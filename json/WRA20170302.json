I am assured by the Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division.<\/p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Waterford Division, on the 31 January 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 277.  There are also 24 Garda Reserves and 28 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and the Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that 838 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 24 of whom have been assigned to the Waterford Division.  I am also informed that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end.<\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division including the Waterford Division, in the coming years.<\/p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.  <b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in the following table the strength of the Waterford Division for the years 2010 to 2016 and up to 31 January 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, as provided by the Commissioner. <table><tr><th colspan=\"2\">Waterford Garda Strength 2010-2017<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Year <\/td><td>Strength <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>305<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>290<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>284<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>274<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>274<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>282<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>277<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017*<\/td><td>277<\/td><\/tr><\/table>*up to 31 January 2017<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200055#WRB01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Health","counter":49,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200055#WRB01500"},{"type":"question","counter":50,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[10975\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200055#WRB01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the supports being provided to a person (details supplied) who is on the waiting list for admission to the central mental hospital; when the person will be admitted to the hospital; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1353","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":51,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that in-reach mental health services are made available to the persons in its custody through its collaboration with the Health Service Executive, and the National Forensic Mental Health Service.

This principle permeates the entire 2015 Act and its respective provisions including in terms of the independence of the nomination of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority which has eleven members including a lay majority and a lay Chairperson.  Under Part 2 of the 2015 Act, the Regulatory Authority, which has its own corporate identity and can sue or be sued in its own right, also appoints its own staff and Chief Executive subject to the usual oversight framework of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It can establish its own committees in the conduct of its day to day business.  It is subject, under the Act, to a suite of annual, business and strategic reporting obligations while also being financially and operationally accountable, including through its Chief Executive, to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Public Accounts Committee, and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  In short, and with the benefit of a series of reinforced independence provisions introduced under Government amendments following publication of the Legal Services Regulation Bill in 2011, the Regulatory Authority now has the structures, functions and powers consistent with an effective, independent regulator while being democratically accountable including to the Houses and relevant Committees of the Oireachtas.  <\/p>  <p>  The statutory independence conferred by the 2015 Act also extends to potential members of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority.  Such persons are each, under the relevant provisions of Part 2 of the 2015 Act, put forward by one of ten prescribed nominating bodies that are intended to represent a regulatory balance of interests between lawyers and the consumers of legal services.  Neither the Government nor any other non-specified entity can nominate or otherwise insert additional candidates for membership of the Authority under these nomination and appointment provisions.  In the consideration of nominees for membership of the Regulatory Authority both the nominating bodies and the Government are obliged to ensure that the nominees have relevant knowledge and expertise in a range of areas that are specified in Part 2 of the 2015 Act.  By way of further safeguard, it is provided under section 9(2)(a) of the Act that when the members of the Regulatory Authority are to be appointed by the Government, there first has to be a resolution approving such appointment passed by each House of the Oireachtas.  There is no departmental official sitting on the Authority and its membership is also staggered by way of both ensuring continuity of function and preventing change to the full membership at one time.  Not only, therefore, is the independence of the Regulatory Authority set out in its own establishment and governance provisions, it is also copper-fastened by its chain of public accountability which is laid out under the 2015 Act as I have just described. <\/p>  <p>  The independence of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority provided in the 2015 Act mirrors that which the Act also applies in relation to the legal professions and their clients.  Under section 13(4) of the Act, the objectives to be observed by the Regulatory Authority in the performance of its functions include those of supporting and promoting the interests of the public and consumers and of competition in the provision of legal services in the State.  They also include the objectives of supporting the proper and effective administration of justice, encouraging an independent, strong and effective legal profession and promoting and maintaining adherence to the professional principles.  The professional principles, as set out in section 13(5), of the 2015 Act, are that legal practitioners must act with independence and integrity, act in the best interests of their clients and maintain proper standards of work.  Moreover, they must comply with the duties that are rightfully owed to the court, and they must, subject to professional obligations, keep the affairs of their clients confidential.  In a similar vein, the Regulatory Authority is also free from any Government or Ministerial involvement in relation to its regulation of codes of practice or professional codes under sections 22 and 23 of the 2015 Act, respectively. <\/p>  <p>  Independence of function is also a cornerstone of the professional conduct and public complaints procedures that will be introduced with the commencement, at the appropriate time, of Part 6 of the 2015 Act.  This will include the establishment of a new Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal that will deal with allegations of misconduct in relation to both solicitors and barristers.  At the same time, the Disciplinary Tribunal will be independent in its functions of the Regulatory Authority, the Government and the legal professional bodies.  Relevant complaints will no longer be made by the public through the legal professional bodies as happens at present, but directly to the new Authority.  Complaints made and completed under the existing professional conduct and disciplinary regimes operated by the Law Society or the Bar Council or their respective disciplinary tribunals cannot be made again to the new Regulatory Authority.  Similarly, under the 2015 Act, any ongoing complaints already made under these existing regimes will have to be completed under their existing procedures and existing law.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the question of dealing with cases retrospectively, when Part 6 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 is commenced then any new complaints from the date of commencement will be dealt with by the Regulatory Authority.  It is my understanding that under the transitional provisions set out under section 91 of the 2015 Act, if they concern acts or omissions by solicitors that have occurred before the commencement date of Part 6, the Authority will deal with them.  If such pre-commencement acts or omissions relate to inadequate services this will be done under the 2015 Act but if they relate to alleged misconduct by a solicitor then \"misconduct\" for the purposes of the complaint will continue to have the meaning it currently has under section 3 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1960.  Where new complaints concern acts or omissions arising following the commencement of Part 6 of the 2015 Act then they will be dealt with by the Regulatory Authority under the new provisions and procedures of that Act.  There is a three-year time limit set out under section 58(7) of the 2015 Act for what might be described essentially as service-level complaints.  This would be where, for example, it is being alleged that the legal services provided by a legal practitioner are of an inadequate standard, or that an amount of costs was excessive.  However, the Deputy will particularly wish to note that, as currently is the case, there is no time limit set under Part 6 of the 2015 Act for complaints about professional misconduct.  Complaints at this level would concern acts or omissions that may be considered as constituting professional misconduct as set out under section 50 of the 2015 Act.  Such misconduct would, for example, include the seeking of an amount of costs in respect of the provision of legal services that is \"grossly excessive\" or the committing of certain listed breaches or offences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200055#WRB02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200055#WRB02800"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[10990\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200055#WRB02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the travel visa requirements that apply to a person (details supplied).","asker":"1238","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":64,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that, as the person mentioned by the Deputy is a South African citizen, they do not need to apply for a visa to join their Irish spouse or accompany them if they are moving to Ireland.

Several other countries who also have more than one official language report some of their official languages as foreign.  The report therefore classifies Irish students as taking one foreign language when in fact the majority of our students are studying three languages (Irish, English and a foreign language).  In contrast, in most other countries a student studying\u00a0three languages will be reported as studying two foreign languages.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the decline since 2009 it should be noted that only\u00a0four languages are included by Ireland in the survey -\u00a0French, German, Italian and Spanish, as these are the only foreign languages examined at Junior Cycle level.

The DEIS Plan for 2017 sets out our vision for future intervention in the critical area of social inclusion in education policy.<\/p>  <p>  A key element of DEIS Plan 2017 is the availability of a new identification process for the assessment of schools for inclusion in DEIS using centrally held CSO and DES data.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The key data sources are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas\u00a0which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area. \u00a0Variables used in the\u00a0compilation of the\u00a0HP Index include\u00a0those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social\u00a0class, occupation and unemployment rates. \u00a0This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.\u00a0 This data is applied uniformly across all schools in the country.\u00a0 Through the use of centrally held data, schools were not required to submit an application for inclusion in the programme.<\/p>  <p>  Further information on the development of the identification process is available in the DEIS Review report which can be found on my Department's website at www.education.ie\/en\/Schools-Colleges\/Services\/DEIS-Delivering-Equality-of-Opportunity-in-Schools-\/.<\/p>  <p>  In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme. \u00a0Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools within the DEIS School Support Programme.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Schools included in the list published\u00a0by my Department on\u00a013th February are those whose level of concentrated disadvantage has been identified as being at the same level as the current DEIS category for schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage.\u00a0 This includes 15 new Urban Band 1 schools, 30 Urban Band 2 schools raised to Urban Band 1 status, 51 new Rural DEIS schools and 13 new Post Primary DEIS schools.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Schools which have not been included or upgraded\u00a0at this stage are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new model which is fair and objective.<\/p>  <p>  The new DEIS Plan provides for a verification process and any school wishing to seek verification of the information used to assess the level of disadvantage of its pupil cohort may submit an application for same to social_inclusion@education.gov.ie.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the school details published on 13th February represent a first step in the application of the assessment process to support pupils in schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.\u00a0 I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS. <\/p>  <p>  However, as noted in the DEIS Plan, the implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.<\/p>  <p>  Once this work\u00a0has been\u00a0completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.<\/p>  <p>  In delivering on the DEIS Plan 2017 we must be conscious that there are ongoing changes in demographics which may be more marked in some areas than others. \u00a0Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006.\u00a0 The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.\u00a0 If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the fact that a school has not been included in the DEIS programme on this occasion does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should its level of disadvantage warrant the allocation of additional resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200056#WRC05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special

consisting of Waterford Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Carlow), Munster Technological University (MTU &ndash; consisting of Cork Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Tralee) and the Connacht Ulster Alliance (CUA &ndash; consisting of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Sligo and Letterkenny Institute of Technology). <\/p>  <p>  Funding:<\/p>  <p>  The process for designation as a Technological University consists of four stages.\u00a0 The &ldquo;phase-gate&rdquo; model for the process allows for assessment of the projects at set points.\u00a0\u00a0In relation to costs, these are considered during each stage of the process and in particular there is an onus on each consortium to develop financial models and estimated costings.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the financial costs, the two consortia that have finalised stage 3 (TU4Dublin and MTU) and developed implementation plans acknowledge the costs involved in merger and the designation process, but also commit to meeting those costs within their own budgets.  They also acknowledge that while there are up-front costs in the shorter term, in the longer term, designation as a Technological University will allow them to recoup these costs and provide for new income streams.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is recognised that these changes to the landscape of Irish higher education carry some up-front additional costs and the HEA has provided for a fund to support HEIs with these costs.  In terms of additional financial support, having regard to the benefits that will arise for the institutions, students and the higher education system more generally, the HEA has provided funding in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 to provide support to institutions involved in the TU process.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of 2016, the four consortiums made joint presentations and submission to the Higher Education Authority in May 2016, seeking funding to underpin the next phase of engagement in respect of their ongoing merger processes.\u00a0 Arising from these presentations and submissions, the HEA provided a ring-fenced sum of &euro;4.702 Million in 2016 to the four consortiums that are involved in merger processes with the ultimate aim of becoming Technological Universities.\u00a0 This funding is in addition to their own resources to the projects being provided by the respective consortiums.<\/p>  <p>  Future Funding:<\/p>  <p>  As already outlined, the Institutions involved in the processes will be required to meet a significant amount of the costs involved in the creation of Technological Universities from within their own resources.\u00a0 However, given the significant benefits that will arise from the development of Technological Universities, the Department of Education and Skills and the HEA will continue to provide financial support to the consortiums to assist in their progress towards Technological University status.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy has asked specific questions around the future funding for Technological Universities which will have to be addresses in the context of the wider issue around future funding of Higher Education.\u00a0 The\u00a0Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education, under the chairmanship of Peter Cassells, was established to\u00a0develop a strategy for funding\u00a0the third level sector. \u00a0The Report which was\u00a0published in July 2016, clearly outlines the funding challenges in the higher education sector and offers a number of approaches and recommendations for consideration for the medium term. <\/p>  <p>  As committed to in the Programme for Government, the report has been referred to the Education Committee as part of the process for formulating a plan for the future of the sector.  The Department is\u00a0looking forward to working with the Education Committee as it analyses all of the options put forward by the Expert Group and hears the voice of all stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  While the Cassells Report deals with the medium and long term funding needs of higher education we also have to consider the immediate challenges and in that context the Department placed a particular focus on this area\u00a0in Budget 2017 securing\u00a0additional funding for the sector for the first time in recent years. <\/p>  <p>  This year an additional &euro;36.5 million will be made available with &euro;160 million additional over the next three years.

Large amounts of research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. <\/p>  <p>  No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016\/17 school year.  No allocation made for such pupils\u00a0by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. <\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0also announced that an additional 900 teaching posts will be provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional\u00a0teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011, when 5265 teachers were allocated, as opposed to\u00a0provision for 7542 posts in the current school year.<\/p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1000 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  Supports for children with special educational needs is a huge priority for this Government.  We currently spend over &euro;1.6 billion, or one fifth of the total education budget, on supports for children with special educational needs. <\/p>  <p>  This investment\u00a0will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation\u00a0of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils\u00a0who require such support.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model, schools will be\u00a0provided with a total allocation which includes\u00a0a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school profile. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need and pupils in each school. <\/p>  <p>  Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school's profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.\u00a0This will\u00a0reduce the administrative burden on schools as they will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils, or pupils transferring\u00a0in to the school,\u00a0who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications for newly enrolled pupils, for whom resource teaching hours\u00a0may have been provided under the old model, as school will now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the NCSE advised schools that there was no longer a requirement for schools to make applications for special education teaching supports for individual\u00a0pupils with\u00a0special education teaching\u00a0needs, as resources\u00a0would be provided for schools by the\u00a0profiled allocation.<\/p>  <p>  For the introduction of the new allocation model, from September 2017, the NCSE &lsquo;Low Incidence&rsquo; allocations which had been made for each school during the preceding year 2016\/17 school year, have been used to establish the complex needs component of the new allocation model for each school.<\/p>  <p>  A model for the identification of pupils with complex needs in future is being devised by the NCSE, in consultation with the Health Service Executive and National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS).  This model will take account of the qualification criteria for the selection of children for access to HSE Children Disability Network Teams. <\/p>  <p>  For the next re profiling of the model, the pupils with newly identified Complex Needs will be included in this revised allocation.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model.  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria it is expected that allocations made to school will be\u00a0sufficient to meet both current and future needs as they arise until the next review. <\/p>  <p>  Currently most schools' educational profiles\u00a0remain relatively constant from year to year.\u00a0  Each year, some students\u00a0with additional teaching needs will\u00a0leave and others will\u00a0enrol, broadly balancing the school profile. <\/p>  <p>  The model will provide, from this year, additional resources to schools where it is expected that there will be additional needs.  In protecting resources in schools where the profiles indicate that the levels of need are\u00a0lower than are currently provided for some additional capacity is also provided for in those schools.  Accordingly, all schools should have the capacity to meet the needs of additional children enrolling in the school in the following school year without the need for additional or new resources. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The model\u00a0will, however,\u00a0allow for some additional provision for very\u00a0exceptional circumstances\u00a0or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very\u00a0substantially prior to the next review of the model.  The Inclusion Support Service,\u00a0being established under the National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.  Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very\u00a0significantly since the allocation was made to the school,\u00a0may\u00a0an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. <\/p>  <p>  A\u00a0new Circular will be issued to schools\u00a0shortly which will provide details of how the scheme will operate while details of the allocations for each school will also be provided to schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200057#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools Scheme","counter":187,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200057#WRD02250"},{"type":"question","counter":188,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[10966\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200057#WRD02300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his Department will review the decision not to designate a school (details supplied) as a DEIS school; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":189,"content":"<p>DEIS is my Department's main policy initiative to tackle educational disadvantage.  The DEIS Plan for 2017 sets out our vision for future intervention in the critical area of social inclusion in education policy.<\/p>  <p>  A key element of DEIS Plan 2017 is the availability of a new identification process for the assessment of schools for inclusion in DEIS using centrally held CSO and DES data.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The key data sources are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas\u00a0which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.\u00a0 Variables used in the\u00a0compilation of the\u00a0HP Index include\u00a0those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social\u00a0class, occupation and unemployment rates.\u00a0 This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.\u00a0 This data is applied uniformly across all schools in the country.<\/p>  <p>  Further information on the development of the identification process is available in the DEIS Review report which can be found on my Department's website at www.education.ie\/en\/Schools-Colleges\/Services\/DEIS-Delivering-Equality-of-Opportunity-in-Schools-\/.<\/p>  <p>  In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme. \u00a0Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools within the DEIS School Support Programme.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Schools included in the list published\u00a0by my\u00a0Department on\u00a013th February are those whose level of concentrated disadvantage has been identified as being at the same level as the current DEIS category for schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage.\u00a0 This includes 15 new Urban Band 1 schools, 30 Urban Band 2 schools raised to Urban Band 1 status, 51 new Rural DEIS schools and 13 new Post Primary DEIS schools.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Schools which have not been included at this stage are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new model, which is fair and objective.<\/p>  <p>  The new DEIS Plan provides for a verification process and any school wishing to seek verification of the information used to assess the level of disadvantage of its pupil cohort may submit an application for same to social_inclusion@education.gov.ie. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the school details published on 13th February represent a first step in the application of the assessment process to support pupils in schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.\u00a0 I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS. <\/p>  <p>  However, as noted in the DEIS Plan, the implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.<\/p>  <p>  Once this work\u00a0has been\u00a0completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.<\/p>  <p>  In delivering on the DEIS Plan 2017 we must be conscious that there are ongoing changes in demographics which may be more marked in some areas than others.\u00a0 Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006.\u00a0 The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.\u00a0 If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the fact that a school has not been included in the DEIS programme on this occasion does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should its level of disadvantage warrant the allocation of additional resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200057#WRD02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pupil-Teacher

In this regard, a Ministerial Direction was put in place in January 2015 which required the Limerick City and County Council to allocate at least 30% of tenancies under their control to homeless and other vulnerable households.  The Direction was subsequently renewed on two occasions, with the last renewal expiring on 30 April 2016.  An exercise carried out during the operation period of the Direction indicated that Limerick City and County Council was achieving the target percentage.<\/p><p>At the time of the last renewal in February 2016, the Housing Agency was requested to conduct a review of the operation of the Direction and provide an impartial assessment.  The Agency recommended that the Direction should be allowed to lapse upon its expiry.<\/p><p>This Direction was only ever intended to operate for a short period of time to provide an immediate increase in the number of social housing tenancies being allocated to homeless households.

This analysis is vindicated by the fact that during 2016 local authorities nationally achieved in the region of 2,700 sustainable exits from homelessness into independent tenancies; this is a record level of exits, with the comparable figure for 2015 having been 2,300.<\/p><p>Taking account of the Housing Agency's report, my predecessor decided not to renew the Ministerial Direction after 30 April 2016 and I do not propose to revisit the issue.

The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property.  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met up-front by the local authority or an AHB.  This allows for the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum of 10 years.  The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease.<\/p>  <p>  Following on from the success of the initial pilot in Waterford and Carlow local authorities, last week I announced that the pilot Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) was being rolled out on a national basis from 23 February 2017. <\/p>  <p>  I am making an additional &euro;26m available to fund this scheme in 2017, which brings the total amount available this year to &euro;32m.  This additional investment in 2017 means that delivery under the scheme can be accelerated and up to 800 vacant properties can be brought back into use as new homes for families on local authority waiting lists this year.  This funding represents a frontloading of the &euro;140m being made available for the scheme over the next 5 years.  Over the period 2016 to 2021, it is anticipated that up to 3,500 units will be secured for social housing under this scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Local Authorities are encouraged to engage early with the scheme and to collaborate where possible with AHBs at a local level to drive the project forward and to achieve maximum output in 2017.  The delivery of 800 units nationally will be spread across all areas and the onus will be on individual LAs to maximise their output.  A specific budgetary allocation is not being made on a county by county basis, but rather, in order to ensure that the maximum output can be achieved, funding will be available on the basis of performance and capacity to deliver new social homes using the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  I will be carefully monitoring the scheme in 2017 to ensure that it works and is cost effective.  Likewise, this analysis will assist in determining its delivery potential for future years, as well as whether additional financial resources are required in that context.   <\/p>  <p>  The Repair and Leasing Scheme is one of a number of initiatives in Rebuilding Ireland to address vacant properties around the country.  Other initiatives including the Buy and Renew scheme will operate in parallel to harness the maximum potential of vacant properties available for social housing.  The full details of the Buy and Renew Scheme initiative are being finalised and will be communicated to local authorities shortly.  I have made an initial &euro;25 million available for this initiative this year and propose to increase this to as much as &euro;50 million in 2018, depending on the uptake. I expect this investment to deliver between 400 and 500 renewed houses for social housing use.  The initiative may present opportunities for local authorities and approved housing bodies to tackle dereliction in towns and urban areas, but prospective housing units will always need to be suitable for social housing use, in an area of need and represent reasonable value for money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200059#WRF00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commercial Rates","counter":280,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200059#WRF00600"},{"type":"question","counter":281,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[11093\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200059#WRF00700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to reform the commercial rates system; the timeframe for any forthcoming legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":282,"content":"<p>Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation pursuant to the Valuation Act s 2001 to 2015.

It had 3 elements: a rigorous counterfactual impact evaluation (that used cohort-building techniques to continuously assess impacts); a survey (response rate: 33.5% of all participants and 23.3% of all host organisations); and a cost-benefit analysis.

However, there was dissatisfaction with the value of the top-up payment and some aspects of the administration of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Following publication of the evaluation in October 2016, the Minister announced his intention to replace JobBridge in 2017 with a new work experience programme that better reflected the improved labour market and addressed certain criticisms of the scheme.

For first time applicants, we advise a turnaround time of 20 working days.<\/p>  <p>  As a matter of good practice, we advise applicants to check the validity of their passports in advance of booking travel, to ensure passport application forms are correctly completed and any relevant additional documentation is included.  Those with no immediate travel plans should allow six weeks&rsquo; for a passport application to be processed in case any difficulty arises with the application.  Please note that the validity periods for children&rsquo;s passports are shorter than those for adult passports.  The Passport Service offers a free reminder service and we invite citizens to please register for an email reminder to ensure people are aware that they need to apply for a new passport (www.eforms.gov.ie\/en\/reminder\/passport\/).<\/p>  <p>  There are different ways to apply for a passport and it is important to ensure that the correct channel is used.  Applicants travelling in less than 15 working days (renewals) and 20 working days (first time applicants) should make an appointment at the Passport Office in Dublin or Cork.  There are a limited number of appointments available and applicants are required to show proof of travel.  Appointments can be booked online (www.passport.ie).<\/p>  <p>  Passport Express is the most cost effective and efficient means of applying for a passport and is available in post offices throughout Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  There is currently a high volume of passport applications in the system and the Passport Office is focussed on ensuring the turnaround targets are met.

This reflects the Government's commitment to rebuilding and investing in public services and will allow expenditure to be increased to meet the additional costs arising from an ageing and growing population and to provide for targeted improvements in public services.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2017 represents the third consecutive year in which the Government was in a position to allocate significant additional resources to public spending with a &euro;1.9bn increase in Gross Voted Expenditure compared to\u00a02016.

The benefits arising from these central procurement frameworks include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency; enhanced service levels and legal certainty.\u00a0\u00a0It is Government policy, as set out in Circular 16\/2013,\u00a0that public bodies, where possible, should make use of all such central arrangements.\u00a0\u00a0Where public bodies choose not to utilise central procurement frameworks they should be in a position to provide a value for money justification.\u00a0\u00a0It should also be noted that the OGP issued Circular 10\/2014 which contains initiatives aimed at facilitating SME access to public contracts. <\/p>  <p>  The State spends around &euro;12 billion on goods, works and services each year.  This represents a very significant portion of overall spending and it is, therefore, essential that the public service achieves maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement.\u00a0 Developing a strategic approach to public procurement means that the state can deliver much needed public service in a sustainable manner at a time when Exchequer resources are limited.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There is a perception that the move towards aggregation will mean that competitions will be won by larger foreign companies to the detriment of the SME Sector.\u00a0 While the OGP has stimulated the market, and there will obviously be more losers than winners in any competitive process, this not borne out by the facts to date.\u00a0 The Public Service Spend\u00a0and Tendering Analysis Report for 2014, published by the OGP and launched by Minister of State Eoghan Murphy last September, indicates that 95% of the analysed expenditure is with firms with a base in the State and the majority of\u00a0the spend\u00a0analysed is with SMEs.

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe.  Lyme disease is the commonest cause of tick-borne infection in Europe.<\/p><p>Lyme borreliosis can be asymptomatic or have a range of clinical presentations.  Current best advice is that diagnosis should be made only after careful examination of the patient's clinical history, physical findings, laboratory evidence and exposure risk evaluation.  Exposure to ticks prior to disease manifestations is necessary for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis.  Since an awareness or recollection of a tick-bite is not always present, however, this should not exclude the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis.  Later stages require the use of antibody detection tests (or advanced DNA detection techniques).  Testing for Lyme Disease is undertaken in most of the larger hospitals in Ireland.  In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient.  If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Public Health England Porton Down facility which uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities.  This involves a screening serological test followed by a confirmatory serological test.<\/p><p>Some laboratories abroad do not use antibody tests like the EIA (screening ELISA test) and Western Blot and instead will use other types of tests, for example, testing for levels of a specific white blood cell (CD-57) or lymphocyte transformation tests (tests to measure how specific cells in a person's immune system respond when exposed to antigens against Borrelia burgdorferi - the bacterium responsible for Lyme disease).  These types of tests are not currently recommended by international groups such as the CDC, IDSA or BIA for a number of reasons:<\/p><p>1. There is not enough scientific evidence that they are suitable tests to diagnose Lyme disease.<\/p><p>2. There is no standard method to perform and interpret these kind of tests and<\/p><p>3. Positive results in these kinds of tests may be due to other illnesses or conditions and not just Borrelia infection.<\/p><p>Since 2013, the HPSC has held an annual &lsquo;Lyme Awareness Week&rsquo; at the beginning of the tick biting season, the purpose of which is to draw attention - particularly in the media - to Lyme disease and the ticks that can spread this disease.  Lyme cases tend to appear in Ireland with greater frequency after April, hence the choice of this time of year for Lyme Awareness Week. <\/p><p>The literature on the HPSC website points out that campers, walkers and certain occupational groups such as forestry workers, conservation workers, deer cullers and farmers are at particular risk of exposure to ticks (and therefore LB).  That said, anyone walking or hiking in the countryside is at risk of biting ticks.  The ticks responsible for LB are generally hard-bodied ticks (Ixodidae).  Ixodes ticks are hosted by a wide range of mammals including deer, sheep and cows, and occasionally birds; their tiny size (less than 2mm unfed) means they can remain undetected for long periods.<\/p><p>Ixodes ticks are most likely to be found in:<\/p><p>-  Shady and humid woodland clearings with grass;<\/p><p>-  Open grassland, walking paths (especially those bordered by long grasses);<\/p><p>-  Wooded and forested areas;<\/p><p>-  Vegetation close to lakes and seaside beaches;<\/p><p>-  Parkland areas; and<\/p><p>-  Open fields and bushes.<\/p><p>They are present in both urban and rural environments and are active from spring to autumn. <\/p><p>Both the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and Tick Talk Ireland provide guidance on protection against contracting Lyme borelliosis.  The best protection is to prevent tick bites, when walking in grassy, bushy or woodland areas, particularly between May and October:<\/p><p>-  Arms and leg should be covered; wearing long trousers tucked into socks or boots, and long-sleeved shirts with cuffs fastened is advised.  Shoes or boots should be worn rather than open-toed sandals.<\/p><p>-  The use of insect repellent on clothes is recommended, or on limbs if it is not practicable to cover up.  DEET or permethrin (insect repellents) can be used &ndash; advice can be obtained from pharmacies.<\/p><p>-  Skin and clothing should be inspected for ticks every three to four hours and children's skin and clothes checked frequently.<\/p><p>-  Ticks should be removed as soon as they are seen attached to the skin.  Further advice on tick removal can be obtained from the HPSC website.<\/p><p>-  It is not recommended that antibiotics are given to prevent the transmission of Lyme disease following a tick bite.  Only if the area becomes inflamed may treatment be required; and advice should be sought from a doctor.<\/p><p>-  People should see their doctor if they develop a rash or become unwell with other symptoms, letting the doctor know of exposure to ticks.<\/p><p>Further advice can be obtained from the HPSC website (www.hpsc.ie) and the HPSC produced a leaflet on &ldquo;<i>Protecting Yourself Against Tick Bites and Lyme Disease<\/i>&rdquo; which is available for the public to download.<\/p><p>A Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC has been established to look at methods of raising awareness especially in those areas (including recreation areas) where Lyme carrying ticks can be most expected to be found.  The aim of this Sub-Committee is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.  In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency, an Environmental Health Officer, and member of Tick Talk has been invited to be the patient representative on the Sub-Committee.

The Government decision in 2012 to locate the hospital on St James&rsquo;s Hospital campus was made in the best interests of children from a clinical perspective.  St. James's has the broadest range of national specialties of all our acute hospitals, in addition to a strong and well-established research and education infrastructure, making it the hospital that best meets the criteria to enable the children&rsquo;s hospital achieve our vision of excellence in modern paediatric practice.<\/p>  <p>  A major milestone was achieved in this long awaited, much needed project when An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission in April 2016 to build a state of the art hospital on a campus shared with St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, together with two Paediatric Outpatients and Urgent Care centres at Tallaght Hospital and Connolly Hospital.  The first phase of construction (site clearing works) on the site of the new children&rsquo;s hospital began in August 2016 and will be substantially completed within a matter of weeks.<\/p>  <p>  The previous Government committed to making &euro;200m available from the sale of the National Lottery for the new children's hospital, adding to the existing &euro;450m Exchequer funding and underlining the Government's commitment to the project.  The cost estimate for the core construction elements of the new children&rsquo;s hospital and the Paediatric Outpatients and Urgent Care centres at Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals was prepared in early 2014.  This estimate of &euro;650m was prepared at a time when annual construction inflation predicted at 3% per annum.<\/p>  <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was appointed in 2013 to design, build and equip the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  An internationally recognised design team supported by an experienced Board and Project Team are in place, have followed best international design, planning and procurement process at each stage of the project.  The Project Team, during the design, planning and tendering phases, has constantly monitored the external environment &ndash; tracking construction inflation and market costs. <\/p>  <p>  The recently concluded tendering process for the main construction works determined the actual market cost of the construction elements of the project.  Due to annual construction inflation rising from 3% in 2013 to more than 9% in 2017 and the lengthened project timeline in the planning, design and procurement process, the cost of the core construction of the hospital and Paediatric Outpatients &amp;amp; Urgent Care Centres has increased from the original estimate.  The increase reflects the increasing volume of activity in the Irish construction industry which is having a significant impact on construction inflation. <\/p>  <p>  The updated capital costs have now been incorporated into the Final Project Brief, and were submitted to the HSE for review.  The HSE has now submitted the Final Project Brief to the Department of Health.  While I am not in a position to comment on updated costs at this stage, I intend to bring a Memorandum to Government in the coming weeks on the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  Full details of the costs will be set out in the Memorandum for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200062#WRJ04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Accommodation Provision","counter":512,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200062#WRJ04250"},{"type":"question","counter":513,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[10888\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200062#WRJ04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to open prefabs at acute hospitals to ease emergency room pressures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":514,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, the Winter Initiative Plan which the HSE launched in September last year, provided &euro;40 million of additional funding for winter preparedness and to manage the expected surge in demand for hospital care in an integrated way across Primary, Acute and Social Care. <\/p>  <p>  As part of this the HSE put in place a National Framework for the provision of temporary alternative accommodation, as just one part of a broad range of measures undertaken to alleviate pressure on our Emergency Departments.

St. James's has the broadest range of national specialties of all our acute hospitals, in addition to a strong and well-established research and education infrastructure, making it the hospital that best meets the criteria to enable the children&rsquo;s hospital achieve our vision of excellence in modern paediatric practice.<\/p><p>As announced in June 2015, the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital will relocate to the campus in time, achieving tri-location of adult, paediatric and maternity services. Tri-location has benefits for children, adolescents, newborns and mothers.  In all cases, the benefits of tri-location are maximised where the adult hospital provides the broadest possible range of clinical sub-specialties and expertise, which are readily accessible for paediatric and maternity patients on the shared campus.  Also, tri-location that delivers the most significant breadth and depth of clinical and academic research on site will enhance the potential of research to drive best clinical outcomes.<\/p><p>Furthermore, excellence in modern paediatric practice cannot be achieved without an embedded culture of, and focus on, research, education and innovation.  More than a hospital, the new children&rsquo;s hospital and satellite centres will be a research-intensive academic healthcare institution.  To deliver this vision, the main facilities for research and innovation will be located at the Children&rsquo;s Research and Innovation Centre on the St James&rsquo;s campus.  This facility will be located adjacent to the existing Institute of Molecular Medicine, a cross university facility which delivers both undergraduate and postgraduate education and has a strong research platform in cancer, infection and immunity and neurosciences.  This direct adjacency reflects one of the many and significant opportunities being leveraged by co-locating on the campus with St James&rsquo;s Hospital, with its rich history in clinical research.  Clinical management and research staff at the new children&rsquo;s hospital will be able to study, evaluate, and improve the healthcare services provided to children and young people in Ireland.<\/p><p>A major milestone was achieved in this long awaited, much needed project when An Bord Ple&aacute;nala granted planning permission in April 2016 to build a state of the art hospital on a campus shared with St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, together with two Paediatric Outpatients and Urgent Care centres at Tallaght Hospital and Connolly Hospital.  The first phase of construction (site clearing works) on the site of the new children&rsquo;s hospital began in August 2016 and will be substantially completed within a matter of weeks.<\/p><p>I wish to again reassure parents and families that the plans and design for the hospital recognise the need of most families to access the hospital by car, while noting that the campus is better served by public transport than any other hospital in the country.  In relation to parking, as approved by an Bord Plean&aacute;la, the plans for the new children's hospital provide for 1,000 car parking spaces, of which 675 will be dedicated for use by families, three times the number currently available at the three Dublin children's hospitals combined.  Parents will be able to reserve their space ahead of arriving at the hospital.  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, the statutory body responsible for planning, designing, building and equipping the new children's hospital has confirmed that this level of parking provision will facilitate 100% car parking provision for inpatient, daycase and emergency attendances, and 65 car parking provision for outpatient attendances.  The car parking stock and appointment schedules will be actively managed to ensure that all patients wishing to avail of parking will be facilitated.  In addition, a condition of the planning permission granted by An Bord Plean&aacute;la is that a minimum of 20 spaces be marked and designated as 'parent and child' spaces and reserved for parents of children with specific needs (equipment etc.) and there will also be 27 specific car parking spaces provided for emergency drop-off parking.<\/p><p>In relation to access to the site, the planning application  included a traffic management and traffic mobility plan for the construction and operational phase which was endorsed by the National Transport Authority and Dublin City Council.  A 10-day oral hearing took place in December 2015 in which traffic evidence was presented in detail and allowed for cross questioning by those who had concerns.  Planning permission was granted in April 2016 without change to the proposed traffic and mobility plan.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la's inspector's report, which includes assessment and recommendations in relation to traffic impact at construction and operational stages, can be found at .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200064#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":590,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200064#WRL00750"},{"type":"question","counter":591,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[11075\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200064#WRL00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to his visit to a hostel (details supplied) when a house medical card will be issued; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":592,"content":"<p>A person who is in receipt of a medical card  must register with a General Practitioner.

Under this Government that emphasis is being strengthened.<\/p>  <p>  The overall funding for Services for Older People has increased to &euro;765 million in 2017, with over &euro;400 million available for homecare.  This additional funding is aimed at allowing people to continue to live in their own homes and at facilitating discharge of older people from acute hospitals and the HSE has set a target to deliver 10.57 million home help hours, 16,750 home care packages and 190 intensive homecare packages this year.  Demand for home care services is rising as more people are supported in their own home and there are challenges in managing home care budgets.  There is no doubt that the resources available for homecare are less than we need to meet demand, and for that reason the Programme for Partnership Government commits to increasing funding for these services.  The increased resources provide additional flexibility to managers who are responsible for meeting these challenges in each geographic area.  I must emphasise that prudent management of available resources is needed as demand for services increases.<\/p>  <p>  Home care services are not currently regulated and are provided on the basis of assessed health care need and there is no means-testing.  Government accepts the need to regulate the home care sector to ensure consistency of provision, and work on developing an appropriate system is already underway.  However, a considerable amount of preparatory work will be needed to develop policy proposals.  This will include a public consultation process which is scheduled for May of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200064#WRL01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service Accommodation","counter":599,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200064#WRL01350"},{"type":"question","counter":600,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[11083\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200064#WRL01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"to outline the progress on the new Edenderry ambulance station; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":601,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200064#WRL01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":602,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200064#WRL01550"},{"type":"question","counter":603,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[11085\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200064#WRL01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"to set down the status of a medical card for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":604,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in Europe continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  All relevant and appropriate information is taken into account when deciding to make changes to the State's immunisation programmes. <\/p><p>Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.  NIAC recommended that the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine be given to all girls aged 12-13 in 2009 and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools.  <\/p><p>Gardasil is the HPV vaccine used in Ireland in the context of the HSE schools immunisation programme.  In Ireland more than 660,000 doses of Gardasil have been administered and almost 250,000 girls have been vaccinated against HPV.  Over 205 million doses of the HPV vaccine Gardasil have been distributed worldwide, either as part of national immunisation programmes or by private doctors.  Gardasil is currently used in over 25 European countries, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. <\/p><p>No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmaco vigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use.  The safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  In Ireland, the  HPRA is the statutory regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland and, along with the EMA in Europe, continually monitors adverse events to vaccination.  <\/p><p>The HSE provides information for parents about diseases, the vaccines to prevent them and side effects to allow them to choose whether or not to give consent to vaccination.  All vaccination information provided to parents is prepared from the available licensed documentation for each vaccine, the Summary of Products Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet.  The information booklets include information on the most common adverse events that can occur after each vaccination.  Seizures, muscle weakness, leg pain, joint pain and chronic fatigue are not mentioned as known side effects to Gardasil in the Patient Information Leaflet.  There are no known long term side effects to the vaccine Gardasil.  The information is presented in clear simple language and approved by the National Adult Literacy Agency so that it can be understood by all adults.  The Patient Information Leaflet does not state ovarian failure, painful and chronic severe daily headaches, seizures, neurological condition, chest pain, paralyses, onset of auto immune conditions, muscle weakness, joint and leg pain, heart problems, systemic inflammation, short term memory.  Parents are also given contact details for their local immunisation office and advised to speak to a member of the school immunisation team if they have any further questions.<\/p><p>Should parents require additional information about vaccines the immunisation leaflet refers to the HSE&rsquo;s national immunisation website ().  The national immunisation website has been accredited by the World Health Organisation for credibility, content and good information practices.  The website allows members of the public to contact the National Immunisation Office to ask a question if they require further information.  These questions, when possible, are answered by the staff of the National Immunisation Office within one working day.<\/p><p>I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  An illness that occurs around the time a vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply the vaccine caused the problem.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  As there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes long term illnesses, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for these illnesses.  It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services and the HSE are currently working to put in place a clinical care pathway appropriate to the medical needs of this group.<\/p><p>The HPRA which monitors the safety of all medicines in Ireland has received 1072 spontaneously  reported  adverse reactions and events associated with use of the HPV vaccines from doctors and members of the public since 2006.  The vast majority of reports received by the HPRA have been consistent with the expected pattern of short term and self limited adverse effects for the vaccines, as detailed above from the Patient Information Leaflet.  Though the Irish media report that anti-vaccine groups report there are several hundred girls suffering chronic fatigue like conditions adverse events after the HPV vaccine, the HPRA has received less than 30 reports of chronic fatigue like conditions and autoimmune disease together and one report of suspected premature ovarian failure after HPV vaccine administration since 2006.  These numbers are much less than the estimated prevalence of chronic fatigue syndrome likes conditions and premature ovarian failure occurring by chance among a population of almost 250,000 Irish girls who have received the vaccine.  One would expect to see at least 300 cases of chronic fatigue syndrome like conditions and more than 20 cases of premature ovarian insufficiency reported in a group this size.  However this has not been seen despite all the media attention given to this vaccine.  This HPRA surveillance data provides evidence supporting the good safety profile of the HPV vaccine and is consistent with data from international regulatory bodies.  Consequently, there is no scientific biological or epidemiological evidence of the HPV vaccine causing chronic medical conditions. <\/p><p>The focus for the HPV programme in 2017 is to counter misinformation in relation to the safety of the HPV vaccine, and to increase the uptake rate in girls as part of the schools immunisation programme.  The benefits of HPV vaccines  outweigh the known side effects.

This trade had been previously confined to boneless intact cuts of beef.  Part of the arrangement agreed this week in Saudi Arabia is also to have a more straightforward way of having plants approved to export to Saudi Arabia whereby they can be listed for export on the approval by DAFM and our subsequent recommendation to the Saudi authorities, should it be accepted. <\/p><p>It is not possible at this point to quantify exactly the effect on beef exports to Saudi Arabia but this week&rsquo;s outcome is significant boost to Irish exporters by expanding the range of products which they may export.  According to the OECD, beef and veal consumption in Saudi Arabia in 2015 was 176,000 tonnes and is forecast to increase thanks to rising populations, higher per capita consumption and rising consumer affluence.<\/p><p>Whilst we exported approximately 97% of our beef exports in 2016 to EU (including the UK), I am conscious of the importance of growing third country markets as a valuable outlet for any increased Irish beef production.  Indeed, this is a crucial component of the Food Wise 2025 strategy.  Significant progress has been made in this context in recent years and my Department is currently in the process of attempting to secure beef access to a range of third countries including China, South Korea, Ukraine, Thailand and Vietnam.  This builds on the opening of some major markets in the last two years including the US, Canada and Japan.

In 2011 the then Minister met with two separate groups which had conducted feasibility studies into the possibility of establishing a new sugar and bioethanol production\u00a0facility, using sugar beet,\u00a0in this country.  The figures published by the interested groups who are investigating the possibility of building a new facility, indicate that the overall capital cost costs involved could range from &euro;250million to &euro;400million, depending on what type of facility will be constructed. <\/p><p>The Minister informed both groups at the time and many times since in the D&aacute;il and through the media, that any venture to develop a combined sugar\/bioethanol production facility in Ireland, would have to be a viable commercial proposition, and supported by a\u00a0 sufficiently robust business case\u00a0in order\u00a0to attract the funding from investors for the very substantial capital investment required.  Minister Coveney clearly informed both groups at the time that it was his job to look for agreement at EU level to allow for the growing of sugar beet for the manufacture of sugar, at the earliest possible date.  In this connection, he secured agreement as part of the overall CAP reform package at the final EU Council of Agriculture Ministers, which he chaired in June 2013, to abolish all sugar quotas by 30 September 2017.  This agreement removes, with effect from 1 October 2017, the current EU quota barrier for operators in Ireland or other Member State, wishing to re-establish a sugar industry. <\/p><p>At the time, this agreement was welcomed by those parties who are interested in seeking to re-establish a sugar industry here.  It is now up to those same entities to move the project forward and to garner sufficient commercial and financial support to turn their plans into a viable reality.\u00a0 The\u00a0Programme for a Partnership Government makes clear that &ldquo;State enterprise bodies will be asked to examine any substantial business plans related to rebuilding the industry with a view to considering appropriate State supports&rdquo;.<\/p><p>Also there is also an EU funding opportunity under\u00a0the that is relevant for the production of\u00a0biobased materials including industrial chemicals from renewable biobased resources.\u00a0 This is a &euro;3.7 billion Public-Private Partnership between the EU and the Bio-based Industries Consortium.

I am focused on working with the industry to meet these difficulties in the months and years ahead.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2017 underpins my Department&rsquo;s efforts through strategic investment in key areas, such as in its agencies and in the agrifood sector.  As part of Budget 2017 I secured an additional &euro;700,000 in funding for capital investments in the Commercial Horticulture sector.\u00a0 This means that this year&rsquo;s budget for the scheme will be &euro;5 million.  In addition, the Horticulture sector will have access to the &euro;150 million low interest cash flow support loan fund announced in Budget 2017 providing access to highly flexible loans for up to six years, for amounts up to &euro;150,000, at an interest rate of 2.95%. <\/p>  <p>  The impact that the devaluation of Sterling is having on mushroom producers and grower margins is a problem that has happened over a very short space of time.  Grower production of this highly perishable product must be well aligned with demand and the mushroom sector, like many other exporting sectors, is particularly at risk because of the high dependency on the UK market.  I am monitoring the situation regarding Sterling volatility closely and I have also established in my own Department a dedicated unit to consider the direct impact of Brexit on our industry.  Although it is still a serious situation, the Sterling exchange rate has stabilised and is now holding at around 85p to the Euro. <\/p>  <p>  My Department, along with the various State agencies, in particular Bord Bia, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland, are working closely with the industry to provide the necessary support and assistance. \u00a0Bord Bia is actively supporting the sector in the areas of Market Intelligence, UK consumer research and Quality Assurance. Towards the end of 2016 they held a currency and negotiation workshop specifically targeted at the sector which I understand was very well received by the mushroom industry.\u00a0 Bord Bia is also running a Marketing Intensification Programme\u00a0 \u00a0which aims to provide targeted marketing supports to companies with high dependency on UK markets.  Grant supports will be prioritised to assist companies in strengthening their position in that market, and in their efforts to identify new markets. \u00a0The CEO of Bord Bia and I have held a series of meetings with senior executives from the UK retailers, to highlight the obstacles that our producers are facing.  I understand that representatives of mushroom growers have recently met with a more positive reaction from their UK Multiple customers, to their need for fair and reasonable returns for their produce from the marketplace.  Funding has also been made available for a pilot programme on LEAN processes through\u00a0Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland.  The programme has commenced with 6 mushroom growers, to assess efficiency across all aspects of the business, including supply chain, innovation, marketing and logistics.  It is hoped that a template could be developed through this programme that will enable growers to optimise their production costs further. <\/p>  <p>  I would also draw attention to support being provided to the industry through National and EU Schemes. <\/p>  <p>  Under the National Development Plan (NDP) 2007 &ndash; 2013 my Department implemented the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector.\u00a0 During this period my Department paid out over &euro;4 million in grant payments to mushroom growers which supported &euro;10.1 million in investment.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  To ensure ongoing support for the sector, my Department extended, under EU sanction, the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector to run until 31 December 2019.  In the years to 2016, a further amount of &euro;2.0 million in grant aid was paid to mushroom growers.\u00a0 The grant aid paid supported some &euro;5.0 million in investment by these growers.<\/p>  <p>  Under the 2017 Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector, my Department received a total of 164 applications, 20 of these from mushroom growers.  All applications received are currently being assessed.  I have also provided a commitment to ensure that payments under this scheme are made as early as possible, so as to try to alleviate any financial pressure that growers are currently facing.<\/p>  <p>  The EU Producer Organisation Scheme is also a vital support for mushroom growers, with around 80% of Irish growers in a producer organisation at present.  This scheme provides an important mechanism for growers to achieve greater bargaining power in the marketplace by becoming part of a larger supply base.  Between 2005 and 2016, a total of &euro;40.5 million was paid to mushroom producer organisations as part of\u00a0the EU Producer Organisation scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200067#WRO03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greyhound Industry","counter":812,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200067#WRO03250"},{"type":"question","counter":813,"qnumday":311,"qnumall":"[11107\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200067#WRO03300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the role and brief of a person (details supplied) appointed to the Irish Greyhound Board.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State Intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.<\/p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.\u00a0 <\/p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. <\/p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:\u00a0 <\/p><p>-  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,<\/p><p>-  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.  It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The\u00a0area of Latton, Co. Monaghan\u00a0falls within the AMBER area and\u00a0will therefore be included in the State intervention procurement process.<\/p><p>Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.  Individuals can also check whether their area is in a BLUE or AMBER area by accessing the county and townland\u00a0information at . <\/p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  My Department will shortly update the High Speed Broadband map to finalise the Intervention Area for the Procurement process, taking into account industry investments that have not materialised in Blue areas, together with new industry investments within the proposed State Intervention Area, along with concrete and credible commitments by industry for further new investments within the Intervention Area.<\/p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  This provides for a future proofed solution for the 25 years of the contract and beyond.\u00a0 A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. <\/p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. <\/p><p>In this regard, I and Minister Humphreys\u00a0established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce in July 2016.\u00a0 The findings of this Taskforce recommends practical actions that can be taken\u00a0to remove barriers to and improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland.  The Taskforce report is available at the following link:. <\/p><p>Minister Humphreys has established\u00a0two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to unlock\u00a0barriers\u00a0to investment in mobile and broadband services.\u00a0 Since July, there has been significant\u00a0progress made in discussions with\u00a0the key stakeholders including local authority management representation, Government Departments and State agencies, as well as interaction with ComReg and telecoms operators.<\/p><p>I have\u00a0signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with\u00a0the allocation of\u00a0spectrum in the 3.6GHz band, in early 2017.  This will provide an 86% increase in total\u00a0spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.  I have\u00a0also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to\u00a0provide\u00a0enhanced mobile services. \u00a0<\/p><p>These investments should assist in significantly improving the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country including County Monaghan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200068#WRP01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Process RIA","counter":859,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200068#WRP01850"},{"type":"question","counter":860,"qnumday":327,"qnumall":"[11148\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200068#WRP01900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the legislative proposals published by his Department between 2011 to 2016 that underwent a regulatory impact assessment; the legislative proposals published by his Department that did not undergo a regulatory impact assessment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":861,"qnumday":328,"qnumall":"[11163\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030200068#WRP02000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if regulatory impact assessments for legislative proposals published by his Department include impacts (details supplied); the impact categories not included; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":862,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 327 and 328 together.<\/p><p>My Department undertakes Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIA)\u00a0in accordance with the procedures set out in the RIA Guidelines published by the Department of the Taoiseach in June 2009.

At an individual level the resources required to achieve a minimum essential standard of living is very dependent on family circumstances and thus the interaction of individual earnings with household income and State-provided supports such as Child Benefit, Family Income Supplement as well as supports available in relation to housing, education and health all contribute to an individual&rsquo;s standard of living. <\/p>  <p>  It is important that Ireland&rsquo;s statutory National Minimum Wage and the Living Wage concept are not conflated.  The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.\u00a0\u00a0The Living Wage is voluntary and has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement.  It is different to the National Minimum Wage which is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis. <\/p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission was established in 2015 and its primary function is to, on an annual basis, examine and make recommendations on the national minimum wage, with a view to securing that the national minimum wage, where adjusted, is adjusted incrementally over time having had regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels.  The Commission presented its first report in July 2015 in which it recommended an increase of 50 cents per hour to the minimum hourly rate bringing it to &euro;9.15.  That increase, which was accepted by Government, came into effect on 1st January last. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission presented its second report in July 2016 and its recommendation that the minimum wage be increased to &euro;9.25 per hour was subsequently accepted by Government and came into effect on January 1st last. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy might note that the most recent figures published by Eurostat show that Ireland has the second highest national minimum wage of any country in the EU at &euro;1,563 per month, behind only Luxembourg whose minimum wage is &euro;1,999 per month.

It is self-evident that men and women on the National Minimum Wage receive the same remuneration per hour - &euro;9.25 per hour.  However, 64.7% of employees on the National Minimum Wage are women.  Reasons suggested by the report for this are; women tend to work part-time more often than men because of caring responsibilities, the cost of childcare and women are over-represented in the Accommodation and Food sector, which carries the greatest risk factor of being on the National Minimum Wage.

According to the Central Statistics Office release regarding Quarter 4 2016, the male participation rate is 71.2% and the female participation rate is 60.1%.<\/p>  <p>  A recent report (October 2016) from the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, based in Ireland, on the topic of the gender employment gap points out that in almost all Member States, employment and labour market participation (or activity) rates for women, even if they have increased over the decades, are still systematically lower than for men, while unemployment and, especially, inactivity rates are higher, due in large part to the disproportionately high number of women who do not participate because of care responsibilities.<\/p>  <p>  This is consistent with the findings of the Low Pay Commission when it examined the preponderance of women on the NMW.  The Commission report pointed to CSO data that demonstrates the differing reasons for taking up part-time work: - for females, 24% indicate that &lsquo;caring for children or incapacitated adults&rsquo; is the reason, with a further 28% indicating &lsquo;other personal or family reason&rsquo;.  Clearly the same issues arise in terms of participation. <\/p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission agreed that the Government has recognised the impact and importance of the costs of childcare both to parents and to the labour market, and through its proposed actions in Budget 2017 has begun to put in place measures to help address the difficulties surrounding the lack of affordability of childcare in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The Eurofound report indicates that in 2014, the EU employment rate for people aged 15 to 64, as measured by the EU&rsquo;s Labour Force Survey, was 59.6% for women and 70.1% for men.  Since 2008, the female employment rate has increased only slightly, with the convergence in employment driven by the relative worsening of the male employment rate.

Regarding the food sector, this Strategy will involve a targeted focus on supporting clients to enhance their competitiveness and innovation capability.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, EI increased the number of Lean Plus Grants available to companies to support their enhanced competitiveness.  EI, in collaboration with Bord Bia, also developed a Market Access Grant, which is an internationalisation support for food companies.  Customised management development programmes are also provided to equip clients with the tools and techniques to operate more effectively and to build international scale. <\/p>  <p>  Innovation is a critical component of competitiveness and it also enables food companies to diversify into new products and in turn new markets.  EI will continue to drive company level R&amp;D and Industry-led research and provide funding for Higher Level Research Institutes and the Technology Centres programme to support the sector. <\/p>  <p>  EI will continue to work closely with all the existing food companies in the Kildare region and any potential new start-up companies who may be looking to set up in the area.<\/p>  <p>  The Government, under the Action Plan for Jobs, is supporting all eight Regional Action Plans for Jobs and providing investment of up to &euro;60 million over the period to 2020 to support collaborative approaches to boost enterprise and job creation across the regions.
