The Chairman, Deputy McGuinness, raised the matter at the last meeting before Christmas, and the witness indicated he did not recall having a credit card.  It had been a long meeting but he subsequently wrote to us and stated that he had a credit card but had forgotten about it at the meeting.  He indicated that he was happy to write to us with regard to the content of the statements.  We received a number of statements and the witness had a card which he signed off every month.  The notes are kept in quite some detail.  Could we write to him to request information about certain issues?  Going through the detail of the credit card statements, there are a lot of travel and hotel expenses, although there are also food expenses as well as entertainment.  Significant amounts are spent in places like Lillie's Bordello and Town Bar &amp;amp; Grill for Christmas parties.  There is approximately &euro;3,600 in total in 2005.  In fairness, in September 2008 there is &euro;331 spent instead.  There is also a record of a second credit card from Mr. David Higgins which also has entertainment in it.  For example, drinks were purchased in Ely in 2007 amounting to &euro;1,400, and something for staff only in Ely again amounting to &euro;2,500 in October 2006.  A staff dinner in Odessa amounts either to &euro;370 or &euro;3,700 - I cannot tell which - and this is one of many expenses.  I was surprised by that because Mr. Maloney was so adamant that he could not remember having a credit card.  Clearly there have been a few held within the authority.

It was a private meeting and the committee agreed that it would be private.  The clerk referred to legal advice received, which stated that publication of the transcript would constitute a fundamental change in the way the Oireachtas and its committees do their business.  The reality is that there was not a great deal of substance to what was said at that meeting.  In the past five minutes, the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. McCarthy, debunked quite an amount of what was said in the context of the number of penalty points that were written off.  The theory posited by Sergeant McCabe was that tens of thousands of penalty points were written off.  The Comptroller and Auditor General made a definitive case to the effect that only hundreds of penalty points were written off.<\/p><p>  Outside of that, the committee did not learn a great deal as a result of what was said at the meeting in question.  It might be stated that the latter is a good reason to allow publication but I do not believe that to be the case.  I return to the fact that publishing the transcript would give rise to a fundamental change in the way Oireachtas committees operate.  If someone were to appear before one of the committees in the future to discuss security or privacy issues, there could be a danger that a transcript of the proceedings could be made public in certain circumstances.  That is a step too far for the Oireachtas and its committees.  I stated at last week's meeting that the committee had, to an extent, entered \"The Twilight Zone\".  We have crossed over into the realm of the politically paranormal where a private meeting becomes a public meeting.  Perhaps we should hold a public meeting and ensure that everyone swears on the Bible that he or she will not repeat what was said.  It is just absurd.  We must be clear and definitive with regard to how we treat private meetings.  We must clarify the position completely.  Beyond that, we are entering the arena of the nonsensical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014020600003#B00600","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speech","time":1391680800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I agree with what Deputy Deasy said.

I would ask that it not just be referred to the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group but also referred to the HSE.<\/p><p>  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group was possibly lucky - for want of a better term - in the sense that a delegation came here on the same day as the CRC.  As a result, after a lengthy, explosive, shocking and upsetting meeting with the CRC, St. Vincent's attended here in the afternoon when, I suppose, members and possibly the public were jaded from revelations.  There were very serious issues raised about St. Vincent's at that meeting and in the aftermath of that meeting.  The one that most particularly sticks in my mind is the issue of the consultants' contract and the potential loss of income to the public hospital as a result.  I do not feel that the matter has been satisfactorily addressed.<\/p><p>  I shall make the broader point now, the one that I had asked permission from the Vice Chairman to make later.  The HSE told us very clearly that the deadline for the 44 section 38 bodies - of which St. Vincent's is one - to sign up to be compliant with public sector pay policy was Friday, 31 January.  There was an internal audit, based on which we were working, published on 15 March last year and sent to this committee on 14 November.  This committee has done some very valuable work regarding some of those 44 organisations.  Possibly as a result of the CRC situation becoming so dominant, many of the 44 section 38 bodies were not in compliance and serious issues were raised.  We received an update from the HSE on 6 November which said that at least 27 of the organisation either were not compliant, had only issued a holding letter or had indicated that they were seeking legal advice.  There has been a dearth of information from the HSE in the time that has passed.

We need to exercise some caution as to how we do our business when it comes to these charitable organisations or organisations that are in the charities sector.  I have been contacted, over the past couple of weeks, by a number of CEOs as well as by people who work at a senior level in umbrella organisations for charities in this country.  To say that donations and fund-raising efforts - an issue that the Vice Chairman has raised again and again - has diminished is putting it lightly.  They are under severe pressure and have seen huge reductions in their fund-raising efforts.  As we do our business on the committee - and there are legitimate questions for some of these organisations that have been raised by individuals on the committee - we need to strike a balance.  We need to understand the effect that our deliberations have on the charities sector in Ireland, which has been very damaging and considerable.  I am not surmising that but have got that information from people who are at the coalface of charities here.  Whether we like it or not, people are watching us and are horrified by some of the revelations that have come from the committee.  At the same time we need to be conscious of the effect it is having.  As we look at Rehab and these other organisations, we need to be more aware of that.

Telephones should be on airplane mode at all times.  Item 3B.5 is correspondence dated 29 January 2014, from Mr. William Treacy, regarding an appearance before the committee.  This is to be noted.<\/p><p>  Documents relating to today&rsquo;s committee meeting include 3C.1, correspondence dated 31 January 2014 from Mr. John Crawley of the DDDA, regarding a briefing paper for matters to be considered at the meeting of 6 February 2014.  This is to be noted and published.  Item 3C.2 is correspondence dated 16 January 2014 from Professor Niamh Brennan, former chairman of the DDDA, regarding issues raised at meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts of 12 December 2013.  This is to be noted and published.

As the committee is aware, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority was established in 1997 to secure the physical, social and economic regeneration of the docklands area on a sustainable basis.  It is a non-commercial State body with a commercial mandate and has operated generally without Exchequer funding.  In May 2012 the Government announced its decision to dissolve the authority and transfer its planning and development functions to Dublin City Council.  The actual dissolution date has not yet been determined.  In the meantime, the authority has a transition business plan in place to resolve the liabilities of the authority through the liquidation of assets, including the transfer of the relevant infrastructure, and to deal with any remaining litigation.<\/p><p>  The authority's gross surplus for 2012 was &euro;2.3 million as compared with &euro;7.6 million in 2011.  After taking account of operating and other expenses and impairment costs charged in the year, the authority reported an operating deficit of &euro;5.5 million.  In addition, the 2012 financial statements recognise an exceptional gain of &euro;8.4 million as a result of a commitment given in July 2013 by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that it will assume the authority's future pension liabilities on dissolution.  At the end of 2012, the authority had net assets of just over &euro;5 million.  It held investment properties valued at &euro;23 million and had creditors that were owed &euro;24 million.  A significant proportion of the liabilities was made up of a bank loan and amounts due to other State agencies in respect of levies collected on their behalf.  The authority recognised that its capacity to meets its liabilities depended on its ability to liquidate its property assets and to collect its debts.  I understand that the authority disposed of significant amounts of property during 2013 and in the early part of this year and the authority has provided the committee with an update in that regard.<\/p><p>  I would like to take this opportunity to comment on a matter raised by Mr. Paul Maloney when he appeared before the committee in connection with the Irish Glass Bottle site acquisition and in subsequent correspondence.  This concerns the executive board's decisions about the authority's financial exposure to the Becbay joint venture.  My understanding is that Mr. Maloney takes the view that the executive board was fully aware at the meeting of 2 November 2006 that it was agreeing to a financial exposure for the authority in excess of &euro;61 million, comprising a guarantee to Anglo Irish Bank of &euro;26 million, 26% of the interest that would accrue on Becbay's loans for two years and up to &euro;35 million in other shareholder funding.<\/p><p>  As explained in Mr. Crawley's note to the committee of 21 January 2014, these are the terms given effect in the shareholders agreement signed on 9 November 2006.  We estimated that the authority's exposure increased to around &euro;82 million by the end of 2010.  Further liabilities had accrued by the time the authority concluded its agreement with NAMA in July 2011.  The point raised by Mr. Maloney relates to the executive board's decisions about the financial commitment, as documented in the board minutes and papers.<\/p><p>  I have reviewed those records again and note a number of key points, which follow.  The board minutes of Friday, 20 October 2006 record, at paragraph 7, that the authority's equity contribution to the joint venture would be &euro;9 million, to be provided from existing resources. The board also noted that the remainder of the required funding would be raised through bank borrowing, secured solely on the Irish Glass Bottle site.  The board minutes of Tuesday, 24 October 2006 state that the director of finance outlined to the board that the maximum liability to which the authority would be exposed if the proposed site acquisition agreement went ahead was &euro;36 million, comprising shareholders loans and equity amounting to approximately &euro;29 million and an additional &euro;7 million in recourse finance which would have to be available to the joint venture company.  It was on this basis that the decision to commit to the bid for the site was made.<\/p><p>  The board minutes of Thursday, 2 November 2006 deal with a number of issues that had arisen in the course of progressing the agreement terms with the joint venture partners and the joint venture funders.  The minutes include references to guarantees to be provided by the authority in relation to Becbay's proposed borrowing, subject to upper limits being set in relation to the potential liability arising from the guarantee.  A related board paper refers to the proposed guarantee provisions increasing the liability of the authority.  Estimates of the additional exposure related to the guarantee are not given but a limit of &euro;35 million is mentioned.<\/p><p>  The draft heads of the shareholders agreement presented to the board on the same day state that all the costs incurred or losses in the joint venture shall be shared<i> pro rata <\/i>between the shareholders, provided always that the total recourse to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority under any loans to the joint venture company, guarantees or in any account whatsoever in respect of the acquisition of the Glass Bottle site or otherwise &quot;shall not in aggregate exceed &euro;35 million&quot;.<\/p><p>  In my view, taking account of Mr. Maloney's evidence, the records kept by the authority in relation to the executive board's decisions on this matter are ambiguous at best.  Evidence from members of the board may ultimately be required to clarify the matter.  In effect, Mr. Maloney's evidence appears to be that the executive board decided in less than two weeks to increase the authority's financial exposure to the joint venture from &euro;9 million to over &euro;61 million.  In my view, decisions of that nature should be very clearly stated in the relevant records.  The justification for the increases in financial exposure and the implications for the expected returns from the investment should also be clearly recorded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014020600007#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1391683200,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

My name is Eileen Quinlivan and I am the acting CEO of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  I am joined today by my colleague, Mr. John Crawley, the authority's financial advisor.  We are here today to discuss the 2012 annual report and financial statements and to bring the committee up to date on developments in the authority since the Comptroller and Auditor General issued his special report No. 77 on the authority.<\/p><p>  Last week we submitted a briefing document to the committee which we will be referring to this morning.  On 31 May 2012 the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government announced the Government's intention to dissolve the authority.  A new council and executive board were appointed to the authority in June 2012 to oversee the transition.  The Minister envisaged that the authority would remain in place for a transitional period during which it is required to wind up existing operations, prepare the transition to new arrangements and make recommendations to him on appropriate structures for the future.<\/p> <p>These structures should ensure the docklands brand and international marketability as an attractive and prime location for investment and high-value development is maintained and enhanced, an appropriate fast-track planning regime remains in place, the local community and the business sector continue to be involved in the regeneration project and job creation is facilitated.  In addition, the board has also considered and made recommendations to the Government on how best to achieve the Minister's key objectives for the future regeneration of the docklands in a way that the board considers will build on the positive elements of the authority's legacy in terms of social, physical and economic regeneration.  A series of key objectives and associated risks were identified to implement the Government decision, as reported on in the 2012 annual financial statements.<\/p><p> In July 2013, the Cabinet approved Dublin City Council as the successor to the authority and instructed the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to put the final transition arrangements, including enabling legislation, in place.  A dedicated unit within the city council is being established to carry forward the docklands regeneration project upon the coming into effect of the strategic development zone planning scheme and the dissolution of the authority.  The city council is providing services to the authority to resource day-to-day operational activities.  The transition of responsibilities to the city council has commenced through this process.  The key wind-up issues being addressed by the authority include: the completion of the remaining asset sales and the discharge the authority's remaining liabilities; the management and resolution, where possible, of all litigation against the authority; the implementation of the transition of the authority&rsquo;s functions, obligations and responsibilities to transfer infrastructure to Dublin City Council; and the transfer and disposal of any authority interests in joint ventures and subsidiaries.  This work will be substantially completed in the first half of 2014 with residual issues being transferred to appropriate State bodies.<\/p><p> The transition objectives set by the board of the authority fall broadly into three categories.  The first objective - the stabilisation of the authority - is substantially complete.  Key deliverables in this regard include the repayment in full of the authority's bank borrowings, which at their highest rose to &euro;35 million; the successful conclusion in the authority's favour of the high-profile &euro;100 million claim by Bernard McNamara and Donatex against the authority; and the resolution of &euro;20 million in other claims against the authority without any cost.  In one case, the authority received a &euro;500,000 benefit.  The authority continues to dispose of its investment assets at good market prices in the current environment in order to settle its remaining liabilities.  The remaining litigation continues to be managed out.<\/p><p> The second objective relates to planning for the future.  Two new structures have been designed and are in the process of being implemented.  An strategic development zone planning scheme has been prepared by the city council for the area covered by the authority's North Lotts and Grand Canal Dock planning schemes. This is currently on appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The authority has also recommended to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that a docklands forum be established to ensure the continued involvement of the local community and businesses in the regeneration of the area.  The third objective relates to the transfer of responsibilities from the authority to the city council, which has commenced.  In this regard, the city council is providing ongoing resources to facilitate the continuation of the section 25 fast-track planning function and is mobilising resources to take responsibility for the authority's infrastructure, for example roads and lighting.<\/p><p> The detailed briefing paper submitted by the authority to the committee last week is intended to provide Deputies with a full update on four key areas.  It contains an update on the findings and conclusions reached in the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report.  It sets out the progress of the authority's finances from 2010 through to the audited financial statements for 2012.  As the authority is being wound up, we have prepared a summary of the moneys received by the authority since its inception and how those funds were spent.  The briefing paper also outlines a proposed delivery mechanism for the continuation of docklands regeneration into the future.<\/p><p> In summary, the authority's finances have been stabilised.  In conjunction with the city council, the authority has put in train a process to develop alternative fast-track procedures.  We have put forward a framework for the continued involvement of local communities in the future regeneration of the docklands area.  In addition, the transition into the city council, as directed by the Minister, is at an advanced stage.  My colleague and I will be happy to deal with the committee's queries to the best of our knowledge and ability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014020600007#F01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen Quinlivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391683800,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Quinlivan.

Discussion was had with what we now know as the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but which was the Department of Finance at the time, on whether it was okay to roll those contracts over.  As part of its hand-over to the current board, the previous board identified this as an issue.

However, it appears as though the moratorium was breached and Mr. Crawley made reference to this in the documentation he provided to the committee.  Four members of staff were provided with contracts of indefinite duration.  I assume this arose under a usual set of circumstances whereby an individual who is engaged by an organisation has two or more fixed-term contracts, after which he or she essentially derives additional benefit from that and under law, contracts of indefinite duration are provided.

By 2 November, the figure had increased again to &euro;61 million.  In the space of 12 days, the figure increased by &euro;52 million.

The total loss to the taxpayer between these seven projects is, therefore, approximately &euro;185 million.  That is a disgrace.  When people deal with the taxpayer's money they should treat it as if it was their own.  Have Mr. Crawley and Ms Quinlivan taken the opportunity to investigate what happened in respect of the Glass Bottle site that made costs run amok in the space of 12 days?

The \"back and forth\" between Mr. Maloney and me was regarding what the board authorised, directed or decided should be in the shareholders' agreement and regarding the investment.  I have no difficulty with what is in Mr. Crawley's note.  Those are the facts and I am satisfied with that.  The difficulty arises around what the board thought it was doing or agreeing to at the time.  In practice we were restricted to relying on the board minutes which Mr. Maloney and I agreed should be a comprehensive record of what was decided.<\/p> <p> I have tried to outline this morning that this was the sequence of decisions, and the Chair has referred to the speed at which the decisions appeared to be changing.  I was also trying to draw attention to the lack of clarity about what those decisions were, even in respect of this limit of &euro;35 million.  It appears, when we look at the executive board minutes, that what they were talking about was a limit on the exposure through the guarantee.  In fact, the limit of &euro;35 million was on everything else except the guarantee.  The guarantee had a separate scope of limitation.  Effectively, the guarantee was 26% of &euro;100 million, or &euro;26 million, plus 26% of the interest on the Becbay borrowing for a period of two years.  In the event, that is not the way it panned out, and by the time the authority came to do the deal with NAMA at the end of 2010, it had racked up a total exposure of about &euro;82 million.  Further liability would have accrued up to July 2011.  Had a deal not been done with NAMA, that liability would have continued to increase.<\/p><p> There are two points involved.  The first is that the attempt to limit the exposure did not work, and the second is the fact that the amount that they were agreeing to commit was changing within the space of days.  That is something that should be very clearly documented in minutes and very clearly understood by boards when they make decisions like these.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014020600017#Q03600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391689800,"counter":602,"content":"<p>It was said that the board minutes for the authority were the most detailed for any State authority or semi-State body, but Mr. McCarthy thinks that the records are ambiguous when it comes to this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014020600018#R00200","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391689800,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I think so, in particular the minutes of 2 November.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014020600018#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1391689800,"counter":604,"content":"<p>If we go back to the exchange that Mr. McCarthy had in December, Mr. Maloney said the following:<blockquote><br \/>On the figure of &euro;35 million, we all agree now that it was a funding guarantee liability to do with recourse and interest.

Co-operation in this area makes sense because the challenges facing health and social care providers, planners, and policy makers on both parts of the island are similar.  There is no doubt that patient benefits will accrue from pooling expertise, resources and exchanging good practice.  The Department of Health is committed to strengthening and growing North-South co-operation in this area.  Members will also be aware that both Ministers for health meet under the auspices of the North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, to discuss and share experiences on a wide range of issues.  This spirit of co-operation is in evidence through the work of Co-operation and Working Together, commonly known as CAWT, which is delivering a number of cross-Border health and social care projects in association with the health and social care services in both jurisdictions and also with the support of EU INTERREG funding.<\/p><p>  The HSE, as the key agency with responsibility for the delivery of health services, is proactively involved in the development of linkages between the services here and in Northern Ireland. The executive has a small number of personnel designated to lead on this work and to assist with establishing contacts between individual services in both jurisdictions.  This work is greatly supported though the HSE's active participation as a leading partner in the CAWT organisation.  The HSE and CAWT, with the involvement of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland and the Department of Health work closely with the North-South Ministerial Council on matters of mutual interest to both jurisdictions.<\/p><p>  I would like to briefly outline some areas of specific co-operation in health.  There is continued engagement between the Department of Health and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety on progressing co-operation in respect of acute hospital services.  A clear example of that co-operation was evident in the instant and comprehensive assistance afforded to the HSE and to patients of the north west during the catastrophic flooding of Letterkenny General Hospital at the end of July 2013.  The Department of Health has placed on record with the authorities and service providers in the North, in particular Altnagelvin Hospital, its sincere gratitude for that assistance.<\/p><p>  The needs assessment of congenital cardiac services on an all-island basis, which is currently being initialised, is a pragmatic example of co-operation across both jurisdictions that seeks to create an effective integrated service for the benefit of patients.<\/p><p>  In addition, a working group established by the Department of Health to determine how best to provide emergency aeromedical support to the ambulance service on a permanent basis has, as part of its membership, representatives from the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  of Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service.<\/p> <p>The terms of reference of the group include giving consideration, in the medium term, to the potential for an all-island approach to emergency air medical support.<br \/>The committee will also be aware of the proposed new radiotherapy facilities at Altnagelvin Area Hospital in Derry.  The Government has committed capital funding for the unit which will offer huge benefits for cancer patients from both jurisdictions requiring radiation oncology services when it opens in 2016.  It will improve geographic access to radiation oncology services for over 500,000 people living in the north west of the island.  It will also considerably reduce travel times for patients in Donegal and surrounding areas.  The project is an excellent example of cross Border co-operation and great progress that has been made to date to ensure the delivery of the new unit.  Officials from both jurisdictions are working together on the service level agreement for the operation of the unit.<br \/>On alcohol and tobacco, the promotion of health and well-being is very important for all our citizens.  There is important and ongoing co-operation between the two jurisdictions on health promotion issues including that of alcohol, which is one of very serious concern.  The North-South alcohol policy advisory group, supported by the Institute of Public Health, was set up to undertake work on the issues relating to alcohol availability.  This work contemplates examining product, price, promotion, and place, as well as hidden harm, which includes the need to support children with substance-misusing parents or carers.  Last October, the Government approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse to be incorporated in a public health (alcohol) Bill.  Work is progressing on the development of this legislation which will provide, <i>inter alia<\/i>, for a minimum unit price in respect of alcohol.  This is a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels per gramme of alcohol that must be legally observed by retailers in both the on and off-trade sectors.<br \/>Concrete steps are being taken jointly with Northern Ireland to prepare for the development and implementation of policy on minimum unit pricing.  A health impact assessment, HIA, has been commissioned in conjunction with our counterparts in Northern Ireland as part of the process of developing a legislative basis for minimum unit pricing.  The assessment will study the impact of different minimum prices on a range of areas such as health, crime and likely economic effects.  It is expected that the findings from the HIA will be available by the end of quarter 2 of this year.  Minimum unit pricing is key to reducing the harm of alcohol in adolescents and problem drinkers.  Collaboration with our colleagues in Northern Ireland on the HIA sets a good example of progress which we can make together in tackling the issue of alcohol abuse.  The Minister for Health and his Northern Ireland counterpart are in agreement on the need to act simultaneously to allay concerns regarding negative impacts on cross-Border shopping.<br \/>An inaugural North-South tobacco conference was held in Belfast in November last.  It provided a platform for speakers, both local and international, to share their experiences and expertise in respect of tobacco control research and policy.  Good progress has also been made in respect of standardised packaging and the general scheme of the relevant Bill has been published and has been referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children.  The joint committee called for submissions on the general scheme and the first in its series of public hearings on the matter was held on 23 January.  I understand the committee is discussing this matter again today.<br \/>There has been significant co-operation between the Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland and the National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP, in respect of suicide prevention measures and the implementation of the all-island action plan is ongoing.  Particular actions arising from this approach have included understanding risk issues - particularly for young men - the roll-out of applied suicide intervention skills training, ASIST, and the sharing of training resources.  As part of its programme of work over the next three years and in partnership with the Department of Health and the health authorities in Northern Ireland, the NOSP will further develop and implement the all-island action plan, focused on knowledge transfer, sharing of resources and information on programmes that are exemplars of good practice.  Suicide is a complex issue and there is no single or easy interventions that will guarantee success.  However, by promoting cross-organisation collaboration and the development of networks and partnerships we can maximise the impact of our suicide prevention initiatives.<br \/>As members are no doubt aware, the Food Safety Promotion Board, or <i>safe<\/i>food, is one of the six North-South implementation bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement in 1999.  It is principally charged with tasks involving food safety awareness, supporting North-South scientific co-operation and fostering links between institutions working in the field of food safety.  It has been engaged in a wide variety of projects and campaigns including continuing to support the all-island obesity action forum, the purpose of which is to support the implementation of obesity policies; the &quot;Stop the Spread&quot; public awareness campaign, which was launched in May 2011 to raise awareness that excess weight has become the norm in Ireland and to encourage people to take action; and an independent television production &quot;Operation Transformation&quot;, which has been sponsored by Food Safety Promotion Board since 2011.<br \/>I am pleased to report that e-health is an area in which we are developing very positive and meaningful relationships with colleagues in Northern Ireland.  As part of the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union there was very useful co-operation during e-health week in May 2013.  The Northern Ireland Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Security, Mr. Edwin Poots, MLA, and his officials were welcome guests at the three-day conference on e-health we hosted in Dublin at that time.  The e-health strategy approved by Government and published on 13 of December.  It highlights the benefits of e-health from both a jobs and patient-care perspective.  We are interested in working more closely with our colleagues in Northern Ireland in this area and we believe there may be potential for an all island approach to e-health.  This would have benefits for patients and providers on both sides of the Border.<br \/>I am of the view that this short presentation has demonstrated the depth and breadth of co-operation between the two jurisdictions in the area of health.  We in the Department of Health will continue to foster that co-operation.  While I have attempted to give members a flavour of progress on issues of co-operation, it is not been possible to cover all areas in the time available.  My colleagues and I are happy to answer any questions members may wish to pose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014020600003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Bairbre Nic Aongusa","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391681700,"counter":625,"content":"<p>With the agreement of members, we will take the next presentation before taking questions.

As members will be aware, the vast majority of patients receive health care in their country of residence.  However, in certain circumstances, patients may wish to receive their health care in another country, for example, in the case of highly specialised treatment.  The new directive seeks to ensure a clear and transparent framework for the provision of cross-border health care within the EU and EEA.  In particular, it aims to facilitate access to safe and high-quality cross-border health care; promote co-operation on health care between member states, while fully respecting their national competencies in the field of health; facilitate the reimbursement of the cost of treatment in another member state; introduce a system of prior authorisation for certain categories of treatment; and facilitate efficient transfer of patient information between member states.<\/p><p>  The directive gives people who ordinarily reside in Ireland the option to obtain the health care that they are entitled to under our public health system delivered in another EU or EEA country.  The health service provider abroad may be in the public or private sector.  The costs will be borne by the patient and he or she can seek reimbursement for the service from the HSE upon his or her return to Ireland.  Reimbursement will be equal to the cost of the health care abroad or the cost of similar treatment here, whichever is the lesser.  Similarly, persons resident in other EU and EEA states may use Irish health services subject to appropriate referral.<\/p><p>  On the transposition of the new directive, there will be two alternative routes for patients who wish to receive planned health care in another member state that will be paid for by the member state in which they reside.  The first of these is the long-established route under the relevant EU regulations, commonly known as the E112 route.<\/p> <p>The second is the new route under the cross-border directive.  The main differences between the two routes are the existing E112 route relates only to treatment provided in the public sector; the treatment must not be available in the health system where the health patient lives; the care must be pre-authorised by the home state; and the costs and reimbursement are handled directly between the home member state and the health care provider abroad rather than between the patient and the health care provider.<\/p><p> By contrast, under the directive there is no requirement for the treatment to be unavailable in the health system where the patient lives, and patients may access treatment in either the public or private sector in another member state.  However, patients must pay the health care provider directly for the treatment and then seek reimbursement from the home health system up to the cost of similar treatment in the home state or the actual amount paid whichever is the lesser.  Except where the member state opts to have certain treatment subject to a system of prior authorisation, and this power is limited under the directive, the patient is not required to obtain prior authorisation.<\/p><p> Under the directive the member state has obligations to its own residents and to residents in other member states.  In the case of Irish residents we must ensure the procedures regarding the use of cross-border health care and reimbursement of costs are based on objective non-discriminatory criteria which are necessary and proportionate; that the procedures are easily accessible and freely available publicly; that requests for cross-border health care are dealt with objectively and impartially; that requests are dealt with in a reasonable period of time, taking into account the specific medical conditions, urgency and individual circumstances of the patient; that decisions regarding the use of cross-border health care and reimbursement are properly reasoned, subject to review and open to challenge in judicial proceedings; and where a patient has received cross-border health care that any necessary follow-up medical assistance the patient may require would be the same as had the patient received the care in Ireland.  We must also ensure patients who seek to receive or receive cross-border health care have remote access or be granted a copy of their medical records.<\/p><p> Member states have the option to offer patients a voluntary system of prior notification whereby the patient receives written confirmation of the amount to be reimbursed based on an estimate of the costs.  This estimate must take into account the patient's clinical case specifying the medical procedures likely to apply.  In the case of residents of other member states we must provide information on request about practical aspects of receiving cross-border health care in Ireland.  This includes providing information on treatment options, quality and safety, invoices and price information, the applicable fees, and appeal and redress procedures if patients consider their rights have not been respected.  Patients must also have access to a copy of their medical records.<\/p><p> Draft statutory provisions to fully implement the directive here have been prepared and are being considered by the Department.  They will then be examined by the Office of the Attorney General prior to settling.  Our aim is to have the necessary statutory provisions in place before the end of the first quarter of this year.  In the meantime a national contact point, NCP, has been established in the HSE.  The NCP is a key provision of the directive.  Its function is to provide information to patients resident here and those abroad considering coming here for services.  The NCP will advise on all aspects of the directive, including the terms and conditions for reimbursement of costs and the procedures for accessing and determining entitlements.  The NCP has arranged for information on the directive to be placed on the HSE website.  I am pleased to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014020600004#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Barron","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391682300,"counter":628,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Barron.

I represent Fine Gael in the Cavan-Monaghan constituency.  I very much welcome the directive on access to European health care services.  We are almost 20 years into a peace process and on a practical day-to-day basis there must be benefits from the peace process in health care and education for ordinary residents living in peripheral areas, but this has not been driven fast or far enough.  Many people along the Border go to GPs in the North.  Those living in Monaghan may go to a GP in Armagh.  If an emergency occurs family members must drive them to Craigavon Area Hospital rather than getting an ambulance because the ambulance will not cross the Border.  These issues need to be sorted out.  They are practical measures which should happen on a day-to-day basis for ordinary residents on both sides of the Border.<\/p><p>  While the directive is welcome it is discriminatory because there is inequality of access.  People who do not have money cannot avail of it as one must pay upfront for the service.  If one has it one will get it, but if one does not one will not.  A European directive should not be framed in this directive. <\/p><p>  I will give a practical example of what could be done at cross-Border level with regard to emergency services such as ambulances.  For many people in Monaghan who attend the GP in Craigavon or Keady in Armagh the nearest hospital is Craigavon Area Hospital.  It is important these services are provided.  I welcome the air emergency helicopter ambulance which has been introduced as it has been used a number of times and has been very beneficial in the Monaghan area.  I commend the HSE for putting the service in place.<\/p><p>  With regard to alcohol and drugs, there are Cuan Mhuire facilities in my home town of Ballybay in Monaghan and in Newry.  This service is provided by Sr. Consilio who receives no funding from the HSE.  The service is badly needed in the area and many of those who attend have alcohol, gambling and drug addictions.  They are recovering and may be homeless, but no service is provided by the State in the Border area.  A voluntary service provided by Sr. Consilio has had to be put in place instead of having services provided by the HSE, or by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland.  The service is living on handouts and needs statutory funding from the HSE and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland to ensure the service is provided in the Border area.  Sr. Consilio would not have needed to open the centre if services were provided by the state on both sides of the Border.  More needs to be done.<\/p> <p>As a first practical step, the HSE needs to engage with Cuan Mhuire and try to provide it with a service.  They are getting some <i>ad hoc <\/i>funding from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to keep going but there is nothing coming from the HSE.  That needs to be addressed immediately.<br \/>These are the initial points but I would be more than happy to engage, if I can, on the day to day experience of people along the Border.  There was hope 20 years ago that services would be developed - some were put in place at the time between Monaghan hospital, Omagh, Dungannon and Craigavon - but the process must be driven much faster.  The idea of cross-Border health services is not an abstract thought but it is a practical daily need of people living along the Border.  There must be joined-up thinking.  Perhaps a small, dedicated team from both the HSE and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland could ensure this can happen.  We must remove obstacles so we can achieve a proper level of health care at the nearest hospitals on both sides of the Border.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014020600005#E00700","nonspeaker":"Deputy Se&aacute;n Conlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391682900,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation from the Department and I thank Ms Nic Aongusa and Mr. Barron for their presentations.  I agree with Deputy Conlan in regard to the need to improve practical co-operation on a daily basis.  Over the years there has been the provision of services by Omagh hospital for Monaghan and a dialysis service from Daisy Hill Hospital for patients in County Louth in particular.  That is welcome.  The Co-operation and Working Together, CAWT, agreement of July 1992 was the first formal partnership and although there has been co-operation, there should be additional momentum.<\/p><p>  For those of us living in the Border area in particular, we are fortunate that a very capable hospital has just been built in Enniskillen.  The last time I was there I saw that the potential of the hospital has not yet been maximised.  If we take the area of Monaghan, Cavan, Enniskillen and Sligo, there is surely a need to deliver services in the area based on a cross-Border context.  If there are additional services or new facilities being provided, does the Department or the HSE consult with bodies or account for the needs of health services in the North?  We should not provide additional services or new facilities, such as physical infrastructure, on the basis of just catering for our own population in the immediate catchment area.  We must factor in the needs of the patients in the North, where such services are also lacking.  I hope that in the context of Sligo, Enniskillen, Cavan and Monaghan, we will maximise the potential of the Enniskillen hospital.  Services should be provided in the North and South, and I hope the very dramatically improved relationship between North and South will help provide the needed momentum in the health care area.<\/p><p>  Mr. Barron mentioned that the aim is to have the necessary statutory provisions in place before the end of the first quarter.  Does this mean they will be operational from the end of the first quarter or is a commencement order needed?  Has this directive been transposed into law in many member states?  Is it only applicable where a resident of a member state that has already transposed it into law is seeking a service in another member state that has transposed the directive into law?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014020600006#F00200","nonspeaker":"Deputy Brendan Smith"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391682900,"counter":636,"content":"<p>I will begin where Deputy Smith left off when he mentioned the Cavan, Monaghan and Sligo area.  Before I get into the issue, I welcome our visiting delegations and thank them for the presentation.  It is important that we develop services on this side of the Border in our hospitals and there should be a strategy for the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group, as well as Sligo.  In my constituency there are the Cavan and Monaghan hospitals, which have services that can be available to people north of the Border.  That must be a very important part of our strategy.  What is happening in Altnagelvin is good, and I am sure the Chairman is acutely aware of the benefit of that.  We have listened to radio programmes for a long time about people travelling on buses to Galway from Letterkenny and Inishowen.  These were harrowing stories, so it is a great development.  Just as we see the Altnagelvin development, there is an onus on the Department and the HSE to ensure we develop services on our side that will draw patients from the South as well as the North.  There must be co-operation on both sides about the use of these services and their rationalisation, etc., and it is important that we gear up the services too.<\/p><p>  I am very happy that the congenital cardiac services will be provided on an all-Ireland basis.  I, along with the Chairman and others, met a very fine delegation of volunteers in the reception area of LH 2000 who campaigned for this issue, as well as parents of children with congenital cardiac conditions.  They were campaigning for an all-Ireland centre of excellence.  I am happy about that because I was very impressed with the sincerity of the delegation, and we did what we could at the time by going to the Minister.  Will a timeframe be provided on that issue and how will it develop in practical terms?  It must be very reassuring to parents with children affected by the issue.  I subscribe to what has been said about air medical support, which should operate on an all-Ireland basis.  Given the size of the country, it does not make sense that it would be otherwise.<\/p><p>  Alcohol has come into a tragic focus in Ireland in the past week with the events surrounding the practice of \"neknomination\" and the two fatalities connected to it.  The other night I saw one or two examples of horrific posts that concerned the practice.  In one post there was a seven year old child and a baby in a cot as the people took part in the practice, and I can confidentially direct colleagues to that post if they are interested.  It was horrific stuff to watch.  It is a major problem.  I know it is not on the agenda here but Facebook has a responsibility to take these types of posts off its website.  If it cannot do so, it should be shut down.  We cannot have it as it is an horrendous practice; it gives a terrible example and has horrendous consequences.  Although it is not strictly in today's brief, it underlines the gravity of what has been said by the delegation about alcohol.<\/p><p>  I agree about the minimum unit pricing.  Will the witness elaborate on how the Department sees that progressing, although I know there is a political dimension to this?  Deputy Conlan spoke very eloquently earlier and both he and Deputy Smith could speak about how we have seen cycles over the past number of years.  In one period everybody would go north to buy cheap alcohol but in another period they may come south to buy it as pricing changes.  People fill their car boots full of very cheap alcohol, so minimum unit pricing is critical.  There should also be a standardisation of pricing in the North and South.<\/p><p>  We must make it a less attractive product for people.  A youngster can go out with &euro;20 tonight and buy four pints of beer in a conventional bar, where he or she would drink them in a social environment.  That youngster could with the same money buy 20 cans of lager and bring it home to drink it unsupervised and without any social control.  That is what we are dealing with, so it is a very big issue.  Whether we like it or not, there is a correlation between pricing, consumption levels and addiction.  Will the witnesses comment on how they see the process evolving practically, what is being done and from where progress will come?  There is also the issue of tobacco packaging.  Empirical findings suggest that if plain and unattractive packing is used, it will have an impact on young people starting to smoke.  The Minister is right in going after that issue.<\/p><p>  We have heard about other practical issues, such as the doctor-on-call system.<\/p> <p>My colleague, Deputy Conlan, might have more specific information on the matter due to his location.  My understanding, and please correct me if I am wrong, is that we have not developed a satisfactory doctor-on-call system, north and south of the Border.  That should be an area of practical co-operation that we could achieve and that would be efficacious on every level.  I ask the delegation to comment on the matter and I am happy to be corrected if I am wrong.  I know that it was not the case some months ago and presume nothing has changed.  Similarly, we do not have an adequate cross-Border ambulance service.  I mean an ambulance that would work in a Border radius area, would pick up people on either side of the Border and be able to travel to Enniskillen, Cavan, Monaghan or whatever is required.  That is an important issue.<\/p><p> Obviously the points made on food safety do not merit repeating because they were adequately made.  They are also very important points.<\/p><p> I wish to make a general observation.  I agree with the colleagues who have expressed frustration with the lack of progress to date in the area.  Surely, health is an area that we can achieve co-operation on and should not be so politicised.  Health is not about flags or emblems and is universal.  Illness is universal and does not respect religious or social barriers.  Education is another sector but is much more politicised and problematic.  The delivery of health services should be a classic area for co-operation.  I know that the Department's bona fides are sound and it wants to co-operate but a lot more should have been achieved.  Does the delegation agree with my broad observation that not enough has been done, we could have done a lot more and should quickly make up for lost time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014020600006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Deputy Joe O'Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391683500,"counter":638,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I apologise as well because I could not possibly have the eloquence of my friends from Cavan or even worse my friend from Ballybay but I shall make an attempt.<\/p><p>  I am a former GP and warmly welcome the potential for the cross-Border directive outlined by Mr. Barron.  It is interesting and exciting and I want to see it in action.  I shall be brief and have one or two simple questions.  What, in the name of God, is stopping further practical patient-oriented co-operation and health?  There is no issue more frustrating for people along the Border than the flexibility on that, in both directions but probably on balance slightly more going North than those coming South.  I do not want to incriminate myself too far.  I abused the British system for years because I was aware of dozens, if not hundreds, of people from Donegal fabricating an address in the North so that they could access health care.  I have never mentioned this before and I do not wish to make a song and dance about it but it was a scandal for all sorts of reasons.  That frustration exists.  The British side or the British National Health Service has tightened up significantly and has managed to sift all of these people out of the system.  Therefore, somebody living in Donegal today has great difficult accessing the North but 15 or 20 years ago - and I do not want to say any detail because probably some of it was slightly fraudulent - people were desperate to access health care.  That is not justifiable, whether it is surgery or an item of health care.<\/p><p>  The witness wisely mentioned pricing.  We know what pricings are here in the VHI system.  We know what pricings were in the North under fund holding 15 years ago.  We gave up fund holding because the bureaucracy around it was more than the clinical care.  It is easy enough to price things.  A price can be put on a gall bladder or appendix removal.  There is space and accommodation.  At times there are queues for some issues in the North but there is always accommodation around the system as well.  There is always vacant accommodation around the system. <\/p><p>  My colleague here wisely mentioned the Enniskillen hospital.  I am very worried about the Enniskillen hospital because it needs more customers, to be put at its simplest.  Those customers could be people living in Blacklion or similar places along the Border.  It could equally be people in the South and south of Donegal on the other side.  It is not beyond the wit of man to get some of this together. <\/p><p>  I have a lot of time for Co-operation and Working Together, CAWT, the various organisations, and Mr. Tom Daly and his efforts.  From what I have seen, our bureaucracy on both sides of the Border seems incapable of defining the barriers and removing them.  Everything is perfect in theory and practice but we do not seem capable of getting it to the final stage and over the line.  Nothing would create more satisfaction in people's minds, on both sides of the Border, than opening up flexibility.  I shall not go into a ream of detail on the matter but shall suggest one simple thing.  There can be a trade-off.  People on the southern side of the Border would warmly welcome, as Deputy Conlan has outlined, access to primary care, GPs and similar in the North and early, simple and straightforward secondary care.  If it came to a complicated situation there might be a decision made that a person must be referred back to Dublin or whatever.<\/p><p>  We have a problem in the North which is being highlighted at the moment by congenital cardiac surgery that you guys are tackling and I thank them for doing so.  That could have been tackled a wee bit more sensitively and with a wee bit more political understanding.  The initiative is almost over the line, if not over the line already.  There is a need for high quality coronary care and there are facilities in the North.  The Minister in the North would like to create a second set of facilities around Altnagelvin which would serve Donegal and other areas.  That initiative must be got over the line because if one's father, mother, brother or sister is dying with a heart attack one is not terribly choosy as to who will save his life.  That is essentially what we are talking about here - getting people in remote rural areas, within an hour or less than hour, to a catheter lab where the clot or whatever is threatening their life can be removed.<\/p><p>  Other issues can be traded off in a southern direction.  We desperately need a plastic surgical unit dealing with burns.  We have a small but very significant number of people, on both sides of the Border, who have been very badly disfigured and scarred.  However, we do not have a coherent unit to deal with burns on the island.  There are some good people in the North who work at the discipline but they have at least one hand tied behind their backs and the same happens in the South.<\/p><p>  There is another issue around obesity.  There is a desperate need for an all-island obesity service where surgeons can take out bits of bowel or whatever in order to help those people who are unable to control their weight.  I have outlined a number of niche markets and issues where there is no major coherent service, North or South.  There can be a coherent service on both directions and must of it can be located in Dublin.  It would lead to a win-win situation.  As Deputy Conlan suggested, we could have a flow northwards at primary care level and there can equally be the same for highly specialist and niche markets or rare diseases.<\/p><p>  I congratulate the delegation.  I am not levelling any accusation against any of the people here because I know the work that they have done.  We must find the driver, somebody or something that will make more happen quicker because health initiatives should not be so slow.  I want to know if there have been issues in the North.  I have regular conversations with Edwin Poots.  Regardless of politics, he has made it very clear to me that he has signed up for as much cross-Border co-operation on health as he can and it is not a political issue with him but a humanitarian one.  Therefore, we must find the ways and means.  Are there medical obstacles?  Is it the medical profession?<\/p> <p>If people are guarding patches, and my guess is that the medical profession have a hand to play in it, we must find some system of moving around it.  There are gains for everyone and there are gains for the Department of Health and the Department of Health in the North.  I have gone on far longer than I intended but there is an array of issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014020600007#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alasdair McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391684100,"counter":641,"content":"<p>Yes, Dr. McDonnell did and he said he was going to be brief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014020600008#H00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391684100,"counter":642,"content":"<p>I was brief.

I would like to concentrate on what Mr. McDonnell refers to as people guarding their patches.  If there are difficulties in respect of the system, is there a way of better co-ordinating it?  Under the current system, the Ministers meet and the officials meet.  Can another layer be established or is there a need for a conference bringing people from medical backgrounds together with those who are concerned with patients' rights?  They could look at the gaps in services and what we could do better.  Has that ever been done?  Would that be a helpful way of moving forward?<\/p><p>  Yesterday, a group based in Maynooth, AIRO, made a presentation on its work to map needs and services throughout the island, particularly along the Border.  The group focused on the limited number of services and time critical issues such as travel times for accident and emergency cases, coronary care and strokes.  Co-operation on these matters is a real benefit for communities.  One of the questions is whether the Department works with groups like this to map services along the Border.  Does the Department provide support to map services and plan for cross-Border services in accident and emergency, coronary and strokes?  We are familiar with the golden hour.  How does this operate in respect of choosing between going to Louth hospital or Newry?  What co-ordination exists?<\/p><p>  Mr. Barron referred to the directive that is to be introduced.  Is there anything we can do in respect of the resources?  What is needed to speed it up?  It makes sense in respect of cross-Border services.  Is there something the committee can do if there is a delay?<\/p><p>  The witnesses referred to what is available to people, including the E111 card.  Is there a difference between jurisdictions?  If I travel across the North and I am involved in an accident, I may be provided with services.  Is there a difference if a similar thing happens to me in Spain or France?  As an example, someone was recently involved in a serious accident in Spain.  The person has been sent a bill for &euro;8,000 because the person did not produce the E111 card.  The person had it on a mobile telephone but this was not acceptable.  The card has to be produced.  Are there anomalies in the system that must be ironed out?  We can talk about it later.<\/p><p>  The witnesses also gave the example of people looking for care outside the jurisdiction.  What are the options for people waiting for access to a paying doctor for one and a half years while on all sorts of medication that is making their condition worse?

If there is a lack of service in respect of certain specialties, what can we do?  I am thinking about this committee and trying to encourage the cross-Border element.

I welcome the progress made but we have a long way to go.  Everyone has goodwill towards this.  Like Deputy Conlan, I live along the Border in Dundalk.  I do not understand why an ambulance from the North cannot come into the South and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  In emergency care, this point must be addressed.<br \/>I refer to the options for people with disabilities to access special care across the Border.  This applies to the search for paediatricians.  In my area, there is no orthopaedic paediatric surgeon in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  It is a centre of excellence, and despite numerous questions I have submitted seeking details, I have yet to receive a response.  From sitting in the hospital for up to eight hours waiting for an orthopaedic appointment, I know people can go across the Border and access it more easily and quicker.  This is not available to us.  What plans exist in this respect?  At the moment, the facilities are not in place.<\/p> <p>We have spoken about nomadic people with various addresses but I actually know of people whose children have special needs who have moved across the Border.  They have upped and moved across the Border because they could access treatment and services in Newry that they could not get in Dundalk.  That is appalling and it must be addressed urgently.<\/p><p> I recently dealt with a mother whose son had applied for funding under the treatment abroad scheme for a very rare condition.  He had been assessed and accepted by a hospital in England, which would provide the required treatment.  When he came back and applied to have that treatment, he was told that the treatment was available in Ireland and his application was refused.  What is the criteria for qualification under that scheme?  When he checked the situation here, the orthopaedic specialist he saw in Cappagh Hospital told him that he would have to go to England for treatment.  He was assessed and accepted for treatment.  The witnesses may know of the case to which I am referring.  I know the individual returned to England for some treatment but has been experiencing problems again in recent months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014020600008#H00900","nonspeaker":"Senator Mary Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391684700,"counter":650,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late.  The former Taoiseach Brian Cowen once referred to the Department of Health as \"Angola\" because there were so many landmines going off.  I appreciate that the witnesses do a great job and work very hard in very difficult circumstances.  However, it sometimes seems that the Department of Health, those working for the health services, such as doctors and consultants, and HIQA do not follow up on their convictions and leave politicians holding the line.  Perhaps the press does not listen to them but they should state what it the best approach for our health services.  It should not be left to politicians to hold the line.<\/p><p>  I come from Roscommon and at the mere mention of Roscommon County Hospital, people say \"Oh my God\".  Roscommon county has a population of a little over 50,000, with just over 5,000 living in Roscommon town.  Those living in north Roscommon, where I live, travel to Sligo for treatment, while the people of south Roscommon go to Ballinasloe.  Therefore, there are approximately 25,000 people living in the catchment area for the hospital.  The accident and emergency department at the hospital had no cardiac surgeon, no paediatric surgeon, nobody to incubate and no anaesthetist for overnight cover.  How can that be called an accident and emergency department?  <\/p><p>  I was in Dublin just over two years ago discussing this with representatives of the Department of Health.  Everyone told us why the accident and emergency service could not remain in the hospital.  The consultants wrote that the department was unsafe.  HIQA said that the consultants could not remain in the department because they would be de-skilled.  Then all hell broke loose and everyone went to ground.  The Department of Health did not get the message out.  HIQA decided that it would not follow up on what it had said at the meeting because it did not want to be political.  The consultants who wrote the letter said nothing and the GPs and doctors all went to ground.  They left this unfortunate politician to hold the line.  I know that everyone here will agree, privately, that it was the right decision to make.  It would have been crazy to allow the accident and emergency department to remain open.  That is irrelevant, however, because the people of Roscommon think that people will die.  Nobody has died in two and a half years and at least 50 lives have been saved because there is an air ambulance in place.  Paramedics and advance paramedics are saving lives.<\/p><p>  The Department and others running our health services must stand up sometimes and not leave the politicians holding the line.  I will always be the politician who closed the hospital.  The hospital is actually twice as busy.  The urgent care centre is as busy as ever and by the time we are finished, the hospital will be five times busier and twice as big.  The witnesses here know that and I know that.  How can we get that message out?  It should not be left to the politicians to hold the line because nobody believes politicians or even wants to believe them.   <\/p><p>  In terms of the media, both local and national, it is a race to the bottom.  They want to report the worst case scenario.  I am disappointed in the Department of Health, HIQA, GPs and consultants.  There is a saying, \"What is the difference between a consultant and God?  God doesn't think he's a consultant\".  The witnesses here have a job to do.  I would like to hear their observations on that.  What happened was they allowed a vacuum to be filled.  I am not blaming them.  I am blaming the whole system.  I am blaming politicians too.  Politicians will try to take credit for some things.  They should stand up.  We need impartial people to come out and state the facts.  That is what happened in Mallow.<\/p><p>  The situation regarding the accident and emergency department in Mallow was very similar but three consultants there came out and said that closing the department would be the best move in the context of patient safety.  They said that the people should go to Cork, end of story.  In Roscommon County Hospital, the three consultants wrote a letter stating that the department was only useful when, probably once in every four years, there might be a car crash within a mile of the hospital.  I asked them why they did not say something when 5,000 people were outside the hospital, protesting at the closure of the department.  They said it was more than their lives were worth to say something.  All I am saying is that the witnesses have a job to do and it is a difficult one.  However, there are times when they cannot leave politicians alone, defending decisions.<\/p><p>  The air ambulance service is an enormous success and must be retained.  Now it is time to get an air ambulance in the North too.  The air ambulance from Athlone will cover most of the south.  An air ambulance in the North could serve the people north of Athlone.  This is cross-Border co-operation that will save lives.  It is imperative to examine the possibility of having two air ambulances.  <\/p><p>  I am sorry to have spoken at length earlier.  I was not having a go at the witnesses but was saying that something must happen and the witnesses cannot leave politicians high and dry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014020600009#J00200","nonspeaker":"Deputy Frank Feighan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391684700,"counter":651,"content":"<p>Members went over time because this is such an important issue.  It is also an emotive issue but there are practical solutions to hand.  We want to help and we want to contribute.  I will give the witnesses an opportunity to respond but before doing so, I wish to acknowledge the fact that 2016 is the target for the opening of the radiotherapy centre in Altnagelvin Area Hospital, which will cater for a catchment area population of 500,000.  That is very welcome.<br \/>I wish to pick up on a point made by Deputy Feighan and others about paramedic and ambulance cover.  I do not know what the situation is in County Louth but I am aware there is good co-operation between Altnagelvin Area Hospital and Letterkenny General Hospital.  I am not sure that the public is aware of that, however, so we have a job to do in terms of letting people know the true situation.  <br \/>I am not seeking a comment on the tragic case of Ms Porter who died at the side of the road in Carndonagh, having waited for 50 minutes for an ambulance, because that is currently the subject of a HIQA inquiry.  I welcome the fact that such an inquiry is taking place.  A few miles down the road from that incident, however, there were ambulances at Altnagelvin.  There were also ambulances outside Letterkenny General Hospital but Ms Porter's family could not get an ambulance for their mother, who was dying at the side of the road.  On top of that, the helicopter service was <i>en route<\/i>from Malin Head to Sligo at that time.  There are opportunities for joined-up thinking.  <br \/>The Minister for Health is on record speaking about the potential for Enniskillen, Sligo, Altnagelvin and Letterkenny to co-operate in the context of air ambulance and paramedic services.  I invite the witnesses to comment on that.  What is the current standing of the proposal in the Department?  Sometimes we as politicians talk about cross-Border co-operation as if it is a simple matter.  At a political level, the Health Minister, Mr. Edmund Poots MLA, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, are working together and agreeing solutions but sometimes the implementation proves difficult.  Perhaps the witness could elaborate on the difficulties they are encountering.  Are there turf wars or cultural barriers?  Is it the case that people have a difficulty with doing something new?  Is it down to the human condition?  Are we creatures of habit, used to doing things in a certain way?  The witnesses are responsible for the Twenty-six Counties.<\/p> <p>What are the difficulties and what are the barriers to the common-sense practical solutions we naive politicians think should happen in the morning?

As is evident from the discussion, the areas of co-operation span many parts of the Department.  Therefore, in a few minutes I will ask my colleague, Charlie Hardy, a principal officer in the acute hospital division, to deal with some of the issues committee members have raised about emergency and hospital services.  Issues were raised also about GP cross-Border services, and my colleague, Paul Barron, will deal with those.  He will also cover the various issues relating to the cross-Border directive.<\/p><p>  I will take a few minutes to deal with some of the other issues.  A general question raised by a number of members, including the Chairman, concerns the fact that while there is significant good work under way in cross-Border co-operation on health, there is much more that could be done.  The Department of Health would agree with that.  There is very close co-operation at official level between our Department and our colleagues in the North.  The Secretary General of the Department meets his counterpart in the North, Andrew McCormick, regularly - several times a year.  There are also regular meetings at official level across the spectrum of North-South issues.<\/p><p>  A question arose as to whether there is a process by which new areas of co-operation can be explored, other than through the usual liaison between officials.  Deputy Crowe mentioned conferences and special events.  We have done that in the past and would consider doing it again.  I mentioned the successful cross-Border conference on tobacco.  We also had one on e-health in Dublin during our EU Presidency, on which we had very active engagement from Minister Poots and his officials.  Under the formal mechanisms, the parties involved are in regular contact to decide on priorities.  At the most recent North-South Ministerial Council plenary session, it was agreed there would be an exploration in each sectoral area to establish whether there were additional priorities that could be progressed.  That exploration will take place in the health area and we will certainly take into consideration the various issues raised here in this discussion.<\/p><p>  The issue of alcohol was raised and there were questions and concerns about minimum unit pricing.  We have a North-South alcohol policy advisory group in the Department, which was set up by the chief medical officers of both jurisdictions in 2012.  This group has been doing significant work on assessing the evidence for the alcohol policy that has been agreed.  The Government has approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse, including the drafting of the public health (alcohol) Bill which will include provisions for minimum pricing.  Concrete steps are being taken to address concerns about minimum pricing.<\/p><p>  I mentioned research that has been commissioned, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Public Services in Northern Ireland, to model the impact of the minimum unit pricing on alcohol consumption in both jurisdictions.  As well as looking at the health impacts of alcohol consumption, the impact assessment is being required to look specifically at the likely effects of different minimum prices on a range of areas, such as crime and the economy North and South.  A Sheffield university has been awarded the contract to carry out the wide-ranging impact assessment, and it is anticipated the research will be ready by the end of quarter two of this year.  I expect the study will address some of the concerns people have had about the economic effect and, possibly, the effect on levels of crime in Border areas.<\/p><p>  Minimum pricing is a tool which addresses the issue of alcohol that is cheap relative to its strength, and all the evidence has shown that its use is more effective in terms of targeting at-risk drinkers, particularly young people.  Some committee members mentioned the recent controversy concerning the so-called Neknomination.  Young people are attracted to buying cheap alcohol at very low prices, and minimum unit pricing has been shown to be the most effective way to deal with that.  It is more effective than increasing excise duty across the board in terms of addressing this issue.<\/p><p>  Senator White asked about the cancer radiotherapy centre in Altnagelvin.  That unit is due to open in 2016 and the Irish Government has committed once-off capital funding of a ceiling of one third of the cost for radiotherapy facilities at the centre.  The unit will provide access to radiotherapy services to more than 500,000 people.  Approximately 10% of patients from the Republic will continue to receive more specialist treatment in Galway or Dublin.  Republic of Ireland patients receiving radiotherapy in Altnagelvin will continue to have their diagnosis, surgery and other treatment planning in either Letterkenny or Galway.  Agreement was reached with the Northern Ireland authorities on the revenue costs, and discussions are under way for a service level agreement which will finalise the agreement between the two jurisdictions for the radiotherapy services to be provided in Altnagelvin.  This is very much a success story in terms of North-South co-operation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014020600010#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Bairbre Nic Aongusa"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391685300,"counter":654,"content":"<p>What is the current situation?

What are the chances that these people will be able to access surgery in Altnagelvin or elsewhere at some stage?  There is a world class cancer centre in Belfast.  Professor Patrick Johnston, a proud son of Derry and soon to be Chancellor of Queen's University Belfast, effectively set up that centre.  What are the chances of tapping into that resource?  If somebody has a tumour, the sooner he or she has surgery, the better.  I do not suggest they should wait for treatment in the North, but surely it is worthwhile trying to access any space available for surgery in the North, rather than wait six weeks or three months to have surgery in Galway, Dublin or somewhere else.

The report was written by John Higgins who happens to be a Tyrone man working in Cork.  He is well aware of the North-South dimension.  Built into the report was the need to ensure that in strategic plans for the bigger groups there would be North-South co-operation and networking of hospitals across the Border.  I do not think there will be cross-Border groups or trusts at this stage but networking across the Border is a very important element of the strategic plans the groups are being asked to draw up in the next few months.  A strategic advisory group is meeting as we speak.  John Higgins is part of it and it will look at the services generally.  That is something will be kept on the agenda.  We will build on the work of Co-operation and Working Together, CAWT.  In the past there were very good examples of cross-Border co-operation and they will be built into the strategic plans of the groups, in particular those groups relating to the north east and west north-west, which are conjoined with the Border.  As well as that, there is a proposal to draw up a steering group between the two Departments to deal with hospital co-operation in particular.  We will work with colleagues in Northern Ireland to set that up in the future.  That will give some element to the co-ordination to which reference was made.<\/p><p>  As regards the emergency ambulance situation, I know that calls have been made across the Border to the North and the South for ambulance transfers in emergency situations.  There are developing links and good communication in many areas on that and the National Ambulance Service is anxious to improve on the links and will work to do that as much as it can.<\/p><p>  The aeromedical service has been very successful, as Deputy Feighan acknowledged.  It is being reviewed at the moment.  We hope to enable it to continue in the best way alongside the proposal that has emerged for a northern aeromedical service that will be complementary, exactly as has been described.  The discussions are at an early stage at this point.  The policy in the North was not to have an aeromedical service but the view on that has changed and we are working together to see whether we can have a joint aeromedical service to complement the service being established in the State as well.  That will be very positive, in particular for Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal.<\/p><p>  Again, in the north west we have heard about Altnagelvin but there are also proposals on the table for north west cardiology.  When Bill Maher, the CEO of the west north-west group, and his chair, Noel Daly, went to Altnagelvin to thank them for all the good work they did to assist when the flood took place in Letterkenny they raised the issue again.  While resources are very tight and it is very difficult to carve out resources to make progress in many of those areas at the moment, they are working with colleagues in Altnagelvin to see how that could be advanced as well.  There will be no change in any service in that area until it has been put in place and piloted and we can see what the results are on a broader front.  Again, that would apply to the group plans that have been put in place there too.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to congenital cardiac surgery and paediatric cardiology.  That has been worked on for a long time and there has been good co-operation.  Up to 29 cases involving children from Northern Ireland were treated last year in Crumlin hospital in Dublin.  They are working on a new service level agreement as an interim measure to deal with the service west.  An internationally-led expert assessment is to take place, which is due to finish at the end of June.  The assessment will describe the existing hospital services in both jurisdictions, outlining options for service configuration and governance arrangements.  The experts will report to both Ministers jointly and recommend an approach to an appropriate model that meets the population needs and other requirements in both jurisdictions.  We can expect a report from the internationally-led group, which is well supported in terms of the requirements it needs to bring the report forward.<\/p><p>  In addition, we have looked at the situation in Enniskillen.  We think there is great potential for cross-Border co-operation with that hospital.  There will be two-way traffic.  We are determined to try to ensure that two-way traffic takes place and that everybody gains the maximum from the situation.<\/p><p>  I will take back the ideas that were spoken about in terms of obesity services, the paediatric surgeon and other ideas.  I can feed them back into the system in terms of considering the strategic options and the group strategic plans that will be brought into play in the next few months.  That generally covers the issues.  I will come back if anyone wants me to follow up on any issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014020600011#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Charlie Hardy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391685900,"counter":662,"content":"<p>From listening to what we have heard today, is it not correct to say that two political drivers are needed; one in the North and one in the South to drive through the common sense issues raised by Alasdair McDonnell, MP?

A number of questions were raised about the EU directive so I will try to deal with them as quickly as I can.  There were also questions on cross-Border GP care, which also falls into my area.<\/p><p>  Deputy Conlan suggested that the directive is discriminatory.  The directive is European legislation not domestic legislation.  If it is discriminatory it is not because the State wants to have discriminatory legislation.  In my opening remarks I very briefly compared and contrasted the two routes, as I described them.  It is fair to say that the new route under the directive might not suit everyone because it involves one having to pay upfront and seek recruitment.  I take the point that it might not suit on every occasion but the other route still exists &ndash; where one does not have to pay upfront &ndash; albeit one is limited to availing of public facilities rather than private facilities.  There is good and bad in respect of each route.  One of the important roles the national contact point will play is to provide advice to people so that they can make decisions as to which route they wish to follow.<\/p><p>  Deputy Smith inquired about my commitment to the end of the first quarter.  The intention is that at the end of the first quarter we would have full implementation and that on or before the end of the first quarter the Minister would sign the commencement order and then we are in business.  There would not be a further lead-in period.  Hopefully, from the beginning of the next quarter we will be up and running legislatively.<\/p><p>  Deputy Smith also inquired about the number of member states.  To the best of our knowledge, as of the end of last year, only seven member states out of the total had transposed the directive.  That is no excuse for us not having done so but the fact of the matter is that only seven member states have so far transposed the directive.  Our understanding is that the UK transposed it at the very end of December.  Deputy Smith then asked a supplementary question on the position whereby some countries have transposed the directive and others have not.<\/p> <p>The position at present is that it is not open to residents here to avail of the directive and to go abroad because we do not have a system in place to enable them to be recouped.  However, for those countries that have transposed, it is open to their citizens to come here because their home member state will recoup them.  Consequently, until such time as we have transposed, it is not open to people here to avail of the provisions of the directive, unfortunately.  There have been a small number of inquiries to the HSE and the position has been explained to them.  Our understanding is that people are prepared to wait for the few weeks until the directive comes into operation.<\/p><p> Deputy Crowe kindly asked whether there was anything the joint committee could do and we are grateful for the offer.  The position is that through no fault of our own, there was pressure of business following on from the Presidency and so on and we had a backlog of legislative work.  Much of that backlog now has been cleared and while a number of issues are ongoing, this one is very much a priority.  We have engaged a legal draftsman to help us and the matter is very much in train.  As I stated, we hope to have the directive transposed by the end of the quarter.  Consequently, while we are grateful for the offer, I do not think any further assistance is required at this stage.<\/p><p> The Deputy also asked about differences between countries and I suppose an important point to make is that what I described this morning are two routes for people to avail of elective treatment abroad, whereas the Deputy's example pertained to an emergency situation.  Generally speaking, such emergency situations in the European Union are dealt with under what used to be known as the E111, and which now is known as the European Health Insurance Card, EHIC, which sits beside the two routes.  It is getting complicated now, in that there are two routes to avail of elective treatment abroad and then in addition, the EHIC is there to assist if one is on holidays or whatever abroad.  My colleague, Mr. Tom Monks, sits on a European grouping that oversees these various measures and it appears as though there can be difficulties in certain jurisdictions, Spain being one of them.  If the Deputy has a specific case in mind, we might be able to provide him with some assistance.<\/p><p> Senator Moran raised a specific case and while we are not familiar with the case in question, we would be happy to talk to the Senator about it.  One condition that applies at present is that a person going abroad under the current E112 arrangement must have sign-off by the Irish consultant.  I do not know whether that arose in this case but we can talk to the Senator about that.  Some questions in respect of GP out-of-hours services were raised by Deputy O'Reilly and Mr. McDonnell - I am unsure whether he has any other designation.  Our estimate is that in the case of approximately 65,000 people, their nearest GP out of hours is across the other side of the Border.  Consequently, a pilot project allowing patients in Inishowen to attend out-of-hours GP services in Derry came into operation as long ago as January 2007.  A second pilot project, allowing people resident in south County Armagh to obtain the service in Castleblayney, commenced in November 2007.  Since commencement and up to 31 December 2013, approximately 700 patients from Inishowen received services in Derry, which is an average of approximately eight per month, while 2,300 patients from south County Armagh received out-of-hours services in Castleblayney, which is an average of approximately 32 per month.  Both jurisdictions are involved in monitoring this on an ongoing basis.  There were proposals to extend the trial to cover Blacklion, County Cavan, and Pettigo, County Donegal, to assist people on the opposite sides of the Border.  Initial discussions took place with local GPs but there did not appear to be a great deal of interest.  However, if there is a particular interest in it, we would be happy to take this up again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014020600011#L01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Barron","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391686500,"counter":674,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Barron and I am conscious that Ms Gildernew wishes to make a brief contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014020600012#M00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391686500,"counter":675,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late and for missing the presentation.

I thank him again for the kind invitation to come before the committee today to comment on the role of the Commission for Victims and Survivors and our key priorities for the future.<br \/>I am grateful to the committee for affording me the opportunity to discuss a number of issues that directly affect the lives of victims and survivors.  Despite the passage of time, including some 15 years after the signing of the Agreement, there are many victims and survivors who continue to suffer from the devastating effects of the Troubles.<br \/>I express my pleasant surprise and gratitude to see members of Justice for the Forgotten, Ms Margaret Irwin and Ms Bernadette Joly, here today.  I acknowledge their tireless work.  They are an important reminder to us all of why we do what we do for victims and survivors.<br \/>As the Commissioner for Victims and Survivors in Northern Ireland, I believe passionately in the work of the commission to promote the rights of all victims and survivors to be heard, to be respected and to have access to services that are the best they can be.  Over the past year, there has been a significant amount of reflection and comment around the 15th anniversary of the signing of the Agreement.  Before providing the committee with an update on the work of the commission, it is worth briefly highlighting the commitments made to victims by the signatories to the Agreement.<br \/>The Agreement, as I am sure the committee will recall, states:<blockquote>It is recognised that victims have a right to remember as well as to contribute to a changed society.  The achievement of a peaceful and just society would be the true memorial to the victims of violence.<\/blockquote>Significantly, the Agreement goes on to state that &quot;The participants [to the negotiations] particularly recognise that young people from areas affected by the troubles face particular difficulties and will support the development of special community-based initiatives based on international best practice&quot;.<br \/>It is important to recall these commitments contained in the Agreement because they represent a formal recognition of the need to address effectively the needs of victims and survivors, including past and present generations.  I will return to the issues of trans-generational impact of the conflict later but it is important to set the work of the commission within the context of the commitments contained in the Agreement.<br \/>Our vision at the commission is to improve the lives of all victims and survivors.  What does a victims commissioner do?  My role is defined in statute but it is essentially to promote the interests of victims and survivors.  It is simple, except, of course, that it is not.  In Northern Ireland there are many things that are contested and the definition of &quot;victim&quot; is one of them.  The law, as it stands, is clear and states that a victim is someone who has been injured, someone who has been bereaved or someone caring for someone who has been injured.  The injury can be physical or psychological.  It would seem on the face of it to be straightforward.  There are many in Northern Ireland who believe there should be a distinction between victims, that there are innocent victims and that &quot;victim makers&quot; should not be included in the definition of victim, that those who set out to kill and maim with guns or bombs and are killed themselves or injured as a result should be afforded no assistance whatsoever.  Other commentators have said that this approach does not appear to allow for those who were killed as a result of state collusion, those who were killed or injured, for example, in the events of Bloody Sunday, or the Ballymurphy families.  Despite apologies from the Westminster Government, there seems to be little acknowledgment that these families and their loved ones were absolutely and completely innocent.  Positions become entrenched and no one hears the other opinion as their opinion is the right one.  It is as though, by the very act of listening honestly and carefully, there could be a contamination.  Maybe then what is really being talked about, it has been suggested, is a hierarchy of blame.  After 18 months in post, one thing I am certain of is that there must never be a hierarchy of pain.  I have heard said on many occasions that the tears of the victim's mother are the same colour as those of the mother of the man who set the bomb.  No one wins and everyone hurts.<br \/>I acknowledge the comments made by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, during his address to the British Irish Association in October last.  I was in the room that day and I was particularly struck by his insightful comments in recognising the responsibilities of us all in dealing with the complex and challenging issues related to our troubled past.<br \/>Since I took up post, I have spent time with many individuals who have direct experience of the Troubles and who live with those experiences and the difficulties they bring every day.  When asked about what my priorities are as commissioner, it is quite simple - to listen, to support, to advise, to care and to safeguard those who have been affected by our troubled past.  I have met people who have been bereaved, I have met those that have been injured, both physically and psychologically, and I have met people who are caring for a loved one who is bereaved or injured.<\/p> <p>Those affected have various needs and it is imperative that we all take responsibility for ensuring that we address them properly.  The needs vary.  Obviously people require adequate resources and treatment, support and help, access to social support and access to help to obtain the justice and truth they deserve, if that is what they want.  <br \/>The committee has asked that we brief it on the commission's priorities.  I would like to do this by initially taking it through the work of the Victims and Survivors Forum.  I will then highlight a number of key areas of work based on the commission's three key strategic priorities, namely, building for the future, dealing with the past and improving services for victims. <br \/>One of my primary duties as commissioner is to make arrangements for a forum for consultation and discussion for victims and survivors.  Strengthening the role and enhancing the profile and work of the Victims and Survivors Forum has been one of my priorities since coming into office.  The forum currently has 22 members, 19 of whom meet the definition of victim and are representative of the breadth of victim experience.  There are three associate members, who bring their unique experience to enrich the work of the forum.  It is important for me to reinforce the contribution made by forum members as volunteers who meet once a month, at a minimum, to inform the work of the commission.  The work of the forum increasingly underpins the work of the commission.  It has become a resource for the commission to discuss and identify live issues for victims and survivors across three working groups, which concern dealing with the past, services, and building for the future.<br \/>In the past year, the forum's working groups have continued to meet regularly, engaging with a range of academics, politicians and other key stakeholders to inform their work.  Examples of meetings include those with Lord Freud and Minister McCausland on welfare reform and the Attorney General to discuss the implications of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights for victims and survivors.  Importantly, last November, the forum met Dr. Richard Haass in addition to all of the political representatives that comprised the panel of parties to the Haass negotiations. <br \/>I will return briefly to the impact of the forum in informing the work of the commission but at this point I must emphasise the significant and positive impact of the forum on victim and survivor issues.  In my opening remarks, I noted the commitment to victims and survivors contained in the Agreement.  In the years following the Agreement, it was lauded internationally for aligning the process of political transition with the recognition of the rights of children and young people, including those affected by the trans-generational impact of the conflict.  Developing our understanding and responding effectively to the negative impact of the conflict's legacy on the lives of young people in Northern Ireland is a primary area of concern for the commission. <br \/>Fifteen years after the Agreement and 20 years since the ceasefires, it is certainly an appropriate time to reflect on the continuing impact of the conflict's legacy on victims and survivors.  Throughout the Troubles, young people suffered disproportionately in terms of the number killed and generations of young people who have been left to cope with carrying a significant burden due to exposure to conflict-related violence. <br \/>We will be undertaking a number of research projects, including one in partnership with the University of Ulster.  The Better Future project will include an examination of the relationship between the impact of the conflict's legacy on the social, economic, and political life of Northern Ireland and the extent to which these factors affect children and young people's mental health and social well-being.<br \/>Let me turn to dealing with the past.  A question I have often been asked since taking up the post as a single commissioner is how I tread a course through the diversity of opinion and the widely varying while promoting the interest of all victims and survivors.  The question has certainly not become any easier to answer 18 months into my post.  Without doubt, one of the most challenging areas for the commission, if not the most challenging, is dealing with the past.  As members will know, dealing with the legacy of the past and issues relating to truth, justice and acknowledgement remain contentious and divisive across society in Northern Ireland.<br \/>From a victims' and survivors' perspective, it is important to remember first of all that victims are not a homogenous group and do not speak with one voice.  Different people want different outcomes.  The forum is a very good example of where people from a range of backgrounds have come together to share and understand one another's perspectives.  While they might not agree with one another, they have come to respect that different people have different world-views.<br \/>Despite the disagreement among local political parties relating to the proposed agreement document that emerged from the Haass process, it does provide an important message.  The document states:<blockquote>We can [&hellip;] all agree that the past has consequences for individual victims and society that continue through the present.  We must meet the challenges posed by the past and work to ensure that they do not overwhelm the present or undermine the future.<\/blockquote>In the past year, the forum's dealing-with-the-past working group has been engaged in important work that is facing head-on the challenges posed by our contentious past.  While there remain understandable differences of opinion among forum members on difficult issues, including the definition, which I note was an issue that the main political parties could not resolve during the Haass process, there is strong collective resolve among all forum members to ensure that &ldquo;the past must never happen again&rdquo;. <br \/>A key theme contained in the Haass document that I certainly welcome is the need to address effectively and comprehensively the needs of victims and survivors.  In particular, I welcome the premium placed on the learning and inspiration that can be derived from the lived experience of victims and survivors.  I consider myself very privileged to hear and learn from the often-pained but inspirational voices of many victims and survivors that I have met as commissioner.  I was heartened by the commitment to ensuring that victims and survivors have timely access to high-quality mental health services that focus on the often-complex psychological needs of individuals and families affected by the Troubles.<br \/>As the main political parties continue to deliberate over the content of the Haass proposals, the commission will be hosting a conference on dealing with the past later this month in Belfast.  Working in partnership with Queens University, the University of Ulster and Healing Through Remembering, the conference will provide a timely opportunity for all stakeholders, including the wider victims and survivors community, to discuss a number of the unresolved issues linked to the past and for the commission to hear the views of all victims and survivors.<br \/>As commissioner, one of my primary statutory duties is to review continually the adequacy and effectiveness of the treatments and services accessed by victims and survivors.  I regularly make the point that given the unimaginable emotional turmoil experienced by many victims and survivors before and after the Agreement, they deserve to have access to gold-standard treatment and care from whatever sector or wherever it is provided.<br \/>With the inception of the Victims and Survivors Service in 2012, the commission continues to review the operation of the organisation to ensure it delivers a service and care of a high standard to victims and survivors.  In exercising my statutory duty and owing to a series of critical issues, I have recently been invited by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to commission an independent assessment of the Victims and Survivors Service.  The assessment, which will be completed in the next two weeks, will focus on the service's corporate governance and management, the individual needs review process, the broader policy framework and wider issues relating to service delivery.  Once again, the forum has performed an important role in representing the breadth of experience of victims accessing the service.<br \/>Important work in which the commission is currently engaged relates to an independent study to examine the viability of implementing a pension for victims and survivors who were severely injured during the Troubles.  The rationale for such a pension is aimed at improving the position of those individuals who not only lost the ability to work following their injury but who also lost the ability to accrue any occupational rights as a result of their having lost their career prospects to chronic ill health.<\/p> <p>The final report will be presented to the commission in March 2014 and, based on the findings and recommendations, I will then provide advice for Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister on the next steps in progressing this important project on behalf of the severely injured.  In the year ahead my focus will be on collaborating with the forum, engaging with the wider community of victims and commissioning research to provide an evidence base to inform my advice to the Government, with advice on how to deal with the past, build for the future and provide services from a victims' perspective.<\/p><p> I respectfully request this committee to encourage others in considering urgently the Haass proposals and, specifically, those proposals for dealing with the past and victims.  Prior to the Haass discussions and throughout the process, politicians committed sincerely to supporting victims and making their needs paramount in the discussions.  I ask committee members to urge their colleagues not to lose their momentum or forget the victims.  <\/p><p> I thank the committee for listening to my presentation.  My colleague, Mr. John Beggs, and I are happy to take members' questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014020600013#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathryn Stone","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391688300,"counter":689,"content":"<p>Will Ms Stone indicate a date for the conference?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014020600015#P00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391688300,"counter":690,"content":"<p>It is to be held on 25 February.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2014020600015#P00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathryn Stone"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391688300,"counter":691,"content":"<p>I am sure members will have suggestions and feedback on the Haass discussions.

I thank Ms Stone and her team for the tremendous work they have done.  We should record the value of that work to the people and the even-handed way in which they approached victims, irrespective of from where they or the victim makers came.  I endorse the comments on the Haass discussions.  Having been involved in the negotiations, we made considerable achievements on behalf of the victims and it is a tragedy that the negotiations were not concluded.  We are, however, still working on these issues.  On Monday and Tuesday I was engaged in lengthy meetings.  I want to see a conclusion and, if there is one priority in driving the effort to reach a conclusion, it is the needs of victims and survivors.  I agree that victims need a conclusion and that the Haass process must provide a way of supporting victims and survivors.

All of the victims are getting older and a cohort are now elderly.  As time passes, it will become increasingly difficult to provide them with adequate services.  Is the issue of providing adequate services for those in older age groups, in particular, being treated with the urgency it deserves?  <\/p><p>  I wish Ms Stone well in her work in this difficult area.

The Justice for the Forgotten group discussed it recently with this committee.  Does Ms Stone agree that the issue informs many of the current political positions in the North?  The committee had a lengthy discussion on the Haass report.  Does she think the recommendation made in the report on victims and survivors can be a template for making progress in this area and would she add anything to it?

How important is the fact that we find it difficult to deal with the past?  Some say it is time to move on and forget about it, that there is no point in going over old hurts and wrongs.  Will dealing with the past be one of the recommendations Ms Stone considers?  In the past couple of weeks there was a reconciliation event in the Skainos centre in east Belfast, which this committee has visited on a number of occasions.  The Skainos centre is the tent; it is supposed to be safe, a shared space to which people can come.  For example, Mr. Pat Magee, who served time for the Brighton bombing, and Ms Jo Berry, whose father was killed in that bombing, met in it.  They talked about the story of their relationship, how they had got to meet each other and how this had or had not helped with their difficulties in dealing with the past.  People and members of the PSNI were attacked outside.  How important is it for victims to deal with the issue of reconciliation?  How important is it to have this shared space in which people can come together?  Different groups have come together, including ex-combatants or people who have been hurt by the Troubles.  Is there any way the victims' commissioner can facilitate the likes of this happening?  Ms Stone has said there is no agreement on the definition of \"victim\" among victims or political parties.  There is no victims' commission in this jurisdiction.  There is very little funding for it.  Is that a weakness in the system and is there a need for some such structure?<\/p><p> Justice for the Forgotten was mentioned.  Representatives of that organisation came here and said funding was one difficulty.  There is an anomaly in that it could obtain funding in the North but not in Dublin.  Does Ms Stone have recommendations for the two Governments in that regard?  Will she examine this issue as part of her submission?  Justice for the Forgotten is going to the Historical Enquiries Team, HET, which is questionable.  It is also going to the Police Ombudsman's office to talk about pursuing investigations that the RUC was supposed to have performed in the past and its actions or inaction.

She met Sir Kenneth Bloomfield a number of years ago and feels that during the years her needs have not been met.  I am hoping there is a more positive outlook on victims.  Many are deeply insulted by the suggestion but some of our supposedly more sensible elected representatives have talked about a legacy of victims.

Mr. Peter McBride from the Northern Ireland Association for Mental Health, NIAMH, appeared before this committee last year.  He is investigating how mental health and counselling services can be accessed.  My constituency is Fermanagh-South Tyrone.  In rural areas it can be very difficult to access counselling when one needs it.  I would like Ms Stone's thoughts on this issue and how we can progress it to provide support for those who need it.

It is very important work.  The lack of access to mental health services in rural areas, an issue raised by Ms Gildernew , must be addressed at a fundamental level by the Government and it must be done immediately.

There were no physical consequences or bereavement, but the family has had this hanging over them for the best part of 40 years and probably longer.

When I accepted this role, I did not imagine that I would spend every day - it really is almost every day - meeting people who had been broken by what happened to them during the Troubles.  They have been described as being shrunken by sorrow.  Many members can recall or know people who have been physically shrunken by their experiences.<\/p><p>  There is no doubt that acute and chronic mental health services are of paramount importance.  Ms Gildernew, MP, bravely described her experience of being diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, some considerable time after the conflict.  One conclusion in a piece of research by the commission, a report entitled Troubled Consequences that is available on our website, is that it is a common thing for people to be diagnosed with PTSD and related mental health conditions as many as 20 years after the end of a period of conflict or events causing conflict.  These are difficult experiences for people and inform the requirement to plan services carefully to respond to individuals' needs.  I have often been reminded that these services must not just be located in city centres.  Many people who live in rural areas, particularly along the Border, are profoundly affected in terms of their mental health, their emotional well being and their ability to create and sustain relationships with partners and their children.  The transgenerational impact of these mental health conditions is also prevalent and is something on which we must act quickly.  During the health presentation, it was mentioned that the population was getting older.  Demography is against us.  We must work to ensure that people have support.<\/p><p>  We must also work quickly to ensure that those who are getting older have access to truth and justice that will help them in their later years.  Frequently, I meet people who burn with the frustration of not knowing what happened to their loved ones and of not having the justice that everyone agrees they deserve.<\/p><p>  I will address some of the points raised at this meeting.  It is important to acknowledge that the review of the Victims and Survivors Service, VSS, has seen buy-in.  The service's new board of directors has welcomed the independent assessment of the service and is looking forward to the report, as that will give the board a framework on which to improve and build on the service's foundation.  It is not fair to say that the services being provided are inadequate.  We must remember that many groups and voluntary organisations have been in existence, often for decades - Ms Margaret Urwin and Ms Bernadette Joly are examples of that - and provide not only emotional support but also practical support and advocacy throughout a justice process, however that might be defined.<\/p><p>  I will try to explain how I came to be commissioner, where the commission sits into the Sir Kenneth Bloomfield report and what happened after that.  He wrote a report, entitled We Will Remember Them, which was published in 1998.  My understanding is that, afterwards, there was a hiatus followed by the appointment of a sole commissioner, Ms Bertha McDougall.  It was quickly acknowledged that there needed to be other commissioners representative of different backgrounds.  There was a period during which there were four commissioners, one of whom, Mr. Mike Nesbitt, left to follow a political career.  When the terms of office of the remaining three commissioners ended I was recruited as a single commissioner.<\/p><p>  In his report, Sir Kenneth Bloomfield described the role of a victims commissioner as a painful privilege.  As I took up my post, I had no idea what he had meant by that.  Eighteen months later, I understand exactly what he meant.  My role is, indeed, a painful privilege.  My work with victims and survivors inspires me and my team every day to ensure that victims get not only what we expect them to have, but also the services that they deserve.<\/p><p>  Some time ago after a difficult and challenging meeting, one of the members of our victims forum sent me an e-mail thanking me for giving her a voice.  I hope that by presenting to this committee, we have been able to give victims of the Troubles a voice and that members have understood what some of their primary concerns are.

Ireland has been a global leader in the fight against tobacco since implementing a ban on smoking in the workplace in 2004.  As such, it is crucial that Ireland continues to lead the way by legislating for cigarette packaging that is plain and contains appropriate health warnings.<\/p><p>  Tobacco is unlike any other product on the market.  It is the only legal consumer product that kills when used as intended by the manufacturer.  Half of all smokers will die from a tobacco-related disease and not only are 90% of lung cancers caused by tobacco but it is also a contributory factor in 30% of all cancers.  A quarter of deaths from coronary heart disease and 11% of all stroke deaths are attributable to smoking, and smokers are two to three times more likely to suffer a heart attack compared to non-smokers.  It is also a risk factor for asthma in children.  Tobacco is one of the leading preventable risk factors for non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, lung disease and diabetes.<\/p><p>  The overall prevalence of smoking is declining but in 2012, some 22% of the population still smoked.  Smoking is an addiction that begins in adolescence and according to a survey commissioned by the office of tobacco control, 78% of smokers started smoking before they reached the age of 18, and 53% started before they reached the age of 15.  In 2010, some 7.9% of children aged ten to 17 reported smoking cigarettes every week.  However, the percentage of children in that age group who report never smoking has increased from 50.8% in 1998 to 73.5% in 2010.<\/p><p>  This new Bill provides the opportunity to capitalise on these developments further by reducing the attractiveness and appeal of tobacco products to children.  The Irish Medical Organisation has long championed efforts to reduce the number of smokers in Ireland, and at our last annual general meeting we passed a motion supporting the Minister for Health&rsquo;s planned introduction of standardised packaging for tobacco products.  As such, the IMO welcomes the tobacco-free Ireland policy and the proposed Bill.<\/p><p>  However, the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill only calls for 65% of the package to be covered with a health warning, which is the minimum required by the forthcoming EU tobacco products directive.  The IMO believes this does not go far enough and advocates for 75% coverage by health warnings in order to protect the well-being of Irish citizens.  There is a growing body of evidence on the effectiveness of graphic warnings.  For example, a Canadian research paper, which surveyed individuals over a ten-year period, found that graphic warnings had a statistically significant effect on smoking prevalence and quit attempts.  In particular, the warnings decreased the odds of being a smoker and increased the odds of somebody making an attempt to quit being a smoker.  Cancer Research UK reports that all quantitative studies found standard packs less attractive than branded equivalents to both adults and children.  Furthermore, a major piece of research by Cancer Research UK and the University of Stirling indicates:<blockquote>...branded packaging presented positive user imagery and functional and emotional benefits to young people.  Conversely, plain cigarette packaging was perceived as unattractive, reduced emotional attachment to the packaging and enforced negative smoking attitudes among young people.<\/blockquote>  Evidence is already available that plain packaging works.  In Australia, the introduction of plain packaging for cigarettes spurred a 78% increase in calls to the quitting helpline, according to a new study by the Cancer Institute of New South Wales.  Smokers are more likely to consider giving up and they are also more likely to think the quality of their cigarettes has diminished with plain packaging.  Research also shows that when young people look at plain cigarette packs, they believe the product is used by people who are less stylish and sociable, and not as attractive to mimic as alternative packaging.<\/p><p>  An often cited point by big tobacco companies is that plain packaging will increase illicit trade but a report conducted by Cancer Research UK in 2012 on smuggling and the tobacco industry found that there was no evidence that plain packs increase smuggling or illegal trade in cigarettes.  On the smuggling issue, the IMO congratulates the Government on signing the protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products, and this treaty will, we hope, help mitigate the illicit trade of tobacco products globally.  These companies try to influence policy for the sole purpose of increasing their profits to the detriment of public health.  The IMO is also calling on the Government to place a &quot;polluter pays&quot; type of levy on tobacco manufacturers so they can make a contribution to the health care costs of tobacco use.<\/p><p>  The IMO believes that Ireland needs to continue to be a front runner in the fight against tobacco.  As such, introducing plain packaging with appropriately sized graphic health warnings would be a crucial investment in the long-term health of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matthew Sadlier"},{"type":"speech","time":1391679000,"counter":716,"content":"<p>Dr. Anthony O'Regan, the chief executive of the Irish Thoracic Society, may now give his opening address.

Over 5,200 people die in Ireland each year from tobacco-related disease.  The Irish Thoracic Society represents respiratory health care professionals throughout Ireland and our members include physicians, thoracic surgeons, clinical nurse specialists, scientists and physiotherapists.  Every day of our working lives our members meet patients who are seriously ill and dying because of tobacco, and this includes smokers and ex-smokers, as well as non-smokers who have been exposed to high levels of tobacco smoke in their home or work environment.  Lung conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, and lung cancer are painful, debilitating and often fatal.  They are also preventable, and the most powerful form of prevention is ensuring that young people never light up their first cigarette.  That is why this legislation is so important, as it represents a major step towards the Government&rsquo;s vision of a tobacco-free Ireland by 2025, builds on previous initiatives and will put Ireland to the forefront of global health protection<\/p><p>  One area of focus is tobacco's relationship to lung disease in Ireland.  This legislation is vital for respiratory health in Ireland, as we have high rates of lung disease compared to the European average.<\/p> <p>In Ireland lung disease accounts for 20% of all deaths, it is the third most common reason for acute hospital admission, and is the most common reason to visit a GP. <\/p><p> Smoking is the major preventable cause of respiratory illness.  Lung disease accounts for over 60% of the 5,200 deaths from smoking annually in this country.  Specifically each year in Ireland 1,500 people die from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, giving us one of the highest death rates for the disease in Europe, and 1,700 people die from lung cancer.  Smoking causes over 85% of these diseases.  Smoking has also been shown to exacerbate many other lung diseases including asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis and even tuberculosis.  Taken with its role in non-respiratory diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, other cancers, and osteoporosis, tobacco kills one out of every two smokers. <\/p><p> Tobacco use is among the biggest causes of health inequalities.  Smoking rates are higher in disadvantaged groups and communities and this is where the burden of tobacco related disease is highest.  Tobacco accounts for up to half the difference in life expectancy between the richest and the poorest groups in our society.  Not surprisingly these differences are strikingly reflected in the prevalence and outcomes of respiratory disease.  For instance, the mortality rates for lung cancer and COPD are over two-fold higher in the lower socio-economic classes.<\/p><p> Another significant trend is the increasing prevalence of smoking related lung disease in women.  It is apparent from the 1970s onwards that the tobacco industry targeted advertising at women.  The fallout from increased smoking in women is now apparent.  In COPD there is a convergence of deaths and hospital inpatient discharges for men and women that mirrors the trends in female smoking rates.  In lung cancer there is a 0.5% increase in female mortality each year and lung cancer is now the main cause of cancer death in women outnumbering breast cancer deaths by 6%.  Lung cancer incidence and mortality in Irish women is amongst the highest in Europe.  <\/p><p> Smoking causes damage to the lungs long before it results in clinically symptomatic disease.  Although the majority of people diagnosed with smoking-related lung conditions are of middle or older age, most will have started smoking in adolescence or early adulthood.  In fact, 80% of smokers start and become addicted before the age of 18.  This illustrates the importance of early interventions to reduce smoking rates among our teenagers and young adults to ensure healthier life expectancy for our population into the future. <\/p><p> We know that legislation works.  Over the past decade Ireland has made great strides in the denormalisation of smoking thanks to the workplace ban, the ban on advertising and on point of sale display.  The success of these initiatives is best illustrated by the reduction in smoking in both children - from 21% in 1998 down to 12% in 2010 - and in adults - from 31% in 1998 down to 24% in 2010.  We must continue on this path and indeed accelerate our efforts to ensure that today's generation of children and teenagers do not become tomorrow's COPD and lung cancer patients.   The introduction of standardised packaging together with graphic images represents a significant step in achieving this goal.  <\/p><p> It is clear that marketing works.  It has worked on behalf of the tobacco industry to the detriment of the lives of hundreds of thousands of Irish men and women throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century.  We now have an opportunity to remove the last vestige of marketing power that the tobacco industry holds and we must grab it with both hands.<\/p><p> Australia introduced standardised packaging one year ago.  While it will take time to fully measure the effects of the policy, preliminary evidence shows that compared with smokers who are still using branded packs, the plain pack smokers are over 66% more likely to think their cigarettes are of poorer quality and less satisfying, and 81% more likely to think about quitting on a daily basis.  Plain packaging has also been shown to reduce pack and product appeal; increase the impact of health warnings; and to reduce confusion about product harm that can result from branded packs.  Most importantly, research indicates that standardised packaging will reduce the appeal of tobacco products to young people who are the primary target for tobacco industry marketing.  The campaign in Australia waged by the tobacco industry challenging this policy is clear evidence of the perceived impact of branding on target populations by these companies.<\/p><p> The Irish Thoracic Society would like to commend the Government on its commitment to the introduction of standardised packaging and to all parties for their support of the policy.  This again places Ireland as a leader in the global battle to protect public health from the effects of tobacco.  In particular, it puts Ireland to the forefront in the implementation of our legal obligations under the UN treaty &ndash; the World Health Organization&rsquo;s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.  By setting an example to other European countries the benefits of the legislation will not be confined to our shores alone.  In order to ensure that this and future generations of Irish children, particularly those from underprivileged areas, can look forward to long healthy lives free of tobacco-related illness, we urge the speedy adoption of this legislation by the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600003#C00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anthony O'Regan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391679600,"counter":719,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. O'Regan.

The Institute of Public Health in Ireland is an all-island body established to achieve greater co-operation for public health on the island.  Tackling health inequalities, a situation where the poorest people experience the poorest health and better off people experience better health, is a core theme in all of our work.  Higher smoking prevalence and tobacco-related harm among the most disadvantaged in society means the Bill is of particular importance to us.  The IPH was pleased to forward a written response in advance and our oral presentation will present key issues from the wider paper.<\/p><p>  The IPH strongly supports the introduction of standardised packaging under the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2013.  We have carried out extensive work on tobacco and our latest publication, along with the Tobacco Free Research Institute, is entitled A Tobacco-Free Future &ndash; an all island report on tobacco, inequalities and childhood 2013 clearly laid out the data on tobacco and childhood, including the legacy of smoking and pregnancy.<\/p><p>  The introduction of the Bill is necessary to support Ireland&rsquo;s goal of being tobacco free by 2025.  It is an important stepping stone for our children on the road to a tobacco-free future.  Smoking is a major public health issue with around 1 million people in Ireland smoking at present resulting in a cost of between 6% to 15% of the total health budget being spent on tobacco-related disease. <\/p><p>  The institute's key message is that tobacco control works.  A trend of lower uptake of smoking among young people in Ireland is consistent from 1998 to 2010.   It is the direct result of a stepwise introduction of tobacco control measures that have succeeded in reducing the appeal and accessibility of smoking to young people.  These measures have included the banning of advertising, removal of point of sale display and the introduction of smoke-free environments in workplaces and public spaces that &quot;denormalises&quot; smoking for all in society.  International evidence shows that the more comprehensive the basket of tobacco control measures adopted the better the results.  Therefore, standardised packaging is a logical progression for policy in Ireland. <\/p><p>  Our next key message is that standardised packaging works.  Systematic reviews, that covered 37 studies screened from 4,518 citations addressing the evidence on standardised packaging, concluded that there are strong grounds for believing that current packaging glamorises smoking and that tobacco products packaged in a standardised colour, typeface and form will improve the effectiveness and salience of health warnings, reduce the misconception of relative harmfulness of various brands, be they lights or natural, and will reduce the overall appeal of smoking. <\/p><p>  This week a study, published in the <i>Medical Journal of Australia<\/i>, again reported a 78% increase in calls to a quitline that was associated with the introduction of standardised packs.  The effect of this has been very sustained.  We believe that reducing the appeal of tobacco to young people is essential and studies have found that plain packaging was considered a deterrent, particularly by younger respondents.  It projects a less desirable smoker identity and further &quot;denormalises&quot; tobacco as a regular consumer product.<\/p><p>  We view the development as an evidence-based, logical, cost-effective and necessary response to the tobacco epidemic in Ireland.  The World Health Organization has estimated that 20% of all mortality among males and 16% of all mortality among females in Ireland is attributable to tobacco.  The current burden of tobacco-related disease, disability and death on this island is unacceptable.  There is no age group, social group and family in the State that has been untouched by the loss of a loved one or friend through tobacco-related disease. <\/p><p>  Over the past decade Ireland has been successful in improving life expectancy.  Many more people can now look forward to living into their 80s and beyond.  However, the gift comes with a responsibility to ensure that those extra years are spent in good health and as free of disability as possible.  Successful tobacco control is an imperative if the health system is to meet the challenge of rising chronic disease and disability into the future.  Reducing smoking is necessary as a means to end human suffering firstly.  It is also necessary to contribute directly to a better population health - a cornerstone of human capital and a driver of economic prosperity and growth. <\/p><p>  To be really successful in the most cost-effective way possible, tobacco control must extend beyond the use of health education and smoking cessation approaches.  It must include evidence-based approaches to reduce the appeal and accessibility of tobacco products to young people and to &quot;denormalise&quot; smoking in society.<\/p><p>  The development of the Bill is in line with our current tobacco control policy and Ireland&rsquo;s commitments as a signatory to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.  The move towards standardised packaging of tobacco is now beginning to gain momentum across Europe and globally.  In the UK in 2012 a consultation on standardised packaging showed consistent and strong support for standardised packaging by all parties with a declared interest in health.<\/p> <p>As an all-island body, we welcome a harmonised, evidence-based approach to tobacco on this island.  In this regard, we note the passing of a legislative consent motion in Northern Ireland this week, whereby the Northern Ireland Assembly agreed that Northern Ireland could be included in amendments to the UK Children and Families Bill, which includes standardised packaging.  This is a step in the right direction.<\/p><p> Committee members' support for this Bill, which represents a significant and necessary step forward for tobacco control nationally and internationally, will help to retain Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a world leader in tobacco control.  The measure will contribute to the goals of the public health policy, Healthy Ireland- A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing, to increase the proportion of people who are healthy at all stages of their life, to reduce health inequalities and to protect the public from threats to health and well-being.  I thank the committee for its attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600004#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Helen McAvoy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391680200,"counter":722,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. Patrick Doorley, the faculty of public health medicine spokesperson on tobacco from the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600005#E00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391680200,"counter":723,"content":"<p>Tobacco is a lethal, addictive drug.  It is the most deadly consumer product ever marketed and it kills when it is used exactly as it is supposed to be used.  One out of every two people who smoke long-term will die from tobacco.  Tobacco kills 5,200 people in the country.<\/p><p>  About three quarters of people who end up smoking have started as children.  About the same proportion wish they had never started smoking.  About the same proportion would like to quit smoking even if they feel they cannot do so right now.  We need proportionate measures to tackle the scourge.  It is one of the strong policy measures the faculty of public health medicine feels is badly needed.<\/p><p>  Smoking prevalence in this country has declined from 29% in 2003 to 21% in 2012.  Children's smoking rates have declined from 22% in 1998 to about 12%.  The decline can be attributed to three strong policy measures.  One is the tobacco taxation policy, which affects children disproportionately, the second is the ban on sales of tobacco in packets of less than 20, and the third is the removal of advertising at the point of sale.  The point of it is that strong policy measures work.  Government policy measures are among the strongest interventions we have to tackle tobacco addiction.  In terms of the economics of tobacco, one of my former colleagues in the HSE has calculated that it costs hospital services alone &euro;300 million per year.  The cost to the entire health service is approximately &euro;500 million.  This has a huge impact on hospital beds.  Government policy aims to reduce smoking prevalence from its current rate, 22%, to 5% by 2025.  That is an extremely ambitious target that the faculty supports.  It will require a rate of progress much more rapid than we have been achieving to date.<\/p><p>  I refer to two systematic reviews of the evidence on plain packaging.  I am talking about groups of experts who looked at high quality work.  There is a lot of work that is not of a sufficiently high standard to be included in the review.  The first review is mentioned by Dr. McAvoy and includes 37 studies conducted in different countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK, among men, women and children.  The thrust of the studies goes in the same direction.  The findings are that there is strong evidence to support the proposition relating to the role of plain packaging in helping to reduce smoking rates, that is, that plain packaging would reduce the attractiveness and appeal of tobacco products, would increase the noticeability and effectiveness of health warnings and messages, which is important because they are effective, and would reduce the use of design techniques that may mislead consumers about the harmfulness of tobacco products.  In addition, the studies in the review show that plain packaging is perceived by both smokers and non-smokers to reduce initiation among smokers.  One year later, the experts looked at the literature again and picked up another 17 studies that had been published after the initial review.  The results were exactly the same.<\/p><p>  That is the thrust of peer-reviewed research on plain packaging and its impact.  It has a greater impact on children than adults in respect of initiation among children.  That is very important.  That is why the faculty of public health medicine strongly supports the measure.  We have a few specific comments on the Bill.  The packaging policy should take into account the possibility that variant descriptors, such as menthol and light, can mislead smokers into making inappropriate product attributions.  The colour of the brand text, business or company name or variant name is not specified in the Bill and this is to be prescribed in the regulations.  We recommend that the findings detailed in the reviews I mentioned relating to colour and perception should inform these regulations..  The size and the dimensions of the packs should be specified in the Bill.  Members may be aware that some packs are shaped like lipstick containers and these are attractive to young females and probably also to young children.  The faculty of public health medicine welcomes the measure and, coming as it does in the context of recent policies in recent years, it brings us one step closer to the day when children in this country can grow up tobacco free.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600005#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Doorley"},{"type":"speech","time":1391680200,"counter":724,"content":"<p>Our next speaker is Dr. Finbarr O'Connell, consultant respiratory physician at St. James's Hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600005#E00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391680200,"counter":725,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the members for the invitation to speak to the committee.  I work in St James's Hospital and I run a large lung cancer practice so I see the real patients who suffer from the worst disease that smoking causes.  Dr. O'Regan has outlined some of these points.  Dr. Sadlier said that 90% of lung cancer is caused by smoking.  In this country, it is 95% and that is not a big difference but it means that practically all lung cancer in this country is caused by it.  We re-audit the figure year on year and in our lung cancer practice it is 95% of people.  We have very few incidences of non-smoking lung cancer.  Lung cancer could essentially disappear as a disease if long-term we were tobacco free as a country.  That must be the goal.<\/p><p>  Smoking also causes or contributes to many other cancers.  Dr Sadlier said that 30% of all cancers are caused by smoking.  That is approximately right, and the others include upper airway cancer of the nose, lips, throat, mouth and larynx, oesophageal cancer, stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, cervical cancer and bone marrow and blood cancers.  All these, which are most cancers, have a contribution from smoking.  Smoking probably directly causes 30% of all cancers.  Dr O'Regan referred to other chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, COPD.  Given that fewer than one in five people smoke, somewhere between one in four and one in five of those people will develop a COPD.  That means that one in 20 people can develop a severe chronic disabling respiratory disease, ultimately ending up on long-term oxygen treatment and unable to breathe, at huge expense to the health sector and at a cost of terrible disability to themselves.  It is a dreadful disease that is sometimes in the background but should be to the fore in this discussion.  The other diseases caused by smoking are ischaemic heart disease, coronary artery disease, angina, heart attacks, cerebro-vascular disease or stroke, peripheral vascular disease, adverse effects in pregnancy and childbirth such as increased rates of pre-term delivery, increased rates of stillbirth and low birth weights.  It will also lead to reduced potency and fertility in men, osteoporosis or thinning of the bones, dental and gum disease, cataracts and poor control of diabetes.  These are not rare diseases but are diseases that people get, suffer and die from.  Tobacco plays a role in most of these diseases.  It plays a large role in those I mentioned first.<\/p><p>  Quitting smoking reduces all the risks of the above diseases.  That has been shown.  Previous speakers referred to the long-term aim being the denormalisation of smoking.  It is the greatest single preventable cause of death and illness in Ireland and worldwide.  Perhaps 6 million deaths per year worldwide, or 7,000 Irish deaths per year, are directly caused by smoking.  These are shocking numbers when we reflect on them.<\/p> <p>Any legislation or measures which assist in de-normalising smoking must be supported.  It is about a change in culture.  Undoubtedly there has been a tangible change in culture in this country with regard to smoking.  It is very real, it has momentum and this legislation will support that further.  <\/p><p> I am not an expert on packaging but my understanding is that attractive packaging encourages young people to take up smoking.  Preventing younger people from starting to smoke is essential and will allow the medium-term aim of Ireland becoming a tobacco-free country to be realised.  The Irish body politic has shown global leadership in the area of anti-smoking legislation and must be congratulated for that.  This Bill represents an important further step on the road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600005#E00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Finbarr O'Connell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391680800,"counter":727,"content":"<p>Thank you Dr. O'Connell.

I represent the Tobacco-Free Research Institute, whose aim is to investigate and support the development of a tobacco-free society by engaging in research on all aspects of tobacco from a public health perspective.  The institute was set up by the Department of Health and Children in 2002.  At present, I am the director general of the institute and am also a respiratory physician.  Like my colleagues, I have spent most of my clinical life treating patients with smoking-induced lung diseases.  I am almost exclusively involved in research at present so most of my presentation will be about the research aspects of tobacco control.<\/p><p>  The institute has been seminally involved in the evaluation of the smoke-free laws that were passed earlier and is also involved in a number of EU-funded projects examining price and taxation.  I have prepared some data on the ill-effects of smoking but the committee has already heard much of it from previous speakers so I will not rehearse it in great detail.  However, I feel it is justified to restate that tobacco causes heart disease, cancers, stroke and numerous respiratory diseases, including asthma, COPD, lung cancer and respiratory infections, including tuberculosis.  Smoking has an effect on children in the womb and in childhood.  It is responsible for many of the complications of pregnancy and remarkably, sudden infant death syndrome.  In young children, it causes ear and other infections and neuro-biological retardation.  We all know the damaging health effects of tobacco and it is difficult to understand how we tolerate them.  <\/p><p>  In terms of our research, I particularly want to mention the issue of illicit trade.  The committee may hear from the tobacco industry that this legislation will increase illicit trade in tobacco.  If the industry is really against illicit trade, it should sign up to the WHO protocol on illicit trade.  That would show the industry's real intent.  We have examined in great detail the illicit trade in tobacco in Ireland and all over Europe and our results are very different to the data put forward by the industry.  In our study, for example, we found that 4% of packs were identified as illicit and roughly 10% as non-domestic duty-paid, giving a total of 14.9%, but the figure in the KPMG report for the industry is 20%.  I would caution the committee that when it is presented with figures on illicit trade, it is important to check that the methodology used to estimate those figures is given.  For obvious reasons, it is very difficult to measure illicit trade accurately but there are validated methods and we have used these.  We have also declared our methods but the methodology is redacted from the aforementioned KPMG report.  I would urge the committee not to accept figures on illicit trade which do not include full details on the methodology used and which are not peer-reviewed.  It is no good just bandying about figures on something which is so hard to accurately measure.<\/p><p>  In the context of this law, we must ask what else works in terms of tobacco control.  We have heard from many of the previous speakers regarding price, banning advertising of tobacco and restricting its sale to children all work.  Smoke-free registration also works, as does regulating the packaging and labelling of tobacco products.  The use of mass media to promote a life free from tobacco and smoking cessation services are also effective.  All of these are both effective and cost-effective and they need the support of this committee.  It has also been found that what works for adults also works for children.  This is probably because children want to be adults.  Schemes focused directly on children are not always very effective.<\/p><p>  However, in international studies, price is the most important measure in tobacco control.  We have studied the role of different strategies in Ireland, using what is called the SimSmoke model, and have shown that in Ireland too, price has been the most successful tool in reducing the prevalence of smoking from 34% in 1998 to 26% in 2010, representing a 22% relative reduction.  However, the committee should note that the same rate of progress, which was very good, will not get us to 5% in 2025.  Better and more interventions are necessary in that regard.  <\/p><p>  Regarding the evidence for plain packaging, it has been rehearsed already and I will not go into the detail again.  However, I will reiterate the point that plainly packaged tobacco products are perceived as less attractive, of poorer quality and taste and, more importantly from the perspective of children, less cool and sophisticated.  Plain packages increase one's ability to recall health warnings, the type, size and positioning of which are important.  We have been mocking up the type of packs that may result from this legislation, as derived from the heads of the Bill and the EC directive and they are very different from what is currently available.  <\/p><p>  The committee has heard that a public opinion poll conducted here showed that the introduction of plain packaging would be popular.  A huge majority is in favour of this approach.  We also found this to be the case with smoke-free legislation.  We also found that after the legislation was introduced, it became even more popular.  The committee need not be worried that the people will not support this legislation.  <\/p><p>  The committee may have noticed that many people are not sure how this is going to work in practice.  This highlights the need for planned implementation of the legislation and focused, independent monitoring of the resulting effects of the law.  Therefore we strongly recommend that the committee ensures that this legislation is not only introduced, but also that resources are provided to ensure that appropriate research is conducted to measure its effectiveness and to meet the predictable challenges of a malevolent industry which will claim to have negative data.  <\/p><p>  In conclusion, I commend the Oireachtas for its commitment to the introduction of standardised packaging and for securing all-party support for this policy.  In particular, I would like to congratulate the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, who has restored momentum to the legislative approach to tobacco control in Ireland and made a major contribution to EC tobacco control, where his work on the tobacco product directives has greatly enhanced Ireland's EC standing.  As the committee will know, during Deputy Martin's time as Minister for Health and Children, Ireland's standing was at its highest, with the introduction of smoke-free legislation and the setting up of the Office of Tobacco Control and our own research institute.  During the tenure of Ms Mary Harney, that momentum was lost, to the amazement of our international colleagues, who are now once again looking to the Oireachtas for leadership in the battle to protect our citizens from chronic disease and premature death.  I have every confidence that the Oireachtas will give this leadership and that our children and future generations of Irish men and women will live longer and healthier lives, free from the profit-driven scourge of tobacco-related diseases.  This can be done be ensuring speedy implementation of the legislation, by making sure that Ireland persists in using all other tobacco control interventions that scientific research has shown clearly to be effective and by supporting the continued monitoring of the health and social effects of these interventions through independent, scientific research.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Luke Clancy"},{"type":"speech","time":1391681400,"counter":729,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  We welcome the fact that they have come to give a presentation on the subject before us.  They have reinforced the views that are widely held by everyone, in particular in terms of the clinical outcomes of smoking and the impact it has on people's lives and health.  We are probably all in agreement that we must do everything we possibly can to reduce smoking.  Based on the clinical experience of the witnesses, the prevailing view seems to be that when a person starts smoking they will, in effect, be smoking for life.  That is what the tobacco companies hope, and if a person dies then they have to recruit someone else at a young age to take up smoking and keep the momentum going in terms of sales and marketing.<\/p><p>  It was said that we must ensure standardised packaging is introduced in terms of size and shape so that one will not have packaging that looks like lipstick or other attractive designs aimed at young people.  What specific issue within the confines of the Bill on standardised packaging of tobacco should we include to ensure that we keep a genuine focus on reducing the consumption of tobacco?<\/p><p>  Several speakers outlined why 22% of the population smoke.  It will become more difficult to reduce the number of smokers in the future.  We have extremely well-resourced forces against us.  International tobacco companies are hugely resourced and well organised and there is massive support in terms of other professional bodies that support them because they are funded by them.  We are a small player in a powerful fight.  We all know that if tobacco was discovered tomorrow and brought to our shores it would be an illegal substance and would not be allowed in.  We are where we are and we must try to row back on the situation.  I am interested to hear whether there is something else we should include to strengthen the legislation or that we could recommend to Government for future legislation if it is not possible to incorporate it in the Bill under discussion.<\/p><p>  I do not know what would prompt Professor Clancy to suggest that politicians would even look at polls to make suggestions or that we would define a policy in order to be popular.  That would not enter our minds at all.  I smoke from time to time.  I have tried to stay off cigarettes for most of my life.  I am shattered when I see young children smoking.  Given what we know now based on clinical and empirical evidence across the world there is no logical or good reason to smoke.  When we were growing up the advertising campaigns were starting to say that smoking was bad but I can remember the Marlborough man advertisement.  Are there other ways in which we could target smoking?  Given the resources available to the State in terms of legislation or taxation and focusing on advertising and education what steps could be taken to discourage young people in particular from taking up smoking?  The role models for young boys in many cases are health conscious sports people, for example, soccer players, rugby players and hurlers among others.  We have a cohort of young girls in particular whose role models are not necessarily positive in terms of why they are famous.  One sees the message given by waif-thin models and the association there is with smoking.  All those things are being portrayed in a covert way by powerful forces.  We must examine that area as well.  Standardised packaging of tobacco will help but I am keen to hear whether there is anything else we can or should do either in the Bill under discussion or in another public health policy area to focus on young people in particular, especially young girls, because the statistics suggest that they are vulnerable in terms of the implications on their health and in the longer term on the health of the nation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600007#G00100","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1391681400,"counter":730,"content":"<p>I very much welcome the panel of experts who have addressed us and attended the meeting this morning.  The exercise is unchallenging because every member of the committee here present shares the view and outlook of the witnesses.  They have no project to peddle to convince us.  I do not know if anyone will take up the role of devil&rsquo;s advocate and try to argue the contrary position.  I will not, but I will try to tease out some of Dr. Sadlier&rsquo;s comments.  He should please understand that I support the legislation.  There is no question of our shared position on this matter.<\/p><p>  Dr. Sadlier referred to evidence that is already available.  I did ask in a number of earlier engagements on the matter for witnesses to show the evidence that this is a worthwhile step and that it is not just to give the impression of doing something.  I really want this to be meaningful and that it will do as it says, dare I say, on the pack.  Dr. Sadlier said evidence is already available that plain packaging works.  He went on to make the point that plain packaging spurred a 78% increase in calls to the quit line.  I am taking an awkward position; that could mean that four people had previously decided to quit and three more joined them.  It really does not tell us an awful lot.  Can we seriously argue, as the New South Wales study suggests, that there was a 78% increase in the number of people contacting the quit line because of the introduction of plain packaging?  I would love to think that were the case but I am sceptical.  It is important that we have strong arguments to convince more and more people that this is a meaningful and worthwhile exercise.<\/p><p>  Dr. Sadlier mentioned that when young people look at plain cigarette packs they are considered less stylish and not as attractive.  The experience today is that one cannot see cigarettes on sale in a retail outlet because they are shielded from view.  An earlier comment was made to the committee &ndash; it might have been by the Minister &ndash; that in social settings young people can see cigarette packs sitting on a table in a bar, lounge or other social setting.  Dr. Sadlier was correct to give credit where it is due.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, when Minister, championed the end of smoking in the workplace and social settings.  That recognition is deserved.  Nevertheless, from my personal observation of the situation, on social occasions one finds that men have cigarettes in their pocket.  They are no longer on the table in front of them beside their pint.  There is no ashtray as there is no smoking.  Women invariably keep cigarettes in their handbags.  They do not take them out until they are outside the door or in a smoking environment.<\/p> <p>Consequently, they now are less a tool of promotion then when they were something on a table before other young people.<\/p><p> As for the idea of it not being as attractive to mimic, I noted that in the introduction to Dr. O'Connell's submission, he spoke of how attractive packaging plays an important role in enticing young people to take up smoking and then advocated plain packaging with graphic health warnings.  However, the current packaging has such graphic health warnings, which rightly are absolutely horrendous.  Consequently, I am unsure whether there is a cohort of young people who would think the current packaging is any less horrific than if it were plain with the same photographic depictions.  As I do not know, I am just teasing this out because the witnesses could go through this exercise, after which they will go away and members will go away until the next session, which might be a wee bit more interesting.  This is not take away from the importance of this engagement but we must tease this out a little and I asked witnesses to accept my contribution in that spirit.<\/p><p> I have just two further points to make.  I wish to record my thanks to Dr. O'Connell's colleagues, as I recently have been a guest of his fine hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600007#G00200","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391682000,"counter":732,"content":"<p>I am sorry to hear that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600008#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Finbarr O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1391682000,"counter":733,"content":"<p>No, I simply wish to record my sincere personal thanks to the coronary care unit in St James's Hospital.

I do not have a specific question because they have provided compelling evidence to the joint committee today.  I use the word \"evidence\" because while members have heard evidence in other submissions, I discount it if it is being funded by the tobacco industry.  However, the witnesses have provided members with highly compelling evidence.  Dr. Finbar O'Connell stated that 95% of lung cancer patients in Ireland are directly linked with tobacco and everyone can think of someone he or she knows who had or has lung cancer.  Consequently, that was quite a startling figure for me in respect of the realisation that so much is within our grasp to improve people's health.  Last week, representatives of some children's groups appeared before the joint committee and gave members compelling evidence about marketing and the attractiveness of the product.  I refer to the different sized boxes to which the witnesses referred and the bright sparkly colours that are used and which are attractive in nature.  Obviously, the witnesses also have given members the health warnings, particularly for children, and I had not heard of the prenatal factors in such a compelling way.  This is very important for the joint committee as it proceeds with these hearings.  I think the opening sentence Dr. Matthew Sadlier used was that it is the only product that, if used as intended, kills.  That is the basic fact about it.  As for the fact that 78% of people will start before the age of 18, either the tobacco industry's marketing campaigns are marketing to the wrong people or they are targeting children and I believe it clearly is the latter, because if that is the rate of take-up, it is well past any margins of error.<\/p><p>  I thank the witnesses.  Their evidence has been very useful.  I hope the evidence that has emerged this morning will be publicised.  Unfortunately, it is not what always makes the headlines but I believe the public must be informed of the effects of smoking right across the health spectrum, both directly and indirectly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600008#H00400","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1391682000,"counter":735,"content":"<p>I will now call on three members who have indicated their desire to contribute, namely Senator Colm Burke and Deputies Mitchell O'Connor and Fitzpatrick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600008#H00500","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1391682000,"counter":736,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for all the work they have done and are doing in this area.  It is very valuable and they are making a huge contribution in this regard.  One point on which I wish to touch is the high level of smoking within the poorest socioeconomic areas.  How do the witnesses think this issue can be tackled?  While legislators can make all the changes in legislation that are required, I have spoken to a number of people working in clinics in public hospitals who note the level of smoking is quite high.  I even spoke to someone who was running a high-risk pregnancy clinic who advised me of a patient who presented recently and who was smoking 300 cigarettes per week.  The person worked out that the cost of those cigarettes was greater than the amount of the social welfare payments she was receiving.  Therefore, this indicates there must be a very high level of sales of illicit cigarettes in some of those areas.  How should one deal with such areas in respect of the education process, because we do not appear to be making as big an impact in some of these areas as is the case elsewhere?  From the witnesses' own experience, how should this problem be approached?  One must approach it at the outset from the perspective of younger people but one must also approach parents.  The witnesses may have some ideas in this regard, as I believe much work remains to be done in that area and it is important that it be tackled.  I again thank all the witnesses for their contributions this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600008#H00600","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1391682000,"counter":737,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses, for whom I have great respect.  They are doctors who deal with people and who know about those who have suffered from tobacco-related diseases.  Dr. O'Connell should again name all those diseases for the benefit of those who may be watching in on proceedings or for those who are present in the room.  I ask him to repeat that list for the benefit of the public, in order that people might realise all the different cancers and diseases he mentioned.  I should add that I used to smoke in the past and found it really hard to give up cigarettes.  One reason for this was that the brand in question, which I will not name, had a purple and white box and if I saw it anywhere in the pub, I would approach strangers and ask them for a cigarette.  I am ashamed to say that but advertising does work.  This is the reason there is an advertising industry.  If one visits any shops on Grafton Street, they live and die by advertising.<\/p><p>  I will start my questions with Professor Clancy.  It will be an easy question for him because he is an expert in the field.  Members have been told that 50 young people must be recruited each day to make up for the number of people who die from cancer.  Why do Irish children take up smoking?  They appear to take it up much earlier than children in other countries.  Can Professor Clancy specifically define the reason for this?  As legislators, can members do more in this regard?  Perhaps the advertisement Professor Clancy circulated to members could be displayed on the committee room's video cameras, as it shows how awful are the diseases that smoking causes.  Had I seen such pictures of rotten teeth and horrible decayed-looking lungs when I was younger, that would have stopped me from smoking.<\/p><p>  My next question is directed towards Dr. O'Regan.  In the past, I was a school principal and I am aware that some students smoke because they believe it helps them to lose or keep off weight..  Perhaps Dr. O'Regan could comment on this.  Is that a realistic viewpoint as young girls in particular are smoking for dietary reasons?  The representatives from the Institute of Public Health in Ireland might tell me what can be done on the island of Ireland to make sure that smoking rates are brought down to the levels of those in, for example, California, Canada and Australia.  Certain groups of doctors who are present this morning have mentioned that people from the lower socioeconomic groups, and girls in particular, are taking up smoking and continue to smoke even in spite of all the medical health messages being sent out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600008#H00700","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"speech","time":1391682600,"counter":738,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming here.  Over the past number of weeks I have learned a lot about smoking.  There is not a day passes that I do not comment that your health is your wealth, and smoking can seriously damage your health.<\/p><p>  As was stated over the past number of weeks, over 5,200 people die in Ireland each year from tobacco-related disease.  I did not realise that it was the third most common reason for acute hospital admission.  They are keeping the doctors in business.  It is the most common reason to visit a GP, which speaks for itself.<\/p><p>  Half of all smokers will die from tobacco-related diseases.  If that does not put people off, I do not know what would.  My father died of lung cancer at the early age of 74.  Some 90% of lung cancers and 30% of all cancers are caused by smoking.  One quarter of all deaths from coronary heart disease and 11% of all stroke deaths are attributed to smoking and smokers are two to three times more likely to suffer from a heart attack compared with a non-smoker.<\/p><p>  According to a survey commissioned by the Office of Tobacco Control which really shocked me, 78% of smokers start before they reach the age of 18, and 53% before the age of 15.  As a parent of three - two girls and a boy - it is just the two girls who smoked.  I am convinced the reason they started to smoke was peer pressure.  There were a couple of girls in here last week who stated that, in a school yard or in a corner, the most popular thing for a girl was to have a cigarette in one hand and a coloured-labelled package in the other.  That is alarming.  In 2010, 7.9% of children aged ten to 14 reported smoking cigarettes every week.  That is most alarming.  That is something we will have to push against.  The good news was that the percentage of children aged ten to 17 who reported never smoking has increased, from 50.8% in 1998 to 73.5% in 2010.<\/p><p>  Professor Clancy stated that, in international studies, price is the most important measure in tobacco control and has been the most successful tool in reducing the prevalence of smoking, from 34% in 1998 to 26% in 2010, representing a 22% relative reduction.  With the laundering of illegal tobacco, it all merges together.  I wonder can he elaborate.  If we keep hiking the price up, will that stop people smoking or will it help the market in smuggled cigarettes?  As I stated, your health is your wealth.  It is important that we discourage young people from smoking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600009#J00100","speaker":"1068"},{"type":"speech","time":1391682600,"counter":739,"content":"<p>I will hand back to the witnesses, starting with Dr. Sadlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600009#J00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391682600,"counter":740,"content":"<p>I will address the points raised in order.  First, what the IMO would call for in the proposed legislation is that Ireland would not necessarily merely opt for the minimum percentage of the package mentioned in the European directive and that we would increase, to 75% rather than 65%, the percentage of the package containing the health warning.  That would be one change to the proposed legislation, to answer Deputy Kelleher's question, that we see as a positive move.<\/p><p>  In response to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's questions, there is strong evidence.  If the packaging was a medication, it would probably be licensed to treat the conditions given the beneficial effect it would have.  There is also evidence from the psychological literature to show that human beings will respond more emotively and viscerally to visual images than to words.  Human beings seem to be primed towards biologically directed images.  It is quite easy to understand how.  Images of diseased organs, etc., will cause a stronger visceral response and a reaction of disgust in more people than will clinical words.  Where packaging contains warnings that smoking contains all these fancy chemical names, to a large number of the population that could be a vitamin or something toxic.  At that level, people do not necessarily know.<\/p><p>  This is a fight that will have to be fought on a number of different fronts.  The packaging is certainly an important element of it.  My organisation has called in the past for a ban on smoking in the vicinity of playgrounds.  It would be sensible if there were restrictions or guidelines on the representation of smoking in the media.  If a celebrity is seen coming out of a nightclub in a particular dress, the shop that sells it will have a run on its products.  The thrust of policies should involve a restriction on displaying celebrities or persons of prominence smoking in newspapers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600009#J00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matthew Sadlier"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391682600,"counter":741,"content":"<p>As a clinician and someone representing the clinicians who look after those with lung disease, I will try to focus on those issues.  Deputy Kelleher asked about packaging.  I suppose we have concentrated in this discussion on primary prevention but a big impact also is secondary prevention to try to get those who come into our clinics to stop smoking and address those issues.<\/p><p>  If one stops smoking at 30, 40, 50 or 60 years of age, one gains years of life and productivity in life.  One measure would be to get access to smoking cessation services.  If one comes in and is already addicted to smoking, how do we improve that?  There has been some suggestion it would be better if we could put a short line on the cigarette package so that the 81% who think they may quit on a daily basis would have better access to smoking cessation services, and an important knock-on effect may be investing more in those smoking cessation services.<\/p><p>  We spoke about young people and smoking.  As the committee will be aware, in the United States the next step along the line is Tobacco 21.  Dr. O'Connell spoke about this.  It is illegal to buy cigarettes, if one is under the age of 21, in New York and in certain cities in Massachusetts.  Needham, in the middle of Boston, is one.  Where other cities less than a mile away do not have this legislation, it still impacted on young people smoking.  We could bring in legislation like that.<\/p><p>  Following on from the issue with young women who do smoke more than young men now, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor is correct that there may be an issue relating to body image and weight loss.  That is a problem.  We have difficulty addressing it because of the peer pressures in this group.  However, I would look at it a different way.  The amount of sport uptake and professionalism in sport among women has expanded.  There was a great image, that created a furore last week because the Super Bowl was on, of the quarterback smoking in the 1967 Super Bowl.  Everyone thought it was extraordinary that sportspeople smoked in those days.  Of course, it does not happen now.  With more promotion and investment in the professionalism of sport among women, and all this positive energy that has come from sporting women, hopefully, we can move that idealistic issue of smoking to loose weight, which has impacted on men over the years as well, into the sporting arena.<\/p><p>  There is another point that the committee should be aware of.  A woman who smokes, per cigarette, is more likely to get lung cancer and other lung diseases than a man who smokes.  Women are more susceptible to the effects of cigarette smoke.  We are looking down the line at the impact the increased smoking in women over the past 20 years will have on the next 20 years.  That is a scary vista because of the age of onset of this disease.<\/p><p>  On the basis of this list of diseases that people get, Dr. O'Connell mentioned all the cancers but we have mentioned chronic obstructive lung disease and lung cancer.  Asthma affects 7% to 15% of the population and smoking plays a major role in the exacerbation and possible cause of asthma.  There is a disease called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis that, if we were to list it as a cancer, would be the eighth commonest cause of cancer mortality in this country.  Some 60% to 70% of it is caused by smoking.<\/p><p>  On infections, we know that in tuberculosis, TB, the outcomes are worse in smokers.  Whereas people think TB is not that common, it is still common.  Other infection outcomes are probably also worse in those who smoke.  The list goes on and on in terms of the lung diseases that we see.<\/p><p>  My last comment relates to this issue of whether there is evidence that this will make a difference.  All I would say is we do not yet have the evidence because this is new.  In Australia, they are prospectively evaluating this and, hopefully, more evidence will come forth.  It is pretty clear that if people find cigarettes less satisfying, if they perceive that they are of not as high a quality, which is what is coming out of Australia, they are less likely to smoke.  Although we are not yet there with the facts and figures, because we are leading the way, hopefully, in two to five years time the evidence will be more compelling for this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600009#J00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anthony O'Regan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391683200,"counter":742,"content":"<p>I welcome the positive remarks and the clear commitment from the committee members on this issue.

This was mentioned by Mr. Gavin Maguire last week.<\/p><p>  Deputy Kelleher mentioned the Marlboro Man.  Sadly, I understand that the fourth Marlboro Man passed away in recent months from a tobacco-related disease.  It is important to mark that as a story about the real legacy of tobacco advertising.<\/p><p>  On the impact in Australia and the quit-line raised by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, I have the details of the relevant study to hand.  If members permit me, I will detail how it was conducted.  It was a whole-of-population interrupted time-series analysis in New South Wales that examined the number of calls that occurred in the months before the introduction of graphic warnings in 2006 and thereafter.  It also examined the increase in calls that occurred on and after the introduction of plain packaging.  It reported a 78% increase in the number of calls with the introduction of plain packaging, from 363 per week to 651 per week.  That is statistically significant.  The peak occurred four weeks after the initial appearance of plain packaging and it has been prolonged.  With the introduction of graphic health warnings in 2006, there was the same relative increase but the effect was not as prolonged as that observed with the introduction of plain packaging.  Some 40 weeks or so after the introduction of plain packaging, there was still a sustained increase in the number of calls to the quit-line.  This is significant.  We do not have the data yet to indicate what is happening regarding smoking prevalence but the statistics we have are good enough for me at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600010#K00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Helen McAvoy"},{"type":"speech","time":1391683200,"counter":743,"content":"<p>The decline in the number smoking was mentioned in the presentations.

New studies from the United Kingdom conducted by Professor John Britten show that product placement and indirect advertising of tobacco products in movies and television programmes watched by young people are on the increase substantially.  Product placement is a great way to get one's mobile billboard on the screen.  One may not have it on one's table in the caf&eacute; or in schools but we need to be very careful about this.  What I describe is the new strategy for advertising.  Data are available from the United Kingdom to indicate product placement of tobacco in the films and media young people are watching is on the increase.  This is very difficult to handle because we live in a multimedia world.  Children have content on their telephones by way of social media and they see movies, but the tobacco industry would not be quite so keen to show standardised packaging in a movie.<\/p><p>  Points were made on progress on the island by Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor.  Minister Poots indicated very recently that the legislative consent motion is due to be debated through the UK Children and Families Bill but at least the North is in the fray in that the amendments could apply to it.

We need a broad social-determinants-of-health approach that seeks to improve the circumstances of those who are most likely to take up smoking.  A particular issue arises with regard to the role of women, including mothers, in modelling smoking behaviour for their children.  A conclusion we reached in our report was that there is a need to better integrate smoking cessation strategies into child and family services and early-years services that are now being located in certain areas, particularly disadvantaged areas.  It is important to promote the welfare of families in which the parents are not modelling appropriate behaviour for their children and to protect children from the harmful effects of tobacco smoke in the womb &ndash; second-hand smoke &ndash; and reduce the risk of their taking up smoking.  We need to improve the integration and referral pathways to smoking cessation, particularly in respect of family and maternity services.

The World Health Organization has listed what it considers to be the five or six most effective measures.  Examples include the monitoring of tobacco use, the monitoring of the tobacco companies and prevalence, and offering help to those who want to quit.  The latter is extremely important and we need to offer more help.  People sometimes need to make six or seven attempts before they quit, and they need to be supported in that.

The tobacco industry is only too happy for what it regards as high prices to be undermined by smuggling.  It should be noted that in years when tax rates were not increased the industry imposed its own price increases despite screaming about the impact of high prices.<\/p><p> People can be wary about public campaigns because of questions about their value for money but a strong body of evidence has been amassed on how to target messages at, for example, lower socio-economic groups, how to engage people and how new media such as Facebook and Twitter can be used to reach younger people.  New media make it possible for people to support each other online.<\/p><p> There is no single solution, however.  We need to intensify everything we are doing at present.  If we are to achieve the goal of 5% prevalence by 2025, our rate of progress needs to be much better than is currently the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600010#K01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Patrick Doorley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391683800,"counter":755,"content":"<p>The Chairman asked why we need this legislation.

Suffice it to say they include all of the diseases from which Irish people suffer and die.  Lung cancer is the biggest cancer killer, causing one in five deaths from lung cancer.  Smoking is the cause of 95% of Irish lung cancers and it contributes to most of the other cancers.  One third of all cancers are directly attributable to smoking.  The claim in television advertisements that one in two long-term smokers dies from smoking is based on evidence.  It is a flip of a coin whether a long-term smoker will live or die.  Approximately 16 years are lost on average, which is a considerable number.  In my clinic the figure is much worse than that.  I regularly sit down with people in their 40s or early 50s - people with young children - to tell them they have incurable lung cancer.  That is unfortunately an all too common scenario these days.  As several members have said, we all know the evidence about smoking and health.<\/p><p>  It is heartening to hear positive feedback from the committee and Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's comment that there is no issue with the legislation either in this room or the Oireachtas in general.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600011#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Finbarr O'Connell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391683800,"counter":756,"content":"<p>Deputy Kelleher asked what specific actions could be taken.  I agree with my colleagues in regard to the size of our ambition.  The European Commission directive sets a target of 65% but 75% is not unreasonable and would further deprive the industry of advertising space.  The models I described earlier indicate that the two main responses required in Ireland are consistent and persistent mass media campaigns and improvements in smoking cessation services.  Dr. McAvoy spoke about inequalities of health due to smoking.  The people most in need of our services are those who are still smoking but they are not receiving them.  The people who stop smoking are well-off by and large.  Poor people are not stopping and they are not getting the services they require.  This Bill represents a small intervention and if we are to get the most out of it we will have to increase the other elements to which I referred.  It will do no good to clap ourselves on the back once the Bill is passed.  We must reinforce everything around it that can make a huge difference.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in is correct in regard to the evidence for the Bill.  We will be the first country in the northern hemisphere to require plain packaging.  The best estimates suggest it will reduce the prevalence of smoking by 1% among adults and 3% among children after two years.  Even though the percentage figures are small, they represent substantial reductions in the context of the huge numbers affected.  However, more will have to be achieved through reinforcing the other interventions that we know can work if we are to reach the targets set by the Government.  The Deputy is also correct that there is less advertising of tobacco products in general but why should there be any advertising of cigarette packs?<\/p><p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick raised the big question of illicit trade and its impact on prices.  We have studied this issue extensively all over the world and the scientific evidence indicates that while price is an initiating factor in making people think about smuggling, it is fallacious to assert that a price increase from &euro;8 to &euro;9 will change the dynamic.  The level of fines imposed and other consequences of being caught are more important than price as factors in illicit trade.  The penalty for tobacco transgressions is chicken feed.  It is much lighter than is the case for other drugs.  The strength of the legislation is also important.  However, the primary factor is the existence or otherwise of distribution networks.  I do not refer to somebody who buys a few packs of cigarettes in Europe.  Illicit tobacco is now being transported in containers.  It is not possible to profit from illicit trade unless a distribution network exists.  Essentially, it is a law and order issue rather than a health issue.  Even with the existence of illicit trade, price is the one factor that is bound to work.  When we examine inequalities in health as part of the study to which Dr. McAvoy mentioned, the main factors that reduced inequalities were price and, to a lesser extent, smoking cessation services.  If we care about the poor, these are the measures that really matter.<\/p><p>  Deputy O'Connor asked what we can do to prevent children from smoking.  The measures that work for adults also work for children.  Price is a strong deterrent for children because they have less disposable income in general.<\/p> <p> Another major issue for them is mass media and the messages they receive.  Moreover, there are no smoking cessation services for young adults or children in Ireland.  While a person might say he or she has only just started and could stop if he or she so wished, he or she cannot.  However, it is not the case that the level of smoking is rising among children; it is declining.  Our surveys have shown consistently in the past 15 years that the level of smoking among children is declining, among both sexes.  Relatively far fewer girls took up smoking than boys in the past ten years.  I think it is because they are probably more clever and watching what is going on.  Furthermore, the awareness of smoking has increased so much that sensible children who, by and large, are girls have taken up smoking a lot less and I believe this will not be the ongoing problem.<\/p><p> As for the Chairman's question on whether there should be opening hours for the sale of tobacco, I do not know, but he is quite right to raise it because if we simply do what we are already doing, the practice of smoking will still be strong in 2025 and I can guarantee the joint committee that the rate will be nothing like 5%.  <\/p><p> On questioning the need for new measures because the rate is declining, new measures are needed because of the diseases about which members have just heard and the reality that at least 6,000 people per year die from this disease.  That is an important word I have not used in this context before the joint committee previously, that smoking and tobacco and nicotine addiction is a disease.  I wish members would regard it as a disease and get the smoking cessation treatments.  As the joint committee may be aware, I am the only respiratory physician in the country who runs a smoking cessation clinic.  I must ask, if this is a disease, why is that so?  Why is smoking cessation treatment not supported?  Perhaps that might help us also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600011#L00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Luke Clancy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391684400,"counter":758,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their strong contributions.

In England a patch is supplied under medical supervision to women who are pregnant but who still are finding it hard to stop smoking while pregnant.  Do the delegates have an opinion on whether a patch could be used in such circumstances and whether it would be safe enough?

Moreover, there are no proper services for people who smoke.  The Deputy is asking for the provision of patches, which are a crutch, as it were.  My point is that it is a disgrace that there is not a smoking cessation service available for every pregnant woman in the country.  As for patches, the question is whether they are safe.  There is a terrible worry about using anything during pregnancy.  My off-the-cuff answer is that if one compares it with smoking, there is no comparison.  As to whether it is absolutely safe, possibly not, but it is at least 100 times safer than smoking.

Smoking is the biggest cause of inequality in health.  In this context, poor people are now the main smokers.  This is an historical thing because that is not how it started.  If one considers tobacco as an epidemic, it has changed dramatically.  What happened first was that well-off and educated people had tobacco.  The trouble now is the information which is put out, as well as the manner in which it is put out, to get to people who are literate, interested and have a big motivation.  We have not been reaching poorer people or targeting them deliberately.  As I have stated, the only measures in tobacco interventions that really are effective and reduce inequalities are price and smoking cessation services.  That is part of it and I believe it is because we are not focusing on them.  Historically, that is the way it has gone.  For instance, in new states and developing countries it is the rich who smoke, but as time evolves and the epidemic wanes, people with information and access to services, that is, people who have smoking as a disease and are well-off, access services, while poor people and pregnant women do not.

We represent the owners of 4,000 family-owned shops, convenience stores, forecourt stores and supermarkets, many of whom are licensed to sell tobacco products to members of the public in the normal course of their business.<\/p><p>  RGDATA has no funding initiatives in place with the tobacco sector.  However, we publish a magazine once a year for which we accept trade advertising from all suppliers, including tobacco companies.<\/p><p>  RGDATA has adopted a clear position on the subject of tobacco control measures introduced by the State in the interests of public health.  For as long as tobacco is a lawful product for retail sale in the State, RGDATA members who are licensed to sell such products are committed to operating subject to the controls, regulations or restrictions that may be imposed by the State.<\/p><p>  We do not wish to make any substantive challenge to the policy objectives underpinning the proposed Bill.  However, we have been requested to present to this committee on the impact of the proposed Bill from a retailer's perspective and there are three points in relation to the heads of the Bill which we wish to bring to committee's attention.<\/p><p>  Our first point is a general observation about the need for enforcement regarding the illegal trade in tobacco in Ireland.  RGDATA members are compliant and respect the legal obligations imposed on them for the sale of tobacco products.  It remains a matter of concern that, notwithstanding their compliance, there is a substantial level of illegal sales of tobacco products in Ireland through the black market.  If new tobacco control measures are to have an impact and have credibility, it is important that they are accompanied by a renewed commitment to stamp out the illegal sale of tobacco products.  There is nothing more disheartening and disillusioning for a compliant retailer than to see another party flout the law through the sale of contraband, with apparent impunity.  Strong enforcement action against black market and contraband sales remains a key factor in proper levels of tobacco control.<\/p><p>  Head 4 of the Bill provides that the new measures will only apply to tobacco products which are put on the market for retail sale in Ireland.  Presumably this means that those purchasing tobacco products outside the jurisdiction and bringing them into the State, in particular those buying duty-free cigarettes, will not be subject to this new law.  Given the policy objectives which the proposed Bill is seeking to address, why does the legislation not go further and prohibit the importation into the State of cigarettes which do not comply with the packaging restrictions contained in the Bill above a certain volume level per person?  If the object of the legislation is to render the sale of tobacco products as less attractive, surely this principle should apply regardless of where the Irish-based smoker acquires the tobacco products for consumption in the State?<\/p><p>  Our third point comes under head 5.  This is a practical concern which has been raised by retailers in relation to the measures contained in the Bill and concerns the risks associated with staff stocking different brands of cigarettes in the gantries for retail sale.  As the committee will be aware, we operate a closed-container system.  Many staff, when they open up these containers and fill them up, use the colour to ensure they have got the correct cigarettes in the correct order.  At present, a retailer or the staff can clearly distinguish between the different brands of cigarettes when stocking the packages in the gantry.  With plain packaging, this will be difficult and there will be a real risk that in a busy shop environment, the wrong brand could be stocked in the wrong holder or container given the absence of clear distinguishing marks.  This could mean that a customer is supplied the incorrect brand by accident, given that the packet of cigarettes is usually automatically retrieved from a closed gantry container with the brand sight unseen by the retailer or the customer.  To address this concern, RGDATA respectfully suggests that consideration be given to some small distinguishing mark being applied to the bottom surfaces of the pack.  This could be a simple and discreet colour code to distinguish one brand from another.  We want this to be done in a way that would not be obvious to the consumer, nor make the packaging more attractive or appealing.  From a retailers' perspective, it would reduce the risk of consumers being misled to purchase a brand of tobacco that they did not choose.  We would ask the committee to consider as part of what can be put on the packaging that perhaps a discreet mark be put on the bottom of the pack so that when they are put into the gantries, one would be able to see this coloured mark and the staff member would know that he or she had put the correct brand into the correct container.<\/p><p>  These are RGDATA's observations on the proposed Bill.

Plain packaging of tobacco is a sensitive subject.  The committee will hear many views on the topic.  I am here today to explain the view of Irish business.  As the committee may be aware, IBEC represents Irish business, the indigenous and foreign-owned, multinational, big and small, spanning every sector of the economy, and includes tobacco companies amongst our membership.<\/p><p>  At the outset, we wish to make it clear that IBEC supports the objective of the Minister, and this committee, to protect public health.  We have consistently stated that measures to improve public health can bring with them economic benefits.  To this end, for example, we supported the introduction of the workplace smoking ban in 2004.  However, it is incumbent upon Government, especially at times of extreme economic difficulty, to ensure that the measures it takes are balanced and do not bring with them unintended consequences that adversely impact upon business and employment.  We believe that the plain packaging proposals would have such consequences.<\/p> <p>We believe the Bill as outlined will have substantial negative consequences well beyond the sector directly concerned and affect owners of intellectual property.  As such, the proposal could affect the business community in general and not just the tobacco sector.  <\/p><p> Of particular concern are proposals for standardised packaging of tobacco products which will remove all forms of branding trademarks, logos, colours and graphics.  The brand name would be presented in a uniform typeface for all brands and the packs would all be in one plain neutral colour.<\/p><p> As stated in our submission, we are very concerned with the effect these proposals could have on branding rights by the removal of all forms of branding.  Branding is a central part of how business communicates with its customers.  It provides consumers with information on everything from product characteristics to heritage, allowing them to make informed purchasing decisions.  It also allows product differentiation, which drives competition and innovation.  Wide-ranging restraints on the use of branding, including colours, distinctive pack and products sizes and shapes, would set a dangerous precedent.<\/p><p> These proposals have the potential to affect significantly the value and purpose of a company&rsquo;s intellectual property.  They would cast doubt on Ireland&rsquo;s continued commitment to the protection of property, in particular intellectual property and member state obligations under the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property.  Companies that invest in Ireland do so based on various assumptions, including on the standard of protection afforded to property, in particular intellectual property.  These measures, if adopted, would send an immediate signal to foreign countries and investors about the standard of intellectual property protection in Ireland and about Ireland&rsquo;s continued commitment to the protection of property.  The signal that it would send is that intellectual property protections are not nearly as solid as previously thought.<\/p><p> It should be noted that the regulatory impact assessment guidelines published by the Department of the Taoiseach stipulate that regulatory impact assessments should be conducted at an early stage and before a decision to regulate has been taken and that, ideally, a regulatory impact assessment should be used as the basis for consultation.<i><\/i>It is very concerning that a regulatory impact assessment has not been published prior to a memorandum on the standardised packaging for tobacco products being brought to the Cabinet and that the preparation of this legislation so far has not been in accordance with the regulatory impact assessment guidelines.  Proposals for plain packaging legislation need to be evidence based, proportionate and respectful of intellectual property rights, and they should and take into account the growth and job-creation prospects of the wider economy.  The absence of a regulatory impact assessment in this regard is stark.<\/p><p> I thank the members for listening and I look forward to questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600013#P00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Sharon Higgins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391685600,"counter":770,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Joe Sweeney, district president of the National Federation of Retail Newsagents in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600014#Q00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391685600,"counter":771,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to address it on the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2013.<\/p><p>  I am president of the National Federation of Retail Newsagents, NFRN, in Ireland.  Founded in 1919, it is one of Europe&rsquo;s largest retail trade associations, and it has 16,000 members throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland.  The Irish branch of the federation is a membership-driven organisation that represents 1,000 retailers across the island of Ireland, including 500 stores in the Republic.<\/p><p>  We support any initiative to safeguard the health of the people of the country.  In this statement, I will draw attention to some of our members&rsquo; views and concerns.  I will address briefly remarks made at the committee&rsquo;s hearing last week by a representative of the Irish Heart Foundation, who casually dismissed the concerns of retailers on the likely impact of this legislation as being of no merit.  Retailers are an aid to the Department of Health as they are the people who enforce the Government&rsquo;s policies.  I was heartened to hear Deputy Regina Doherty remark that retailers provide both employment for themselves and others, and this should be recognised by the committee.  Equally important was Deputy Byrne&rsquo;s comment that it is all about education.  This is a sentiment with which I completely agree.  I have four adult sons and neither they nor I nor my wife smokes despite our having access every day to our stock of tobacco.  When my children were teenagers and at the most likely age to start smoking, it was still legal to smoke in the workplace and the cigarette gantries displayed the tobacco brand.  Despite this and my sons&rsquo; ease of access, they did not start, simply because they were made aware of and educated on the dangers of smoking.  They chose not to smoke as opposed to having the choice made for them and rebelling against it.<\/p><p>   NFRN Ireland and I are not in any way in favour of smoking.  Our members are at the front line of legal, heavily regulated tobacco retailing.  It is offensive to me and other retailers that there is an incorrect and arrogant assumption that our questioning of this Bill is somehow a defence of the tobacco industry.  We are trying to protect our own business interests and while the product remains legal we expect to be recognised as responsible retailers who are competing with a criminal underworld.  We ask the Government to support and protect our businesses and the jobs they represent and acknowledge that criminals will sell an illegal product to children; the product is often sold by children to children.  As supporters of Government policies, we ask for support in return.<\/p><p>  NFRN Ireland contests and disputes the sentiment that plain packaging would reduce the appeal of tobacco and tobacco products as they are not on display here in the first instance due to the display ban.  It is difficult to understand how the appeal of a brand can attract a smoker when the product is not visible to him or her and the impulse purchase that might have been prompted by the sight of a product does not occur.<\/p><p>  There is no hard evidence to suggest that oversized health warnings or plain packaging will reduce the number of people currently smoking or those who start to smoke.  The only supposed evidence from Australia, given to this committee during the hearings to date, has been the tenuous argument that increased calls to a quit-line mean people will actually stop smoking.  What the people who mentioned this study failed to point out was that it was undertaken during December and January, a time of year when calls to quit-lines would be expected to increase in any case as smokers make their new year&rsquo;s resolutions.<\/p><p>  Some organisations the members have heard from dismiss our contention that plain packaging will lead to increased illicit trade.  If that is so, how do they explain the surge in illicit tobacco sales in Australia in the year since plain packaging was introduced there?  Furthermore, the tobacco products directive agreement reached at EU level will give the Department of Health all of the powers needed to tackle cigarette packaging.  It will bring in measures such as the devotion of 65% of cigarette packets to health warnings and the outlawing of packaging that the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, has said is aimed at attracting young people, such as what he described as lipstick-shaped packs.<\/p><p>  I want to summarise the key recommendations that NFRN Ireland would like this committee to consider.  The first is that the Government should promote and endorse the use of electronic cigarettes as a weaning tool for those who wish to give up smoking.  It is essential that these products remain on general sale and are never restricted to pharmacies.  In order to increase the likelihood of a smoker choosing an alternative, an alternative must be readily available.  The long opening hours of our members&rsquo; stores support this.<\/p><p>  Second, education is the key.  Through education, young people can make informed choices and avoid taking up a dangerous habit.  NFRN Ireland urges the committee to examine the example of California and introduce a programme similar to tobacco use prevention education, TUPE, which resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of teenagers who started to smoke.  The emphasis should be on stopping people from starting to smoke.<\/p><p>  Third, NFRN Ireland has on many occasions highlighted the serious level of illicit trade in Ireland.  We have put forward a number of potential solutions to various Oireachtas committees, Deputies, Senators and councillors.   We submitted a proposal to the Minister of State responsible for small business, Deputy John Perry, on developing a smartphone app, based on the Codentify software, that will allow consumers to verify that their tobacco products are legitimate.  The Garda representatives who were present here two weeks ago spoke positively about this.  Where there is a suspicion that tobacco products are counterfeit or smuggled, such an app would provide law-enforcement officials with a simple and effective tool for determining immediately whether this is the case.  NFRN Ireland would be willing to pay for the introduction of this app to the Irish market.<\/p> <p> Fourth, the sale of tobacco products at a market or fair should be banned outright.  To this end, the penalties available under the Casual Trading Act should be made as strict as those which apply under the Finance Acts.  Equally, landlords of properties where illicit products are sold should be held accountable for the activity on their sites in the same way as retailers are held accountable.  <\/p><p> Fifth, as Ireland is an island, ports offer an easy means of bringing illicit tobacco into the country.  In Ireland there are eight ports but in only two are there mobile scanners, meaning that the majority of ports remain unmanned.  In all ports there should be a permanent scanner and such an investment would not only be self-financing but also profitable for the Exchequer.<\/p><p> These are all measures which NFRN Ireland believes the joint committee should consider carefully as part of an integrated approach to tackling the issue of tobacco control across a range of fronts, rather than pursuing one single, unproven, high profile step such as plain packaging.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600014#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Sweeney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391686200,"counter":773,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Vincent Jennings, chief executive officer of the Convenience Stores and Newsagents Association.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600015#R00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391686200,"counter":774,"content":"<p>The Convenience Stores and Newsagents Association welcomes the opportunity accorded to it to present its views to the joint committee on the heads of the Bill.  The World Health Organization has published advice to governments that they enlist the support of civil society organisations and, specifically, retail organisations when seeking to enact and enforce bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship activities.  We make reference to this advice as it is our opinion that the authors of <i>Tobacco-Free Ireland<\/i>, the tobacco policy review group, elected not to consult any representative of the 13,000 registered tobacco retailers during their deliberations.  There is a reference within the report to consultation with stakeholders and the CSNA would like to state this consultation was incomplete and contrary to the advice of the World Health Organization.  As the review group made a number of recommendations for legislative change, we believe that, in line with Cabinet guidelines, a regulatory impact assessment, RIA, should have been conducted by the policy review group and provided alongside the report which was adopted as Government policy one month after its publication.  Neither the committee nor any of the interested parties invited to make submissions on the Bill has had the benefit of an RIA to accompany the heads of the Bill.  We consider this to be a significant deficiency in the consultative process.<\/p><p>  This Bill, in style and purpose, owes much to the Australian Bill.  We need to remind the committee that a comprehensive suite of measures was introduced alongside that Bill to provide for the desired outcome: increases in the already significant reduction in smoking initiation and prevalence.  These measures included: an annual increase in each of the following four years of 25% in excise; the reduction of duty-free allowances from 250 cigarettes to 50; pictorial warnings, in existence since 2006, which were revised and enlarged; some A$85 million for social media messaging, of which A$28 million was for high-risk and disadvantaged groups; 100,000 prescriptions for nicotine patches; an exemption from sales tax for NRT in non-pharmacy outlets; additional subsidies for lower strength NRT; new penalties specifically for tobacco smugglers; while legislation was enacted to restrict Internet advertising of tobacco products.  We remind the joint committee that the level of smuggling of tobacco products in Australia was 4% in 2011.  The Australian Government has committed to review the first 12 months since the introduction of these measures and the head of the preventive health task force, Professor Daube, has been quoted as saying: &quot;I don&rsquo;t think anybody reputable would make claims about adult prevalence until we have the next national government-run survey.&quot;<\/p><p>  The CSNA requested sales data from our counterparts in Australia.  This data - provided by retailers, not tobacco industry sources - showed that in the first six months of 2013, when compared with the figures for 2012, overall tobacco sales volumes had increased in the stores surveyed by 4.5% in units, from 9.616 million units to 10.047 million units sold and from A$124.3 million to A$134.6 million, an increase of 8.2% in value.  The worrying aspect of these figures, for the Exchequer and retailers, was that there had been a dramatic increase in the value and sub-value categories which had increased by 57% collectively in terms of volume and a significant additional 22% of sales in the roll-your-own, RYO, category.  This coincided with decreases in the premium and mainstream ranges which had decreased by 9.1%.  Cigars, both wet and dry, had declined by 90% and 32% in quantity.  Were these down-trading figures to be replicated in Ireland following the introduction of plain packaging, the effect would be significantly disadvantageous for our members, but it would have little or no measurable financial impact on the multinational tobacco companies from which we source our tobacco products.  This is owing to the unique position the State has provided for these companies, courtesy of the Finance Act.<\/p><p>  It is an offence for retailers to sell cigarettes above the recommended retail price, RRP, which is determined by the companies.  Regardless of whether we purchase from the companies or are supplied by distributors or cash and carry outlets, at higher wholesale prices, we must sell at the RRP.  The companies have subsidised and manipulated the RRP within the value sector.  They have stimulated demand through a variety of activities, including holding the RRP subsequent to budget increases, and are perfectly positioned to meet the expected additional demand for the value sector range if plain packaging is introduced.  Retailers will find that the wholesale prices will increase for this range, yet owing to the unique position the Government has provided for these companies, they will by able to fix the RRP at existing levels.<\/p><p>  We ask the joint committee to consider a number of other matters that we have identified as weaknesses in achieving the dual purposes of reducing harm to children and preventing the continuation of the deception of existing smokers.  There is an urgent need, not provided for in the <i>Tobacco-Free Ireland<\/i> report, to outlaw proxy purchasing, that is, the purchase of tobacco by an adult on behalf on minors.  This is part of the French criminal code.  We believe society can register its disapproval of smoking by minors by mirroring our own laws on the attempted purchase and possession in a public place of alcohol and introduce similar prohibitions for tobacco products.<\/p><p>  If the joint committee accepts the proposition that the usage by tobacco companies of various colours on their packaging is a subliminal attempt to deceive consumers into believing one colour is lighter or safer, it is illogical to continue to permit these colours to be continued to be referred to on each occasion the consumer requests such a product using that exact colour as the description for his or her purchase.<\/p><p>  We are also most concerned that there is no attempt in the Bill to dilute the effect that duty paid products in another jurisdiction will have on the public health policy of the State.  Figures provided by Revenue indicate that 330 million cigarettes and an unrecorded amount of RYO products were imported legitimately last year into the State.  The presence of this significant number of branded packs is in sharp contrast to the determination of the Australian Government to give its Bill the maximum level of effectiveness.  The CSNA urges the joint committee to recommend to the Government that it take appropriate action to reduce the personal allowance for travellers entering the country, similar to the actions taken by Finland to defend its public health policies.  <\/p><p>  We remind the joint committee that the new EUTPD, not this Bill, has increased the size of public health warnings to 65%.  This is the same figure that is stipulated in the Bill.  The TPD also provides for the elimination of the lipstick packet by which the Minister was justifiably outraged.<\/p><p>  We believe the joint committee should recommend that the Department consider increasing, over a three year period, the minimum age at which young persons may legally purchase tobacco products from 18 years to 21.  This would extend protection against initiation into a cycle of sickness and ill-health for those children currently aged 17 years and under. <\/p><p>  We have outlined our objections and request for clarification on a number of aspects of the Bill.  We need to have clarification of the meaning of &quot;tobacco products&quot;, as the definition provided in the Bill is at odds with the definition in the Public Health Tobacco Act 2002 which includes filter-tips and the like.<\/p> <p>We cannot accept that retailers should be penalised on the double in being fined and taken off the register for an unspecified period.  Any implementation of this Bill should ensure full consultation with retailer groupings, as well as Revenue, to co-ordinate crediting.  The absence of an offence for purchasing branded product by an individual, provided for in this Bill, is tantamount to facilitating receiving stolen goods.  Retailers need to be permitted to engage in collective bargaining through their trade associations with suppliers.  This would introduce a balance into what is now an uneven and unequal relationship.  This is not only permitted but encouraged by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.  Retailers need to be provided with assistance to prepare the ground for a tobacco-free society.  The Convenience Stores and Newsagents Association, CSNA, requests this Bill is deferred until all of the above measures are put in place to protect children, the State, consumers and retailers.<\/p><p> Late last night I uncovered that the National Pensions Reserve Fund holds &euro;21 million worth of equities and bonds in tobacco companies.  I have provided to the committee the full listings of these shares.  In these straitened times and requiring a stimulus for properly costed and well thought through tobacco control measures, I suggest the committee requests the direction of this &euro;21 million, which is tainted money, to be directed towards tobacco control immediately.  What is particularly of note is the fact that one of the shareholdings is in Swedish Match which is the manufacturer of Snus, a banned product across the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600015#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vincent Jennings","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391686800,"counter":776,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Jennings.

I am here in my capacity as a Retail Excellence Ireland board member and also as marketing and corporate services director at Topaz Energy.<\/p><p>  Retail Excellence Ireland is Ireland&rsquo;s largest retail industry body.  We represent 1,100 retail companies which operate over 11,000 stores in Ireland.  A significant cohort of our members responsibly retail tobacco products.  Our members employ 110,000 people.<\/p><p>  We wish to register our deep concern at the proposal to introduce plain packaging for tobacco products.  The implementation of the proposed legislation will have a profoundly negative effect on our members&rsquo; businesses.  There is no credible evidence that plain packaging as a policy proposal will lead to a reduction in youth smoking or prevent youth initiation.  More consideration must be given to other means of tackling tobacco consumption without severely impacting the responsible sale of tobacco products.<\/p><p>  The Australian Government announced that an impact assessment would be conducted as to the effectiveness of the measure in December 2014.  We would recommend that it would be prudent to await the results of such an assessment before proceeding further.  Several countries have initiated World Trade Organization dispute settlement proceedings against Australia, claiming the Australian plain packaging legislation breaches international trade obligations.  A final ruling is not expected before December 2014.  Several other countries considering plain packaging as a policy proposal are awaiting the outcome of such proceedings before deciding whether to proceed with the measure.  We would consider it prudent to await the outcome of these challenges.<\/p><p>  The Government estimates that approximately 20% of all tobacco consumed in Ireland is non-Irish duty paid.  This costs the Exchequer in excess of &euro;250 million annually and Irish retailers considerably more.  The Government should ensure sufficient resources are provided to the law enforcement agencies charged with tackling the illicit tobacco trade in Ireland.  A significant commercial opportunity will be afforded to criminal operators in the illegal tobacco trade to supply to the market with tobacco products that are in demand in their pre-plain packaging formats.  The introduction of plain packaging will afford a far greater opportunity to criminals to copy the plain package design.  The introduction of plain packaging will have a disproportionately negative effect on legitimate Irish retail operators.  Plain packaging will damage competition, leading to the commoditisation of tobacco products.  Commoditisation will reduce margins, as well as reducing cash flow.  This means that consumers will increasingly focus on price, leading to trading down from premium brands.  If 25% of current premium smokers were to down-trade to value tobacco, retailers would lose more than &euro;42.5 million turnover annually.  This obviously will put an increased pressure on margins, resulting in further job losses.  Lower prices might also lead to increased initiation of smoking.<\/p><p>  The introduction of plain packaging will also increase the number of job losses in the legitimate retail industry.  In 2012, loss in turnover to retailers as a result of illicit sales was estimated at around &euro;450 million.  According to AC Nielsen, the total turnover from the sale of tobacco products in 2012 was &euro;1.35 billion.  This demonstrates the importance of these products to a significant cohort of our members.  With 80% of this turnover going to the Government in excise and VAT, it is also a major contributor to the Exchequer.<\/p><p>  A recent report by KPMG on the impact of the introduction of plain packaging in Australia for the six months following the introduction of plain packaging showed there has been no reduction in consumption rates but illicit trade figures have increased by over 13%.  A report recently undertaken by Roland Berger on the potential impact of plain packaging for cigarettes in Ireland estimates that in total 1,900 jobs and &euro;125 million could potentially be lost if the measure is introduced.  We have serious concerns with the measure and believe there are more appropriate ways for the Minister to achieve his objectives of reducing smoking in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600016#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Candon"},{"type":"speech","time":1391686800,"counter":778,"content":"<p>I call on Mr. Mike Ridgway, a spokesperson for several UK packaging manufacturers and a former managing director of Weidenhammer UK Limited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600016#S00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391686800,"counter":779,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me to address it today.  I am a guest in the Oireachtas and appreciate the opportunity afforded to me to represent the views of the packaging industry in the debate about packaging regulation in the tobacco sector.  I reside in the UK but I do have some Irish credentials.  My grandfather came from County Clare and my grandmother came from Belfast, so I have an affinity for Ireland.  I was employed in the UK packaging manufacturing industry for over 40 years and retired as the managing director of my company some three years ago.  Since that time, I have been acting as a spokesman for seven major UK packaging companies which are all heavily involved in the design, development, innovation and manufacturing of packaging solutions for a wide range of consumer products, including tobacco products.<\/p><p>  I fully appreciate there is not a sizeable packaging manufacturing industry operating in the tobacco sector in Ireland.  We feel, however, we can contribute to the important debate taking place here, in the UK and in Brussels with the tobacco products directive.  The companies that I represent have a serious concern that policy proposals introduced in this jurisdiction may well have detrimental knock-on effects on their sustainability, endangering the thousands of jobs they provide across other European countries.<\/p> <p>As professionals working with packaging materials, we have first-hand experience and expertise of the complex role packaging plays within the fast-moving consumer goods sector, and how it protects the consumer and the legitimate industry from the dangers of counterfeiting.<\/p><p> The companies I represent have commercial interests with the tobacco industry.  The industries have traded together for decades, producing and using a wide range of products including metal tins, rigid boxes and composite cans, plastic pouches and laminates, printed labels and folding cartons.  With this in mind we have the interests of our employees, investments and innovative workplace skills to consider.<\/p><p> I will expand on the role of packaging.  Tobacco packaging is a high-precision manufactured engineering component produced in large volume to exacting standards and subsequently used on high-speed packaging machines.  To print and produce these highly complex products, capital equipment costing many millions of euro is needed, together with an experienced, well-trained and largely apprentice-trained workforce. <\/p><p> Essentially packaging acts as a barrier to trade in counterfeit and illicit goods.  Sophisticated packaging is a defence against counterfeit products as it makes it extremely difficult and costly for criminals to copy.  These fake products are typically sold on the black market.  The illicit trade is a problem both in Ireland and the UK.  Members will be familiar with the figures in Ireland, but I will explain the UK's problem.  We lose some &pound;8 million, &euro;9.5 million, in tax revenue every day.  How many hospitals and schools could be built with that money?  Nearly &pound;3 billion is lost to the British Treasury annually based on figures supplied by HMRC in London.<\/p><p> Packaging introduces variations, not only in colour, design and graphical content but also in enhanced features including embossing, de-bossing, hot-foil stamping, matt-gloss varnish combinations and vignettes.  I could continue talking about the technical side for quite some time.  In addition, special materials have been developed using techniques developed over periods of time including special raw materials, formulated low-retained solvent inks, tear tapes and tipping paper produced by world-class manufacturing companies.  The construction of the cigarette carton has also gone through many changes which are not just graphical, but also of construction.  Appendix 2 to my submission illustrates a product well known in the market and how its design has changed over five or six years from a rectangular standard carton, through to having little embellishments, such as blocking features, logo changes and shape changes.  I ask members to compare that with the photographs underneath of what a standard plain pack would be.  It would be much simpler to produce involving a different printing method, moving from gravure printing to lithographic printing and even digital printing.  Such packs can be knocked out very simply and easily.<\/p><p> Once simplicity is introduced via a standardised design all complexity is eliminated.  This will result in the printing process being opened up and the counterfeiter and copier can move with ease to print these standard packs.<\/p><p> We also need to consider the issue of tax stamps.  It has been stated that tax stamps and other security systems help police address the problem of the illicit trade.  I am not in a position to comment on the stated position of the law enforcement agencies in Ireland on this issue but in other jurisdictions with similar illegal tobacco problems, there is a belief that tax stamps have little impact.  Criminals can also copy tax stamps.  It is difficult for consumers and retailers to tell the difference between a genuine and fake product.  The point is that tax stamps are irrelevant because somebody buying cigarettes in a back street or in a car-boot sale is only interested in the product.  By the time the product is in the illicit distribution system a tax stamp, whether good or bad, is totally irrelevant.<\/p><p> Let us consider external experiences.  Australia introduced plain packaging just over a year ago.  According to the KPMG report, which was mentioned earlier, there has been an increase in the illicit trade.  Significantly there has also been an increase in what are called the \"illicit whites\".  I will explain that in greater detail later.  Other retail surveys have shown the purchasing of cigarettes becoming a commodity item and a price-driven purchase.  However, most significantly of all, the studies, including those by KPMG and the London School of Economics, all indicate that the level of smoking has remained consistent.<\/p><p> Let us also consider how branded packaging in the legitimate and controlled retail environment contributes to the delivery of tobacco-control objectives.  It minimises the sale through illegitimate channels such as the black market.  It significantly restricts the availability of product to young people.  It supports duty-paid pricing levels.  It minimises the market share of counterfeit products, such as \"illicit whites\".  Appendix 1 shows what standardised plain packaging looks like.  The one in the middle is called the \"Spoonbill\" a spoof product that appeared on the market in Australia with just a name - it did not mean anything.  To the consumer it looks like a legitimate plain-pack product.  However, it was made by counterfeiters, we believe in Vietnam and supplied into the Australian market.  Sophisticated criminals will soon get their heads around that sort of thing.<\/p><p> We assist in the delivery of health regulation by having a legal product with packaging and ingredients regulations.  Counterfeit and illicit brands have no control.<\/p><p> I will summarise the impact of plain packaging.  It removes technical barriers.  It provides huge economies of scale for counterfeit production.  It facilitates deceiving consumers and undermines trust in genuine merchandise.  It would lead to a collapse in product value due to commoditisation.  There would be higher consumption due to cheaper commodity products and affordability.  There would be greater availability to young people through the illicit trade.  It would also potentially lead to increased harm from unregulated products.<\/p><p> I thank members for listening to me.  I have been employed in the packaging industry for many years.  I do not want to see sections of my industry damaged through the introduction of excessive regulation for which there is no evidence that it works.  The UK packaging industry fully supports the regulation of tobacco products but believes there are far more effective alternatives to plain packaging such as education, information and cultural awareness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600016#S00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Ridgway","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391687400,"counter":781,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Ridgway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600017#T00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1391687400,"counter":782,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  I am encouraged that there is not outright opposition to the purpose of the legislation.  Even though people are coming to the issue from a variety of experiences and responsibilities in life, I believe there is a shared acceptance that we have to work towards the best situation possible, not only for the current generations but also for the future of humankind.<\/p> <p> Having listened to the presentations and read the submissions carefully, I note that we share the same opinion.  I apologise that I will not have enough time to deal with both presentations.  I welcome Ms Buckley's presentation on behalf of RGDATA and thank her for her practical points.  This is the health committee and our natural position and disposition is to seek whatever measures will help to improve public health.  I know there are other considerations from each of the delegations' perspectives which have to be noted, respected and addressed.  The contributions will help us in whatever engagement we will have with the Minister and the Government when dealing with legislation.  I concur that there is a need for strong enforcement action against the black market and contraband sales; this position is shared by all members of the committee.  Any legislative measure should apply in equal measure in dealing with the importation of tobacco products.  This is also reflected in the positions articulated by Mr. Joe Sweeney and Mr. Vincent Jennings who represent the respective bodies, the National Federation of Retail Newsagents Ireland and the Convenience Stores and Newsagents Association.  There has to be an acceptance that, in tandem with this address, there is a need for a reduction in the travel personal allowance in bringing tobacco products into the country.  I note that both Mr. Sweeney and Mr. Jennings have made this point.<\/p><p> Ms Buckley has highlighted the risks associated with staff stocking different brands of cigarettes in the gantries for retail sale.  Others may blow me out of the water, but I welcome the highlighting of practical issues that will facilitate workers in the retail sector in managing the sale of tobacco.  I wish there were fewer consumers of tobacco products, but for the time being, whomever they may be, at least they would be sure of being sold the brand for which they were paying.  <\/p><p> I agree with Mr. Sweeney that tobacco products should be confined to legitimate retail outlets and that the sale of tobacco products at illicit or locations of questionable status such as markets and fairs should cease and needs to be addressed in legislation.  Landowners or landlords who provide facilities for the sale of illicit products must be held accountable for their hosting of such activities.  I expect all this product is imported illegally.  I concur with the view that there is inadequate provision of scanners to address the problem at ports and I speak from the perspective of the island of Ireland.  We must ensure scanners are permanently located at the ports rather than depend on the use of mobile scanners which catch people one day but not the next.  <\/p><p> I agree that the personal travel allowance for tobacco products should be significantly reduced.  It is interesting that Mr. Jennings made the point about retailers being able to collectively bargain with suppliers.  I am at one on that point.  He has said retailers need to be provided with assistance to prepare the ground for a tobacco-free Ireland.  I do not know if I will live to see it, but it is an aspiration of mine that I would like to see more people ceasing to smoke.  That is the real objective.  Retailers in the legitimate retail business should have their position taken into account by the Government when progressing this objective, an objective which I support completely.  I thank the delegates very much and I am sorry that the bell has rung as I must conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600017#T00300","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391688000,"counter":784,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates and ask them to be clear on whom their organisations represent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600018#U00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1391688000,"counter":785,"content":"<p>What is the Senator's specific query?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600018#U00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1391688000,"counter":786,"content":"<p>I ask specifically about links with tobacco companies, whether a parent or subsidiary company, an event or a publication.

Should we consider a change in the locations and times for selling tobacco, as in the case of alcohol?  <\/p><p>  I refer to a KPMG study commissioned by Philip Morris.  The Roland Berger report was commissioned by Philip Morris and I studied that report very carefully and the statistics for job losses.  The figures are based on estimates rather than evidence.  The Australian data come from the trade and are not official figures.  We, therefore, need to be very cautious.  The words \"smuggling\" and \"counterfeit\" are frequently thrown around at these hearings.  The only independent research on smuggling rates in Ireland has been carried out by Revenue and the HSE's National Tobacco Control Office.  It shows a smuggling rate of 13% in Ireland, of which just 1% involves counterfeit product.  The rest is imported legally by the industry.<\/p><p>  I refer to the case of Andorra which will be well known to the delegates.  The oversupply of cigarettes to Andorra means that it has so many cigarettes that every man, woman and child in the country would have to smoke 130 cigarettes a day.  Last week's committee meeting was attended by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners and the Customs service.  They told us that there was no evidence that the use of plain packaging would lead to an increase in the rate of smuggling.  I ask that these views not be misrepresented because I have read statements that misrepresent what the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and customs officers said to us.<\/p><p>  I have serious concerns about the Codentify software which has been developed by Philip Morris and which has serious technical limitations.  All four major companies which endorse it - Philip Morris, BAT, JTI and Imperial Tobacco - have been accused of smuggling, yet the delegates are asking me to vest my confidence in that software.  I have concerns about it.<\/p><p>  The committee has been told that education is the answer.<\/p> <p>Mr. Joe Sweeney cited California.  I will do my research about California.  In preparation for today's meeting we were given evidence about Germany and I looked at it.  The reality is that Germany has the same smoking rate for 12 to 17 year-olds as Ireland.  The evidence has shown that it is not education that has changed its figures but the effective reduction in youth smoking rates has been brought about by increased taxation and smoking bans.<\/p><p> The earlier session on medical evidence was compelling when it was stated that 95% of lung cancer is due to tobacco.  We had medical testimonies one after the other and doctors who have dealt with people directly.  We have had the children's groups coming in telling us about the marketing and how children are attracted to the product.  One can say that is not the aim of the marketing or what is intended but then I have to question it given that 78% of smokers start before the age of 18.  Either the companies are mispitching the marketing or it is very intentional.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600018#U00600","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391688600,"counter":790,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600019#V00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1391688600,"counter":791,"content":"<p>I will finish on one more point.

We had the medical people appear before us for the morning session and now we have the submissions from the witnesses.  Today I feel like Solomon - which is right?  Is it jobs, is it death?   That was the message that came across at the earlier session.  Perhaps I can quote from some of what was stated earlier.  It was stated that one in two smokers will die from tobacco related illnesses.  The doctors compared it, saying it was like the flip of a coin, one has a 50% chance of dying.  Dr. Luke Clancy said that we respond emotionally to packaging.  Perhaps Mr. Mike Ridgway would comment on that.  The point I made earlier this morning is that there is a whole industry around marketing, sales and packaging which is so important.  Yet when we hear the witnesses speak it is as if they are coming from the other end because there will be plain packaging and it will be difficult to recognise counterfeit or illicit cigarettes.  I asked the assistant commissioner here about two weeks ago if it would make a difference and if it would increase smuggling and he assured me it would not.  I also concur with Senator Jillian van Turnhout that Revenue considered it had a very strong label to recognise if cigarettes were counterfeit.  I can acknowledge that those in the retail trade make a profit, I read somewhere that they make a profit of about 3%.  Is that correct?<\/p><p>  Last week my colleague, Deputy Regina Doherty, stated that she too recognised there are difficulties.  For example, would electronic cigarettes or nicotine replacement therapies be a viable product to sell rather than cigarettes?  I understand the delegates are worried about jobs and so on.  As I said at the outset we are worried about deaths.  As Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said, this is health committee and that is our main concern.  <\/p><p>  Ms Sharon Higgins mentioned intellectual property.  In regard to the High Court of Australia that ruled on 15 August 2012 by a six to one majority that the Government's plain tobacco packaging legislation was constitutionally valid, Ms Higgins said today that in terms of intellectual property Ireland would suffer because the case is not as solid.  Is that disingenuous or can she give me some evidence in comparison to the ruling found in Australia?  <\/p><p>  Ms Tara Buckley made some very good points on the issues on which we need to strengthen.  We heard others from the doctors today who said that we should not sell cigarettes to anyone under the age of 21, also that we should ban smoking from play-yards and open areas and that all of this must be key in to the whole debate.  The doctors were emphatic that this is only one part of what needs to be done to improve public health.  There are many more areas to be tackled.  <\/p><p>  I want to hear about the flip-side of it.  None of the witnesses has said that packaging promotes smoking.  Again, the doctors told us they had evidence to show that it was cool for young people to smoke certain types of cigarettes and that women, in particular, like the packaging.  Will the witnesses comment on women using smoking for slimming purposes?  That appears to be the cool attitude and that is where we have a worry.  I understand how the witnesses are worried but we are worried about health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600019#V00500","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"speech","time":1391688600,"counter":794,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and welcome our guests.

There are serious concerns here.  Mr. Mike Ridgway has been very upfront about his connections with the tobacco industry but IBEC needs to come clear.  As Mr. Vincent Jennings is aware, I met him and various other people with the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, on some of the problems about illegal tobacco.  I then raised the issue in the House with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  It is an issue I intend to pursue again because I am open to the idea that we should try to have a Finnish style regime where people can import very few cigarettes.  We should try to push the boat out on that issue because it would be a useful way of trying to reduce the imports of tobacco on which tax is not paid in this country.<\/p><p>  If any of the witnesses have any further ideas as to how to tackle the illicit trade I would be interested to hear them because it is a serious problem and is undermining certain retailers.  I have a concern that if tobacco is being sold - I wish it was not - it should be sold in such a way that the State gets the maximum amount of tax from it because, after all, it is needed to pay for the hospitals which are required to tackle the problems caused by tobacco, among other things.<\/p><p>  On the issue of plain packaging if, as Mr. Vincent Jennings said, there is not a decline in tobacco sales in Australia why the big deal about opposing it?  It is well worth a try.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600019#V01000","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speech","time":1391689200,"counter":799,"content":"<p>I thank all the contributors for taking the time and effort in preparing their contributions.  Some constructive proposals have been made this morning.  As we sit here today, 14 people per day in real terms will die either at home or in hospital as a direct result of smoking and smoking-related illnesses.  That is a conservative estimate and that is where we are coming from as a health committee.<\/p><p>  I certainly support the idea of banning the sale of cigarettes in markets and fairs and believe the legislation on this should be changed.  It would not be a huge problem to do so.  I think that is an extremely constructive proposal.  Another issue raised concerned smartphone apps and the proposal from the Minister of State with responsibility for small business, Deputy Perry.  Where are we with that?  Has any progress been made on it?  What can this committee do to make sure this is followed through on because it is an important point and something that can be implemented?  We should give assistance to anything that can be helpful to people who are running businesses.  <\/p><p>  Obviously, there is concern about the illicit trade.  Based on the submissions this morning, it is running at around 20%.  All of the witnesses are involved in the business trade.  Where do they see the deficiencies in dealing with the illicit trade?  They have already identified the ports issue, which needs to be followed up on.  Where else do they see deficiencies relating to the illicit trade?  If we want to deal with this issue, we also need to deal with the illicit trade, which is an important issue.

I had a competing meeting.  A lot of my questions have already been asked but I have some particular ones for the three organisations representing the retailers - the National Federation of Retail Newsagents Ireland, the Convenience Stores and Newsagents Association and Retail Excellence Ireland.  We had a series of hearings with the assistant commissioner, the Criminal Assets Bureau, Revenue and customs who told us they are assured that the tax stamp referred to by Deputy Mitchell O'Connor will be enough to ensure that we will be steadfast and damp down the illicit trade.  What do the people represented by Retail Newsagents Ireland, the Convenience Stores and Newsagents Association and Retail Excellence Ireland do in terms of informing the garda&iacute; or passing on information?  In the run up to these hearings, I and other colleagues were lobbied by members of the aforementioned organisations in respect of their concerns about demand going down.  They were able to identify months in a calendar year where their trade was down.  That is invaluable information that should be passed on to the garda&iacute; because if there is a month where the sales of cigarettes are down in a particular shop, that information should be shared with the garda&iacute; because, obviously, the supply is coming from somewhere else.  Could representatives of the Retail Newsagents Ireland, the Convenience Stores and Newsagents Association and Retail Excellence Ireland tell me what engagement they have with the garda&iacute; in respect of the illicit trade, whether they are involved with the joint policing committees and the steps they will take to play their part in combating the illicit trade?

I agreed with some of the questions in respect of the import of cigarettes.  I think customs officers in airports and ports are doing a very good job trying to curtail the amount of illegal tobacco coming into the country.  In the past, this committee was told that there has been a significant improvement in preventing illegal cigarettes entering the country.  I missed most of this morning's presentation because, as one would say, I was present in the flesh in my constituency for a different reason.  Somebody said there was a &euro;42 million turnover in tobacco products in the retail industry.  Do the witnesses have any statistics about the profit made in retail in poorer areas?  We heard from people in the medical profession this morning that the level of smoking in poorer areas is higher than in areas where people are better educated and live in a different social environment.<\/p><p>  Does each witness believe the medical evidence that has been given, not only this morning but across the board, that smoking kills?  Do they believe that as individuals because it is very important for me to understand where the retail industry is coming from?  I am concerned that many of the presentations this morning argued that the legislation would be the bad guy because people will lose their jobs.  Somebody over there made a flippant comment about how the money taken in through Revenue helps build hospitals and schools.  I find that very offensive because smoking is the reason people are dying and hospitals are inundated.  I spent the last week and a half in St. James's Hospital with a family member with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  He knows that the reason he has the condition is because he smoked.  Three years ago, I buried my sister-in-law who had lung cancer because she smoked.  That is the reality of smoking.  It affects everybody in every walk of life.

It is as simple as that.  Smoking has no value of a societal nature whatsoever.  That said, we must all be realists.  We represent retailers who, unfortunately, are as welded to the product at this point in time as are the poor people who are either buying legitimately from them or being taken to the cleaners by paramilitaries and major criminals.  The scourge needs to stop and we need to begin our efforts in that regard now.  I honestly believe the work which has been done by the National Tobacco Control Office and its staff is having an effect.  However, there is a need for haste.  The figure relating to prevalence has variously been estimated to be 22%, 24% or - as the Department of Health informed the committee this time last year - 29%.  Whatever the figure is, it is too high and must be reduced.  We wholeheartedly support the aspiration of the Minister - there is a need for more than aspirations - to work towards a figure for prevalence of 5%.  If we could reduce the figure to match that which obtains in Australia - between 14% and 15% - we would state it was a job well done.

It is about time the Department of Finance was contacted and informed that we do not want our money invested in tobacco companies.  There is a need for ethical investment.  All of this is part of the denormalisation process.  The difficulty with denormalisation is that we are correctly and, it might be stated, slavishly using the template provided under the framework convention.  We are ticking all of the boxes but not seeking to do anything outside of this.  The framework suggests there must be a minimum age.  We have, correctly, taken steps in that regard and introduced an age limit of 18 years.  As a result of the fact that the framework does not state we should prevent people from providing tobacco for youngsters, we have done nothing in this regard.  Nobody thinks, in the context of the policy review, that banning this type of behaviour would be a good idea.  The policy review group's report provides a very good and well considered model.  However, the group did nothing outside of this and did not consider ethical investment, proxy purchasing or the fact that the market for this product in Ireland is so unique.  The latter is the case because the Finance Acts introduced by those in government have made people in the retail trade slaves to the tobacco industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600022#Y02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vincent Jennings"},{"type":"speech","time":1391690400,"counter":858,"content":"<p>I do not think Mr. Jennings can say that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600022#Y02700","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1391690400,"counter":859,"content":"<p>I can say it because it is true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600022#Y02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vincent Jennings"},{"type":"speech","time":1391690400,"counter":860,"content":"<p>I do not think Mr. Jennings can say it with accuracy.

I was deeply involved in a long discussion on the tobacco products directive in Brussels.  We supported the elimination of the lipstick pack because the Deputy is right that that product was sending the wrong message to the wrong section of the market.<\/p><p> An issue that did arise - I hope the Deputy will take this as a positive point - was how we defined appeal and attractiveness.  That issue has been debated long and hard, yet it is inconclusive because it is so subjective.

It is calculated that one container coming into the United IKingdom from eastern Europe will generate a profit of &pound;1 million.  It is that level of profit generation that leads to the spin-off criminal activities in the form of people smuggling, fuelling the drugs trade, prostitution and so on.  It is the loss of this revenue and the profits that can be gained by others that result in the law enforcement agencies having bigger problems than they already have.  I cannot comment on the Irish view, but from the UK police perspective, it has been very vocal in its concerns about what the introduction of plain packaging would do to assist the criminal fraternity and it has written letters to <i>The Times<\/i>newspaper and issued other publications on this point.<\/p><p> Regarding Senator Jillian van Turnhout's point - I ask her to take this as a positive contribution - when I was in full-time employment, my company was a German firm.  I spent a good deal of time in Germany and was very impressed by the methods of communicating the problems of tobacco to young people there.  There were extensive programmes which involved taking schoolchildren into hospitals for two or three days and showing them graphic illustrations of what smoking did to the body.  I believe, in addition to what the Senator said, that having an improved education system for children of that age group would be a very beneficial policy to follow, rather than what we are talking about today, namely, the introduction of excessive regulation when there is no evidence that it will work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600023#Z02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Ridgway","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1391691600,"counter":889,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Ridgway most sincerely for making the effort to be here today at his own expense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014020600024#AA00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1391691600,"counter":890,"content":"<p>I will make two very brief points as I understand there are time constraints.  <\/p><p>  On the education aspect, I take on board what Mr. Ridgway said.

This new subsection would place very specific obligations on the ESB in terms of employment and employee profiles.  The proposed amendment, if adopted, would appear, whether intentional or otherwise, to restrict the ESB in its operations in a number of other ways.  The ESB would be required to conclude any access agreements only with third parties or companies which meet the prescribed employee profiles set out in the amendment.  In terms of employees within the supply chain, it would appear the ESB could be restricted to concluding any procurement contracts for products or services to companies which meet the employee profile set out in the Deputy's proposed amendment.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the ESB is a commercial State company and is required to operate to a commercial mandate.  This amendment could impact on the ESB's ability to meet its objectives in this regard.  I understand the rationale behind the Deputy's proposed amendment but I hope he will appreciate that, for the reasons outlined, it would not be appropriate to include such specific obligations in primary legislation.  In addition, the amendment would confer specific obligations on one operator in the telecommunications market and not on another.  This would not be appropriate given the fully liberalised nature of the telecommunications market.  For those reasons I regret that I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p><p>  On the Deputy's point regarding the inclusion of the word \"selling\" in section 2(b), the paragraph states \"leasing, licensing, selling and otherwise providing, making use of and engaging in any service in connection with electronic communications networks and electronic communications services infrastructure\".

I suspect existing ESB technicians will be utilising their skill sets and those of subcontractors to install this telecommunications fibre around ESB networks.  I, too, would be concerned about prescribing in primary legislation that which is proposed in this amendment.  The real focus should be that the delivery of this infrastructure has real potential to deliver thousands of jobs in terms of the provision of quality broadband for the regions, in which I believe this legislation will assist.<\/p><p>  The ESB already has many jobs initiatives and pilot programmes in place in various communities.

Like Deputy Coffey I understand from where the Deputy is coming but there is a bigger picture here.  As stated by Deputy Coffey, by definition the work concerned is relatively skilled.  The big prize at the end of the project is connectivity for parts of rural Ireland.  There will not be connectivity for every part of rural Ireland because the joint venture will be a commercial operation.  However, it will for the first time enable fibre connection to homes in rural parts of Ireland that up to now has been unheard of.  The Deputy's main concern is job creation.  The availability of high quality broadband offers the prospect of dispersing employment to parts of rural Ireland.  That is the prize at the end of this.  Any contractors engaged in this project will be contractors with prescribed skills.  Much of the physical work will and must be done by ESB direct employees.  Where skills are required, they are specialist skills which could not necessarily be met by, say, the 100 first people on the top of a list at a local employment exchange.  Hopefully, as a result of our doing this, there will be people taken off the live register in many provincial towns in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62014020600004#C00700","speaker":"947"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1391695800,"counter":924,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1391695800,"counter":925,"content":"<p>Sections 2 and 3 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1391695800,"counter":926,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1391695800,"counter":927,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<blockquote><br \/>In page 4, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:<br \/><b>&ldquo;4. <\/b>(1) In circumstances where either the Board or the Board in conjunction with another company, while engaging in the business of providing electronic communications either under <i>section 2 <\/i>or <i>section 3 <\/i>or both, advertises specific broadband speeds to the consumer, the Board and or the company in question shall be obliged to provide such speeds to the consumer.<br \/>(2) Any person who fails to comply with <i>subsection (1) <\/i>shall be liable to penalty by way of a fine, the amount of which shall be prescribed by the Minister by way of regulation.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>The 1927 Act provides for access to land and property by the ESB.

So the question of unreasonable intrusion onto lands by a third party does not arise.<\/p><p>  The ESB has, over many years, put in place specific policies and codes of practice on accessing private lands, as the Deputy has just outlined.  It is the ESB's policy to compensate landowners for any land damage and-or crop loss it causes in placing or repairing a line.  It compensates landowners for loss of ability to develop their lands in the event that the land was purchased prior to installing the ESB infrastructure.<\/p><p>  Agreements on these matters are reached in the vast majority of cases without recourse to the wayleave rights currently available to the ESB in the electricity market.  It is only in exceptional cases that wayleave rights are invoked.  This is consistent with the strong degree of protection for landowners through the existing statutory right to arbitration and compensation under section 53 of the Electricity Supply Act 1927, as amended, which can be exercised prior to, during or at the conclusion of works by or on behalf of the ESB.<\/p><p>  The wayleave rights proposed in this Bill are more restrictive for the electronic communications infrastructure developer than for electricity purposes.  The ESB is not permitted to install any new poles or other ground based infrastructure to support overhead electronic communications lines.  It is limited to accessing land to install electronic communications lines on existing poles and other support infrastructure of the electricity network.  I have a photographic display which might help Deputies to get a bird's eye view of what is envisaged.  If the amount of compensation for such access cannot be agreed, the landowner can refer the matter to the statutory arbitration procedure which is currently available in the case of installing electricity infrastructure and the decision of the arbitrator is binding on both parties.<\/p><p>  Having carefully considered the amendment proposed by the Deputy it is my view that this is more appropriate for consideration in the context of the wider ESB powers as set out in the Electricity Supply Acts, as amended.  I do not believe that such an obligation should be conferred in isolation.  In other words, I do not believe it is appropriate to confer this obligation only in respect of the ESB's telecommunications activities.  I have asked my departmental officials to bear this in mind in the context of any future plans to consolidate the existing body of electricity legislation.<\/p><p>  The photograph shows in a fairly striking way the intention to use the existing supply system to run the cable as an additional cable and that may only be done by ESB staff.  They may not take feeds off that and develop new lines because that would be the shortest short cut; it is the existing supply system infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62014020600005#D00200","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1391696400,"counter":930,"content":"<p>I am glad the Minister is using photographs; a picture paints 1,000 words.

Speed may also be affected by the use of a wireless router or Wi-Fi in the consumer premises.  Almost all of these factors are beyond the control of the service provider.  In addition, broadband speeds in the marketplace are currently evolving rapidly and are likely to continue to do so in the future, as new technologies and enhancements arise.  Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to include in primary legislation provision for penalties for non-delivery of advertised speeds.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, the introduction of this amendment would impose a more onerous obligation on the ESB than on other service providers.  This would represent an unfair burden on one market player and would not be appropriate given the fully liberalised nature of the market.  As the Deputy is aware, the telecommunications market is regulated by the independent regulator, ComReg.  I am advised that ComReg has taken a number of proactive initiatives to address consumer concerns with respect to speeds including working closely with the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland and providing enhanced information on this matter on its website.  I am also advised that ComReg has recently secured industry agreement to participate in a pilot project to measure and report on broadband speeds measured at the point of access to the premises.  This would measure speeds prior to any of the variables I outlined earlier occurring within a customer's premises.<\/p> <p>I understand ComReg plans to launch this pilot in the second quarter of this year.<\/p><p> I share the concerns of many of my colleagues on the committee about misleading or exaggerated claims about download speeds made by service-providers.  However, as I pointed out, it is my belief that a legislative remedy along the lines proposed, particularly in the context of legislation to enable ESB to engage in the telecommunications market, is not the appropriate way to deal with this issue.  I hope Deputy Moynihan will accept that for the reasons outlined I am unable to accept this amendment.  I am not challenging his assertion about the frustration in parts of rural Ireland in particular about the quality of the broadband and a failure to deliver promised broadband speeds.  There are a variety of reasons promised or contracted speeds are not delivered.

As the Minister said there are various reasons.  In my view the primary reason is the legacy of the network we inherited, mainly due to the sale of Eircom assets and the little or no investment in that infrastructure in the intervening period.  In my view the current delivery of infrastructure is innovative.  It uses existing infrastructure and it will save significant capital costs in ducting, excavation, ducting and reinstatement.  It will fast-track delivery of the fibre network to communities around the country.  I have a question about public service obligation which requires the ESB to deliver electricity to remote and rural areas.  Electricity is a fundamental utility requirement.  I presume there is no public service obligation element to this legislation requiring the ESB or the ESB and its partners, to deliver this infrastructure.  I presume it will be a commercial decision to bring the infrastructure to where the providers will reap the best rewards.  I ask the Minister and his Department to keep a close watch on where this investment and infrastructure is located so that any black spots remaining will be addressed by means of proper national broadband analysis to ensure that those black spots in remote areas are addressed by other initiatives.  This is my one concern, namely, that utilities might cherry-pick the larger centres of population in order to have a commercial return.  Many of the frustrations about the lack or quality of broadband goes beyond those areas and need to be closely monitored.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62014020600006#E00200","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1391697000,"counter":944,"content":"<p>Deputy Coffey's question is relevant as I noted an article in a newspaper today stating that they will probably cherry-pick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62014020600006#E00300","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1391697000,"counter":945,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

I receive letters on this matter from Deputies and from people in every part of the country.  It will be very interesting to see what technically professional analysis throws up in this regard.  Undoubtedly the frustration referred to by colleagues exists in parts of the country.<\/p><p>  Like the Chairman I read the newspaper article.  The writer knows what he is talking about.  I am not known to frequently say that but in this case it is true.  He knows what he is writing about and obviously it is a knowledge that was not passed on to the headline writer who is incorrect in writing that this broadband service will not improve online experience in rural areas.  Of course it will unimaginably improve the online experience - as the Chairman said - in those rural areas fortunate enough to get it.  That is a simple matter of fact.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Moynihan said, the question is whether we can expand in phase 2.  It is important to recall that this is a new competitor in the market; it does not mean that the players already in the market are not themselves continuing to make progress every day.  For example, notwithstanding the experience of the company in recent times, Eircom has committed and recommitted to a programme of investment that will see a fibre solution passing 1.4 million homes by mid-2016.  That promises to be a very significant contribution.<\/p><p>  Deputy Coffey is correct that this Bill does not attach a public service obligation to the joint venture company.  As he said, it will be a commercial venture bringing more competition and it will improve the online experience.  If we could bring the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>around to having the headlines imitating the copy, it would cause less disquiet in rural Ireland but it might mean selling fewer papers.  There is no doubt that the online service will be improved immensely.
