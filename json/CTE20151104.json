We have engaged with a number of members of the committee on these issues previously.  I can tell those who are not familiar with our work that we are the representative body for 49 voluntary youth organisations in Ireland.  Our member organisations work with approximately 380,000 young people between the ages of 10 and 24 years with the support of approximately 40,000 volunteers and 1,400 staff.<\/p> <p>  In light of the limited time available for this presentation, I will make a few short comments on JobBridge before focusing primarily on the implementation of the Youth Guarantee.  We have circulated a copy of our report, JobBridge -Stepping Stone or Dead End?, to members of the committee.  The report, which was launched last February, is based on survey responses and face-to-face interviews with young people who have participated in JobBridge.  The findings in our report are mixed.  Most of those surveyed and interviewed were satisfied after they had participated in JobBridge.  Many of them indicated to us that JobBridge facilitated them in acquiring work experience, helped them to get active and provided contacts and networking opportunities to them.  Our research identified a number of deficiencies with JobBridge, including poorly designed internships, inadequate mentoring, instances of unacceptable treatment of interns and a lack of clarity regarding the rights of participants.  Other issues which emerged include insufficient monitoring, inadequate income support and evidence of abuse of the cooling-off period leading to job displacement.  We are concerned that, based on the limited sample in our study, just 27% of people secure full-time employment following participation in the JobBridge scheme.<\/p> <p>  We have made ten recommendations to enhance and improve the quality and impact of the JobBridge scheme.  We believe these recommendations would enhance the experience of interns, aid progression to employment and ensure public funds to support employment are put to good use.  Following the publication of our report, we had a constructive meeting with the Minister of State with responsibility for this area at which we discussed our recommendations.  We welcome the decision of the Department of Social Protection to conduct an evaluation of the suitability, effectiveness and relevance of JobBridge.  We hope, based on our study, that this evaluation will involve consultation and discussion with actual participants and is more than a desk research exercise.  Our involvement in this area has taught us that there is a great deal of value to be gained from talking to participants in JobBridge.  Such interactions provide contextual flavour for what they are experiencing.  At a time of public concern about low pay, precarious employment and poor working conditions, we must ensure the integrity of internships as a meaningful way for young people to develop skills through experiential learning.  We must safeguard against exploitation by employers and ensure internships are mutually beneficial to employers and employees.  It must be stressed that internships should not be defined as having no remuneration attached to them.  They should pay the living wage where possible.  Employers who pay the living wage should be recognised as only doing what is right.<\/p> <p>  Our concern about quality opportunities for young people is not limited to the JobBridge scheme.  In 2011, the National Youth Council of Ireland was among the first organisations in Ireland to call for the introduction of the European Youth Guarantee to tackle the youth unemployment crisis.  We believe in the premise of the Youth Guarantee, which is that young jobseekers should be provided with a guaranteed offer of a good-quality employment, education, training and-or work experience within four months of becoming unemployed.  It is an effective way to support young people into work.  Obviously, the incentive to implement the European Youth Guarantee scheme was assisted by the potential for the drawdown of significant EU funds from the youth employment initiative and the European Social Fund.  We understand that the amount of money in question is approximately &euro;130 million per annum.  Our view that the full implementation of the Youth Guarantee could make a positive difference was reinforced by our involvement with the Ballymun Youth Guarantee pilot scheme.  We will hear from some of those involved in that scheme in a moment.  In the Ballymun example, the number of young people on the live register fell by 29% as a result of a co-ordinated effort by the statutory and non-statutory agencies involved.<\/p> <p>  While we have always understood that the implementation of the Youth Guarantee would take time and create challenges for all involved, we have a number of significant concerns.  First, we are concerned about the pace, scale and level of investment in the implementation of the Youth Guarantee.  According to the national implementation plan, some 28,350 education, training or work experience places were to be provided in 2014, which was the first year of Youth Guarantee implementation.  Data provided by the Department indicates that just 23,213 education, training or work experience places were delivered in 2014, which is more than 5,000 fewer than promised.  We estimate that prior to the introduction of the Youth Guarantee in 2013, approximately 20,000 places were provided.  Our view, therefore, is that the extent of additional provision is inadequate.  We hope the number of places delivered has increased this year.  We would certainly welcome information from the Department of Social Protection at the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  Our second concern is that education and training is not solely an issue of quantity; it is also an issue of quality.  Our experience has shown that the forms of education and training provided must be appropriate to the jobseeker and relevant to the labour market.  Too often in the past, jobseekers were sent on training courses solely to meet the need of providers to fill places.  A key feature of the Youth Guarantee is the development of personal progression plans between young jobseekers and caseworkers in Intreo offices to meet the particular needs of the young people in question.  The most recent data available, which covers the period from January 2014 to July 2015, indicates that 9,073 young jobseekers completed personal progression plans.  We believe the Department of Social Protection should invest more time, resources and staff in the development of personal progression plans for all young jobseekers who have been on the live register for four months or more.  I refer particularly to the 18,500 young people who have been on the live register for longer than 12 months.<\/p> <p>  Our third concern is that the structures and partnerships required to deliver the Youth Guarantee are not in place.  We have always stated and acknowledged that the Department of Social Protection cannot deliver the Youth Guarantee on its own and that all statutory, voluntary and private sector stakeholders have a role to play.  This was evident in the case of the Ballymun pilot scheme, which clearly would not have succeeded without the partnership that was formed.  The National Youth Council of Ireland has not been consulted or engaged with regarding the Youth Guarantee since December 2013 even though the national implementation plan states that as a national partner, the council should be invited to participate in the delivery and-or review of the Youth Guarantee.  The members of the National Youth Council of Ireland who are working at local level have a clear insight and a role to play in informing what should happen next.  While the national implementation plan gave detailed commitments and figures for 2014, it did not look beyond that period.  There are no published projections or commitments for 2015 and beyond.  If we are to improve the Youth Guarantee, we need to be able to measure its success.  If we are to analyse the impact and effectiveness of the Youth Guarantee, we need more data and information and an evaluation of implementation of the strategy over its first two years.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the fact that youth unemployment has declined from an all-time high of 31.6% in February 2012 to 19.7% in the most recent figures, which relate to October 2015.  However, the rate of youth unemployment is still more than twice the pre-crisis rate of between 8% and 9%.  We are particularly concerned about the 18,500 people under the age of 25 who have been in receipt of jobseekers' payments for more than one year.  In our view, it is simply not good enough to accept as a fact that the youth unemployment rate will always be double the national average rate of unemployment.  We think it would be wrong to assume that the recovering economy will solve this problem.  The reality is some young people will not be able to access the jobs which will become available without the education, training and other supports promised under the Youth Guarantee.  We are all familiar with the social and financial cost and impact of unemployment.  I refer particularly to the impact of long periods of joblessness on individuals, families, communities and society as a whole.  The scarring effects of long-term youth unemployment are especially damaging.  As we emerge from the crisis, as our economy recovers and as more jobs come on stream, investment in the Youth Guarantee makes sense and should be prioritised.  All the evidence demonstrates that it is socially just and economically prudent to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015110400002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Power"},{"type":"speech","time":1446642000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I ask Ms Whelan to make a presentation on behalf of the Ballymun Jobs Centre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015110400002#D00300","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446642000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the members of the joint committee for inviting us to make a presentation on the operation and impact of the JobBridge and Youth Guarantee schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015110400002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Nuala Whelan"},{"type":"speech","time":1446642000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I cannot hear a word Ms Whelan is saying.

We, therefore, continually assess the barriers which prevent access to the labour market, the quality of activation programmes and their relevance in supporting jobseekers in moving towards sustainable employment.<br\/><br\/>An overview of the Ballymun Job Centre was provided in the documentation distributed prior to the meeting.  According to Pathways to Work - implementation of the European Council's recommendation for a youth guarantee - the Youth Guarantee &ldquo;will involve a mix of initial assessment, career guidance and planning, education and training or work experience, aimed at increasing the capacity of young people to access employment&rdquo;.  There is also a reference to &ldquo;partnership between the public service agencies and local businesses and community groups&rdquo; and other stakeholders.  In many ways this reflects the Ballymun Youth Guarantee pilot scheme, which sought to design and implement a quality driven client-centred approach to supporting young people in their journey towards the labour market.  The objective was to enable sustainable access rather than short-term outcomes. <br\/><br\/>The Ballymun Youth Guarantee pilot scheme ran from November 2013 to December 2014.  During that time 739 young people were invited to participate.  Some 679 young people aged from 18 to 24 years engaged and were in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  The process involved activation by the Department of Social Protection through the Intreo office and attendance at a group information session.  The clients were then referred to the Ballymun Job Centre, to the guidance team which consisted of five guidance officers and a team leader.  They worked on a one to one basis with each client for a four month period, after which time a quality offer was made.  This was underpinned by an inter-agency network.  There were, therefore, national and local implementation groups, made up of key stakeholders.  This ensured the process was flexible and able to respond effectively to the needs of jobseekers. <br\/><br\/>Before the young people were referred to the Ballymun Job Centre they were profiled in three target groups.  Group one comprised clients who had received an education up to or less than junior certificate level, no work experience and numerous barriers to education and employment.  Group two had completed their leaving certificate and some work experience.  Group three had completed their leaving certificate or above and had some good work experience.  This influenced the level of guidance provided for the jobseeker.  The job centre&rsquo;s key role was to pilot the delivery of an in-depth career guidance service.  It consisted of a four-step process which included an initial assessment of the client's individual needs in respect of education, training, skills and personal circumstances and a tailored career guidance process which identified latent skills, abilities, preferred behavioural style in the workplace and so on.  A range of evidence-based methodologies and tools were used to help in this assessment which informed the development of a career plan which included a career objective and some short-term career goals.  Implementation of this plan was the fourth stage which was carried out in a very positive and supportive way.  <br\/><br\/>We used this approach to achieve outcomes such as increased self-awareness, improved self-esteem, building career self-efficacy and helping the client to become more resilient in the labour market.  This enabled sustainable access to the labour market rather than short-term career outcomes.  Through the inter-agency approach a range of quality offers was developed, including further education and training programmes, supported employment such as community employment, Gateway, JobBridge, blended learning interventions and private sector employment.  Target group one received 180 offers; group two, 283, while 99 offers were made to group three clients.  For clients deemed not to be ready for employment services, a pre-offer was available which could, for example, include addiction counselling.  Participants felt the Youth Guarantee was very beneficial, that it helped them to gain soft skills and experience in the labour market.<br\/><br\/>The national Youth Guarantee should be based on the objective of investing in young people in order to increase their employability and labour market sustainability in the long term.  Some lessons from the pilot scheme include, at an organisational level, the adoption of a guidance policy by the Department of Social Protection and the definition of a quality guidance model in terms of the systems and structures that should be implemented.  At a practitioner level, the skills and approach of the guidance practitioner are key to ensuring the client has a good quality journey to the labour market.  At client level, a non-intimidating setting is paramount where trust and a good rapport can be established with the guidance practitioner. <br\/><br\/>Many jobseekers engaging with our services progressed to JobBridge.  This was also the case with the Youth Guarantee pilot scheme and, in most cases, it has been a very positive experience.  Mr. Maurice Devlin, in his evaluation of the Youth Guarantee pilot scheme, stated, &ldquo;Providing young people with Work Experience is key: Skills can be taught but this is not the same as experience&rdquo;.  This is what most young people involved in the pilot scheme felt they needed to access the labour market.  JobBridge, when seen as a quality offer and identified as an intervention that will assist the jobseeker in overcoming some of his or her labour market barriers or meeting a particular need, can be very positive.  Feedback from jobseekers is that they need experience for their CV, curriculum vitae.  It helps them to build self-esteem, their social capital and motivation.  JobBridge can be a positive intervention when used in the right way, when the jobseeker has identified a need which it will fulfil when the internship has been identified as part of a career plan and when the employer has identified the experience on offer.

I am a principal officer in the Department with responsibility, among other things, for the JobBridge scheme.  I am joined by my colleague Mr. Terry Corcoran, principal officer with responsibility for activation policy.  I will outline the current position on JobBridge, while Mr. Corcoran will address the Youth Guarantee.<\/p> <p>  JobBridge was introduced in July 2011 in response to the unprecedented collapse of the economy, particularly the sharp rise in unemployment.  The primary aim of the scheme is to give unemployed people the opportunity to secure work experience and prove their competence to prospective employers, in other words, to break the cycle where they cannot find a job without experience but cannot gain experience without a job.  Prior to the introduction of JobBridge, any unemployed person who wished to avail of an internship opportunity to gain work experience risked losing his or her jobseeker's payment as he or she was no longer considered to be genuinely available for and seeking work.<\/p><p>JobBridge addressed this anomaly and provided an additional top-up payment of &euro;50 per week as a contribution to the costs incurred by job seekers in participating in an internship.  It is important to note that participation in JobBridge is wholly voluntary.  There is no obligation on job seekers to look for, or take up, a JobBridge internship and job seeker payments are not conditional on participation in JobBridge.  <br\/><br\/>It is also worth noting that many firms, particularly small and medium sized firms, which constitute the vast majority of JobBridge host organisations, were able to grow their workforce during a period when access to working capital was very constrained.  In this way, firms could seek to sustain or increase output and revenues and if successful, prove the business case to retain the interns as paid employees at the conclusion of the internship. <br\/><br\/>To date, JobBridge has attracted the voluntary participation of over 43,500 jobseekers and has encouraged over 17,800 host organisations to offer a wide range of work experience opportunities.  There are currently approximately 4,770 people engaged in internships with approximately 1,650 further internship positions advertised on the Department&rsquo;s website. <br\/><br\/>As previously advised to this committee, the Department commissioned an independent evaluation of JobBridge by Indecon<i>.  <\/i>Given its scale and scope, the Indecon evaluation is, by a considerable margin, the most authoritative review completed to date.  In addition to reviewing administrative data, its findings are based upon a survey group of over 4,400 interns with a response rate of over 53% and a survey group of over 3,000 host organisations with a response rate of over 49%.  The results of this evaluation indicate that about 61% of interns progress into paid employment within a period of five months of completing their internship, with about 36% securing employment immediately on completion of the internship, of whom over 50% enter employment with the host organisation.  These progression outcomes are the highest of any general employment or training programme offered by the State and compare very favourably with similar programmes in other countries.  The outcomes are also reflected in the high levels of satisfaction reported by interns and host organisations.  A total of 89% of interns surveyed felt that JobBridge had given them new skills, 73% said that they were either satisfied or very satisfied with the nature of the work experience and 66% said they would recommend the experience to other job seekers.  Employer and host organisations reported satisfaction levels of approximately 90%.  <br\/><br\/>This is not to say that JobBridge host organisations will always provide a good experience or that interns will always find the experience worthwhile.  However, in order to try to ensure that JobBridge provides a good basis for successful outcomes, the Department applies a number of conditions.  The first condition is the implementation of the standard agreement, which is signed and agreed to by both the intern and the host organisation at the outset of the placement.  This agreement clearly states the terms of the internship, including the expected working hours and the specific learning outcomes the intern will gain over the course of his or her internship.<br\/><br\/>Second, host organisations must agree to the basic terms and conditions of the scheme at the outset and before an application can be validated.  These terms and conditions include the submission of a monthly monitoring and compliance reports.  Third, host organisations must certify that the internship does not displace an existing employee and the host organisation must have no vacancies in the area of activity where the internship is offered.  Fourth, there is a cooling-off period of six months between the end of one internship and the beginning of another.  Fifth, limits related to the size of the host organisation are placed on the number of internships that it can offer.  In addition, the Department provides a toolkit for host organisations including a guide to good mentoring and the elements of a good internship.  The Department also conducts both random on-site inspections and inspections in response to complaints received.  Over 11,800 monitoring visits have been conducted since the scheme&rsquo;s inception, with over 4,600 last year alone.  Reports indicate that 98% of these have been satisfactory.  Remedial action is always taken in cases of non-compliance.<br\/><br\/>The economic environment today is very different to that of four years ago.  There has been a significant and sustained increase in employment and the rate of unemployment continues to fall and is now at a new low of 9.4%.  Therefore, the Department is commissioning a second independent evaluation of the scheme.  The closing date for receipt of tenders was 19<sup><\/sup>October 2015 and the assessment process is ongoing.  It is expected that the evaluation will be completed and a final report published in early 2016.<b><\/b>The results of this review will provide an evidential basis upon which to consider if and how the scheme might best be improved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015110400002#E01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446642000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I will deal with remaining issues.  More broadly on youth employment policies, as opposed to JobBridge on its own, the primary Government strategy to tackle youth unemployment is through policies to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity, primarily through the Action Plan for Jobs.  However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by unemployed job seekers and, in accordance with the EU Council recommendation for a Youth Guarantee, by young job seekers in particular.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the treatment of young people within that strategy.<\/p> <p>  The Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment, education or training within four months of becoming unemployed.  With services such as Intreo, Youthreach, VTOS, PLC programmes and JobBridge, Ireland already had many of the component parts of a Youth Guarantee as suggested by the European Commission.  The main plank of the guarantee in Ireland is to prioritise access to these programmes for young people who become unemployed, with the objective of ensuring that they have an opportunity for employment, further education or work experience within the recommended period of four months of becoming unemployed, as per the EU Council recommendation.  <\/p> <p>  A comprehensive account of the approach to the roll-out of the Youth Guarantee is set out in the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan published in January 2014.  As outlined in the plan, the first intervention is to provide case officer support to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  Accordingly, operating processes have been refined in each of our regions to prioritise the early engagement of young people through Intreo to ensure that all young people receive expert advice and have access to progression options.  That advice may be delivered by the Local Employment Service, LES, where one exists, as is the case in Ballymun, for example.  The LES is not universally available across the country but there is substantial coverage.  In areas where there is no LES, advice will be delivered by the Department's own staff.  In addition, as part of our commitment to engage with 100,000 long-term unemployed people through the Intreo and JobPath processes during 2015, we are prioritising engagement with the approximately 13,000 young people who are already long-term unemployed.  In implementing these processes, the Department is applying learning from the Ballymun Youth Guarantee Pilot Project and making extensive use of the services of the LES and Job Clubs, as was the case in Ballymun.  The description the members heard of the use of inter-agency approaches to developing additional mentoring and programme places is also being applied in a number of other areas in the country, involving youth service organisations, in particular, in the delivery of a programme which I will refer to later.  It is a development from JobBridge.<\/p> <p>  For those who do not find employment through the process just described, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers - over 70% - are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s.  In some cases under the guarantee, access to these programmes has been liberalised for young people.  In the past, such access was much more concentrated on older, long-term unemployed people.<\/p> <p>  In addition we have recently introduced two new programmes specifically for young people.  The first of these is JobsPlus youth, an employment subsidy for unemployed people under 25 years of age which is payable after four months of unemployment.  The subsidy can be up to &euro;416 per month for two years for an employer who takes on a qualified young person.  The duration for access to that programme for older unemployed people is one year.  The second programme is the developmental internships programme First Steps which aims to offer young people who are particularly distant from the labour market a work experience opportunity with sponsor employers.  The witnesses from Ballymun put such people in the \"Group One\" category.  <\/p> <p>  Some of the initiatives that were planned under the Youth Guarantee required primary legislation to allow positive discrimination on age grounds in the provision of employment services and supports.  That legislation was passed late last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015110400002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terry Corcoran"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1446642000,"counter":23,"content":"<p>The launch of the First Steps developmental internship programme and the JobsPlus variant for young people required the passage of that legislation. The legislation also permitted the introduction of earlier and more intensive engagement by Intreo with the young unemployed as compared with older unemployed people.<\/p><p>Under a related initiative, the EURES unit of the Department, which is part of the European employment service network, is currently implementing the Experience Your Europe, EYE, programme.  It operates in parallel with a broader \"Your First EURES Job\" initiative at European level to offer young unemployed people support in taking up employment, work experience and training in other EU countries.  Under the scheme, EURES Ireland can fund some of the training, travel, re-location costs and-or living costs incurred by jobseekers undertaking up to 12 months of training and work experience abroad.  The total budget for the scheme this year is &euro;2.3 million.  Under the co-sponsored placement programme element, young jobseekers between the ages of 18 to 24 are sponsored by an Irish-based company and placed in a partner company in another European country for up to 12 months to gain experience, for example, language skills.  Two pilot projects of this programme commenced in May 2015 resulting in placements in the Netherlands and Germany, with further placements planned in Denmark and Poland in the coming weeks.  The numbers on these are still small but further development and extension of these EYE projects will be informed by the outcome of a review due to take place before the end of this year.<\/p><p>Overall, taking new and existing measures into account, expenditure on programmes providing employment, training and further education opportunities for young people is estimated to be in excess of &euro;500 million in each of the years 2014 and 2015.  We have provided a table setting out the final participation figures for these programmes in 2014.  It is appended to the statement.  As noted earlier, the uptake on programmes was more than 23,000 as compared with the 28,000 overall intended provision.  The lower numbers are partly as a result of the fact that the programmes are demand led.  As my colleague mentioned, participation on programmes such as JobBridge is entirely voluntary and is therefore led by demand from young people and employers.  The lower numbers are also partly due to delays due to the legislative requirement I mentioned earlier.<\/p><p>With regard to funding, of the &euro;500 million expected to be spent in each of those two years, the European Social Fund and the European youth initiative are expected to contribute approximately &euro;60 million a year of the &euro;500 million, which is slightly over 10% of expenditure.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1446642000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>It has been a long presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015110400002#G00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446642000,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I am sorry.

I will put my questions in the order of the presentations.<\/p> <p>  The National Youth Council produced a report earlier this year on JobBridge.  It was quite critical but also highlighted the need for a further analysis, so it is good to hear that the analysis is about to take place.  Has the witness seen anything since the publication of that report that allays the fears that were raised in it?  Has the witness any view on the First Steps programme, which is the equivalent of JobBridge for young people but with a compulsion element as far as I recall?  The report stated that there was a range of poorly designed internships, inadequate mentoring, instances of unacceptable treatment of interns and lack of rights clarity concerning terms and conditions.  Other issues identified included insufficient monitoring and auditing of the scheme to prevent job abuse, job displacement and inadequate income support.<\/p> <p>  The programme undertaken by the Ballymun group under the Youth Guarantee was comprehensive.  It is a model that could be followed, but I am dubious that it will be, particularly given that the Government at the same time as it was encouraging the Ballymun group was developing the JobPath scheme which would take away many of those who could benefit from the intensive work the group was outlining.  Is the group concerned about the development and roll-out of JobPath, which involves private companies taking on some of the role the group would have had previously?  There is an incentive for the company to locate them.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Department's representatives, I have highlighted my views of JobBridge so I will not elaborate on them in detail but I will offer a quick calculation.  My view is that JobBridge is a subsidy for private industry equivalent to over &euro;400 million in the years since it was established.  I supported the Minister when she announced JobsPlus.  If the same subsidy had been put into JobsPlus there would have been more sustainable work.  On the Indecon report, and thankfully there will be a new report, with 43,500 people having participated in JobBridge if one looks at the figures in that report the survey is only based on 5% of the total number of interns.  It was carried out a few years ago so at this stage it is not reflective of the experience and in some ways has been discredited.  It would serve everybody well if we did not use it as a tool.  It was carried out very shortly after JobBridge was launched and probably prior to many of the headline JobBridge cases of abuse or wrong internships being created.  There was one last week where a veterinarian was being sought under JobBridge.  I doubt that was ever the intention of those who designed it, but it has been abused in that way.<\/p> <p>  Finally, how many companies have been blacklisted as a result of the monitoring the witness outlined in the presentation?  Why do we not name and shame the companies that have been involved in abuse of the scheme or abuse of the interns on the scheme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015110400002#G00500","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1446642000,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their interesting presentations.  Is Mr. Power aghast at what he is hearing from the Department?  It is not so much that there is a contradiction but there are huge gaps which Mr. Power outlined in his summary report.  However, according to the summary report there is 22% for very satisfactory, 36% for satisfactory and 11% either way.  That is 69% which would be veering on satisfactory, which lines up with much of what the Department says.  I might be wrong about that but that is the impression.  If there were three things Mr. Power could do tomorrow, what would be the three priorities?  It appears to be working, but there are gaps.  Could Mr. Power tell us what those gaps are?  Also, I note that nearly 1,000 were aged over 55 years.  I do not see any of their reactions in the report.  Perhaps he would comment on that.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the Department's representatives, I recall hearing about, and being fond of, the concept of Gateway.  I do not know if other members remember it, but it was going to be creative, imaginative and implemented through the county councils.  The Youth Guarantee uptake in 2014 was only 192.  Can the Department give an update on Gateway and how it is working?  Also, should there be more in the vocational training opportunities scheme?  The numbers are quite low there.<\/p> <p>  They are quite general questions.  Even as an independent, I consider this to have been an incredible train to get out of a station, and it is working very well.  Many people, including those sitting in front of me, put a great deal of effort into it.<\/p><p>The witnesses are right, and as for the two new training programmes that now are to be brought on board, namely, the First Steps and JobsPlus Youth programmes, it will be interesting to see how they fare and what has been learned from the reports and what to avoid.  I ask Mr. Power and the representatives from the Department to respond to these general questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015110400002#G00600","speaker":"1170","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446642000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their attendance.  My questions are addressed in the main to Mr. Carroll and Mr. Corcoran.  I had some serious difficulties with the JobBridge scheme.  The plan itself was good and offered potential to people to experience work for which they may have just upskilled or whatever.  However, in some cases at least, I believe it was grossly abused.  I am referring to the public sector in particular in this regard and I seek the departmental representatives' comments on that.  For example, where was the plan in respect of providing JobBridge places for teachers or school caretakers?.  Who sanctioned those jobs in the first instance?  Either one has a vacancy for a teacher or one does not.  Similarly, either one has a vacancy for a special needs assistant in a school, or a porter in a school or a hospital or wherever else, or one does not.  While I have not seen a JobBridge placement for a nurse, I am sure that had I looked hard enough I would have found that somebody somewhere was looking for a nurse on JobBridge.  Consequently, I had some serious problems in this regard.  Mr. Carroll referred to specific learning outcomes, SLOs, that should be related to the job.  As no two jobs are exactly the same, was a <i>pro forma<\/i>SLO prepared for each industry or was there an SLO per job offer - that is, was there a process whereby someone from the Department of Social Protection agreed on the SLOs with the prospective organisation that was bringing in the person?  I have spoken to a number of people who participated in the JobBridge scheme and this is the first time I have heard about the SLOs.  I cannot recall any people telling me these were the specific learning outcomes that they were obliged to tick off at the end of their period, these were the ones they managed to cover and these were the ones they did not.<\/p><p>This brings me to a question on displacement.  If people were being placed into jobs as teachers, porters, nurses or whatever, surely real jobs must have been displaced somewhere along the line.  Moreover, if this was happening in the public sector, it certainly must have been exploited terribly in the private sector.  Consequently, I do not accept that there was no displacement.  As for on-site inspections, when were these inspections carried out and by whom?  Was it by someone from the Department of Social Protection?  I am directing these questions specifically to Mr. Carroll at present and I note he is busy writing away.  I refer to the six-month exception whereby, having finished with one person on the JobBridge scheme, an employer must wait six months before taking on another person.  I may be wrong in this regard and someone else may wish to join in, but I believe that if one redefines the terms of the JobBridge placement, one can set up a second one immediately.  Therefore, one could have a stream of people going through one's organisation constantly on JobBridge.  There is no doubt but that what started out as a good thing for people who were unemployed was absolutely horsed and abused by employers in both the private and public sectors.<\/p><p>I will move on to Mr. Corcoran and the Youth Guarantee.  Some great work has been done in the Youthreach programme.  I have visited many Youthreach centres in my time, and some excellent work has also been done in Traveller training centres.  In respect of the back to education allowance, BTEA, scheme and the vocational training and opportunities scheme, VTOS, I have a problem in that a person who is on a BTEA scheme is at a terrible disadvantage when compared with a person who is on VTOS, and I believe the Department has been paring back the latter scheme over the years.  Again, perhaps some of those directly involved will be able to explain this better.  I also have serious problems concerning people who, let us say, were plasterers, mechanics or whatever and who decided to embark on the back to education allowance programme.  I taught information technology myself for a number of years and we were at the top end of the IT industry, if one likes, in the area of networking and maintenance.  The cost of the course could run to &euro;1,000 and that was just for one's textbooks and the supporting material required.  Thereafter, the cost of one's examinations, which are required for one to become professionally accredited, could run to another &euro;100 or &euro;200.  It was the type of course that attracted mainly men, and I met many men who started off with the best of intentions.  However, I remember one man once telling me he did not have enough money to buy a cup of coffee at the coffee break each day.  This was because his back to education allowance, although I am open to correction, was a once-off payment of &euro;600, and - I will conclude shortly - by the time he had paid his voluntary contribution of &euro;350 or &euro;400 to the college giving the course, he then was obliged to buy textbooks, to prepare for all the rest and to take buses in and out.  Consequently, to a certain degree, the back to education allowance is not meeting the requirement and there is not enough of the VTOS.  While I could go on, I will not, but I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh that naming and shaming is good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015110400002#H00200","speaker":"1196"},{"type":"speech","time":1446642000,"counter":31,"content":"<p>The Senator can come back in later if necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015110400002#H00300","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1446642000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>The Senator has stated that JobBridge was totally and absolutely abused.

First, I welcome the presentations by the three groups, which have been useful in informing the joint committee.  I welcome the review announced by the Department.  It had been called for by the National Youth Council and it is good to learn it is being delivered.  Does the Department have a view at this point as to whether there might be a continuing need for JobBridge at a time when unemployment is decreasing at its present rate of improvement?  As for the two surveys to which reference was made, I note that were members only to hear the results therefrom one at a time, they would walk away with a different sense of people's experience in this regard.  The National Youth Council survey found that 27% of participants gained full-time employment, whereas the Indecon survey referred to 61% obtaining paid employment.  Does that definition account for the difference in this regard or is there something beyond that?  On the survey conducted by the National Youth Council, can its representatives clarify whether its survey covers only the 84 people who participated in the sample?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Carroll emphasised that JobBridge is completely voluntary.  I note that certain political parties have made much hay out of references to \"ScamBridge\" and so on, as though people were forced to do it.  Is there an element of force at ground level in respect of activation?  Are people who do not go down this road looked at differently?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015110400002#H01700","speaker":"1013"},{"type":"speech","time":1446642000,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I will not take up much time.  First, this is a really good document.  I have read it a few times and I am really interested in the figures it contains.  I thank Mr. Ian Power, as well as Ms Nuala Whelan and Mr. Mick Creedon of the Ballymun Jobs Centre, for their attendance and the presentation.  On reading through the documents and on hearing the response from the Department, I note the fact that 43,000 people participated in JobBridge and 61% of people progressed into paid jobs.  One element that stuck out about the presentation was the person - I do not know whether it was a young man or a young woman - who said that the first meeting he or she had in Ballymun about the Youth Guarantee scheme might well have turned out to be the most productive and in many ways the most important meeting he or she had ever had.  That is a huge statement for anybody to make - to refer to it as the most important meeting in one's life.  I am sure these people are very young; I do not know how old they were.<\/p><p>Any person that gets any job has his or her whole life turned around and becomes a completely different person.  It leads the person into being able to get up in the morning with something to go to.  It gives the person self-esteem.  Most importantly, it gives a person a few bob in his or her pocket that belongs to him or her.  That makes people very independent.<\/p><p> All of this is very interesting.  I am tired of listening to the idea that people were marched into taking up JobBridge and coasted into working for &euro;50 extra and were exploited.  We have heard stories told at senior level in the last couple of weeks and days.  I could sit here and tell five stories of young people I know personally who were in JobBridge and have all ended up in full-time jobs.  Of those five, three had never worked before while two had worked in what I would call very mediocre jobs.  For two of those people, their lives have been turned around completely.  They have gone back to education at night supported by the companies that are now fully employing them.  Whether it is 61% or 1%, if one person in every hundred gets a job, it is thousands of people.  If that one person changes his or her life, who he or she is and where he or she has come from, it is a success.  If anybody is exploiting JobBridge, it is the people themselves as the survey has said who could not agree or disagree whether it was a good experience.  The 43% of people who could not agree or disagree were not marched in to do the JobBridge course.  They went voluntarily.  Like anybody who takes up a job, one either likes it or one does not.  That is my base.  One either likes one's job or one does not.  If one does not like it, one clears out of it and does something else.<\/p><p> I emphasise that the point being missed is as follows.  I hear the idea that this is not a real job all the time on the doorstep and from different parties in the D&aacute;il and Seanad and I am taken aback.  If that one person was in my family and his or her life was changed to lead him or her in a different direction, I would consider it all to have been worthwhile.  We can fish with numbers, do everything we like and disagree or agree, but when one person gets a job, his or her life changes completely.  That is the positive thing that has happened with JobBridge and I know many of the participants including people in my own family.  It changes people forever and, as such, we should not sit here and criticise whether it was 4%, 5% or 10%.  A person's life changes when he or she gets a job.<\/p><p> I thank the witnesses for the presentation.

In terms of the study, it was qualitative and looked at the experiences not just the numbers, to respond to what Deputy Byrne was saying.  Of those surveyed, two thirds were generally satisfied while one third was dissatisfied.  We are trying to be constructive in terms of what can be improved and the Deputy asked about three aspects.  With JobBridge, it should be the case that one cannot do the job when one starts it.  One should have to learn the skills over the duration of the period in order for it to have been a meaningful experience.  What we found from talking to young people was that they were not adequately mentored.  The space and time was not provided by supervisors, which is the big area of concern.  They were not getting the learning outcomes and were having those issues.  There was some concern about displacement.  That is not in the majority, it is the minority, and I understand that there are a lot of people who have benefited.  However, we want that experience for everyone who participates, not just a certain number.  I take that point as it is very important.<\/p> <p>  I turn briefly to the Youth Guarantee.  A huge level of support is required for some young people who may have been at a distance from the labour market for some time, which is why the Youth Guarantee is so useful.  It breaks it down into different groups and addresses the needs of those young people personally because not everybody is homogenous.  Everybody is different in terms of background and where they would like to go.  We have a concern in regard to the provision of the places - the 23 versus the 28 - that are planned and we do not have any visibility of the strategy for 2015 and 2016.  It is a positive thing and we have learned how well it works from Ballymun.  We want to see it happening in every community in Ireland, which is why we say we need a strategy and a plan and the money.<\/p> <p>  When the Youth Guarantee was initially being discussed, there was talk of approximately &euro;130 million per annum in funding from Europe.  We have confirmation now that it is approximately &euro;60 million.  Why is that difference there?  We would like to know about it.  While there is not necessarily a need for a huge amount of money, there is a need for somebody in each community like the Ballymun jobs centre to co-ordinate, get everyone around the table and knock heads together.  It is someone to say that there are employers who can offer X amount of work experience, ask who is interested in it and join the dots.  That is what is important from our perspective.  I pass over to James Doorley to address some of the concerns about the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015110400002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Power"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446642000,"counter":53,"content":"<p>As Ian Power said, when we were starting out, we found a lot of young people saying that experience was a huge issue for them.  As such, we obviously support the JobBridge scheme.  Our report was primarily qualitative.  We wanted to get the experience of young people.  The Indecon report is extensive.  However, while there is a great deal of good data in it and there were certain questions it asked, there were questions from our perspective which it did not ask.  There were things it did not look at.  As such, we welcome the fact that a new report is being prepared.  It is important that it is not just based on the data and that we must engage with the participants.  We found that there were many things of which we were not aware until we spoke to young people who had participated in the scheme.  One of the things we would like to see in the second report is something Indecon recommended itself.  It said we need a control group and to compare JobBridge with people who did not participate it.  Saying it is either 61% or 27% is not possible until we have that control group.  That would be useful, as we would then learn what the added value of JobBridge was.  There is a question as to whether some of those people would have got jobs without the intervention of a scheme.  I acknowledge that the Department has done that in a range of other schemes and it is useful for it to know whether the schemes are adding value or blocking people.<\/p> <p>  On the First Steps internship scheme, we have concerns about any internship scheme.  As Paul Carroll said earlier, JobBridge is voluntary.  It may be that it has changed but the initial design of First Steps indicated that young people would be selected and told that they were now participating in the scheme.  We are very clear that we support young people getting work experience, which many of them want.  However, there is something about the concept of internships.  Ross Perlin wrote a very good book about internships and their history.  The whole idea of an internship or apprenticeship is about the exchange of skills and progression.  The idea is that one does an internship on the basis that while one is now working in some respects for no remuneration, one is gaining skills.  One can then say that when one finishes the internship, one is going somewhere, will get a job and will progress.<\/p><p>In our report, that motivation came out very clearly.  When I spoke to young people, the key thing was to get experience and get on the jobs ladder.  If young people are told they must participate in First Steps without that support and the sense that they are going somewhere, we think it would be detrimental.  We think it needs a lot of work to work out how it will be achieved. <\/p><p> In response to Senator O'Donnell, in the report we found that about one third were dissatisfied.  We want it to be better for more people.  I spoke to young people who had very good experiences and those who had experiences that were not as good where bad things happened during internships.  Sometimes it was as a result of their own understanding of what they were engaging in.  The Senator is right in that some of them were in the workforce for the first time.  From our point of view, it is about how we can improve what is there.  JobBridge has certainly delivered for some people but given that we are spending roughly about &euro;80 million per annum and the State is running the internship scheme, we need to deliver more.<\/p><p> In respect of some other points-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015110400002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Doorley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446642000,"counter":55,"content":"<p>What about the 900 people over 50?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015110400002#K00200","speaker":"1170"},{"type":"speech","time":1446642000,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I must just move on if Mr. Doorley does not mind and the Senator can come back later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015110400002#K00300","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446642000,"counter":57,"content":"<p>No problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015110400002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Doorley"},{"type":"speech","time":1446642000,"counter":58,"content":"<p>To be fair, there are nearly 1,000 people in the scheme who are aged over 55.

I hope they are not there today.  I would be confident that the quality of our service and staff in the job centres speaks for itself.  It remains to be seen whether the organisations involved in the JobPath programme can achieve that standard.  That would be the first thing I would say and I would certainly hope it is complementary.<\/p> <p>  I understand the idea of JobPath started because there was a need to increase the number of case officers or guidance practitioners that would be available to assist unemployed people given the large increase in the numbers.  In that sense, we hope that JobPath is complementary to ourselves because there is not enough capacity within the service to provide a good-quality service to unemployed people.  This has been acknowledged in the Pathways to Work document.  It raises the issue of the ratio of guidance practitioners to unemployed persons.  That ratio in the Youth Guarantee was at international norms, at about 150 to one.  This made a significant contribution to the success of the pilot.  In addition, all of the guidance staff had a background and a qualification in guidance.  I remember how at the beginning of the pilot, we had to send in a list of their qualifications to the national steering committee.  Since the end of the pilot, we have stopped the intensive support that was there during the pilot because of our other commitments and gone back to our normal work.  Our ratio has gone up and is about 250 to one.  Whether it is a coincidence or not, we slowly phased out the pilot from the end of December 2014 to April 2015.  Since the end of the intensive support that was available in the pilot, the number of people under the age of 25 signing on in Ballymun has gone up.  While it came down by 29% during the pilot, it has gone up by 10% since then because we do not have the proper ratio of guidance practitioners to unemployed persons.  There is a lesson there for us.  I certainly hope JobPath is not there to take our jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015110400002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mick Creedon"},{"type":"speech","time":1446642000,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Carroll or Mr. Corcoran like to come in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015110400002#K00900","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446642000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I will respond to a number of questions because they are of a similar nature.  The first relates to survey results and what they tell us.  It is very clear that there are a variety of views relating to JobBridge, its effectiveness and whether it is a worthwhile experience for people.  It is critically important that we listen to the views of participants.  We welcome the publication of the National Youth Council of Ireland survey.  The Minister of State and I met with Mr. Doorley and his team to discuss it and there is much in it that we will take on board in reviewing the effectiveness of the scheme.  It is very important to note that it was based on the responses from 84 self-selecting respondents, seven of whom subsequently took part in one-to-one interviews.  This compares with the Indecon report involving 2,364 interns and over 1,500 host organisations.  That may go some way towards explaining the difference between the results.  That report was wholly independent.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Power raised the issue of his hope or expectation that the evaluation we will commence very shortly will have those one-to-one interviews to get in-depth comment from people.  I can assure him that they will and that, similarly, it will have a number of important elements.  It will have an econometric review that will look at and address the issue raised by Mr. Power, which is hugely important, namely, what would have happened in any event.  It will certainly look at a control group to give us some indication as to how these people would have fared if the scheme was not there.  It will involve the surveying of all participants in the scheme and case studies with people that will get into some of those issues in depth.  I hope this provides some assurance in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's comments on First Steps and the report, there is a degree of misunderstanding relating to First Steps and the degree to which compulsion is seen as being an issue.  With First Steps, we are talking about young people who are extremely marginalised and disadvantaged and who even during the Celtic tiger era had no prospect of gaining employment.  It is a hugely resource-intensive programme.  We are asking host organisations to give these young people a chance.  The Department is also significantly committing in terms of providing ongoing support to those individuals.  What is being asked of the individual is that the level of commitment on the part of a host organisation or the Department is reciprocated.  Clearly, there is no point in dragging people kicking and screaming into a scheme.  Due to misunderstandings about it and having listened to what has been said in respect of the report, I am reviewing the First Steps scheme to see whether those misconceptions can be better addressed to ensure we get better outcomes for the participants.  <\/p> <p>  It is very important to emphasise and re-emphasise that JobBridge is wholly voluntary.  The Department acts as a facilitator.  What we are asking employers to do is to advertise a job if they have one.  This is what they should be doing.  If there is no job but the employer wants to provide a worthwhile work experience opportunity for somebody, it can do so.  In doing so, it should set out what it considers to be the intended learning outcomes for the participant.  The Deputy asked where these SLOs come in.  I presume SLO is an abbreviation for specific learning.  It is the host organisation which says, \"This is what we are offering and this is what we think you will learn\".  Jobseekers look at that and decide whether they are attracted to that.  If they are not attracted, that is fine.  If they think that it is for them and apply and for whatever reason, it does not work out for them, they can give a week's notice and leave.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned about the language that is used relating to abuse or exploitation.  There is no element of compulsion, there is no fallout from it and there are no questions asked other than how it went for the participant and given that it clearly did not work out, the reason why it did not work out so that we can provide support, advice and guidance in respect of what the participant should do next.  That is the issue.<\/p><p>Again, there is a misconception.  Why did we get almost 18,000 host organisations to provide opportunities for 43,500 people?  It is because jobseekers are not homogenous and have very different needs.  The Deputy has referred to people who come from disadvantaged, marginalised backgrounds and jobless households.  What they want is to get a leg on the ladder for the first time.  We are talking about people with low levels of educational attainment who want to enter into low level jobs.  Let us not be snobbish about this.  There is nothing wrong with wanting to work in a shop, be a caretaker or a cleaner, if that is the person's choice.  However, they cannot find a job as a cleaner or a retail sales assistant because they have never worked and do not know anybody who does.  They want a chance and Ms Whelan has clearly articulated and acknowledged the value of the JobBridge scheme to the young people of Ballymun. <\/p><p> On the other extreme, we receive job offers, including as a veterinary assistant, and it is assumed that is an abuse of the scheme.  Why is it considered to be an abuse of the scheme?  Is it because a person has received a third level education and a qualification?  He or she does, but he or she lacks practical experience.  That is what is being provided for through JobBridge.  It is said there is no added value or learning opportunity, but JobBridge does what it says on the tin: it provides people with an opportunity to gain work experience.  Therefore, to answer the point made by Mr. Power, the job placement offer should be such that the person would not have been able to do it otherwise.  Is that the lesson?   Let us say, for example, that the person knows how to do it but has been unable to find a job.  What people want is to be able to put on their CV that they have worked with someone.<\/p><p> The learning outcomes will be different.  The person who has graduated from college, where he or she may well have learned to do certain things, wants practical experience.  Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh indicated that the Indecon report had, in some way, been \"discredited\".  That is an inappropriate word to use.  Nothing has been said or done to indicate that the Indecon report was discredited.  It is wholly independent and valuable.  Undoubtedly, given the variety of views and perspectives that can be taken on JobBridge, the Indecon report is by far the most authoritative and independent source of data.  It reviews administrative data and significant numbers of participants were engaged with, but it was of its day.  Undoubtedly, the economic climate has changed in the past four years and it is because of this that the Department wants to carry out a new review.  It will take on board the comments made about the scope of the evaluation.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked why the Department was reluctant to name the organisations that had been suspended from participation in the JobBridge scheme.  In that context, it is important to acknowledge that participation by the host organisation is wholly voluntary.  We must be careful not to put people off.  Organisations can be suspended from participation in JobBridge for a variety of reasons.  For example, there is a requirement that a host organisation ensure compliance with a standard agreement.  In regard to monitoring visits, Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell asked about who, why and when.  The visits are conducted by departmental staff, case officers who interview the intern and host organisation at the place where the work experience is being gained.  Visits have been conducted from the outset of the scheme and will continue.  To date, approximately 25% of all internships have been reviewed, of whcih 98% have been fully compliant.<\/p><p> It is important to have a proper perspective of the scheme.  I may have one view, while others may have a different one on the value of the scheme, but let us talk to those who are using it to hear what they have to say.  What they are saying is, \"This is good for us.\"  There are certainly issues; we need to look at how we can enhance the experience in order that everybody will benefit from it.  They are not necessarily abuses of the scheme.  Some organisations have engaged in minor breaches of it.  In these circumstances, we consider it appropriate, for example, that they be suspended from participation in the scheme for a period of six months.  If we were to name these organisations or if organisations felt they might be named - we have seen the unfair, unwarranted and negative publicity associated with the scheme which is not supported by the facts - it would, undoubtedly, put them off participating.  I consider a six-month suspension to be an appropriate response to a minor misdemeanour and that to publish or disclose the names would be punitive and not proportionate to the offence committed.<\/p><p> While the Department is fully aware of its obligations under freedom of information legislation and how the public interest might best be served by disclosing the names, it is also aware of the provision in section 36(1)(b) of the Act that we should not engage in activity that would result in a company suffering a financial loss.  We have seen instances where organisations have threatened to picket host organisations simply for advertising on JobBridge.  The likely effect of this might be to cause customers of the organisation or shop in question not to enter.  We have an obligation to protect organisations, which is why the names are not being published, not that we are doing things behind closed doors.  We recognise there is a public interest to be served, but there are serious concerns in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015110400002#K01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446642000,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I will stop Mr. Carroll there in order that we can take supplementary questions from members, including me.

There is little or no doubt that in parts of the public service the moratorium on recruitment meant that job vacancies went unfilled.  Some of them were filled through the JobBridge scheme.  I accept that people took these jobs voluntarily, but there were no prospects when they took them that at the end of the six months there would be a job for them as there was no sanction.  That is where the word \"exploitation\" comes in.  It arises in the specific cases where it was known at the time the jobs were advertised, that there would be no jobs available at the end of the six months.  Mr. Carroll has said that if an organisation has a job to offer, it should advertise it and fill the post.  However, we have a situation where a moratorium is preventing an organisation from employing a caretaker.  It will bring in a caretaker under the JobBridge scheme, but there will be no job on offer at the end of the six months.  Also, there is no mentor in place to assist in achieving specific learning outcomes and no training will take place.  Essentially, what happens is the person in question is handed the keys as caretaker and told to work for six months.  He or she receives an extra &euro;50 a week and everybody is happy.

The area I represent is an inner-city working class or non-working class area.  I grew up in an area with manufacturing with Lambs jam, Rowntree Mackintosh and the Fleetwood brush factory.  One could leave school at 14 and have a job the next day without any qualifications.  Times have changed for many people, but a certain group comes through the school system with a very poor standard of education and JobBridge is very suited to them because it gives them an opportunity.  The Chairman said it very well with regard to companies feeling a moral responsibility in communities and I see it in my area.  They are very glad to take on young people who do not have huge qualifications or a good leaving certificate which, perhaps, they barely passed.  These employers are willing to give them an opportunity and this is where JobBridge is very important.<\/p> <p>  I heard what the representatives of Ballymun Jobs Centre said with regard to the increase in the numbers of young people since the pilot project was phased out.  It is important for us as public representatives to know this.  We are supposed to be the eyes and ears of every community but we are not capable of doing so.  I am not God, let us face it, and I cannot see everything and anything that goes on without organisations such as Ballymun Jobs Centre feeding me information.  Meetings such as this are about getting information, bringing it to a higher level in the political party which is in government and insisting projects such as these have an opportunity to continue their work because they are very valued.  Whoever is in government has a responsibility to look after the people in this middle bracket who have not gone to college and do not have good leaving certificate results and get them experience for jobs.  These schemes have criteria and if companies are taking on people without giving them an opportunity to learn, understand and progress it is a huge problem and it must be addressed.<\/p> <p>  I know a man who went into a job which did not require the qualifications he had.  He told me he did so because he no longer wanted to lie in bed in the mornings and did not want to be seen as somebody who just did not want to work and receive a payment every week.  After a short time, not even nine months, he got a very good job.  We cannot forget about these people, who are in their 40s and 50s.<\/p><p>In general I have no problem with people saying negative or inspiring things during this debate.

There is not explicit compulsion.  However, for a young person whose rate is &euro;100 a week with an additional &euro;50 a week if he or she participates in JobBridge, because of the lack of provision in other schemes, JobBridge is the only show in town.

Young people are expected to survive on sums that we do not expect people aged 27 to survive on.

Some young people took the view that, being on &euro;144 a week, they would go on JobBridge and get some extra money, but some of them were forced into opportunities with which they were not particularly enamoured.

Perhaps we will be able to return to a situation in which those internships are paid, which would be the ideal situation, but this is part of a suite of things we should be pursuing.

Elements of the support provided for in the back to education allowance were cut severely during the period of austerity.  For some individuals at the margins, those cuts make a difference.  None the less, it is true that 60,000 people have taken up opportunities under the back to education allowance since 2009.  Members may have seen in today's newspapers that a review was recently carried out of the back to education allowance.  There are some questions over its success in the short-term in achieving employment outcomes.  We think the long-term outcomes for parts of the programme will be significantly better.  The evidence is pointing that way.  None the less, it is being examined consistently.  The comparison between it and VTOS is an issue that has been raised.  VTOS is run by the Department of Education and Skills, whereas the back to education allowance, although people are attending educational programmes, is managed by our Department.

I have wrecked my own brains trying to figure out how we could tailor the system better.

In that regard, there has been an increased allocation of special needs assistants, SNAs, and teachers for schools this year.  A small number of those positions have been advertised.  The Senator is right to say that unions will ensure there is no displacement, as will the Department.  If a school has a job for a teacher or SNA, it should advertise for that job and recruit a teacher or an SNA.  In the Senator's example, the school did not have the money and had reached its allocation.  Is there an opportunity for someone to do something in the school that represents a valuable contribution to school life or pupils as well as a valuable work experience opportunity for that person?  This is what is happening.  A school advertised for a caretaker or a cleaner and someone, for reasons best known to himself or herself, found it to be a worthwhile opportunity.  I find it difficult to see what is wrong with that.  The person has not displaced a cleaner because, in such instances, we contact the school, ask whether it had a caretaker last year and, if so, ensure that it advertises for and recruits a caretaker this year.<br\/><br\/>Schemes of this nature run two risks, the first of which is displacement - namely, that there is a job but the body will not offer it and will instead offer an internship.  The second is dead weight - that is, if the scheme did not exist, the person would none the less have progressed on to something.  In my opening address, I tried to explain the kinds of activity that we are engaged in to minimise these risks.  Indecon, which carried out the survey, found the level of displacement to be 3%.  We are considering the way in which Indecon calculated that figure.  During the course of the survey last year, it asked employers what they would otherwise have done.  As part of the forthcoming survey, there will be a detailed analysis of this figure and a comparison with what is happening in the sector generally.  We hope to have a more robust indication.<br\/><br\/>It is also fair to say that, when the scheme was introduced, the country was in bad shape.  The live register was at 460,000 people and the thinking at the time was that it would hit 500,000.  The country has turned itself around and there has been a dramatic improvement in recent years.  In other countries, there is usually a lag after a recession and it takes a number of years of economic growth before there is an increase in employment.  Remarkably, this has not been the case in Ireland.  Our economy has been jobs-led.  I contend that schemes such as JobBridge and JobsPlus have made a contribution to that.  No jobs were being offered and the country was on its knees.  Either we decide not to do anything about that, remain idle and wait for the economy to turn around, or we determine whether we can do anything to help businesses that are struggling and do not have the capital to recruit and whether we can provide opportunities to keep people attached to the labour market, be they new entrants, new university graduates who need experience or people who have left school.  Are they to sit idly for four years and wait for the economy to pick up?<br\/><br\/>The Senator gave an example of someone who wanted to change jobs.  JobBridge is a successful vehicle in that regard.  Having worked as a construction worker, someone might realise that the times are a-changing and he or she cannot get another job in that space, so JobBridge is an opportunity to get experience doing something else.  It is also an incentive for employers to recruit that person.  This is what the scheme is about.<br\/><br\/>As the economy improves, the risk of displacement will undoubtedly increase.  Some employers have more money in their pockets, but the numbers on JobBridge are already decreasing.  During the course of the evaluation, we will examine why that is happening.  I hate anecdote and criticise others for using it, which is why we have commissioned an external evaluation, but some of the anecdotal information that I am receiving is that companies are having to offer jobs in order to get or keep people.  A company might have invested in an intern for four months, but if a job is available elsewhere, he or she might go for it.<br\/><br\/>Regarding mentoring, the reality of a scheme of this nature is that there must be no displacement, even in the public sector.  One must not be advertising in that space.  People claim that there has been wholesale abuse of the scheme and there are rolling internships.  One cannot advertise the same role again; what one advertises must be different.  If committee members or members of the public have concerns in this respect, they should notify me.  There is a &quot;Contact Us&quot; facility on <i>www.jobsireland.ie<\/i>.  If there is an allegation of abuse of the scheme or a participant, I would love to hear of it and investigate.<br\/><br\/>Mentoring will relate to the experience of the intern and the position that is available.  Depending on the nature of the work experience opportunity and the skill set of the intern, some jobs may require a great deal of mentoring while others may not.  In the latter, it might be a case of Mr. Corcoran, for example, being shown what to do and, if he has a problem thereafter, someone is there to help.

With regard to our study, which Deputy Ryan mentioned as well, as a youth council the issue of JobBridge had arisen frequently and as Mr. Carroll said, there is a lot of anecdotal evidence but that is of little use.  We wanted to do a study but we had limited resources.  We could have approached the Department for funding but, first, it might not have given it to us and, second, it might be perceived as not being independent.<\/p> <p>  It is important to state that while 84 young people responded, seven of whom I met in a structured one-to-one interview, and the details of the methodology is contained in the full report, the issue was to try to get a snapshot because we wanted to get some evidence to bring to Mr. Carroll, his colleagues and others who are working in the area.  Mr. Carroll put it correctly.  The INDECON report is an excellent report.  I have no queries about it but was it of its time?  INDECON also mentions in its report that 72% of the people who were on JobBridge at that time and who participated in its survey had previous work experience.  These were people who were primarily victims of the recession.  That probably reflects the fact that young people have found it more difficult because many young people were coming out of education and training without work experience.  <\/p> <p>  I would also make the point that self-selection might be part of the reason for the difference, as Deputy Ryan said.  Some questions were raised about our study being self-selecting but, in fairness, the study INDECON did regarding their much larger numbers was also self-selecting because people were asked to participate and some people responded.  Some did not, however, and it is important to put on the record that we accept that our report is small-scale.  We just did not have the resources to do a big one.<\/p> <p>  I met with young people who had very good experiences but there were problems.  Many young people were willing to put up with things for the six to nine months because they knew if they complained they may not get the reference to move on.  That is the reality.  Many people keep their heads down.<\/p> <p>  The cooling off period was mentioned by Senator Craughwell.  As Mr. Carroll said, one is not allowed to recruit a new person to the same position for six months.  Some of the people I met were very clear that there was abuse of that because some host organisations were changing the title of a position and were able to get around the six month period.  It was not widespread but it was happening.  I just wanted to make those final comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015110400002#P01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Doorley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446642000,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I must state that I have no absolute evidence that the increase in the numbers signing on in Ballymun in terms of the under 25s is a direct cause of the end of the pilot, but all I would say is that it is a fact.<\/p> <p>  On the pilot, we reorganised the local employment services, LES.

The policies being followed aim towards the most important objective, which is to get people back into jobs.  That is the largest single element of the Government's policies in this area.  Obviously, there is a good deal of evidence, with falling unemployment and rising employment, that this part of the plan is working.<\/p> <p>  The other element of the guarantee implementation plan was the issue of substantial engagement with the newly-unemployed young jobseekers.  The resources for that are being delivered in part by the use of local employment services.  Increasingly, they are being delivered by the movement to JobPath, which is releasing resources inside the Department to undertake more detailed engagement with young jobseekers at the beginning of their unemployment spell.  That was done in this case as well.<\/p> <p> What happened in terms of unemployment in Ballymun?  It is important to note that it is unlike the overall process planned for the Youth Guarantee relating to engaging with newly-unemployed young people.  Given the scale of the resources deployed in Ballymun, every young person on the live register, regardless of duration, was approached during a brief period.  This was done comprehensively in a way that could not be done nationally - the resources simply would not be available.  That was part of the impact.<\/p> <p>  While unemployment may have risen a little during this year for young people in Ballymun, there are seasonal elements at play.  Unemployment is still down year on year in Ballymun.  It is down by 9% on the same period last year.  It is not down by as much as it was at the turn of the year, but, in part at least, that is to do with the fact that we had a major engagement with all young people on the live register and a significant programme provision was made.  Those people cannot stay on programmes forever.  We cannot go on repeating those processes with the same people over and over.

We have given the committee a detailed written submission.  In view of the time constraints, I will pick a few highlights from it and leave the committee to study the detail.<\/p> <p>  Muintir na T&iacute;re is a national voluntary organisation dedicated to promoting the process of community development.  It was founded in 1937 and aims to enhance the capacity of people in communities to become involved in local social, economic, cultural and environmental development.  For the past 30 years, we have actively promoted the community alert programme in partnership with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This programme continues to harness the voluntary input of community members to provide a community crime prevention programme in over 1,400 community alert groups nationwide.  The programme operates with the five principal partners, Muintir na T&iacute;re, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Health Service Executive and, most importantly, local communities.  The programme is operated by five community alert development officers, one for each Garda region outside of the Dublin area.  My colleague, Mr. Cronin, is the development officer for the south west of the country.  The engagement that we have with all those local groups enables us to identify many issues arising in the area of crime prevention which is relevant to this committee.  The current issues can be summarised under a number of categories - the seniors alert scheme, pendant alarms and changes that have been made to that scheme recently; Garda resources; the judicial system; adequate deterrents to crime, funding; and victim support.  In our written submission, we have details under all of these categories but I will concentrate on the recommendations that we make in section 6.<\/p> <p>  We suggest the establishment of a special purpose committee to examine rural crime.  This could be similar to the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, which had a limited lifetime and budget but which was asked to make specific and practical recommendations.  This would allow for more public consultation than this committee will have time for and could instil a sense of participation in the communities that take part.  <\/p> <p>  We strongly support the provisions in the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill - currently going through the Houses - regarding consecutive sentencing and refusal of bail for repeat offenders.  We agree that the right to freedom and the presumption of innocence need to be weighed against the constitutional protection afforded to a citizen's dwelling and we feel this Bill offers a balanced approach to these issues.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the recent establishment of the second Special Criminal Court and hope it will significantly reduce the time it takes to process cases.  However, it must be adequately resourced and must not simply be a reallocation of resources from elsewhere in the Courts Service.  We request a review of the free legal aid programme, of its costs and efficiency of delivery.  While recognising a right of legal representation, we feel this should be reviewed for repeat offenders.  Consideration should be given to reducing the representation for legal offenders and possibly treating the costs of this representation as a repayable loan.  We also request a review of the allocation of resources to crime prevention and crime detection and punishment.<\/p><p>We believe a slight shift towards prevention could have significant impact.  This would include an expansion of the community alert, neighbourhood watch and crime prevention ambassador programmes.  Such a review should also value voluntary input and examine ways of recognising it.  For example, it may be possible to make a contribution towards the costs of properly established text message alert programmes.  Currently, communities must cover all the costs associated with these programmes, including texts, insurance, signage and VAT.<\/p><p> We request a review of the prison system, including a review of the balance between cost and security.  Such a review should also consider non-custodial options which might be appropriate in certain cases, including tagging, curfews, transport restrictions and expanded community service programmes.  We would also suggest a review of anti-social behaviour in built-up areas, villages or estates and how anti-social behaviour is currently dealt with, and an examination of options for practical and fast sanctions and how to expedite landlords' abilities to terminate the leases of undesirable tenants.<\/p><p> Since Muintir na T&iacute;re made its submission, the Minister has made proposals in a number of these areas, and we welcome the proposals as a first step.  I thank the committee for its time and I am happy to take questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Garvey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I thank the witness for his excellent presentation.

The ambassador programme involved training those older people who had time to spare in issues around crime prevention and how they could advise others on crime.  The volunteers then visited the houses in their area where older or vulnerable people lived.  They were able to supply information from the Garda and advise people on how to secure their homes and look after themselves.  The programme was primarily about crime prevention but included some health advice.  At the end of the programme, the volunteers were rewarded with thanks and recognised with a certificate.

The EU directive, which has been partially implemented, does provide for that level of support.  The Garda generally issues two letters to a victim, one at the beginning of an investigation and one when a perpetrator is identified.  The feedback from victims is that this is not enough, as the correspondences can be too far apart.  In order for victims to receive more feedback, they would like to have personal contact with a member of the force who is investigating the crime.  There are restrictions on what victims can be told, but at least they could be reassured that something is happening.  In a case that may take two years to bring to fruition it can be a long time in which to hear nothing.  E-mail has been suggested as a quick way of keeping victims informed about a case's progression.  Muintir na T&iacute;re would concentrate on promoting victim support through the Garda, as that is what victims want and appreciate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#C01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Garvey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":197,"content":"<p>CCTV is an issue that is constantly raised at community meetings, and the major success of CCTV is seen in the divisions where it has been introduced on a fairly widespread basis.

Communities in west Cork, in co-operation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the county council and local sponsors, have raised the necessary finance to install CCTV in various towns and villages throughout the division.  The success of the CCTV can be seen in the division's crime statistics, which are among the lowest in Ireland.  It is a very large area and it would take a person about two hours to drive in any direction north, south, east or west.  Crime has a way of thriving in remote areas, but CCTV can be important at the choke points.  Communities and garda&iacute; are very good at identifying where the choke points are.

Our experience shows that where groups are set up to implement the text alert guidelines correctly and where there is a body of such groups in a district then crime is reduced in those areas.

Anti-social behaviour is one of the more important issues that needs to be dealt with in towns and housing estates where people who have purchased homes are unfortunate enough to be neighbours of individuals who are making their life a misery.  It is an issue that has become more prevalent at the meetings I attend.  In some areas, one would imagine there is an organised systemic campaign to drive people out of their homes.  It is the issue of the future and it is growing.  There is a victim-bully relationship in certain cases where the individual is afraid of the bullies and afraid to make a statement to the Garda and afraid to use legal means.  It is necessary to create some system where a community group can act as an individual and make a statement of complaint and take a case on behalf of their community to change the way certain estates are being ruined by individuals who could not care less about their neighbours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#C02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Diarmuid Cronin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cronin.

I attended a number of meetings at which Muintir na T&iacute;re representatives spoke about their experience in other areas.  It is a tremendous organisation.  Its recommendations and the issues that arise at community alert meetings are a tremendous help because they are about people on the ground.  Its recommendations and observations are food for thought for those overseeing the criminal justice system.  Our committee compiled a report on penal reform which looked at community sanctions rather than imprisonment.  I am interested to note that the organisation is looking at electronic tagging and other forms rather than incarceration, based on the analysis of the threat the person poses.

The witnesses may have different experiences from county to county but my sense is that with a new policing authority assuming responsibility for them, I hope they can get a fresh lease of life because it is important that senior police officers work at it.

After the new committees bed in it will be interesting to see if there will be a different approach or more commonality.  They are an important forum for discussion and what happens after that.  In some ways we have a dual system because in community alert we have regular district meetings.  Our strategy document used to ask for four district meetings per annum.  We now have two because of the sheer volume of meetings.  Any forum where there can be a good discussion about issues affecting the community is positive provided there is a means to take the considered judgment of the forum up the ladder and make some effort to change.  The important issue is the desire to change rather than the nuts and bolts of the actual change.<\/p> <p>  We mentioned sentencing earlier.  Sentencing is probably the most difficult area in which to make major changes because if a person is sentenced to incarceration with limited space that will not go anywhere fast.  We need to be more imaginative and always to follow the money.  If an individual has finances, property or a vehicle, ways and means should be put in place to punish him by sequestering his assets.  If a criminal is carrying out raids throughout the country and owns a vehicle, the vehicle should be seized.  If he has a driver's licence, it should be taken from him.  If he has a passport, his opportunities to enjoy his ill-gotten gains in Spain or wherever should be limited.  If an individual comes into property and if it changes hands at some stage, the loans he receives for free legal aid during the course of his life should be paid back.  If a young criminal starting out in life sees that this is a career that will give him a nice lifestyle, that can be countered by making the free legal aid a loan repayable out of his benefits.  There are many imaginative ways of dealing with an individual besides sending him to jail.  In the present age of development of technology, electronic tagging has a major future.  The number of awful crimes committed - murders and worse, if anything is worse - by people who are out on bail is such that beggars belief that it has been allowed to continue for so long.  The problem is that there is no space in jails to keep people.  Therefore tagging is important.<\/p> <p>  There is a major security industry across Ireland.  There are fleets of security vans criss-crossing the country as well as the Garda fleet.  It should be possible to create a system where at any time of the day or night an individual can be checked to see whether he is where he is supposed to be.

What Mr. Cronin has asked for, rather than focusing on Garda station closures, is more resources for community alert and text alert programmes.   I am a big supporter of these programmes, having seen waves of crime and criminal gangs so many times in Donegal.  The only way to truly defeat them is with the community working hand in hand with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I love the idea of whole swathes of townlands looking out for suspicious behaviour and, in particular, vulnerable elderly people.  It is the way to go.<\/p><p>With Garda station closures, I am concerned about the perception of security, particularly for elderly people.  Will the witness provide some thoughts on the wider issues?  For example, if a Garda station is to be closed, we need to resource community alert and ensure it operates.

The closing of the stations has not saved money.  The problem is the local community wants to see garda&iacute; around but without a fleet, that is not possible.  The garda&iacute; need to be mobile and able to put up a checkpoint on quiet rural roads.  Besides the motorways, there is a fantastic network of roads in rural Ireland that takes people into the most remote places.<\/p> <p>  The garda in a local station must have a proper office.  It is no use just having a building, as he or she needs a computer with broadband access and everything that goes with it.  The garda must be able to do the job efficiently, and technology and up-to-date information in the office is an absolute must.  There is that aspect to it.  Where community alert groups and garda&iacute; are working well, there is a low crime rate.  Taking it by division and where district meetings are being held religiously, with a relationship built up by the communities and garda&iacute;, and where information is coming in a two-way conversation, text alert has revolutionised the ability of the garda&iacute; to get relevant information quickly to thousands of people in a district or division.  We can see through statistics the divisions where this is working well and being used properly by garda&iacute; against districts and divisions where the process is still only finding its feet.  We can consider the figures, comparing towns, but the statistics speak for themselves.<\/p> <p>  I will mention Mallow district, which had 22 burglaries during September.

There has been much talk of post office closures but post offices in some areas could be used as a one day per week Garda station at certain times.  We also have a network of approximately 180 to 190 community councils dotted around the country.  Most of those councils have community centres and halls, and there is also the possibility that Garda stations could be put in those on a day per week or fortnight.

This aspect of the debate is frequently left out.  It is a matter of what garda&iacute; stationed in a particular station are doing during their eight-hour shift.  Consider the community policing practices of the Metropolitan Police in London.  A regular police officer spends at least six hours of his or her eight-hour shift on the beat in the community.  In Ireland, by contrast, officers have not reached that number of hours.

That is what Deputy Finian McGrath was speaking about in terms of the Metropolitan Police.  In that force, the officer on the beat knows his or her patch and the people, and they know the officer.  When one is on a first-name basis with one's local member of the force, it means one is much more likely to come forward and assist.  One is much more likely to come forward on time rather than at a later stage.  Time and again, I hear at meetings about the frustration members have experienced because of information being received days after the event.  The text alert has come some way towards speeding up the flow of information.  Sectoral policing, whereby the local member of the force has time to move around his own community, is desirable.

Individuals who pick up a gun thinking they are going to confront raiders on their property by firing a warning shot are, in the first instance, going to create two victims: the guy they fire at and themselves.

One interesting thing that came out of that was that many of the individuals involved in the theft of metal were claiming disability allowance.

I looked at the various markings.  A common denominator of all forensic markings is that they need ultraviolet light to be seen.  They come in many different shapes and forms but ultraviolet light is the common denominator.  It is needed for the search parties that go out to search a criminal's property and in the district offices where a criminal is being proceeded, to see the markings if they are present.  At the time there were a number of companies - the major players were SelectedDNA and SmartWater.  However, none of the companies could get a major contract that would allow them to really develop the sales of their product in the country.<\/p> <p>  Copper cable is used by wind farms, telecoms companies and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and there could be major contracts with banks, credit unions, or any kind of a property on which an individual might carry out a raid.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs resources in order to have a system in its laboratory to read the markings.  It is a game changer and is a major player in other jurisdictions.  It is a crime preventative because if a property is marked, it creates a big reason not to raid it.  I spoke about such a product at one of my community alert meetings and a person asked me where he could get it.  I asked him what exactly he would be using it on and he said that he had a record collection of LPs, including some golden discs which were quite valuable, and he knew that if he marked his records that no matter where in the world they were distributed, whether the USA, UK or Europe, they could be traced back to him.<\/p> <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na recovers an immense amount of property every year which has to be auctioned because nobody can claim it and the Garda cannot determine who is the owner.  This is a crying shame.  My predecessor in community alert was a retired garda sergeant called Pat O'Leary.  He advocated that people stamp numbers, such as their telephone number, onto their property.  Perhaps something like Eircode could be stamped.  It is very difficult to etch or stamp but it is simple to use the equivalent of nail varnish and just mark little dabs here and there and have it traced internationally back to one's home and property.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#G00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Diarmuid Cronin"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":246,"content":"<p>That was very interesting.

These were implemented by us in conjunction with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We hope that this would deter people from taking a more extreme route.<\/p> <p>  We have had much debate on rural crime.  It would seem that all crime, in particular rural crime, is committed by extreme criminals and perhaps we are all a little bit responsible for that extremeness.  If one looks at free legal aid, an offender can commit a number of different crimes, yet is able to carry on forever committing crimes without any sort of penalty or clause.  We should ask ourselves if we are fostering a situation in which we are creating extreme criminals over a period of time.  If all these other things were put in place and if people were sanctioned, perhaps by deductions in social welfare, the denial of free legal aid or changes to our bail laws, it would help to counteract the extreme element that exists.<\/p><p>I wish to point out that only an extreme element is involved in criminal activities.

During our last appearance before this committee, in November 2014, we spoke at length about multiple issues that faced the Reserve Defence Forces at that time, namely the introduction of key performance indicators to the Reserve, structural conflict between the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Forces, recruitment and the package of supports required for the Reserve into the future.  We also spoke about the hidden costs to individual reservists which are an unwelcome element of membership of the force.  We spoke about the training, roles and functions of the Reserve, issues that existed at the time within the Naval Service Reserve element of the force, and international trends regarding the utilisation of reserve forces and the supports required for this to be achieved effectively.  The final matter we spoke about were the benefits of reserve membership to individuals and the benefits that reservists bring to the military, their civilian employers, and their communities in general.  We believe a brief update on these matters is warranted.<\/p> <p>  Key performance indicators are annual performance benchmarks that a reservist must meet in order to be considered as an effective member of the force.  The most serious challenge facing reservists is the annual medical exam.  It had to be conducted during working hours in a military barracks and was not the easiest task to organise for volunteer reservists who have civilian employment.  Thankfully, we can report that an interim measure now exists which allows reservists to be medically examined by their GP, in their own time and at no cost to the individual thereby dispelling this problem.  It is a positive development but, unfortunately, the Defence Forces have not revised its personnel management infrastructure to cater for medical grades provided by GPs which presents an obstacle for reservists in terms of access to fitness tests and courses. <\/p> <p>  In terms of the Naval Service Reserve, we are happy to report that forum meetings have been subsequently held between us and the military authorities with a view to rectifying many of these outstanding issues.  These meetings have been extremely productive and all involved are actively working towards improving the Naval Service Reserve into the future.<\/p> <p>  We can also report that the employer engagement programme which we initiated has been formally adopted by the military authorities.  A Defence Forces working group on Reserve Defences Forces employer engagement has been established and it includes two members of this representative association.  The working group will shortly release a Reserve Defence Forces employer's handbook which is the first step to actively engage with Irish employers but more will be needed in this regard.<\/p> <p>  The issue of recruitment is still a matter of significant ongoing concern.  Following the reorganisation of the Defence Forces in 2012, the Reserve was reduced from an establishment figure of 9,500 down to 4,069 personnel.  That figure has been increased to 4,169 personnel following the announcement in the White Paper of an increase in the Naval Service Reserve establishment figure.  At present, the Reserve has 2,712 members due to a lengthy recruitment and promotions embargo which has adversely affected the supply of new personnel needed to bring the force up to the establishment figure.  The embargo has also had the knock-on effect of making it difficult to fill vacancies as they arise. <\/p> <p>  This year, recruitment competitions yielded an increase of just over 300 new members but retirements due to natural wastage have resulted in a loss of more than 200 other personnel.  Overall this means that there has been a net gain of approximately 100 new members.  If this rate of increase were to continue on a yearly basis into the future then it will be 2030 before the Reserve will have recruited up to its establishment figure which is a period beyond the intended life of the White Paper.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the package of supports required by the Reserve into the future, one of the key issues is the use of staff from the Permanent Defence Force.  We completely recognise and acknowledge that specialist instruction from highly qualified members of the Permanent Defence Force is vital to the progression and development of the Reserve.  Therefore, we contend that the involvement of such highly qualified Permanent Defence Force instructors with the Reserve, as instructors, should come with a financial incentive.<\/p><p>With this in mind, a Reserve Defence Force specialist instruction allowance should be investigated with a view to its implementation for members of the Permanent Defence Force, specifically for those Permanent Defence Force instructors who can provide expertise that the Reserve does not organically possess.<br\/><br\/>The roles and functions of the Reserve in respect of training have been formalised in the recent White Paper.  The White Paper states that the primary role of the Reserve is to augment the Permanent Defence Force in times of crisis, and a further formal role assigned to the Reserve is to contribute to State ceremonial events.  In this regard and in particular in respect of the primary role, we seek clarification on what exactly is defined as a time of crisis.  If this definition is allowed to remain vague and nebulous, as it is currently, it could arguably result in the under-utilisation of the Reserve in times of great national need.  Furthermore, in respect of the primary role of the Reserve being a force to be called on only in times of crisis &ndash; an as yet undefined term &ndash; the White Paper also references the creation of a specialist Reserve because:<\/p><blockquote>...there may be professional skills that on occasion may not be readily available in the PDF. In this context, there may be individual members of the RDF, who by virtue of their professional civilian qualifications or in the case of members of the FLR, professional military skills, have the competence to undertake such specialised tasks. These could include ICT, medical, ordnance and engineering professionals.<\/blockquote><p>While we are delighted that such a specialist Reserve is to be created, it makes little sense to attract highly-skilled and qualified professionals to this force, only for them to be told that they might be used in a future time of crisis, whatever that might be.  A serious motivating factor for such qualified professionals to join a specialist Reserve would be to apply their civilian skills in a military environment, i.e., to actually do a job.  Therefore, we strongly request that the Reserve be provided with a defined role that includes utilisation of the Reserve outside of crisis situations, for the sake of attracting qualified professionals to the new specialist Reserve and to get the best value for money and engagement from the Reserve Defence Force in general.  Everything, including recruitment, training, the level of commitment of members and organisational outputs, flows from purpose.  This purpose must be real, current and tangible rather than a distant maybe.  Personnel need to be utilised for operational roles and the requirement of that operation will drive the training and standards.<br\/><br\/>The hidden costs of membership are primarily the costs of travel to and from reservist barracks or training centres.  These costs have actually risen following the barracks closures of recent years which have forced many reservists to travel further afield to attend training.  Recently, the Minister stated his intention to use an element of the &euro;437 million capital spending plan on defence to begin rolling back the pay cuts imposed on members of the Permanent Defence Force by the Lansdowne Road agreement.  The Lansdowne Road agreement similarly resulted in Reserve Defence Force pay cuts, and so we are seeking assurances that any roll-back in Permanent Defence Force pay cuts will include a roll-back of RDF pay cuts as well.  Unlike the Permanent Defence Force, those in the Reserve do not enjoy graduated pay scales.  On obtaining a given rank, a reservist will be paid at the entry level for this rank for however long he stays at this rank, despite length of service.<br\/><br\/>Similarly, the end-of-year gratuity was taken from Reserve members in 2012.  Ostensibly this was to provide a force of 4,069 members with 41,000 paid training man-days per year but this was a membership figure the force was never enabled or allowed to reach.  Moreover, the number of paid training man-days has been slashed annually to its current allotment of 26,000 per annum.  This effectively negates the reason for removing the gratuity from members in the first place.  In contrast, members of the first line Reserve, that is, ex-Permanent Defence Force members, still receive a gratuity, as do members of the Garda Reserve.  The White Paper states that reactivating annual paid training for members of the first line Reserve is to be investigated, i.e., the provision of an additional source of income for this group.  To members of the Reserve, the benefits of a returned gratuity would also outweigh the relatively small cost.  It would have a significant and positive impact on recruitment and retention within the Reserve, primarily by making it less expensive for someone to be a member of the force and thereby producing the greatest value-for-money to the State.  The gratuity was generally a much-needed end-of-year reimbursement for the often-substantial costs incurred travelling to and from barracks and other military training locations.  We contend that the reintroduction of a gratuity needs to be investigated as a matter of urgency.  We believe Reserve members, who are loyal and committed volunteers in the service of the State, should not have to pay out substantial sums in annual travel costs to give this service to the State.  Furthermore, we completely agree with the earlier statements from the Minister to the effect that the Reserve needs to recruit the right people.  A gratuity would certainly go a long way towards attracting qualified professionals to the force.<br\/><br\/>We broadly welcome the contents of the recently published White Paper on Defence and consider them positive and constructive.  Outside of Chapter 8, which deals with the Reserve Defence Force, we have identified initiatives that could be expanded to utilise or benefit Reserve personnel.  First, a scheme similar to the defence contribution to employment support scheme for those aged 18 to 24 years, as outlined in Chapter 4 of the White Paper, could be established for unemployed reservists.  This would see these individuals obtain skills that could aid them in securing employment.  These skills would also then be retained within the Defence Forces.  Second, in respect of women in peacekeeping, Chapter 3 of the White Paper identifies that all-female overseas units may be required in gender-sensitive peacekeeping roles.  While the Permanent Defence Force is comprised of 6% women, the Army Reserve is 16.3% female while the Naval Service Reserve is 22% female.  This clearly marks Reserve female personnel as worthy of serious consideration for inclusion in any such all-female overseas peacekeeping unit.<br\/><br\/>We are keen to clarify that this representative association completely supports the implementation of the contents of the White Paper, but we also wish to advise on how elements of the White Paper, as they pertain to the Reserve, could and should be implemented.  The White Paper provides scope for such suggestions, for example, &quot;The Department of Defence will undertake a review of the provisions of the Defence Acts and bring forward proposals for any changes to the Defence Acts that may be required in order to reflect the possible crisis situations, where activation of members of the Reserve is appropriate.&quot;  Another example is, &quot;The broader RDF organisational structures will be kept under ongoing review by the Department of Defence.&quot;  A further example is:<\/p><blockquote>Accordingly, approaches to recruitment and retention will be kept under ongoing review having regard to their success rates and the key goal of having an efficient and effective Reserve. In this context, the current organisational structures will also be kept under review.<\/blockquote><p>A final example is, &quot;The Department will identify the options available to underpin the engagement of those specialist members of the Reserve...&quot;<br\/><br\/>The word &quot;review&quot; is mentioned many times.  It is evident that the specifics of how decisions relating to the Reserve will be implemented have yet to be finalised.  Therefore, we are keen to advise on how several elements of the White Paper of relevance to the Reserve Defence Force could be rolled out or advanced in future.  Furthermore, we are requesting that this representative association should remain central to any panels or boards involved in such implementation, since the presence of representative association delegates in such circumstances could only benefit the overall process.  Representation is an essential part of the military management blend and we require assurances that no unilateral decisions will be taken without proper consultation.

It was succinct and clear.  It raises a number of issues; first and foremost is the area of recruitment.  I have raised the issue of recruitment in the Reserve Defence Force on several occasions here and in the House with the Minister.  I am convinced that the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, is strongly committed to the development of the Reserve.<\/p> <p>  Given the figures, the reality is that there continue to be significant difficulties in achieving the establishment figure.  Mr. Richardson stated in his presentation that at the current rate of progress it will be 2030 before the establishment figure is reached.  Let us consider that reality alongside what appears, on initial reading, in the White Paper to be a strong commitment to the Reserve.  However, then we factor in the frequent use of the term \"review\".  It seems to create a situation in which there is not, in so far as the Reserve is concerned, the sort of certainty that is needed to be able to move forward and conduct the type of effective recruitment campaign that is needed.<\/p> <p>  I have looked at the Reserve forces throughout Europe.  In many countries there are more members in the Reserve than in the permanent defence forces.  The reverse is the situation here.  In light of the overall situation, and given that all of us are supportive of what this is about, we have to see that there is a major benefit to society at large in having a reserve force that can be called upon routinely and in times of crisis, as referred to in the White Paper.  However there is also a significant benefit to those participants in the Reserve.  Perhaps the deputation could tell us a little about that.  My sense is that the training, discipline, collegiality and everything that comes from participation actually benefits the person as well as benefiting society.  Moreover, there is an ultimate benefit for employers.  I call on the deputation to outline more to us their ideas around the specialist Reserve that may be established and the extent to which that specialist Reserve could be used.  I take the point made by the deputation that unless we have a broad meaning attributed to \"crisis\" then we will not see the level of utilisation that we should see of this specialist Reserve.  If we have a broad use or broad interpretation of \"crisis\" then \"crisis\" ceases to have any meaning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#J00200","speaker":"1054"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":263,"content":"<p>We will let the witnesses back on that question and then you can put a further question afterwards, if you wish.

The testing should be the same as for members of the Permanent Defence Force; we wholeheartedly agree with that.  There is interest out there in joining the Reserve Defence Force but the message is simply not reaching the people who might wish to join.  Our suggestion is that a national campaign might be more effective than the type of localised campaign that has been pursued until now.  If the advertising budget were spent on a national television and radio campaign, as well as on social media and new media campaigns, as opposed to placing advertisements in local newspapers where they might not necessarily be accessed by young people, it might lead to a serious increase in uptake.<\/p> <p>  We are hearing talk at present of the upper ceiling for enlistment being dropped from 35 to 25 years.  If we are trying to recruit qualified professionals and specialists to the Reserve, we should bear in mind that it will be particularly difficult to get people with any serious amount of experience in any sector at age 24 or 25.  As such, we would like to see the ceiling retained at age 35.  In the British Army, to give a comparison, our cousins across the water hire some specialist personnel up to the age of 60.<\/p> <p>  One aspect of recruitment about which we have serious concerns relates to Garda vetting and the process whereby applicants have to fill out a form and send it off for processing and approval before they are eligible for recruitment to the Reserve.  In some instances, it is taking nine or ten months for those forms to be processed and returned, by which time the Garda clearance is void.  There are dedicated citizens who want to join the Reserve but who are being turned away because their Garda vetting forms were not processed on time.  This issue affected some 100 applicants this year, which is a serious chunk of our recruitment.  It is an issue we would like to see addressed.  The main point I would like members to take away regarding recruitment is that the budget probably does need to be redirected into something more national rather than having local campaigns which may not be connecting with young people.<\/p> <p>  I ask my colleague, Mr. Mulligan, to deal with the question of the definition of a crisis situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil Richardson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":266,"content":"<p>We are 100% happy that members of the Reserve Defence Force are carrying out their ceremonial role effectively.  However, clarity is required in respect of our crisis role.  The Government has asked us to augment the Defence Forces in crisis situations but we need to be prepared for such situations.  In particular, we are being cut out in the training necessity, or what a commander perceives would be a training necessity.  The White Paper mentions aid to the civil power and aid to the civil authority tasks as an area where support could be given.  However, there is no particular Reserve Defence Force syllabus for that area.  To some extent, training for that role can really only be acquired by completing the job in hand.  In that regard, there is a necessity for people to be operationally driving the training requirements of the Reserve.<br\/><br\/>On further training, chapter 8 of the White Paper states, &quot;Notwithstanding the ability of the PDF to undertake day-to-day operations and to deal with a range of contingencies, there are circumstances where operational demands could exceed the capacity of the PDF.&quot;  The document goes on to give as examples of such circumstances: &quot;... a significant deterioration in the international security environment resulting in a conventional military attack on this State, a large scale security event at home, certain civil contingencies that could require large scale Defence Forces' support, e.g., a major pandemic, events that require a sustained effort over a prolonged period of time ...&quot;  The White Paper states that the Reserve Defence Force offers a cost-effective means of mitigating the risk of the Permanent Defence Force being unable to meet operational requirements.<br\/><br\/>Taking chapter 8 into account, together with the suggestion of particular response teams set out in chapter 3.3 in respect of the defence of the State from armed aggression, we must bear in mind that the generation of military capabilities can have significant lead-in times.  If the definition of a crisis situation is nor sufficiently clear, it could lead to an implied view than an aggressor will effectively work to a timescale that is convenient to the Defence Forces.  In reality, maintaining military capabilities for a worst-case scenario on an ongoing basis would be prohibitively expensive.  This is where the Army Reserve and the Naval Service Reserve can provide an ability to transition immediately into an organised and capable insurgency force with established resources, skills, tactics and leadership, such as the command control we have at the moment.  Under the current Reserve model, resources, skills and leadership instruction extend from national to local level and there is a capacity to transition quickly into a well-resourced, well-organised and well-dispersed local insurgency organisation under the single-force concept, which emphasises the importance of a local Reserve Defence Force as a bedrock element of defence policy.  In order to realise that role, we must be prepared for it.  However, the definition of the crisis element within the White Paper does not allow for that.  It must be incorporated within the operational day-to-day implementation of the role.<br\/><br\/>In the case of the Naval Service Reserve, we are carrying out a role at the moment where there have been shortages of personnel within the Naval Service.  Going by the definition in the White Paper, are we to take it there will never be such shortages of personnel into the future and, if so, what exactly would define a crisis?  Will we have one commanding officer who will decide we are not in crisis through shortage of personnel, in which case Naval Service Reserve personnel will not be asked to support seagoing vessels, even though we could have a commander on a particular seagoing vessel who is seriously short of personnel during a particular trip?  It is a question of who defines what constitutes a crisis.  We have had situations where leading hands were given their own watch going forward.<br\/><br\/>Another issue to consider is that the Naval Service Reserve is currently performing an information-gathering function within the primary ports around the coast.  In the Waterford unit of the Reserve, for instance, we go out and patrol weekly, carry out sighting reports and pass them, through a reporting mechanism, back through operations within the naval base.  In other words, the Naval Service Reserve has <i>de facto<\/i>been carrying out a port security role, albeit through a voluntary organisation, within the Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Dublin port areas.  In the current economic climate, it does not make sense that, via the definition of &quot;crisis&quot;, we may be effectively undermining the assets we have within the Naval Service Reserve when it comes to protecting our ports.  Is the White Paper inadvertently undermining a vital voluntary asset for coastal information-gathering on behalf of the State?  In short, we are worried the White Paper might undermine the deterrent function we are performing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Mulligan"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Will the delegates elaborate on their reference to an employment support scheme?

It is a fantastic way of engaging with employers and showcasing the value of reservists.<\/p> <p>  The question then arises as to what the next step should be.  International trends suggest that step should be employment protection legislation to support reservists in times of activation and utilisation, coupled with employer supports.  To give an example, the Australian military will, instead of buying in a lawyer from a civilian firm, activate a reservist lawyer and pay him or her at the appropriate rank.  The individual's employer is reimbursed to a certain degree for the loss of that staff member.  This works out cheaper than hiring someone from the private sector to come in and do the job and there is a gain for the reservist, his or her employer and the military.  It is something we will need to look at doing.  The employer engagement booklet is very much a first step; deciding what comes next is where it gets tricky.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil Richardson"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":269,"content":"<p>The ending of the Reserve gratuity seems to be to be a significant problem.

Now that reservist is being expected to pay for travel back and forth for however many weekends or weeks during the year.  If one presents this to a potential recruit, the recruit says, \" I am not paying to join the force.  That is ridiculous.\", and simply does not apply.

My colleague, Deputy Crowe, my party's foreign affairs and defence spokesperson, cannot make it today because there is a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I was my party's previous defence spokesperson and I am fairly well placed to represent him here today.<\/p> <p>  The issues during my time as defence spokesperson were around the cutbacks.  In the peak, in 2006, the budget was &euro;7.1 million and, in 2014, it was &euro;1.3 million.  It was a very serious cutback that they faced.  Allied with the issue of the centralisation of training and access facilities, it must be having an impact on recruitment.  To a degree, that has been touched on.<\/p> <p>  The Government cut the numbers of Reserve Defence Force in half, slashed the budget drastically and made it much more difficult for potential young recruits to the Reserve Defence Force from rural areas to access it.  When one talks about the White Paper - next year there will be a net gain of 100 and projections forward to 2030 - one of my concerns in the past was that when these decisions were being made RDFRA, as a representative association, was not getting access to the Minister to convey its concerns.  The Chairman was a Reserve Defence Force member for 23 years.  I would like to believe that every Member of the Oireachtas genuinely respects the role, patriotism and community participation of members of the Reserve Defence Force.

In contrast, that is half the cleaning bill for cleaners engaged by the Defence Forces.  When one looks at the phone bill, it is four times what is allocated to ourselves.  In that context, it is a straight-line graph which has been going down since 2012.<\/p> <p>  On fulfilling the numbers in the recruitment, we have a situation now where we are not maintaining the numbers we had originally.  Even though we had 150 recruits who crossed the threshold, got in and got a boot on their foot last year, the system that is in place is now very elongated and we are taking nearly 12 months to bring somebody in, from first contact until he or she finally reaches attestation.  That is too long for any voluntary organisation.<\/p> <p>  As regards the reinstatement of the resource allocation, as the financial situation improves in the country, we would be delighted that an allocation would be improved also for the RDF.  The bottom line here is that if it is a set allocation, then that is all we can do.  We cannot recruit any more.  We do not have the clothing for them, we do not have the footwear for them and we will not have the places for them if the allocation is not increased.<\/p> <p>  The other factor going forward to 2030 would be that the RDF needs a functionality.  As the Chairman said on the previous occasion, one cannot be training and then do nothing with the training.  We need a framework whereby those who will make decisions at some time in the future at these reviews will set out the functionality.  Even if it is only barracks duties or whatever kind of in-house duties we can carry out, that would fulfil some role for a start.<\/p> <p>  The interesting part is the specialist Reserve that is talked about in the White Paper.  We have many specialists.  Even in smaller units, we have a range of specialists, from carpenters to scientists.  If those reservists were utilised in a role at home before they had any role overseas or anything like that, it would be a step in the right direction.  It is difficult for the professional combat soldier commander to turn around and say he or she has 20 RDF members for Friday next.  It is difficult for them to get to that point because we all are engaged in our own employment.  The fundamental element to address that is employment legislation.  If one can guarantee that one can take 20 guys out of their jobs on Friday next for a week and that they will be in their job the following Friday, then there is no problem.  That professional soldier will say to himself that he can count on those RDF members, that is where he has a gap and that is how he can fill it.  It is not pie in the sky to say that we need employment legislation.  The committee members will be well aware at this stage that there are zero contract hours and all sorts of turn-up-when-you-can type contracts.  Anybody who is in a job will not risk his job and would be foolish to do so.  The more responsible members of the RDF are those who would be in good jobs.<\/p> <p>  Going back to one of the questions Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l asked earlier on the benefits to the personnel themselves, we would see tremendous benefits to the community.  We would see tremendous benefits to the personnel themselves.  Over the years, very few who have been through the RDF or, as it was previously, the FCA, ever ended up behind bars or anything like that.  One or two might have along the way but I can assure the committee that there were very few because we are a little community in ourselves.<\/p> <p>  In summary, we would see employment legislation, whatever shape that might take at any future date, as essential to reassure members of the Permanent Defence Force that they can call and rely on the RDF to do a job.  We would see that the reinstatement of the resource allocation would greatly enhance what we can do within that budget framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Mulley"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I assume the transcript will be sent to the Minister for Defence anyway.

The White Paper quoted the request by the Secretary General of the United Nations that consideration be given to the contribution of female soldiers to the United Nations operations.  This is an area in which women in the RDF can contribute to the PDF.  We have women in Waterford RDF who are qualified watch keepers.  We have three officers being commissioned at the end of the month, two of whom are marine watch keepers, a qualification which takes considerable study and experience to achieve.  One is a pilot on the River Thames and comes back and forth and lives in Waterford.  Another is a master mariner undergoing training to become a master of vessel.

We are happy to be here to discuss the general scheme of the bail Bill, which concerns the State's use of pre-trial detention.  That involves the holding of people in prisons before their guilt or innocence in regard to a particular offence has been determined.  This, as members will know, is the holding of people on remand. <\/p> <p>  Members will also know that people who are charged with a crime are entitled to that most fundamental of rights enshrined in law throughout the centuries, that is, the presumption of innocence.  Having said that, there are accepted reasons the State can restrict a person's liberty in circumstances where he or she has been charged with an offence.  The O'Callaghan principles in section 2 of the Bail Act 1997 have, up to now, provided the main legal basis in Irish law regarding the provision of bail.  These reasons include the risk of flight, the seriousness of the offence, the likelihood of reoffending and likely interference with witnesses or jurors., among a number of other matters.  A delicate balancing act is employed by judges in determining whether to grant bail, and the seriousness of the decision in granting or refusing a bail application must not be underestimated.  <\/p> <p>  Before I talk about specifics, I would like to highlight three key issues around the bail or remand system in Ireland.  First, there is no maximum for remand duration in Ireland, unlike best practice in other European countries.  Second, in regard to people being held on remand in Irish prisons, the Irish High Court has criticised the conditions in Irish prisons in the Kinsella case in 2011.<\/p><p>Third, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment has recommended to Ireland, in the context of bail provision and remanding in custody, that it continue to pursue &quot;vigorously multi-faceted policies designed to put an end to overcrowding in prisons&rdquo;.  Under international human rights law, bail refusals should be exceptional and justified in the circumstances of specific cases.<br\/><br\/>The application of bail laws is protected so fervently under international human rights standards because taking away a person's liberty before he has been convicted of a criminal offence can, as one can imagine, have serious and significant ramifications for a person&rsquo;s right to privacy, family rights and right to a livelihood.  The consequences of remand will reverberate throughout a person&rsquo;s life and, most likely, stay with him forever.<br\/><br\/>International research shows that ethnic and religious minorities, foreigners, people suffering from mental illness and people with an intellectual disability tend to face a disproportionate risk of being held in pre-trial detention.  We are talking about the most vulnerable of the vulnerable.<br\/><br\/>Let me give some specifics on the general scheme.  The possibility of a speedy trial is one of the key factors in the O'Callaghan principles.  Members will be aware that we struggle in Ireland in terms of the length of time one must wait for a trial.  In 2008, we were found to be in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights in the case of McFarlane <i>v.<\/i>Ireland.  This has been omitted from head 26 of the Bill.  We strongly urge the committee to recommend that head 26 of general scheme be amended to include all of the O&rsquo;Callaghan principles, particularly with a view to considering the possibility of a speedy trial in determining the granting or refusal of bail.<br\/><br\/>The ICCL is a member of the Victims Rights Alliance.  We work to protect and secure the rights of crime victims in the criminal justice process in the State.  We welcome the efforts in head 26 to afford additional protections to victims and their family members by guarding against interference with witnesses.  However, we are concerned over the possibility, as set out in the general scheme, that a complainant, or alleged victim, may be able to give subjective information about the likelihood of interference by an alleged offender, or somebody who has not been convicted of anything.  Victims should have the right to participate effectively in a criminal process.  However, we suggest that the proffering of evidence as to the suitability of a person for bail, or not, should remain within the realm of the Garda.<br\/><br\/>Head 27 of the general scheme restates section 2 of the Bail Act 1997.  I refer to the refusal of bail to prevent the commission of a serious offence.  It includes a restatement of various factors that the court should take into account, such as the addiction of a person to a controlled drug.  Under the general scheme, this has been extended to include intoxicating liquor.  We urge the committee to ask the Minister to take steps to make progress on the use of alternatives to pre-trial detention, particularly where a person is an addict or suffers from another vulnerability, such as homelessness.  In addition, the establishment of bail supports and services in the community would be a more effective way to treat lower-level offending than excessive periods in pre-trial detention.  This has been proven in research, which I know my colleagues will talk about.  This is missing from the Minister&rsquo;s proposals.  Evidence shows that alleged offending by vulnerable accused persons tends to face a disproportionate chance of pre-trial detention.<br\/><br\/>The trend across democratic countries is to explore alternatives to pre-trial detention, and not to increase it, for the very reasons I outlined at the beginning of my statement.  I wish to conclude by urging members to ask the Minister what she intends to do to have a concrete impact on the integrity of the bail system.  It is welcome that various items of legislation are being codified in the general scheme but the additional factors therein do not address the key issues.  This is a piecemeal approach.  The key issues concern how the excessive periods waiting for trial are being addressed and the Government's alternatives to pre-trial detention given the current state of the Irish prison system.  We have to operate in the reality of the system as it exists and how we wish it to be in the future.  Finally, what types of bail supports will the Minister put in place to assist repeat offenders, particularly those in more vulnerable categories?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Duffy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#P00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":310,"content":"<p>The IPRT very much welcomes the invitation of the committee to address it on the general scheme of the Bill.  While the Bill is a largely welcome development, constituting a comprehensive restatement of the law on bail, it also provides an opportunity to revisit some aspects of the legislation that are problematic, in addition to flagging some concerns, especially about omissions in the Bill.<\/p> <p>  In the interest of keeping to time, which I know is very limited, I will not repeat the submission of my colleague from the ICCL.  However, I can say without reservation that we endorse each of the recommendations she has made.  I refer members to our written submission, which we stand over.  It might be helpful to address the committee on the scale and impact of pre-trial detention and go into a little more detail on the case for bail supports and services.  I will address electronic monitoring, which I believe has not been addressed elsewhere, and talk very briefly about mandatory sentencing, which finds a place within head 40 of the Bill.<\/p> <p>  There is no question but that pre-trial detention does have a place within the criminal justice system in ensuring that certain defendants will be brought to trial.  However, overuse of pre-trial detention and its impact on liberty and the presumption of innocence are really significant.  Pre-trial detention is expensive.  When used excessively, it not only has an impact on individuals but also places a strain on prisons, which are already under strain, and diverts resources away from those who are already serving a sentence and the rehabilitation of the latter.  Exposure to prison itself is damaging and makes people more likely to reoffend, not less likely.  An accused person who is remanded in custody may find it more difficult to prepare his or her defence adequately.  It is for all these very practical reasons, in addition to principled reasons, that the European Convention on Human Rights requires that pre-trial detention be used as a measure of last resort.<\/p> <p>  Given all the foregoing, it is really regrettable that the general scheme of the Bail Bill does not include any statutory provision whatsoever for bail supports.  Bail supports and services include supervised bail.  I refer to mechanisms by which supports are made available for those placed on bail to ensure they turn up for appointments and for court and so some preliminary work can be done on any issues raised that relate to offending or alleged offending.  An example would be working with factors such as addiction, which in some cases can be a contributing and significant factor when it relates to offending.<\/p> <p>  We have laid out in some detail the research from other jurisdictions, such as England, Wales, Australia and Canada.  We have seen from it that the use of the supervised bail and other schemes has a number of outcomes.  It creates positive changes in behaviour over time, including a desire to avoid trouble or jail, learn to deal with conflict and refrain from drinking or taking drugs.  It results in court attendance of 80% to 90%.  That means increased court efficiency.  We know how overstretched our courts are at present.  Punctual attendance is crucial and everybody has an interest therein.  The schemes ensure this while managing risks in the community.  Obviously, the schemes reduce the number of remands to custody.  We should not leave out the fact that there are significant cost savings.  In Scotland, for example, which is a very comparable jurisdiction in regard to criminal justice, research shows that offsetting the cost of supervised bail against the reduction in prison costs from reduced use of remand over a three-year period resulted in a net benefit of between &pound;2 million and &pound;13 million.<\/p> <p>  We recommend that the Bill include an evidence-based approach to provision of bail services and supports, obviously aimed at the prevention of offending on bail, ensuring appearance at court and reducing the number of remands to custody to the essential minimum.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the draft heads, we endorse the recommendation in both the ICCL's submission and our own on ensuring the period of remand remains at eight days and is not extended to 15.  We encourage the introduction &ndash; in head 10, we suggest &ndash; of the no-real-prospect test.  This is a test that was proposed by the Prison Reform Trust in the United Kingdom.  Essentially, it means the addition of words such as, &ldquo;or where there is no real prospect that the person who is making an application for bail will, even if convicted, be given a custodial sentence&rdquo;.  In those circumstances, it makes no sense, economic or social, to remand the person to custody.<\/p><p>We very much welcome the requirement to give reasons for bail decisions.  Victims, criminal justice analysts and anybody working in the criminal justice system would welcome more accountability and transparency around all judicial decision-making.<\/p><p> It is really important to address the electronic monitoring issue in some detail.  This relates to heads 18 and 19.  There is legislative provision for electronic monitoring but it does not happen in practice and we very rarely see it being used.  Where it is a genuine and well-resourced alternative to remanding somebody to prison while awaiting trial, particularly given the length of time we are talking about currently where trials are being listed in 2017 and there is an extremely long period of pre-trial detention, and where we have examined how it might work in the Irish system, it would be welcome.  We know from research in the UK and the recently published recommendations of the Council of Europe that we cannot lump in electronic monitoring without considering a number of issues about the way it will work and how it will affect individuals.  Proportionate and necessary use of electronic monitoring would be welcome but must be considered extensively.<\/p><p> Head 40 provides for mandatory consecutive sentences for certain specified bail offences.  I think I can say there is consensus in this regard.  The Law Reform Commission, the strategic review group on penal policy and my organisation have all come to the view that the impact of presumptive minimum mandatory sentences, prisoner numbers and questions as to the extent that those sentences have contributed to reducing crime are a concern.  The strategic review group recommended that no further mandatory sentences or presumptive minimum sentences should be introduced.  Going ahead with the bail Bill without looking at bail supports and services is akin to trying to solve a perceived illness without looking at the cheapest and most effective medicine.  It simply does not make sense.  I urge the committee to consider in more detail the research available and to examine the possibility of including a provision on that very socially and economically effective issue in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Malone","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to draw attention to certain troubling aspects of the general scheme of the bail Bill 2015, which on the whole is to be welcomed for consolidating and restating existing law on bail matters.  I will focus on notable omissions in part 1 of the proposed Bill and a number of legislative innovations of dubious value and necessity which may drive up the prison population if enthusiastically embraced by the Judiciary.<br\/><br\/>I will start by making a point about the language surrounding the discussion of bail.  The language accompanying the unveiling of the Bill to new Garda graduates at Templemore in July 2015 was reminiscent of that used in advance of the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, the bail amendment.  It was quite out of step with the recent progressive penal reform agenda pursued by this Government.  One presumes this so-called crime control language was calculated to appeal to the law and order cohort of Fine Gael voters in the run-up to the election.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, stated that the Bill &quot;will strengthen the law to protect the public against crimes committed by offenders out on bail&rdquo;, while the Taoiseach added that, &quot;This is the first comprehensive review of bail law since 1997 and demonstrates this Government's ongoing commitment to crack down on crime.&quot;<br\/><br\/>The main goal of the proposed legislation is to restate and consolidate existing Irish law in accordance with the Constitution and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, while giving judges &quot;better guidance&quot; as to how they might &quot;protect the public&quot; in certain key areas.  It is unfortunate that the Minister did not see fit to give the courts &quot;better guidance&quot; as to how they might also protect the rights of accused persons.  There is currently no explicit presumption in favour of granting pre-trial bail to an adult in Ireland, nor is the presumption of innocence explicit in the Constitution or any statute.  The European Court of Human Rights has stated that to justify the pre-trial detention of an accused person who is presumed innocent, there must be &quot;a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty&quot;.  That was in Kalashnikov<i>v<\/i>.<i><\/i>Russia.  The court also held that states should consider less intrusive measures than detention and must prove that a less intrusive alternative to detention would not meet the objection or objections to release pending trial.  Under the European Convention on Human Rights, therefore, an accused should only be detained if one of the grounds in Article 5(1) applies and a condition of bail cannot mitigate the risk in question.<br\/><br\/>In terms of reflecting the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, the proposed Bill should contain a clear statutory articulation in part 1, recognising the presumption of innocence and the presumption in favour of release on bail.  This would serve as an important reminder to judges and the prosecution when objecting to bail that people accused of criminal offences are innocent until proven guilty and should generally be released before trial, unless the evidence demonstrates that their remand in custody is necessary, proportionate and grounded in law.  This means it should not be based on unlawful presumptions or vague, unsubstantiated statements by the prosecuting garda.<br\/><br\/>A general provision should be inserted into the Bill to the effect that<b><\/b>&quot;in every bail application, the court must consider whether a condition or conditions could be attached to bail which would be sufficient to meet the objection or objections raised under head 26 or 27 of this Bill&quot;.  An additional provision should explicitly require that judges only impose such conditions as are strictly necessary and proportionate to meet the identified risk or risks to ensure an individualised approach is taken regarding the setting of conditions.<br\/><br\/>I will make a point on addiction to alcohol with respect to codifying section 2 of the Bail Act 1997.  While addiction to controlled substances and alcohol certainly is a major factor in the offending behaviour of many people who come before the criminal courts, permitting judges to remand people with addiction issues in custody to prevent further offending on bail does little to address the complex underlying issues.  In this regard, the justice committee&rsquo;s recent consideration of Ireland's failed war on drugs is timely.  Important lessons can be learned from the recent successes of the Portuguese decriminalisation strategy which has increased its focus on addiction as a public health issue rather than a social ill to be addressed primarily by recourse to the criminal courts.  In the context of a revised bail scheme and any new approach to drugs policy, holistic supports should be funded, including Probation Service supervised hostels providing access to mental health and addiction treatment and other necessary interventions in order that people can address underlying problems.<br\/><br\/>As noted by the Strategic Review of Penal Policy, Irish penal policy has suffered from a failure to plan adequately for the future and to understand the consequences of changes in policy.  The result has been an explosion in our prison population since the mid-1980s, with no evidence or suggestion that society has become correspondingly safer.  It is highly likely that proposed stringent bail measures, such as those relating to domestic burglary and the so-called guidance given to judges regarding head 27 and how they may protect the public more generally have been conceived without adequate or any assessment having been undertaken to examine their potential impact on the already overburdened prison system or of the pressure that additional remands in custody will place on the investigating garda&iacute; as well as the Director of Public Prosecutions to get the case ready for trial.  As my colleague from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties stated, the legal right to a speedy trial is all the more important and pressing when the accused is in custody.  Anyone who has any experience of the criminal justice system will attest that trials are anything but speedy at present, especially in the Circuit Court, where it can take upwards of a year and a half due to busy court lists and other inefficiencies.  The situation will only worsen if substantially more people are remanded in pre-trial detention.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Perhaps the key question for the Minister, her officials and all Members of the Oireachtas at this juncture is to consider whether it is prudent, responsible and conducive to a safer society to remand more people in pre-trial custody, primarily to incapacitate them, if it would necessitate the emergency temporary release of convicted offenders to free up beds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Jane Mulcahy"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their excellent and concise submissions.  I agree entirely with the tone, as they have all taken a very similar approach.  I share their welcome for this codifying Bill because we will see provisions relating to bail condensed in one place, which is very welcome.<\/p><p>However, I would also agree with Ms Duffy's points about the need to ensure adequate protection of the rights of due process for accused persons.  This committee has contributed to the progressive agenda on penal reform, notably with our report on penal reform some years ago.  We recommended that imprisonment be a sanction of last resort.  We also recommended various ways of enhancing these community sanctions.<\/p><p> Some of the witnesses spoke about the right to bail.  I welcome provisions 1 and 2 in head 10 where there is a clear presumption in favour of granting bail.  It states that \"An applicant for bail shall be granted bail except where ... the court does not consider\" and so on.  Is there a way any of the witnesses would suggest to strengthen that language?  I am conscious that we already have implicit, albeit not explicit, protection in the Constitution for the presumption of innocence.  We have clear protections for the right to liberty, so is there a need to say more?  Is that enough in head 10(2).<\/p><p> I have two specific questions for the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, relating to some things that were said in the submissions.  The IPRT made a strong case for bail supports and services, including some instructive figures on positive outcomes from elsewhere.  Will Ms Malone elaborate a little more on the actual content of the sort of schemes she has talked about elsewhere, including the idea of supervised bail?  The closest we have to that is curfews and the obligation to sign on daily at a Garda station.  In a sense, if we have a tightly constructed set of conditions imposed on bail, it comes close to a sort of supervision, but what exactly does Ms Malone mean by \"supervised bail\"?  Does she think that electronic monitoring can be part of that?  In Denmark, we saw electronic monitoring used in a relatively progressive manner.<\/p><p> My other question is specifically for the ICCL.  It is about the provision in head 28 that the complainant would give evidence.  I agree with Ms Duffy that we need to look at that.  Clearly there is a victim's rights element here too.  Does Ms Duffy have any ideas on reform?  Rather than ruling it out altogether, would there be merit in including provisions that are tighter, like the sort of victim impact statement we have after conviction, in order that there is a format for this evidence to be given?  Head 29 refers to Garda evidence and currently garda&iacute; give evidence about the impact on complainants.  Should we build that into the legislation?<\/p><p> I note that in the post-conviction stage, and part 6 that deals with bail applications on appeal, there is provision for complainants to give evidence.  I do not think anyone can object to the complainant giving evidence in the bail hearing after conviction.  That seems to be entirely right.<\/p><p> Head 36 is about the power of the District Court to grant bail where a sentence is being appealed.  That could have a significant impact in practice because many sentences of imprisonment are appealed from the District Court and bail is fairly routinely provided for in those cases.

I have brought along a document on social research.  It is a Scottish Government document about the use of supervised bail in Scotland which sets out that scheme in some detail.  I am happy to leave that with the committee.<\/p> <p>  In short, concerning that scheme, the substantive difference is that it does not ask those on remand who perhaps had a chaotic lifestyle or an addiction simply to turn up at an office, sign something and go off again.  It was a set of meetings with a tone similar to a meeting with a probation officer.  If they were admitting the offence, and it may not be the case, they spoke about any issues within their lives that they felt had contributed to offending behaviour in this instance or that could contribute to further offending behaviour.  They could be things like employment, bereavement, counselling, addiction or mental health.  The idea was that it was a wrap-around service which dealt with people in their given situation at the time and ensured their time on remand was used in the best way possible to make certain they turned up for court.  At the end of the day the justice system wants people to turn up for court in order that justice can be served, whether that results in an acquittal or a conviction.<\/p> <p>  The crucial thing was that they were looking not just at the symptoms and warehousing people until their cases came to court but also looking at what could be done in the interim, while respecting the presumption of innocence, to work with those people in their given situations to make the court system more effective.  Ultimately, it would save money for the taxpayer because that is what all those things added up to.  It is an attractive package because not only is it socially effective in dealing with the issue but also it addresses public concerns about people turning up and not offending when on bail.  This is one example of many and I am happy to share the rest of the research with the committee.  That was the qualitative difference between simply turning up to a police station and having an active engagement with something that was quite positive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#R00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Malone"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Bacik for her questions.  Head 28 concerns the complainant or the alleged victim giving information at the bail hearing.  This raises a number of issues.  First, we know there have been issues before the court around garda&iacute; giving opinion evidence.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and other bodes have raised problems around that procedure.  It is important to note that a judge's role is to infer from facts.  In the ideal world, therefore, all that would be put before a judge would be facts, by which the judge would then come to a decision on whether bail would be granted.  It is complex and in certain situations opinion may be included.  As Senator Bacik mentioned, however, this should be limited very much, if it is included at all.<\/p> <p>  I have serious concerns about the victims themselves because if they are going to give an opinion, does that mean they are open to cross-examination and a bail hearing around that opinion or belief?  I do not necessarily know if we want a justice system where an alleged victim can be put in the box at a bail hearing and cross-examined about certain issues.  That is another matter.<\/p> <p>  By and large, the ICCL is of the opinion that only garda&iacute; should proffer that type of evidence.  Victims have other ways to interact with the criminal justice process where their rights can be protected.  I agree that if it were deemed that this would be necessary, if we could see circumstances where the wrong decision was being made by members of the Judiciary because they were not getting all the information and could only get the information from alleged victims, something could be included but it would need to be framed in much tighter language as a necessity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#R00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Duffy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I want to add something to that point about complainant evidence.

Our committee has a strong track record in that regard, having compiled a report on penal reform.  We put a great deal work into its proposals, led by the chairman, and they have not been implemented but, hopefully, they will be implemented.  In that light I am concerned about the witnesses' analysis because we have not addressed the penal reform deficits.  The challenge for legislators and Government is to strike a balance between the sole rights of the individual and the concerns about protecting the public and, obviously, taking on board the victims' rights.

They look at three things -  if there is a belief or a fear that the person will interfere with the witness, if there is a belief or a fear that the person will interfere with the course of justice, and if there is a risk of serious offending if the person is released on bail.  That is the starting point.  Judges are faced with that decision on a daily basis and have to weigh up all the information before them and make what is a very difficult decision.  There is no doubt and I do not think we would ever suggest that there is no place at all for pre-trial detention.  Clearly, it is a very important tool available to the criminal justice system in order to ensure that those who have been charged with a crime appear before the court, give evidence, are tried and, ultimately, there is an outcome.  The public has an interest in that regard.  What we have to remember is that within that two very important things happen.  First, there is identification of a risk, although it will not exist in every case, and if there is a risk how it can be addressed most effectively and, second, if there is a way in which we can ensure that the person returns to court, does not reoffend and engages with whatever he or she is supposed to engage with but is kept out of the prison environment.  The issue is if there is a way of doing that and, if so, we have a duty to consider it.  That means also protecting the public because remanding large numbers of people to prison does not make the problem go away.  What it does is fill our prisons with remand prisoners who are the most transient prisoners.  I checked the numbers today and six of our 14 prisons are overcrowded.<\/p> <p>  If the use of remand is increased without considering the impact that will have within our prisons, because what happens in our prisons affects what happens in our communities, we have to look at it in a joined-up way.  We would never advocate abolition of pre-trial detention but we do advocate asking ourselves if it is necessary, if it is proportionate, if there a risk and, if so, if it can be mitigated.  If not, it may be that pre-trial detention is the answer.  It is a difficult task that judges face every day.  Simplistic solutions such as making it mandatory to remand in certain circumstances are not the way.  We have gone beyond that kind of simplistic debate and I hope there is a more nuanced debate which looks at all the solutions to this problem, including bail supports services and supervised bail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#S00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Malone"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":325,"content":"<p>Ms Duffy wants to contribute on that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#S00800","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":326,"content":"<p>We asked victims of crime what they want to see in the system.

In fact, there is not really a balance because every single participant within the criminal justice system should have respect for their particular rights.  As Ms Deirdre Malone from the Irish Penal Rights Trust has mentioned, we would not advocate that there is no such thing as pre-trial detention in Ireland.  Of course, people need to be held on remand.  One of the main reasons they need to be held on remand is to protect witnesses and victims from further harm.  As already pointed out, the way in which that is handled has to be set out in a framework that is in accordance with human rights principles.  Again, I refer to articles 5 and 6 of the ECHR which set out the proportions and the public interest arguments that should surround a bail system.  That is what we would advocate.

In his book <i>The Culture of Control<\/i>David Garland states that in recent years distinctive policies have been developed that aim to reduce fear levels rather than to reduce crime.  I suggest that the burglary Bill is symptomatic of such a policy.  It has been born out of the perception and the reality that burglary is a very intrusive crime that causes damage in individual's lives.  In looking at the law, we have to see whether it will have the desired impact.  Will it mean that people in rural Ireland will sleep safer in their beds at night if we introduce such a law?  It is setting the definition of a prolific burglar at a very low level.  A person who has one conviction and two pending charges is setting the bar truly at a very low level.  If judges decide to adhere to this standard, it will, undoubtedly, have quite negative effects on our prison population.  It will mean that more people will be remanded in custody and this will have a knock-on effect of undoing much of the good work that has been done recently by the Irish Prison Service to stem the use of temporary release as an emergency measure, a safety valve.  If all manner of domestic burglars are being remanded in custody who otherwise, in previous times, would have been granted bail, there will be an impact.  I question whether the impact assessment has been carried out but, if not, it should be, because there is a need to be able to demonstrate that society will, in fact, be safer; if it is not, it is just talk.  It might appeal to voters at election time but really this is a serious issue that will have long-term consequences.<br\/><br\/>I reiterate the points about trying to deal with some of these problems at the front end by having some bail supports and ensuring that people turn up to trial.  Some people have such chaotic lives that they do not remember that they are meant to turn up when their case is listed for mention.  Wrap around supports can be of assistance.  If they have nowhere to live, remembering to turn up to court is the least of their worries so anything that can be done to improve compliance with conditions should be done.<\/p><p>I also suggest that there is a tendency to have an over-use of too many conditions.

There are considerable sections within rural communities, and urban communities, which hold the view that if a person has one conviction and two charges pending then that is a significant threshold within which to suspect that person is a threat to the public and for him or her to be detained.  I wonder if the role of electronic tagging could strike a balance between the analysis of the witnesses and that of the community leaders on recidivist offenders.  I agree that a rational, evidence-based approach is needed when looking at penal reform but the public also needs reassurance that the State is serious in its efforts to tackle criminals.  Confidence in the criminal justice system is undermined when statistics can show the number of times people commit offences while on bail.

This is not happening at the moment because the Garda does not have any of those supports.  I spoke with a local community in Athy about this.  The first concern of the community was not about the bail laws but the fact that the local Garda station had been decimated and garda&iacute; could no longer be seen on the beat.  The community was also aware, and we know this from our own research, that where conditions are imposed that they may not be monitored.  It is important that the Garda has the resources with which to monitor bail conditions, but those resources were slashed in the past.  That situation seems to be turning around now, which is positive.  Electronic tagging can be useful in appropriate cases.  For example, if the purpose of an electronic tag is to provide an alternative to remanding a person or to ensure the person resides in a particular place or does not enter a particular place or is under curfew at certain time, these are less intrusive measures than losing one's liberty pending trial.  While they are nonetheless an interference with a person's liberty, they may be necessary and proportionate in certain cases.  This is why, when we saw the inclusion of electronic tagging, we stated in our submission that we always welcome alternatives to imprisonment as long as they are considered deeply, and that tagging may be an effective alternative to imprisonment.  However, international research shows that the contributory causes of crime in a substantial number of cases such as shoplifting and burglary can often be symptomatic of a need or desire to feed an addiction, and this is reflected in the problems we see in our prison population.  This cannot be ignored.  There is almost a consensus among speakers at this committee on the need to decriminalise drug use and the need to look at addiction as a health issue rather than a criminal justice issue.  This should never be considered as an excuse to allow people to enter other people's homes, but we have to deal with the cause of these events and not simply warehouse the symptoms of the events.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#T00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Malone"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I wish to comment with regard to burglary.  In one of the recent press releases from the Minister, she said that 75% of all burglaries were committed by 25% of offenders.  Tied on to this information was the argument about the roaming gangs and the highly organised criminal gangs.  If better statistics were available in the State we might be able to unpack this data a little bit to see that in fact most burglaries are probably committed by people who have serious addictions, but I do not know what the precise percentage is.  A more complete look at the underlying causes of crime is needed.  One can remove people from circulation and incapacitate them, but it is deeply worrying to do this before trial when they are legally innocent.  I cannot stress this enough.  These people have not been convicted.  It is one thing to talk about incapacitation if the people have already been convicted, but it is another thing if they have not been convicted.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to the issue of bringing people to trial sooner.  We see that the Garda will receive an extra &euro;5 million to allow them to respond better to crime in rural areas, but will more money be made available to the courts to enable the court lists to speed up? These are all related issues.  If a young person, for example, is on eight or ten conditions for over a year, the chance of non-compliance increases because that is a restriction of his or her liberty for a very long period.  If a person is held in pre-trial detention, the impact on the person is much greater.  That time cannot be given back.  There is an omission in this Bill on the judicial convention of backdating of sentences.  Where that has a statutory focus, then it should be in the Bill.

I am not referring to the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill 2015.  This is only attaching a sticking plaster to the system of bail.  We actually need to look at other issues.

We need an evidence base of statistics, as already referenced by the Chairman - maybe my colleagues have those statistics - with regard to why people are being granted bail and why they are being refused bail.

If the person has a history of violent offending, that will be at the forefront of the judge's mind in making a decision, particularly in a section 2 bail objection, which relates to the likelihood of further offending.  If there is a risk based on prior conduct of serious violent offending, the judges will very much take that into account.  On the other hand, under the current law, the seriousness of an offence in and of itself is not a ground for refusing bail.  For this reason, one will see people who are charged with murder being granted bail because it cannot be established on the evidence that there is a likelihood that the person will commit a similar type of act again.  If the person has a very clean record, the risk may be low or may be met by setting conditions such as requiring a surety or the surrender of a passport.  Whatever the risk that is identified, it must be grounded in evidence.<\/p> <p>  The job of the garda in any bail application is to bring to the court the relevant evidence.

In such circumstances, people ask me what is going on in the justice system.  My point, therefore, is the inconsistency in some of the decisions on bail.  I understand that judges must make difficult decisions and people are human and will get things wrong.  For example, someone who is perceived as not being violent may suddenly become violent.

Simply having a requirement to give a reason for a decision is an improving factor for everyone, regardless of the type of decision.  It can only be of assistance to require reasons to be committed to paper in a clear and open manner.  It should not be done solely at the request of the defence or prosecution.  Victims, prosecutors, lawyers and everybody else will have an interest in understanding the reasons a decision was made in any given case.<\/p> <p>  The other point I would make regarding decision making in courts is that questions about consistency will always arise and the answer is to have transparency.  Members of the public always welcome knowledge.  Unfortunately, however, our perception of how the criminal justice system works is mainly derived from the media, and news values are not the same as justice values.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#U00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Malone"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I agree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#U00500","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":345,"content":"<p>The most serious offences are given most news coverage because they are the most interesting to the public.

We do not always know the reasons judges make decisions around sentencing and we do not have an integrated sentencing system or guidelines and principles for sentencing in this country.  This is very frustrating for people involved in the process and members of the public who, as Ms Malone noted, largely pick up their information through the media.  Having said that, we obviously do not want to interfere with the independence of the Judiciary.

It is interesting for observers such as myself to read about inconsistencies in the application of bail laws and in sentencing.  I do not necessarily mean that I read about these cases in the tabloid newspapers.<\/p> <p>  It is incumbent on us to ensure the Bill is given a thorough hearing.  Bail laws must strike a delicate balance between the rights of the citizenry and the civil rights of individuals who have committed crimes in terms of whether they are incarcerated or have to make good for their crime in some other form.  In many cases, I do not have any difficulty with electronic tagging.  This procedure should be funded to a much greater extent than at present, not only to free up space in the prisons.  In that regard, I thank Ms Malone for pointing out that six of the 14 prisons in the State were overcrowded either last week or this week.  Such statistics are not often placed in the public domain.<\/p> <p>  I represent north Dublin, and we all know that several years ago the State paid the Thornton Hall landowner &euro;30 million for a farm worth &euro;300,000.  The State, via the Prison Service, has invested a substantial amount in that project, with no results.  Significant investment is required in the prisons, including at least one prison in Dublin, to bring them up to a reasonable standard.  This is clear from the level of overcrowding in the prisons.  While tagging and better application of the bail laws will remove people from prisons and more garda&iacute; will deter people from committing crimes and, I hope, reduce the overall number of individuals incarcerated in the prison system, at the same time, it is clear that we need at least one and possibly even two new prisons.  I will leave it to the experts to make a determination on that issue.  <\/p> <p>  Society has moved away from the \"eye for an eye\" view of crime, whereby a person who commits a crime should be locked up and the key possibly thrown away, depending on the severity of the crime.<\/p><p>We need to employ more innovative approaches and international best practice in terms of rehabilitating individuals within our prison service.  That means treating them with dignity, giving them an outlet and ensuring, for example, that prisons are completely free from drugs.  Let us suppose a person is addicted to drugs when going into the care of the Prison Service.  We have read of cases over the years - I imagine the deputations have come across them too - of individuals who go into prison clean but come out addicted to drugs.  In a societal sense, that is horrific.  The State is effectively sponsoring that by locking them behind a wall and allowing such things to occur.  I am firm in my view that we should have a zero-drugs policy in prisons.  People should go in and come out clean.  I do not care what the cost is in terms of the human cost or the addictive step-down that occurs.  That is the nature of the incarceration as far as I am concerned.<\/p><p> I wanted to touch on some other things with regard to comments made by the deputation.  I was rather confused by something Ms Malone mentioned.  She referred to the lack of garda&iacute; or the reduction in the number of garda&iacute; in the context of a bail discussion.  Why was that mentioned?  Ms Malone can reply in a moment.  I wish to ask some more questions and then the Chairman can wrap up.<\/p><p> Ms Mulcahy made a statement to the effect that there is not much empirical data on figures that are in the public domain relating to those who are committing burglaries.  The Minister has made statements with regard to certain percentages on the matter.  Anyway, Ms Mulcahy used the word \"fact\" and continued to the effect that most burglaries are carried out by those who suffer from addiction but yet she did not know.  I do not believe it is possible to make a statement like that and use the word \"fact\" in the context of an Oireachtas hearing.  It is essential, as Deputy Finian McGrath adequately outlined and as far as I am concerned, that the inconsistencies in the application of bail laws are addressed.  Ms Malone - or perhaps Ms Duffy - was right to say that we do not read about the reduction in certain crime categories and that we only read about the salacious material that sells newspapers - let us be honest about it - or, in certain instances, the horrific crimes, such as the murder of an on-duty garda and such things.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, my view is that availability of training to members of the Judiciary is required in terms of the implementation of bail laws.  I agree wholeheartedly with Ms Malone about the publication of decisions in writing.  It should be an essential component of a functioning judicial service.  There should be no question over whether it should be requested.  It should be automatic.  Ms Malone has my full support on that point.<\/p><p> I had another point that I was going to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#U01000","speaker":"1014","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":351,"content":"<p>Does someone want to pick up on those points?

These are relevant in two respects.  First, the presence of garda&iacute; in the local community has been shown to have a preventative effect on crime.  People feel safer and there is more of a sense the garda&iacute; are present, aware and know what is going on in a given community.  Community policing has always been a crucial part of any criminal justice system.  The idea of the officer on the beat who everyone knows is important in an everyday sense.<\/p> <p>  It is also important in respect of monitoring bail conditions.  My colleague will correct me if I am wrong, but, as I understand it, if a garda requests certain conditions, such as, for example, signing on in a police station, then that garda or her station is then tasked with monitoring the fact that a given person continues to sign on.  That was the point I was making in respect of garda&iacute;.<\/p> <p>  There was a comment about an extra prison.  Thornton Hall was debated at length over number of months.  Many research reports were produced and considerable debate on the question took place.  The conclusion was that penal expansion does not assist communities in reducing crime.  If that were the case, then crime rates in the United States, where there is mass incarceration, would be exemplary.  We know that is not the case.  In fact, it is far from it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Malone"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":353,"content":"<p>To be fair, I was actually referring to the humane treatment of prisoners in that context rather than as a deterrent to crime.

Then they asked the public what sentences the public believed would be appropriate in given cases in the light of the public knowing all the facts of the cases.

It was harsh of me given that I am urging politicians to be careful about their language.  I suppose what I meant is that I highly recommend that people spend some time at High Court bail list hearings to get a perspective on burglary.  People would then see that on any given day most of the people being accused of burglary have addiction issues.  One might come across an armed gang member from a highly mobile group.  However, such examples capture media attention and hence political attention.  That was really what I was trying to draw attention to.  Unfortunately, because of the way we record statistics in this country, it is very difficult to get to the root of it and the accurate statistics.  That is something for another day.  Certainly, it would be better if we had more accurate statistics in this regard.  For example, if we knew what percentage of accused people go on to receive a custodial sentence, it would be helpful.  It would also be useful to know what percentage of people remanded in custody do not get convicted at all.  They may have spent six, seven or eight months in pre-trial detention, with no compensation offered to them.  That is six or seven months that they cannot get back.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to inconsistencies in bail decisions.  Obviously, it is of great concern to all of us when judges seem to get it wrong and release someone on bail.  However, I reiterate that they are dependent on the information that is presented to them from the PULSE system and the Garda.  The can predict all manner of human behaviour.  When allegations of violent behaviour are put before them, there is not a judge in the country who will not take that seriously.  They are quite risk averse and they know the way the media headlines will go if they get it wrong.  On the other hand, there is considerable inconsistency at the lower end of the scale.  We have seen women remanded in custody for failing to appear.  They may have chaotic lives or they may have gone to see a child in care but a judge might throw the book at them and remand them in custody for a week.  Is that an appropriate use of remand?

Certain conditions are easier than others to monitor, such as conditions to report and sign on at a Garda station, as it is easy enough to see whether someone is doing this.

Agreed.<\/p> <p>  We will move on to petition No. P00015\/15 which relates to cearta v&oacute;t&aacute;la - voting rights - and is in the name of Mr. Norman Wilson.  The petitioner who is an Irish citizen residing in Australia is requesting that citizens of Ireland who live abroad have voting rights in Oireachtas and European Parliament elections.  In its fifth report which was published in November 2013 the Constitutional Convention recommended that Irish citizens living outside the State be allowed to vote in presidential elections.  However, this recommendation did not include general elections, European elections, local elections or referendums.  The Government is required to report to the House on all recommendations made by the Constitutional Convention, it but has yet to do so in this instance.  On 23 October the D&aacute;il debated a report entitled, Voting Rights for Irish Citizens Abroad, which had been published by the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs in November 2014.  The committee has discussed this matter and deliberated on it.  We have agreed to forward a copy of the response received from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to the petitioner, with a copy of the transcript of the D&aacute;il debate on 23 October.  When matters before this committee as petitions have been substantially dealt with by the Oireachtas, there is a precedent that we do not duplicate that work.  As this matter has been dealt with, it is proposed to close the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  We will move on to petition No. P00022\/15 which seeks a referendum on whether the Republic of Ireland should rejoin the United Kingdom.  It has been submitted by Mr. Michael O'Neill on behalf of Mr. Orin Mhando.  The petitioner is calling on the joint committee to recommend to the Government the holding of a referendum to agree to the Republic of Ireland rejoining the United Kingdom in order to give Unionists living in the Republic of Ireland a voice and the opportunity to gain seats in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The petitioner did not take his suggestion to any Department or public representative in advance of submitting the petition which could be deemed to be of a questionable nature as it was submitted in the name of one person on behalf of another.  This is highly unusual and would normally happen only in circumstances where there are multiple petitioners or where an individual is unable to submit the petition personally.  We asked the principal petitioner to prove that he had the permission of Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Neill to submit a petition in his name.  In his response by e-mail he forwarded a link to a Twitter account claiming that this was proof of permission to use the name.  In addition, he did not tick the box to indicate that he would appear before the committee if it asked him to do so.  The committee has looked at the petition and deemed it to be inadmissible under Standing Order 165(2) which relates to admissible petitions.  The Standing Order states that, where a petition deals with \"local or regional matters\" or \"matters which are more appropriate to a regulatory public body or a body established for the purpose of redress\", the committee shall \"establish that all available avenues of appeal or redress have been utilised by the petitioner prior to the Committee considering the matter\".  The petition is inadmissible on these grounds.  It is also an unusually presented petition.  Is it agreed that it is inadmissible?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The final petition is petition No. P00023\/15 which is entitled \"unlawful discrimination and violation of European law\" and has been submitted by Mr. Luis Manuel Muegues Acosta.  The petitioner is a Colombian national and his wife is Spanish.  He states that when he arrived at Cork Airport on 19 July, an official stamped his passport with a work restriction notice and entered him into the immigration system.<\/p><p>If the petitioner is correct in the information he provided within his petition then under EU Directive 2004\/38\/EC - on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of member states - he should have been processed on the basis of his wife being a European citizen and allowed the same access and rights to work as her.<\/p><p> As a rule this joint committee does not get involved in individual cases, however, it was decided to seek an explanation from the stakeholders involved in this case to establish if there is a systemic problem when processing European nationals and their spouses when entering Ireland through passport control.<\/p><p> The petitioner has made contact with the secretariat and he was advised that as he had not allowed sufficient time to resolve his issue in advance of submitting the petition and also as this was an individual case, the joint committee could decide that his petition is inadmissible.  We have decided, following deliberation, that it is an individual case.  Unfortunately, we have to deem it inadmissible to be consistent.  However, an effort by our secretariat has been made, in good faith, to establish some of the issues that arise from the petition.  We understand that the stakeholders are currently working with the petitioner to resolve and investigate the issue.  On that basis, we are going to close the petition and we wish the petitioner well.  We have tried to assist as best we can within the very tight remit that we have.  I take it that is agreed?  Agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015110400002#E00400","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1446652800,"counter":382,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 4.52 p.m. sine die.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications","time":1446629400,"counter":383},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>The Joint Committee met at 09:30<\/p><p>MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Deputy Michael Colreavy, Senator Terry Brennan, Deputy Timmy Dooley, Senator Paschal Mooney.

I am joined, as the Chairman mentioned, by Ms Rosemary Steen, our director of external affairs; Mr. John Fitzgerald, director of grid development; and Mr. Mark Norton, network planning manager.  In April, we presented to the committee specifically on the North-South interconnector, and we are pleased to be back today to update members on the Grid Link project.<\/p> <p>  In March we launched our draft strategy for Ireland's grid development and carried out a ten-week consultation process.  The strategy looked at the changing technical and economic context for Ireland's electricity transmission system.  It examined the energy challenges facing Ireland and identified the steps we need to take to develop a strong, secure transmission system for homes, farms and businesses across Ireland, so that the electricity grid is capable of providing for the energy needs of the country now and into the future.  A key objective of the draft strategy was to ensure it aligned with, and supported, the broader economic policy landscape, including the Government's Action Plan for Jobs and IDA Ireland's regional development strategy.  The draft strategy reflects the change in economic circumstances and where we as a country, an economy and a society are now.  When first developed in 2008, Grid 25, as it was then named, which included plans for the Grid Link project, was designed to ensure the electricity grid would continue to support the Celtic tiger economy with its high economic and energy growth rates.  The past five years have changed that reality.  There has been demand reduction to the point where estimated demand levels for 2010 will not materialise until 2025 - a 15-year delay - and, even then, growth rates will be less than a third of the rates previously forecast.<\/p> <p>  In reviewing the way in which EirGrid develops the electricity grid on behalf of electricity customers, we committed to a number of core strategic pillars upon which our work would be based.  First was a commitment to open engagement and inclusive consultation with local communities and stakeholders in our approach to network development; second, an undertaking that practical technology options will be considered for network development; and, third, a focus on optimising the existing network to minimise the need for new infrastructure.  It is in this context that the draft strategy we brought forward included the new innovative regional option to deliver the Grid Link project.  Previous strategies had looked at delivering the project via either a 400 kV overhead solution or a fully underground option delivered using high-voltage direct current, HVDC, technology.<\/p> <p>  In reviewing our grid strategy, we set about marrying existing and developing technology via an advanced technology called series compensation.  This option would use the existing network and avoid the need for significant new overhead infrastructure.  Following the publication of our draft strategy in March, and at my previous appearance before this committee in April, a number of Members, here and across the Oireachtas, expressed support for the adoption of series compensation to deliver the Grid Link project.  In addition, the feedback from communities as part of our consultation on the draft grid development strategy was very favourable to the regional option.  It is important to stress that series compensation is only possible for the Grid Link project due to the extensive transmission network in the Munster and Leinster region, more specifically the lines that run from Moneypoint in the west to Leinster and the wider eastern seaboard.  Such a network is not available to us in the development of other major projects such as the North-South interconnector.<\/p> <p>  If we proceed with series compensation, EirGrid will be among the first transmission system operators, TSOs, in Europe to deploy it on the grid.  It is a technology that enables more power to be transported on a transmission line, provided the underlying transmission network is strong enough to support it.  We have carried out extensive analysis of the network in the area and determined that it is appropriate in this case.  Coupling the deployment of this technology with a new cable across the Shannon and a series of line upratings across the south east will enable us to deliver a good solution for the area, which will negate the necessity for significant new overhead or underground infrastructure for the Grid Link project.  As a technology, series compensation has been used over very long distances in some parts of the world, such as Brazil and California, but recent advances mean it is now suitable for use on smaller transmission systems like ours.<\/p> <p>  Questions have been posed as to why this technology was not put forward by EirGrid previously.  Series compensation is not a new technology.  However, it would not have addressed the need the Grid Link project was originally designed to address for any reasonable period of time.  The key point here is that changing demand forecasts and a slower rate of growth than originally forecast, combined with advances in technology, mean the series compensation option now represents a viable solution to meet projected needs for the foreseeable future.  In addition, series compensation has the benefit of offering significantly reduced costs to electricity consumers from the delivery of Grid Link.  To deliver the project via overhead lines or through the underground option would have cost hundreds of millions, as has been previously set out.  The series compensation option we have now committed to pursue will ensure the project is delivered in the most cost-effective manner available to us.  We will ensure electricity costs to both businesses and homes are kept to a minimum by adopting this option.<\/p> <p>  The more detailed technical workings of series compensation were set out in the report presented to the independent expert panel in September and published last month on our website.  Furthermore, this solution was peer reviewed by London Power Associates in the report published in March.  However, my colleagues and I will be happy to provide detailed information to members today, or we can meet them at a later date to provide further detailed briefings as required.  We welcome any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":389,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Slye.

There seems to have been a complete turnaround in respect of the company's previous plans, which included a Grid South and Grid West.  Why did EirGrid opt for this change in direction?  Mr. Slye indicated that the new grid strategy has been tested to ensure it can deliver power into communities for the foreseeable future.  How accurate is that prediction?  Given that the new projections are so out of kilter with those we were given in 2007, notwithstanding that the latter were based on Celtic tiger data, how confident can we be about the new forecasts?<\/p> <p>  In the past three or four years, there has been huge fear, anxiety and concern among communities in locations where pylons were to be installed.<\/p><p>How can these communities be reassured this plan will not be resurrected in the next 12 months or in the next ten to 20 years?  Has EirGrid new projections?  Has it tested other technologies?  Are these technologies foolproof?  If the figures of 2007 were so wrong, how can we be assured they are right in 2015?  How will EirGrid dispel the fears that there will be further attempts to install pylons in these communities?  There needs to be clarity that the Grid West and Grid South projects are dead, so to speak.  Does EirGrid have trust in the figure on which it is basing its projections?  How much has this aborted project cost EirGrid and what was spent on advice and fees up to this point?  Thousands of submissions were made against these proposals in 2013 and 2014 which were based on real concerns and anxieties.  They were rubbished, for want of a better word, at the political level.<\/p><p> Given that the EirGrid figures for its projections were wrong in the past, why has it confidence in the current figures?  How much money has been spent to date on the aborted EirGrid projects?  Given that the agency is not proceeding with the other grid projects, is there money available to do a proper job and have an underground interconnector, given that it is now technically feasible to do a North-South underground interconnector and using the savings from other projects?  By putting all the infrastructure underground EirGrid would be doing the correct thing by the communities in counties Cavan Monaghan and Meath.<\/p><p> With the permission of the Chair, I may ask further questions later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#D00500","speaker":"987","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions and I will go through them in the order in which they were asked.  First, the Deputy asked how sure EirGrid was of the data underpinning the figures for the adoption of the regional grid option.  We have done extensive analysis on this.  In addition to our own analysis, we commissioned Indecon to do a review of our analysis and to look at the economy sector by sector and region by region to see whether the plans we were putting forward would meet the needs of the regions for the foreseeable future.  The Deputy asked what foreseeable future means.  The horizon of the foreseeable future is out to 2025 to 2030.  We published the review by Indecon in March and it is available on our website.  We can discuss, if the Deputy so wishes, the data and figures in the report that looked at the south east and the adequacy of the regional solution to meet the needs of the network for that period.  Given where the economy is and where we see the growth in the economy, which is great to see, the make-up of the economy is very different now from what it was before the crash.  Before the crash, construction made up a significant proportion of the GDP growth in the economy.  I think we are all acutely aware that before the crash it accounted for more than 20% but now it is below 10%.  What is driving economic growth today is very different.  That in part is a reason the relationship between GDP growth and energy growth has changed.  One no longer gets the close correlation we had in the years between 2000 and 2007 between GDP growth and energy growth.  The make-up of the economy is different and cost competitiveness has become a significant focus for industry.  Energy has become one of the areas where businesses have become acutely conscious of the need to manage their costs to ensure competitiveness.  We only have to look at yesterday's announcement of the unfortunate closure of the Michelin plant in Ballymena to understand the impact of cost competitiveness on the sustainability of businesses.  Businesses are much more conscious of managing energy costs.<\/p> <p>  We are seeing the new standards in housing coming through in the new housing stock, so the use of energy per unit of residential housing is not as good.  For all those reasons growth rates in energy are now not as correlated with growth rates in GDP.  We want to ensure any option we put forward is robust and the plans we put forward will meet the needs of society and the economy.  At the end of the day, the transmission system is there to serve society and the economy and to ensure reasonable demands for electricity are met and the economy can grow.  We underpinned our analysis with an analysis by Indecon which went through that in great detail and we published that as part of the draft grid development strategy in order that we would get feedback from anyone who believed we might have missed in any way anything in terms of economic growth.  There was no feedback on any of it.  In fact there were supportive statements from various relevant agencies around it.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's second question was on the money spent to date.  In developing the Grid Link project to the stage where it is now, with the three options developed and we are about to move forward with one option, the total expenditure to date on the project has been of the order of &euro;12 million.  This includes the development of the three options and the comparison of the three options to enable the regional option to be selected as the way to move forward.<\/p> <p>  I apologise to the Deputy if I took up his next question in the wrong way but what I have written down is whether we understood the real concerns that were raised in the submissions on the Grid Link project.  There were of the order of 38,000 submissions made on the Grid Link project during the consultation period that ran from the end of 2013 into early 2014.  We recognised the very real concerns in the communities.  That was the very reason that in January we announced a series of five initiatives designed to address those concerns.  That consultation closed in mid-January and before the end of the month we had announced a series of five specific initiatives based on a very high-level review of the themes we had seen coming through in that consultation and other consultation.  We took an immediate step to try to address those because we recognised the concerns.<\/p><p>Those initiatives included a commitment to undertake a detailed study of the undergrounding option in the cases of Grid West and Grid Link, to review our consultation and engagement process, to put in place a community gain scheme for communities, to address in a very explicit way concerns around the tourism, agriculture and equine industries and to work with the review of electromagnetic fields which is to be undertaken by the relevant Department.<\/p><p> Perhaps it is worth mentioning that during 2014, we undertook an extensive review of our consultation and engagement process.  We engaged two external agencies to come in to help us with that.  They went out to meet stakeholders, individuals and groups that had participated in consultation.  They provided us with detailed reports and feedback, all of which we published explicitly on our website.  On foot of that process, in December of last year we set out a series of 12 commitments that we were making as a company in order to improve our consultation and engagement process.  We are continuing to look at how we can improve that.  It is fair to say that we listen to communities and try to respond.  We have looked to improve the manner in which we consult and engage with communities.  We are continuing to seek to do that as we go forward.<\/p><p> The Deputy's fourth question related to why we are not looking to put the North-South interconnector underground.  He correctly referred to the last time we were in here, when we spoke about the North-South interconnector project.  He pointed out that the technology to put it underground is available.  I suppose the first thing to say is that the project in question is now the subject of a statutory planning process with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, to which we have made an application for consent.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has engaged in a process of statutory consultation and it is running through that process.  Maybe that is the first thing to say.  The second thing is that undergrounding comes at a very considerable additional cost.  In 2011, the Government appointed an international expert, who reported to this committee in 2012.  The expert's estimate of the additional cost was that it would represent an increase of a factor of three.  We have done a detailed engineering, environmental, technical and cost assessment of a route-specific option for the North-South interconnector delivered using high-voltage direct current technology.  We have identified a route, costed and assessed the feasibility of that route and determined through that detailed work that the cost of such a route would be in excess of four times the cost of the alternative option.  All of that is published and available and forms part of our planning application, which has been submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I would like to make two points. Given that EirGrid got the planning of the Grid West and Grid Link projects so wrong, without putting a tooth on it, is it feasible at this stage to take another look at the North-South interconnector?  I suggest that it should be reconsidered in light of what has transpired with the Grid West and Grid Link projects.  EirGrid has spent &euro;12 million on the Grid Link project to date.  My assessment from the outset was that a group of engineers within EirGrid looked at this project as a means of getting power from point A to point B, without factoring in the human cost or the human issue in this regard.  State funding of &euro;12 million has been spent on a project that is now being shelved or postponed.  People in the communities out there are wondering whether this project is gone forever.  Mr. Slye has said that EirGrid is looking at figures for the period up to 2025 to 2030, which is a span of ten to 15 years.  Are we looking at this project coming down the line again?  Can Mr. Slye say at this point that EirGrid's current preferred option, with which it is proceeding in the cases of the Grid West and Grid Link projects, will suffice right into the foreseeable future in terms of making sure there is energy right around the country?  Is this being done on the basis of all the scientific evidence that is available to EirGrid and all the best practice reports?  Can we be assured that EirGrid will not come back and put fear into communities again in ten or 15 years' time?  Is the technology advancing so much that EirGrid can do that?  I suggest that it needs to dispel absolutely the doubt that persists out there.  I will conclude by repeating my first supplementary question.  Given that EirGrid got this so wrong, is it time to look at the North-South interconnector as well and make a decision on it that would be more amenable to the communities in Cavan, Monaghan and Meath?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#F00200","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":395,"content":"<p>The Deputy's first point related to the robustness and longevity of the regional option.  As I have said, we have assessed that option against the demand for energy in the region that we can reasonably foresee.  We are progressing with the regional option.  We are not progressing with the 400 kV overhead line option.  That option will not be progressed with.  We need to continually look at the evolution of demand and generation in the economy and in society.  It may well be the case ten or 15 years from now that we need to do something else to reinforce the grid.  We are continually reinforcing the grid.  Maybe it is worth pointing out there are approximately 200 projects in Grid 25.  We tend to talk about three of them, but there are 197 other projects that are under way.  We are continually reinforcing and updating the transmission grid as required to meet the needs of society and the economy.  We will continue to do that.  I do not think it would be responsible of me to sit here and say that there will be no need to further reinforce the transmission network 20 or 30 years from now.  However, I can say that the 400 kV overhead line option for Grid Link is dead.  I can say categorically that we are not proceeding with it.  We are proceeding with the regional option because we believe it meets the needs of the region and the economy for the foreseeable future.  As I have said, I am using that term in the context of 2025 or 2030.  We will continue to look at the demands of the economy and what society needs to ensure the transmission network is fit for purpose.  To the extent that there might be anything additional that might need to be done in the future - I imagine that there would be as the economy and society continue to evolve - we will work with communities to do that in compliance with the new strategic pillars we have set out, which involve trying to maximise the use of the existing infrastructure, working in close co-operation and collaboration with the communities that are out there and minimising the need for new infrastructure.

The fact that EirGrid has not been progressing with overhead power lines for the Grid Link or Grid West projects is viewed by myself and entire communities with amazement, bemusement and disgust at what seems to be a complete U-turn.  I speak for the people of County Meath who are reasonable, fair, very hard-working and progressive.  Our county has changed dramatically in the last 20 years and we are realistic.  We realise that change and development is necessary.  However, people should be treated with a little respect.  After eight years of public concerns and genuine fears being expressed, EirGrid has completely ignored the north east.<\/p> <p>  One of the first meetings I held when I became a Deputy two and a half years ago was attended by EirGrid and the North East Pylon Pressure, NEPP, group.  Members of that group probably feel that they are in a time machine because EirGrid has simply dusted off its original plan.  Apart from changing the height of the pylons, I would say that not even a comma has been removed from the initial plan that was put forward.  EirGrid launched a document recently entitled Your Grid, Your Views, Your Tomorrow, upgrading Grid 25.  It is a nice, shiny new document but there is nothing new in it in the context of the North-South interconnector, while Grid Link and Grid West are afforded other options, including underground lines.  EirGrid has never afforded the people of Meath, Cavan or Monaghan the same options.  The witnesses are before this committee today to discuss EirGrid's new, innovative plans but they will have to forgive me for not jumping for joy or doing cartwheels when the people of Meath have never been given other options.  I do not know if the witnesses have met many people from Castletown, Carlanstown or Kilmainhamwood.  If they have watched any football games involving the county, they will know that the people of Meath do not roll over.  We have not been treated fairly but we expect to be.  I need to say that because this has gone on for so long and people have not been treated fairly.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions for the witnesses.  They said that Grid 25 was designed to ensure that the electricity grid will continue to support the Celtic tiger economy but that the last five years have changed that reality.  For the past four years, EirGrid has continuously stated that there was an absolute requirement to achieve the Grid Link project, involving the erection of 750 pylons.  Yet, in the space of one year, the company has managed to do a complete U-turn.  A planning application, identical to the one that was lodged five years ago was lodged with An Bord Plean&aacute;la this year for the North-South interconnector.  That does not reflect the opening statement or the changed environment to which the witnesses have referred.  Why is that the case?<\/p> <p>  The witnesses spoke about new, innovative options but many would disagree with the assertion that the strategy for Grid Link is either new or innovative.  Why have new options not been put forward for North-South interconnector?  Why has nothing else been put forward?  Why are there no regional options for the north-east region?  The witnesses cannot tell me that there are no other options; there are definitely other options.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses also spoke about the cost effectiveness of the new project and that it would cost hundreds of millions of euro were the company to go ahead with the underground option.  Surely if hundreds of millions of euro will be saved, which is what the opening statement implies, then that money could be redirected and used for the undergrounding of the North-South interconnector because we now know that this is possible.<\/p> <p>  Finally, the witnesses referred to open engagement and inclusive consultation with local communities on all practical technological options but I would argue that EirGrid has not engaged with the people of north Meath.  It has not been able to provide a detailed costing for undergrounding because its representatives have not been let onto the land.  If the company has not been on the land, how can it carry out the study that would be needed in order to put forward an accurate assessment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#G00100","speaker":"1180"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":404,"content":"<p>First of all, before getting into individual questions I wish to make something clear.  On the Grid West project, we looked at various options to deliver it overhead and underground, in line with the terms of reference set out by the independent expert panel chaired by Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness.  We published the detailed assessment of both overhead and underground options earlier this year.  We have engaged with some people in the local community on questions they raised.  We have not progressed it further as we are awaiting the outcome of planning applications by some of the wind developers in the area that are in train.  Members are probably aware that one of the wind farms that was to be developed by Coillte, the Cluddaun wind farm in north Mayo, was refused planning permission.  The Oweninny development has been granted planning permission but the developers are looking to amend that permission.  We have sought clarity from the developers.  Obviously, we must await the outcome of their planning permission application before we can proceed with the project, in terms of the option that is most appropriate.  In effect, the project is on hold pending clarification from the generation developers.  The developers need to have clarity around the process they are undergoing with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The situation is very different to that pertaining to Grid Link.  While I am happy to answer questions on both, I am just pointing out that they are different and we should not conflate them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":405,"content":"<p>Are there not underground options for Grid West?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#G00300","speaker":"1180"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":406,"content":"<p>For Grid West we have a fully underground option as well as overhead options.  The Deputy is correct in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked why we have changed Grid Link now.  Grid 25 was initiated in the context of the 2007-2008 grid development strategy.  We obviously reviewed the project at each stage and published those reviews as part of the various consultations that we carried out.  The drop-off in electricity demand did not happen in 2007 or 2008.  It did not actually happen until 2010-2011.  The demand curve is set out in the grid development strategy to which the Deputy referred, namely the Your Grid, Your Views, Your Tomorrow document.  We have included both the historical and projected demand growth figures in that document and members will see that it was not until a significant period after the economy went through such a shuddering that demand fell.  We continually review the project.<\/p> <p>  I referred earlier to the specific commitment we made to make a side-by-side comparison between the underground and overhead options at the start of 2014.  That, coupled with the review of the overall grid development strategy, allowed us to identify the regional grid option and the use of serious compensation which, with advances in control systems technology, allow it be deployed on smaller transmission system than the thousands of kilometres that it had previously been used on in other parts of the world.  Those advances in technology, coupled with the fact that the demand had declined in real terms and that there was a shift in the make-up of the economy, allowed us to identify that as an option and to progress it and bring it forward.  It would not have worked in the context of the high growth rates of previous years.  <\/p> <p>  In the context of the North-South interconnector, the Deputy asked two questions.  The first was why the regional option will not work for that project.  The regional option involves maximising the utilisation of an underlying mesh transmission network.  It involves pushing more power through a mesh transmission network by deploying the newer technology on some of the transmission lines.  In the context of addressing the need to transfer power between the Munster region and the Leinster region, broadly speaking, there is an extensive mesh transmission network that has been built up there since 1927 which can be utilised.<\/p><p>In the case of a North-South interconnector project, however, two transmission grids were developed separately over time in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  These are currently joined by a single interconnector.  Quite simply, there is no underlying mesh transmission network that can be maximised.  In other words, the network on which we might deploy this technology in order to allow it to work just does not exist.<\/p><p> Deputy McEntee commented on the extent of the examination of the underground option for the North-South project.  I referred earlier to the fact the Government appointed an international expert commission to review the project and that this commission submitted its report in 2012.  We did an extensive analysis on a specific route, a detailed technical, environmental and economic analysis, which we also published.  Further to that, the then Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, requested that the independent expert panel, which he had appointed, chaired by Ms Catherine McGuinness, the retired Supreme Court judge, would look at all of the work that had been done on the North-South project, in terms of the assessment of the various options and provide an opinion as to whether the work was consistent and comparable to the level of detail of an examination of options which was then being requested for Grid West and Grid Link.  In the middle of last year, the expert panel issued a statement indicating that in all material respects the analysis had been done for the North-South project.  A comparable analysis of an overhead and underground option was published on 1 July last year.  We have looked extensively at alternative options for the North-South interconnector project.  We have published them and made them available.  They also form part of the planning application file that has been submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p><p> Deputy McEntee asked whether the money saved by the deployment of a regional option for Grid Link, which is a lower cost solution than either an overhead or an underground option, could be diverted to an underground option for the North-South project.  We examine each project and have to make a decision based on Government policy and the specific needs involved.  To spend hundreds of million of electricity consumers' money on putting the infrastructure underground does not seem to be the appropriate answer.  This is also supported by the regulators, North and South, who have been quite clear in their views on the appropriateness or not of incurring the additional cost associated with an underground project.  Recently, the Northern Ireland regulator was explicit on the urgency of the project, the need to get it through and the fact that the overhead option was the only realistic one.<\/p><p> The Deputy's final question was on consultation and engagement with people on the North-South project.  We have made considerable efforts to try to continually improve how we consult and engage with communities.  We recognise that delivering transmission infrastructure which benefits the entire State and all electricity consumers but impacts more directly upon a smaller group that hosts the infrastructure is a difficult prospect.  We are always considering ways in which we can improve how we consult and engage with affected communities.  We recently appointed agriculture liaison officers, some of whom are in the Gallery, to specifically try to engage with communities located along the route.  We understand that these are very real issues for people who are concerned about the impact of the project.  We are committed to trying to work through the issues and to address them where it is possible to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":408,"content":"<p>Following the initial meeting two and a half years ago, the purpose of which was to move the project forward again, I would have thought there would have been some sort of consultation with people rather than their being informed that there is only one option.  In 2010 and 2011 we were told the lights would go out if the project did not proceed but we now know that is not the case.  There has not been a single change to the proposal for the North-South interconnector.  While we talk about the different changes, it has never been reflected in the North-South interconnector proposal.  We all know there has to be progress.  However, the company has been trying to bring forward the project for eight years and to say that something has been published on the back of a report that is probably 500 pages long and expect people in counties Meath, Cavan and Monaghan to find that and understand what it says is ridiculous.  If the company wants to move this project forward, it needs to be able to bring people with it and show that it has worked with them.

I reviewed the questions I asked on the previous occasion they appeared and I wish to indicate that I will be asking some of them again today.<\/p> <p>  I like to start from a point of agreement.  I think we would all agree that every business, agency, politician and person on the island of Ireland wants adequate, reasonably costed, secure green energy now and into the future.  After that, we seem to run into difficulties.  It seems to me and many others that but for the massive public opposition to the overground Grid Link project, the rethink would not have happened.  Massive public opposition and serious political concerns meant that a rethink happened and a solution was found, which solved many of the problems that were causing distress to people in the path of Grid Link.  Let me say \"Well done\" to those people.  Were it not for their opposition, an incorrect decision that would have led to an increased cost being incurred by the State and taxpayers would have been made.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of specific questions which I will put to the delegates before I deal with the lessons to be learned.  One of the key lessons from the rethink on Grid Link is that people re-examined the forecast demand and came up with a realistic estimate of the projected demand for the next 15 to 20 years.<\/p><p>Has that been done regarding the North-South interconnector?  Are we dealing with reality when we talk about projected demand in the North-South interconnector scenario?<\/p><p> My second question is on the regional option or series compensation.  Am I correct in believing that means that supply can be taken from a low demand area to be used in a high demand area?  I do not know how it works so will somebody explain to me whether that involves taking supply from low demand areas and putting it into high demand areas?<\/p><p> My third specific question is about the series compensation or regional option.  Does that facilitate integration with supply in Britain or on the European mainland in terms of future energy security?  Does the technology support that integration?<\/p><p> The points I made at the last meeting lie at the heart of the North-South interconnector issue.  I suspect that the witnesses believe that because something has gone to An Bord Plean&aacute;la the job is done and there is nothing people can do about it.  When I asked questions at the last meeting such as whether the impact of over-grounding on house values, land values and tourism had been considered, the replies were to the effect that they looked at what happened elsewhere but it is subjective and difficult to put a measurable impact on it.  Is that fair on the farmer who will have pylons on his or her land or whose house will be overlooked by pylons?  Is it fair to the owners of hotels, guest houses, pubs and caf&eacute;s who will see a reduction in the number of tourists coming into their areas and who depend on tourism in those areas?  We need to be able to measure the impact of any developments.  If there are adverse impacts from good developments, that reality has to be taken into account.  Adverse impacts arising from good developments can happen.  I was not satisfied with the answers I got on the last occasions so could we explore that issue this morning?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#H00500","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":413,"content":"<p>The Deputy's first question was on forecast demand.

In terms of the Grid Link project, as we do with all projects we review them before we move them to the next stage.  We continually do that.  When we did that with the Grid Link project as part of the overall review of Grid 25 and the detailed assessment of overhead and underground options, this new technology option became a viable option that was identified at that time.  It was not identified earlier because of the higher demand levels and higher demand growth rates.<\/p> <p>  It is appropriate that we continue to review projects at stage gates as they go forward to make sure that where there are new options, we identify them.

When we published our draft review of the strategy we included this in it because we had done that, and we continued to do the detailed design and assessment of it through the rest of the year, such that we could do that full assessment of the option.  However, we felt that to mitigate the issue the Deputy mentioned about the suddenness of it coming out, and given that we had identified it as a strategic option back in March, we should be open and transparent about that and get communities' feedback on that as part of the wider grid development strategy.  That led us to a point where, in September, we had done that detailed comparison of the options against the criteria of environmental, technical and economic considerations.  We try to manage it in that way and be systematic about the way we review projects to make sure that we are only bringing forward those projects that are appropriate, and that we continue to assess them to make sure they are appropriate.

I welcome the change with Grid Link and Grid West and utilising the existing infrastructure.  That is to be commended.  We have an existing North-South infrastructure at the moment in time of 220 kV.  I realise the difficulty with running a 440 kV cable underground and the expense of that.  My question is as follows.  We have a 220 kV interconnector and need a 440 kV interconnector North-South.  Has EirGrid considered the possibility of running an 220 kV interconnector underground in parallel with the existing overhead that is there?  That is an option and if it has not been looked at, it should be.  I share the concerns of the people of Meath, Monaghan and Cavan and note their reluctance and the way they have been treated.  They see what has happened with Grid West.  EirGrid said there were no new options for the interconnector between North and South.  Has EirGrid considered the possibility of an underground solution in parallel?  It can run in parallel with the existing overhead.<\/p> <p>  On the question of demand for electricity reducing, we are talking about planning for 2025 to 2030 and 15 or 20 years ahead.  There is no guarantee that demand will not increase.  More houses and factories are being built, which we encourage, and demand will go forward.  I would like EirGrid to look at the possibility of running a complete 220 kV interconnector underground in parallel with the existing overhead.  EirGrid has looked at utilising the existing 220 kV and increasing the height of the pylons or adding the odd one in when the spans are too long.  I hope that has been looked at.  I am not happy that there is no alternative to an overhead interconnector.  I am not convinced about it and I would like Mr. Slye to convince me.  That is my main concern and it is the concern of the people of the north east.

There is a technical alternative to overhead on the North-South interconnector which is the deployment of high voltage direct current, HVDC, technology.  This involves a convertor station at each end and a cable between the two converter stations.  This is technically not as good a solution because one is inserting a new technology into the middle of a mesh AC network and it requires very complex control systems to manage it which have a risk of failure.  It also does not facilitate economic development along the route in the same way an overhead line does.  We spoke earlier about some large companies tapping into the existing transmission network which is possible with an overhead transmission network.  The scale of costs involved with an underground HVDC are so prohibitive that no industrial customer would do it, which is another reason it is not a good solution.<\/p> <p>  However, HVDC is a technical alternative and we have set out the costs associated with that technology, which are very significant.

It is not possible to run a high voltage AC circuit at 220 kV or 400 kV for the length of the North-South interconnector.  To go underground one would need to move to a different technology which is HVDC technology to deliver that.  The voltage has an effect on the amount that can be underground, but it is an inherent fact of AC transmission technology that there are technical limits on the amount of undergrounding that can be done at high voltages.  We have looked at an underground solution, we have looked at ways to deliver that underground solution and we have determined that it is not possible to do it at AC but it is possible to do it at DC.

I have sat through these meetings from the very start and from the day that the chairman designate of EirGrid was before the committee.  I asked him if he would like to live beside a pylon himself.  He said &quot;No.&quot;  Over the years the committee has heard that we were a growing economy, which we have at the moment, thank God, and that a growing economy would require this project on a regional basis.<\/p><p>The committee was told that under no circumstances could there be any option other than lattice structures.  We heard from EirGrid representatives that in the west there would be no option other than lattice structures.  I am not from either of those regions.  I am from a region where we have these structures crossing the mid-west from Loop Head, right through the centre of County Clare, up into Tipperary and down into Limerick.  I was always interested in the project and whether, in the event there was an underground option for new development, there would also be an underground option for existing networks.<\/p><p>This process appears to lack any degree of credibility.  There is zero credibility.  We are back in a situation now where the economy is growing.  The IDA tells us that one of its fundamental requirements is a need for energy in the regions and I imagine that includes the south east and the west.  All of a sudden the south east and the west are stalled or scrapped, depending on how one looks at it, but not the north east.  The north east will not benefit from this.  The committee learned from a meeting with representatives from EirGrid that the beneficiary of this project will be Northern Ireland.  We find ourselves in a situation where areas that will be worst affected will not benefit at all.<\/p><p>We are also being told that there is a possibility of laying a cable, presumably in the seabed to France with all the different technologies and voltages between the French and the Irish sides, while at the same time every excuse is put in the way of linking this jurisdiction with the Northern jurisdiction, ultimately to benefit the Northern economy.  I do not have a difficulty with that but there is a difficulty with the double standard which emerged a long time ago when this committee was told one could have any option in the south east and west as long as it was a lattice structure.  That has now changed but it has not changed for the north east.  I do not represent that area but I look at fairness and impartiality and it would seem that if we are going to have a growing economy on the entire island and if there are deficits in energy supply, there would be a universal approach on an all island basis but that is not what is happening.  It seems to be piecemeal and <i>ad hoc <\/i>and we are at a stage now where we are nearly making it up as we go along.<\/p><p>As a Member of the Oireachtas I have zero confidence in this system at the moment.  If I were representing an area that was under the microscope for this, I could not tell people I had any confidence in this as it is being chopped and changed.  Two or three years ago the committee was told that this was the only option for the south east.  Now that is gone and there are many options for the south east.  It can be solved regionally and there is a possible solution for the west but we are still being told there is no solution for the north east other than the one we are going to plough ahead with.  At the same time there is the possibility of a cable to France at God only knows how much cost and I presume it is not going to be lattice structures across the Celtic Sea or the Bay of Biscay.<\/p><p> I have a very straightforward question.  Could we stop the pretence that things cannot change and everything must be as it was three years ago?  Everything is not as it was three years ago and there have been changes.  The economy is growing and there is much more demand for electricity, as there will be in future.  It seems there is a complete lack of credibility from the organisational perspective in how this has been designed and sold.<\/p><p> I said last week with regard to another organisation that a hames has been made of this from start to finish.  We are now in a position where this is happening in one region in the country.  I do not represent it and know nothing about it but if I was from there, I would be very sore.  There is an obligation, as this body is owned by the taxpayers, to listen to people.  That has not been done at all for the past number of years.  The chairman-designate said at the time that he would not like to live beside one of these structures and his honesty was refreshing, although it nearly cost him his position.  If he would not like to live beside one of these, why should somebody in Cavan, Monaghan or Meath, as their communities will not benefit in any case?  The beneficiaries would be communities in Northern Ireland with an energy shortage.  Ironically, at the last meeting we were told the cable would go underground when it crosses the Border.<\/p><p> We have been at this a long time and we are going around in a circle.  As we have gone on the merry-go-round, two regions, namely, the west and the south east, have fallen off.  To inject any degree of credibility into what is being done, EirGrid should pull the handbrake and admit this has been a public relations farce from start to finish.  It should explain how it was to consult with people and produce nice documents but although it got 38,000 submissions, it seems it did not listen to anybody.  This is not what is needed.<\/p><p> Now that EirGrid has decided to forget about the lattice structures and pylons all over the south east and it is looking at undergrounding options, where does that leave the existing infrastructure built from Loop Head up through the centre of the country?  People in the regions have grown up with those structures and we have spoken about electromagnetic radiation, with potential health and planning impacts.  There are other concerns in the north east, the south east and the west.  Where does this leave people in the midlands and the mid-west, who have had these for the 30 years since Moneypoint opened?  People have a right to be absolutely incensed by the way in which this issue has been handled from start to finish.  There is zero confidence in this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#L01300","speaker":"1058","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I will take a brief supplementary question from Deputy McEntee before reverting for replies and taking the next three members, Senator Byrne, Deputy Fitzmaurice and Deputy Durkan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#M00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I have a clear and straight question.

It could not be clearer.  Mr. Slye has stated it here.  That has changed incrementally over the past number of years.<\/p><p>The representatives from EirGrid made a clear statement to Deputy Moynihan the last time I was here.  This did not exist in 2007.  Apparently, we were told it could not be done.  That is the clearest statement possible.  The people of Meath will not accept anything less.  That is a fact.<\/p><p> The opposition to this project is such that it is surely a factor in the cost calculations of EirGrid.  The fact that this project has been delayed for eight years must surely be a major factor in terms of the additional costs that EirGrid has incurred, some of which are the fault of EirGrid and others that are through no fault of EirGrid.  In any event, that cost is there and it will continue throughout an oral hearing.  There was no word in County Meath about the east-west interconnector underground.  I know some objected in north Dublin, perhaps, but not a word was said in County Meath.  Generally, EirGrid has good relations with the community in that part of the county.  That must count for something.  It is in place for four or five years at this stage and it must be looked at.  That must be the way to do it, instead of riling the people and creating considerable anger and unfairness in respect of how different parts of the country seem to be treated based, it seems to me, upon political representation.<\/p><p> I am keen to make another point.  The Deputy from Limerick is Deputy Patrick O'Donovan.  I should know him because at one time we appeared on the same episode of \"Where in the World\" some 20 years ago.  We were against each other.  That is a little known fact, but he reminded me of it some years ago.  He made the point that there would be no benefit to the north east and that this was only benefiting Northern Ireland.  I am keen to put on the record that I have no difficulty benefiting the North.  Certainly, I support anything that can lead to better integration of the electricity market on this island and working towards an all-island electricity market.  However, it cannot be done at the cost of an environmental, health, historical and heritage catastrophe.  That must be taken into account.

For the sake of the future, EirGrid representatives have said previously that they could not do it in every part of Ireland.  Part of Grid West was supposed to go underground at the time.  Why can we not facilitate the people now in Monaghan and those affected by the North-South issue and put it underground and go for it?  It may cost a little extra but I do not believe people begrudge other people in any part of the country eyesores.  I do not want people enduring eyesores, no matter where they are.

There is no such thing as saying that it is not really five times and it may be two and half times, in which case it would amount to the same thing.  That is the cost.  At present, they are designing systems in the UK to transmit electricity overground.  If people want them to go underground, then the relevant region pays for it.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned about this and I do not believe EirGrid is going anywhere.  I do not believe EirGrid has identified the extent to which economic growth in this country is going to drive the requirement for energy in future.  EirGrid has failed in that regard.  EirGrid has changed decisions in mid-air without consultation with anyone.  That is not something to engender confidence in either the people who are affected or the public representatives who have to carry the responsibility for it.<\/p> <p>  As Members of the Oireachtas, we have shouldered the responsibility in recent years of doing what a previous Government determined we should do, that is, develop alternative energy.  However, there are few options.  We have been left swinging.  I totally disagree with what Senator Byrne has said.  His organisation knew full well what was going on.  I was invited to Cavan, Monaghan and north Meath when I was a spokesman on this matter to address these issues well before the last general election.  What was going on there was well known.

We prepared the report as per the terms set out by the independent expert panel on the underground and overhead options.  We published that earlier this year and we have engaged with communities around that.  The project is on hold, pending clarity from the developers of the various large wind farms around Mayo and their intentions.  As we mentioned earlier, one of them, the Cluddaun wind farm developed by Coillte, was refused planning permission earlier this year.  The Oweninny wind farm, parts of which are being developed by Bord na M&oacute;na and other parts in a joint venture with the ESB, currently has planning permission but an application to alter this is currently with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Obviously, we would envisage that the developers would want to see the outcome of that planning process before they can provide clarity.  We do not think it is appropriate to move forward with an engagement with communities around selecting an option until we get clarity from the developers as to what developments in terms of renewable generation in Mayo will be proceeding.  That is the status of the matter: it is on hold pending clarity around that.  We have asked urgently for the developers to provide us with clarity on that.  Notwithstanding this, the planning process that is currently under way will have a material impact on their plans.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice also mentioned Carrick-on-Shannon.  There is a huge number of transmission lines in the vicinity of Carrick-on-Shannon, overhead transmission lines, both 220 kV and 110 kV.

I thank the Deputy for the feedback on that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked a question about the North-South interconnector and whether there was the option to produce more in Northern Ireland.  At the outset, I want to say that we are statutorily barred from engaging in generation in any way, shape or form, contracting for it or engaging in the buying or selling of it.  What we have is an all-island energy market that was initiated in 2007.  Part of that is a mechanism that encourages generators to develop the appropriate generation facilities to meet the needs of the island as a whole.  That was a core premise of the all-island energy market, that it would serve all customers on the island.  What we have seen is that there is sufficient capacity on the island but that in the specific jurisdiction of Northern Ireland there is not, hence the need for the North-South interconnector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#P02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":533,"content":"<p>If there were 40 km underground, could the line be upgraded without putting anything else in the overhead part of it?

She was categoric that the North-South interconnector had to proceed because of the serious consequences for security of supply in Northern Ireland.  The supply and demand balance will move into deficit after 2021, which threatens the ability to keep the lights on in Northern Ireland, that most fundamental touchstone of provision of electricity supply to fuel an economy.  She was quite clear that in terms of what is needed to be done, there is no plan B and we really need to move forward with this and deliver it.<\/p><p>This is a critical project because it will provide security of supply for consumers in Northern Ireland and across the island.  The all-island electricity market has been in place since 2007 and it has served customers well.  It is a robust wholesale market.  Part of the initiative in this regard was to create a grid that would allow power to flow seamlessly across the island to where it is needed.  The key link is the North-South interconnector and it needs to be delivered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#Q01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":551,"content":"<p>Is there no plan B?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#R00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":552,"content":"<p>There is no plan B.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":553,"content":"<p>On behalf of the committee, I thank Mr. Slye, Ms Steen, Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Norton for attending.
