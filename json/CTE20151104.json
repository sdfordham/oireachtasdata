I also welcome Mr. Diarmuid Cronin, who is a community alert development officer.<\/p><p>The reason for this meeting is that it is 30 years since community alert was established in Carrigtwohill in east Cork.  There was a commemoration recently there which I was privileged to attend.  The invitation to the witnesses is a result of those 30 years of work, to take stock and to engage with Members of the Oireachtas to see what is needed now and how the Houses can help and learn from the experience of Muintir na T&iacute;re and the work that is taking place.  In some ways, the current situation mirrors what happened 30 years ago and there are things going on in the modern context that need to be dealt with in the same way as they were back then.<\/p><p>Before we begin, I draw the attention of our witnesses to the situation in respect of privilege.

We have given the committee a detailed written submission.  In view of the time constraints, I will pick a few highlights from it and leave the committee to study the detail.<\/p> <p>  Muintir na T&iacute;re is a national voluntary organisation dedicated to promoting the process of community development.  It was founded in 1937 and aims to enhance the capacity of people in communities to become involved in local social, economic, cultural and environmental development.  For the past 30 years, we have actively promoted the community alert programme in partnership with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This programme continues to harness the voluntary input of community members to provide a community crime prevention programme in over 1,400 community alert groups nationwide.  The programme operates with the five principal partners, Muintir na T&iacute;re, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Health Service Executive and, most importantly, local communities.  The programme is operated by five community alert development officers, one for each Garda region outside of the Dublin area.  My colleague, Mr. Cronin, is the development officer for the south west of the country.  The engagement that we have with all those local groups enables us to identify many issues arising in the area of crime prevention which is relevant to this committee.  The current issues can be summarised under a number of categories - the seniors alert scheme, pendant alarms and changes that have been made to that scheme recently; Garda resources; the judicial system; adequate deterrents to crime, funding; and victim support.  In our written submission, we have details under all of these categories but I will concentrate on the recommendations that we make in section 6.<\/p> <p>  We suggest the establishment of a special purpose committee to examine rural crime.  This could be similar to the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, which had a limited lifetime and budget but which was asked to make specific and practical recommendations.  This would allow for more public consultation than this committee will have time for and could instil a sense of participation in the communities that take part.  <\/p> <p>  We strongly support the provisions in the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill - currently going through the Houses - regarding consecutive sentencing and refusal of bail for repeat offenders.  We agree that the right to freedom and the presumption of innocence need to be weighed against the constitutional protection afforded to a citizen's dwelling and we feel this Bill offers a balanced approach to these issues.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the recent establishment of the second Special Criminal Court and hope it will significantly reduce the time it takes to process cases.  However, it must be adequately resourced and must not simply be a reallocation of resources from elsewhere in the Courts Service.  We request a review of the free legal aid programme, of its costs and efficiency of delivery.  While recognising a right of legal representation, we feel this should be reviewed for repeat offenders.  Consideration should be given to reducing the representation for legal offenders and possibly treating the costs of this representation as a repayable loan.  We also request a review of the allocation of resources to crime prevention and crime detection and punishment.<\/p><p>We believe a slight shift towards prevention could have significant impact.  This would include an expansion of the community alert, neighbourhood watch and crime prevention ambassador programmes.  Such a review should also value voluntary input and examine ways of recognising it.  For example, it may be possible to make a contribution towards the costs of properly established text message alert programmes.  Currently, communities must cover all the costs associated with these programmes, including texts, insurance, signage and VAT.<\/p><p> We request a review of the prison system, including a review of the balance between cost and security.  Such a review should also consider non-custodial options which might be appropriate in certain cases, including tagging, curfews, transport restrictions and expanded community service programmes.  We would also suggest a review of anti-social behaviour in built-up areas, villages or estates and how anti-social behaviour is currently dealt with, and an examination of options for practical and fast sanctions and how to expedite landlords' abilities to terminate the leases of undesirable tenants.<\/p><p> Since Muintir na T&iacute;re made its submission, the Minister has made proposals in a number of these areas, and we welcome the proposals as a first step.

The ambassador programme involved training those older people who had time to spare in issues around crime prevention and how they could advise others on crime.  The volunteers then visited the houses in their area where older or vulnerable people lived.  They were able to supply information from the Garda and advise people on how to secure their homes and look after themselves.  The programme was primarily about crime prevention but included some health advice.  At the end of the programme, the volunteers were rewarded with thanks and recognised with a certificate.

I have researched the inconsistent spread of victim support measures around the State.

The EU directive, which has been partially implemented, does provide for that level of support.  The Garda generally issues two letters to a victim, one at the beginning of an investigation and one when a perpetrator is identified.  The feedback from victims is that this is not enough, as the correspondences can be too far apart.  In order for victims to receive more feedback, they would like to have personal contact with a member of the force who is investigating the crime.  There are restrictions on what victims can be told, but at least they could be reassured that something is happening.  In a case that may take two years to bring to fruition it can be a long time in which to hear nothing.  E-mail has been suggested as a quick way of keeping victims informed about a case's progression.  Muintir na T&iacute;re would concentrate on promoting victim support through the Garda, as that is what victims want and appreciate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#C01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Garvey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>CCTV is an issue that is constantly raised at community meetings, and the major success of CCTV is seen in the divisions where it has been introduced on a fairly widespread basis.  The area I know best is the west Cork division.  Communities in west Cork, in co-operation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the county council and local sponsors, have raised the necessary finance to install CCTV in various towns and villages throughout the division.  The success of the CCTV can be seen in the division's crime statistics, which are among the lowest in Ireland.  It is a very large area and it would take a person about two hours to drive in any direction north, south, east or west.  Crime has a way of thriving in remote areas, but CCTV can be important at the choke points.  Communities and garda&iacute; are very good at identifying where the choke points are.  In a large division like west Cork there are bridges and intersections that are difficult to avoid and must be crossed.  The difficulty for many communities is in finding the necessary funding.

The success of the text message alert programme over the past two years shows that technology has a place in assisting communities.  We now have over 700 registered text alert groups, and more than 20,000 texts are sent each month to help prevent crime.  Our experience shows that where groups are set up to implement the text alert guidelines correctly and where there is a body of such groups in a district then crime is reduced in those areas.  The statistics do add up.  That group, which is mentioned in the submission, must pay its own costs, which are not extortionate, but when one moves towards CCTV then the costs change completely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#C01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Garvey"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>The witness gives west Cork as an example.

The neighbourhood watch group has the liaison Garda who attends the community alert meetings but the extra resource of the Muintir na T&iacute;re development officer is a huge advantage.<\/p><p> The issues in towns are in many ways similar.  Anti-social behaviour is one of the more important issues that needs to be dealt with in towns and housing estates where people who have purchased homes are unfortunate enough to be neighbours of individuals who are making their life a misery.  It is an issue that has become more prevalent at the meetings I attend.  In some areas, one would imagine there is an organised systemic campaign to drive people out of their homes.  It is the issue of the future and it is growing.  There is a victim-bully relationship in certain cases where the individual is afraid of the bullies and afraid to make a statement to the Garda and afraid to use legal means.  It is necessary to create some system where a community group can act as an individual and make a statement of complaint and take a case on behalf of their community to change the way certain estates are being ruined by individuals who could not care less about their neighbours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#C02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Diarmuid Cronin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cronin.

I attended a number of meetings at which Muintir na T&iacute;re representatives spoke about their experience in other areas.  It is a tremendous organisation.  Its recommendations and the issues that arise at community alert meetings are a tremendous help because they are about people on the ground.  Its recommendations and observations are food for thought for those overseeing the criminal justice system.  Our committee compiled a report on penal reform which looked at community sanctions rather than imprisonment.  I am interested to note that the organisation is looking at electronic tagging and other forms rather than incarceration, based on the analysis of the threat the person poses.  There is so much I could say on this issue.  The organisation's contribution is excellent and I am sure we will forward it to the Minister for Justice and Equality, although she may have it already.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the joint policing committees, I have been a bit concerned about them.  The good news is that the new policing authority, when in place, will oversee joint policing committees.  They were a very good initiative when introduced but, as with many things, over time they become stale.  The witnesses may have different experiences from county to county but my sense is that with a new policing authority assuming responsibility for them, I hope they can get a fresh lease of life because it is important that senior police officers work at it.  Obviously Muintir na T&iacute;re's model is a partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it works well, but extending that model to the wider communities urban and rural is the issue.  I want to hear the observations of the witnesses on the joint policing committees and how they could improve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#D00800","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I am a member of the Cork joint policing committee, having been recently elected to it.  I was a guest of that committee and of the Limerick committee as well as being a member of the Kerry committee.  I note a different approach from that of the past.  After the new committees bed in it will be interesting to see if there will be a different approach or more commonality.  They are an important forum for discussion and what happens after that.  In some ways we have a dual system because in community alert we have regular district meetings.  Our strategy document used to ask for four district meetings per annum.  We now have two because of the sheer volume of meetings.  Any forum where there can be a good discussion about issues affecting the community is positive provided there is a means to take the considered judgment of the forum up the ladder and make some effort to change.  The important issue is the desire to change rather than the nuts and bolts of the actual change.<\/p> <p>  We mentioned sentencing earlier.  Sentencing is probably the most difficult area in which to make major changes because if a person is sentenced to incarceration with limited space that will not go anywhere fast.  We need to be more imaginative and always to follow the money.  If an individual has finances, property or a vehicle, ways and means should be put in place to punish him by sequestering his assets.  If a criminal is carrying out raids throughout the country and owns a vehicle, the vehicle should be seized.  If he has a driver's licence, it should be taken from him.  If he has a passport, his opportunities to enjoy his ill-gotten gains in Spain or wherever should be limited.  If an individual comes into property and if it changes hands at some stage, the loans he receives for free legal aid during the course of his life should be paid back.  If a young criminal starting out in life sees that this is a career that will give him a nice lifestyle, that can be countered by making the free legal aid a loan repayable out of his benefits.  There are many imaginative ways of dealing with an individual besides sending him to jail.  In the present age of development of technology, electronic tagging has a major future.  The number of awful crimes committed - murders and worse, if anything is worse - by people who are out on bail is such that beggars belief that it has been allowed to continue for so long.  The problem is that there is no space in jails to keep people.  Therefore tagging is important.<\/p> <p>  There is a major security industry across Ireland.  There are fleets of security vans criss-crossing the country as well as the Garda fleet.  It should be possible to create a system where at any time of the day or night an individual can be checked to see whether he is where he is supposed to be.

I am a big supporter of these programmes, having seen waves of crime and criminal gangs so many times in Donegal.  The only way to truly defeat them is with the community working hand in hand with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

It is the way to go.<\/p><p>With Garda station closures, I am concerned about the perception of security, particularly for elderly people.

The garda&iacute; need to be mobile and able to put up a checkpoint on quiet rural roads.  Besides the motorways, there is a fantastic network of roads in rural Ireland that takes people into the most remote places.<\/p> <p>  The garda in a local station must have a proper office.  It is no use just having a building, as he or she needs a computer with broadband access and everything that goes with it.  The garda must be able to do the job efficiently, and technology and up-to-date information in the office is an absolute must.  There is that aspect to it.  Where community alert groups and garda&iacute; are working well, there is a low crime rate.  Taking it by division and where district meetings are being held religiously, with a relationship built up by the communities and garda&iacute;, and where information is coming in a two-way conversation, text alert has revolutionised the ability of the garda&iacute; to get relevant information quickly to thousands of people in a district or division.

We also have a network of approximately 180 to 190 community councils dotted around the country.  Most of those councils have community centres and halls, and there is also the possibility that Garda stations could be put in those on a day per week or fortnight.  This would mean garda&iacute; would be more visible in rural areas.  The Garda stations would not be replaced but at least garda&iacute; would be more visible on a weekly or fortnightly basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paddy Byrne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":35,"content":"<p>To respond to the Deputy's question on resources and the allocation between garda&iacute; and communities, to put it in perspective, Operation Thor was launched this week and we welcome it.

This aspect of the debate is frequently left out.  It is a matter of what garda&iacute; stationed in a particular station are doing during their eight-hour shift.  Consider the community policing practices of the Metropolitan Police in London.  A regular police officer spends at least six hours of his or her eight-hour shift on the beat in the community.  In Ireland, by contrast, officers have not reached that number of hours.

That is what Deputy Finian McGrath was speaking about in terms of the Metropolitan Police.  In that force, the officer on the beat knows his or her patch and the people, and they know the officer.  When one is on a first-name basis with one's local member of the force, it means one is much more likely to come forward and assist.  One is much more likely to come forward on time rather than at a later stage.  Time and again, I hear at meetings about the frustration members have experienced because of information being received days after the event.  The text alert has come some way towards speeding up the flow of information.  Sectoral policing, whereby the local member of the force has time to move around his own community, is desirable.

Individuals who pick up a gun thinking they are going to confront raiders on their property by firing a warning shot are, in the first instance, going to create two victims: the guy they fire at and themselves.

What happens if the gangs begin to arm themselves?  It leads to chaos.

I looked at the various markings.  A common denominator of all forensic markings is that they need ultraviolet light to be seen.  They come in many different shapes and forms but ultraviolet light is the common denominator.  It is needed for the search parties that go out to search a criminal's property and in the district offices where a criminal is being proceeded, to see the markings if they are present.  At the time there were a number of companies - the major players were SelectedDNA and SmartWater.

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs resources in order to have a system in its laboratory to read the markings.  It is a game changer and is a major player in other jurisdictions.  It is a crime preventative because if a property is marked, it creates a big reason not to raid it.  I spoke about such a product at one of my community alert meetings and a person asked me where he could get it.  I asked him what exactly he would be using it on and he said that he had a record collection of LPs, including some golden discs which were quite valuable, and he knew that if he marked his records that no matter where in the world they were distributed, whether the USA, UK or Europe, they could be traced back to him.<\/p> <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na recovers an immense amount of property every year which has to be auctioned because nobody can claim it and the Garda cannot determine who is the owner.

We should ask ourselves if we are fostering a situation in which we are creating extreme criminals over a period of time.

During our last appearance before this committee, in November 2014, we spoke at length about multiple issues that faced the Reserve Defence Forces at that time, namely the introduction of key performance indicators to the Reserve, structural conflict between the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Forces, recruitment and the package of supports required for the Reserve into the future.  We also spoke about the hidden costs to individual reservists which are an unwelcome element of membership of the force.  We spoke about the training, roles and functions of the Reserve, issues that existed at the time within the Naval Service Reserve element of the force, and international trends regarding the utilisation of reserve forces and the supports required for this to be achieved effectively.  The final matter we spoke about were the benefits of reserve membership to individuals and the benefits that reservists bring to the military, their civilian employers, and their communities in general.  We believe a brief update on these matters is warranted.<\/p> <p>  Key performance indicators are annual performance benchmarks that a reservist must meet in order to be considered as an effective member of the force.  The most serious challenge facing reservists is the annual medical exam.  It had to be conducted during working hours in a military barracks and was not the easiest task to organise for volunteer reservists who have civilian employment.  Thankfully, we can report that an interim measure now exists which allows reservists to be medically examined by their GP, in their own time and at no cost to the individual thereby dispelling this problem.  It is a positive development but, unfortunately, the Defence Forces have not revised its personnel management infrastructure to cater for medical grades provided by GPs which presents an obstacle for reservists in terms of access to fitness tests and courses. <\/p> <p>  In terms of the Naval Service Reserve, we are happy to report that forum meetings have been subsequently held between us and the military authorities with a view to rectifying many of these outstanding issues.  These meetings have been extremely productive and all involved are actively working towards improving the Naval Service Reserve into the future.<\/p> <p>  We can also report that the employer engagement programme which we initiated has been formally adopted by the military authorities.  A Defence Forces working group on Reserve Defences Forces employer engagement has been established and it includes two members of this representative association.  The working group will shortly release a Reserve Defence Forces employer's handbook which is the first step to actively engage with Irish employers but more will be needed in this regard.<\/p> <p>  The issue of recruitment is still a matter of significant ongoing concern.  Following the reorganisation of the Defence Forces in 2012, the Reserve was reduced from an establishment figure of 9,500 down to 4,069 personnel.  That figure has been increased to 4,169 personnel following the announcement in the White Paper of an increase in the Naval Service Reserve establishment figure.  At present, the Reserve has 2,712 members due to a lengthy recruitment and promotions embargo which has adversely affected the supply of new personnel needed to bring the force up to the establishment figure.  The embargo has also had the knock-on effect of making it difficult to fill vacancies as they arise. <\/p> <p>  This year, recruitment competitions yielded an increase of just over 300 new members but retirements due to natural wastage have resulted in a loss of more than 200 other personnel.  Overall this means that there has been a net gain of approximately 100 new members.  If this rate of increase were to continue on a yearly basis into the future then it will be 2030 before the Reserve will have recruited up to its establishment figure which is a period beyond the intended life of the White Paper.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the package of supports required by the Reserve into the future, one of the key issues is the use of staff from the Permanent Defence Force.  We completely recognise and acknowledge that specialist instruction from highly qualified members of the Permanent Defence Force is vital to the progression and development of the Reserve.  Therefore, we contend that the involvement of such highly qualified Permanent Defence Force instructors with the Reserve, as instructors, should come with a financial incentive.<\/p><p>With this in mind, a Reserve Defence Force specialist instruction allowance should be investigated with a view to its implementation for members of the Permanent Defence Force, specifically for those Permanent Defence Force instructors who can provide expertise that the Reserve does not organically possess.<br\/><br\/>The roles and functions of the Reserve in respect of training have been formalised in the recent White Paper.  The White Paper states that the primary role of the Reserve is to augment the Permanent Defence Force in times of crisis, and a further formal role assigned to the Reserve is to contribute to State ceremonial events.  In this regard and in particular in respect of the primary role, we seek clarification on what exactly is defined as a time of crisis.  If this definition is allowed to remain vague and nebulous, as it is currently, it could arguably result in the under-utilisation of the Reserve in times of great national need.  Furthermore, in respect of the primary role of the Reserve being a force to be called on only in times of crisis &ndash; an as yet undefined term &ndash; the White Paper also references the creation of a specialist Reserve because:<\/p><blockquote>...there may be professional skills that on occasion may not be readily available in the PDF. In this context, there may be individual members of the RDF, who by virtue of their professional civilian qualifications or in the case of members of the FLR, professional military skills, have the competence to undertake such specialised tasks. These could include ICT, medical, ordnance and engineering professionals.<\/blockquote><p>While we are delighted that such a specialist Reserve is to be created, it makes little sense to attract highly-skilled and qualified professionals to this force, only for them to be told that they might be used in a future time of crisis, whatever that might be.  A serious motivating factor for such qualified professionals to join a specialist Reserve would be to apply their civilian skills in a military environment, i.e., to actually do a job.  Therefore, we strongly request that the Reserve be provided with a defined role that includes utilisation of the Reserve outside of crisis situations, for the sake of attracting qualified professionals to the new specialist Reserve and to get the best value for money and engagement from the Reserve Defence Force in general.  Everything, including recruitment, training, the level of commitment of members and organisational outputs, flows from purpose.  This purpose must be real, current and tangible rather than a distant maybe.  Personnel need to be utilised for operational roles and the requirement of that operation will drive the training and standards.<br\/><br\/>The hidden costs of membership are primarily the costs of travel to and from reservist barracks or training centres.  These costs have actually risen following the barracks closures of recent years which have forced many reservists to travel further afield to attend training.  Recently, the Minister stated his intention to use an element of the &euro;437 million capital spending plan on defence to begin rolling back the pay cuts imposed on members of the Permanent Defence Force by the Lansdowne Road agreement.  The Lansdowne Road agreement similarly resulted in Reserve Defence Force pay cuts, and so we are seeking assurances that any roll-back in Permanent Defence Force pay cuts will include a roll-back of RDF pay cuts as well.  Unlike the Permanent Defence Force, those in the Reserve do not enjoy graduated pay scales.  On obtaining a given rank, a reservist will be paid at the entry level for this rank for however long he stays at this rank, despite length of service.<br\/><br\/>Similarly, the end-of-year gratuity was taken from Reserve members in 2012.  Ostensibly this was to provide a force of 4,069 members with 41,000 paid training man-days per year but this was a membership figure the force was never enabled or allowed to reach.  Moreover, the number of paid training man-days has been slashed annually to its current allotment of 26,000 per annum.  This effectively negates the reason for removing the gratuity from members in the first place.  In contrast, members of the first line Reserve, that is, ex-Permanent Defence Force members, still receive a gratuity, as do members of the Garda Reserve.  The White Paper states that reactivating annual paid training for members of the first line Reserve is to be investigated, i.e., the provision of an additional source of income for this group.  To members of the Reserve, the benefits of a returned gratuity would also outweigh the relatively small cost.  It would have a significant and positive impact on recruitment and retention within the Reserve, primarily by making it less expensive for someone to be a member of the force and thereby producing the greatest value-for-money to the State.  The gratuity was generally a much-needed end-of-year reimbursement for the often-substantial costs incurred travelling to and from barracks and other military training locations.  We contend that the reintroduction of a gratuity needs to be investigated as a matter of urgency.  We believe Reserve members, who are loyal and committed volunteers in the service of the State, should not have to pay out substantial sums in annual travel costs to give this service to the State.  Furthermore, we completely agree with the earlier statements from the Minister to the effect that the Reserve needs to recruit the right people.  A gratuity would certainly go a long way towards attracting qualified professionals to the force.<br\/><br\/>We broadly welcome the contents of the recently published White Paper on Defence and consider them positive and constructive.  Outside of Chapter 8, which deals with the Reserve Defence Force, we have identified initiatives that could be expanded to utilise or benefit Reserve personnel.  First, a scheme similar to the defence contribution to employment support scheme for those aged 18 to 24 years, as outlined in Chapter 4 of the White Paper, could be established for unemployed reservists.  This would see these individuals obtain skills that could aid them in securing employment.  These skills would also then be retained within the Defence Forces.  Second, in respect of women in peacekeeping, Chapter 3 of the White Paper identifies that all-female overseas units may be required in gender-sensitive peacekeeping roles.  While the Permanent Defence Force is comprised of 6% women, the Army Reserve is 16.3% female while the Naval Service Reserve is 22% female.  This clearly marks Reserve female personnel as worthy of serious consideration for inclusion in any such all-female overseas peacekeeping unit.<br\/><br\/>We are keen to clarify that this representative association completely supports the implementation of the contents of the White Paper, but we also wish to advise on how elements of the White Paper, as they pertain to the Reserve, could and should be implemented.  The White Paper provides scope for such suggestions, for example, &quot;The Department of Defence will undertake a review of the provisions of the Defence Acts and bring forward proposals for any changes to the Defence Acts that may be required in order to reflect the possible crisis situations, where activation of members of the Reserve is appropriate.&quot;  Another example is, &quot;The broader RDF organisational structures will be kept under ongoing review by the Department of Defence.&quot;  A further example is:<\/p><blockquote>Accordingly, approaches to recruitment and retention will be kept under ongoing review having regard to their success rates and the key goal of having an efficient and effective Reserve. In this context, the current organisational structures will also be kept under review.<\/blockquote><p>A final example is, &quot;The Department will identify the options available to underpin the engagement of those specialist members of the Reserve...&quot;<br\/><br\/>The word &quot;review&quot; is mentioned many times.  It is evident that the specifics of how decisions relating to the Reserve will be implemented have yet to be finalised.  Therefore, we are keen to advise on how several elements of the White Paper of relevance to the Reserve Defence Force could be rolled out or advanced in future.  Furthermore, we are requesting that this representative association should remain central to any panels or boards involved in such implementation, since the presence of representative association delegates in such circumstances could only benefit the overall process.  Representation is an essential part of the military management blend and we require assurances that no unilateral decisions will be taken without proper consultation.  I thank the committee and I am happy to invite any questions members of the committee might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#H01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil Richardson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Mulley, Mr. Richardson and Mr. Mulligan for the presentation.  It was succinct and clear.  It raises a number of issues; first and foremost is the area of recruitment.  I have raised the issue of recruitment in the Reserve Defence Force on several occasions here and in the House with the Minister.  I am convinced that the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, is strongly committed to the development of the Reserve.<\/p> <p>  Given the figures, the reality is that there continue to be significant difficulties in achieving the establishment figure.  Mr. Richardson stated in his presentation that at the current rate of progress it will be 2030 before the establishment figure is reached.  Let us consider that reality alongside what appears, on initial reading, in the White Paper to be a strong commitment to the Reserve.  However, then we factor in the frequent use of the term \"review\".  It seems to create a situation in which there is not, in so far as the Reserve is concerned, the sort of certainty that is needed to be able to move forward and conduct the type of effective recruitment campaign that is needed.<\/p> <p>  I have looked at the Reserve forces throughout Europe.  In many countries there are more members in the Reserve than in the permanent defence forces.  The reverse is the situation here.  In light of the overall situation, and given that all of us are supportive of what this is about, we have to see that there is a major benefit to society at large in having a reserve force that can be called upon routinely and in times of crisis, as referred to in the White Paper.  However there is also a significant benefit to those participants in the Reserve.  Perhaps the deputation could tell us a little about that.  My sense is that the training, discipline, collegiality and everything that comes from participation actually benefits the person as well as benefiting society.  Moreover, there is an ultimate benefit for employers.  I call on the deputation to outline more to us their ideas around the specialist Reserve that may be established and the extent to which that specialist Reserve could be used.  I take the point made by the deputation that unless we have a broad meaning attributed to \"crisis\" then we will not see the level of utilisation that we should see of this specialist Reserve.  If we have a broad use or broad interpretation of \"crisis\" then \"crisis\" ceases to have any meaning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#J00200","speaker":"1054"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":84,"content":"<p>We will let the witnesses back on that question and then you can put a further question afterwards, if you wish.

The testing should be the same as for members of the Permanent Defence Force; we wholeheartedly agree with that.  There is interest out there in joining the Reserve Defence Force but the message is simply not reaching the people who might wish to join.  Our suggestion is that a national campaign might be more effective than the type of localised campaign that has been pursued until now.  If the advertising budget were spent on a national television and radio campaign, as well as on social media and new media campaigns, as opposed to placing advertisements in local newspapers where they might not necessarily be accessed by young people, it might lead to a serious increase in uptake.<\/p> <p>  We are hearing talk at present of the upper ceiling for enlistment being dropped from 35 to 25 years.  If we are trying to recruit qualified professionals and specialists to the Reserve, we should bear in mind that it will be particularly difficult to get people with any serious amount of experience in any sector at age 24 or 25.  As such, we would like to see the ceiling retained at age 35.  In the British Army, to give a comparison, our cousins across the water hire some specialist personnel up to the age of 60.<\/p> <p>  One aspect of recruitment about which we have serious concerns relates to Garda vetting and the process whereby applicants have to fill out a form and send it off for processing and approval before they are eligible for recruitment to the Reserve.  In some instances, it is taking nine or ten months for those forms to be processed and returned, by which time the Garda clearance is void.  There are dedicated citizens who want to join the Reserve but who are being turned away because their Garda vetting forms were not processed on time.  This issue affected some 100 applicants this year, which is a serious chunk of our recruitment.  It is an issue we would like to see addressed.  The main point I would like members to take away regarding recruitment is that the budget probably does need to be redirected into something more national rather than having local campaigns which may not be connecting with young people.<\/p> <p>  I ask my colleague, Mr. Mulligan, to deal with the question of the definition of a crisis situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil Richardson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>We are 100% happy that members of the Reserve Defence Force are carrying out their ceremonial role effectively.  However, clarity is required in respect of our crisis role.  The Government has asked us to augment the Defence Forces in crisis situations but we need to be prepared for such situations.  In particular, we are being cut out in the training necessity, or what a commander perceives would be a training necessity.  The White Paper mentions aid to the civil power and aid to the civil authority tasks as an area where support could be given.  However, there is no particular Reserve Defence Force syllabus for that area.  To some extent, training for that role can really only be acquired by completing the job in hand.  In that regard, there is a necessity for people to be operationally driving the training requirements of the Reserve.<br\/><br\/>On further training, chapter 8 of the White Paper states, &quot;Notwithstanding the ability of the PDF to undertake day-to-day operations and to deal with a range of contingencies, there are circumstances where operational demands could exceed the capacity of the PDF.&quot;  The document goes on to give as examples of such circumstances: &quot;... a significant deterioration in the international security environment resulting in a conventional military attack on this State, a large scale security event at home, certain civil contingencies that could require large scale Defence Forces' support, e.g., a major pandemic, events that require a sustained effort over a prolonged period of time ...&quot;  The White Paper states that the Reserve Defence Force offers a cost-effective means of mitigating the risk of the Permanent Defence Force being unable to meet operational requirements.<br\/><br\/>Taking chapter 8 into account, together with the suggestion of particular response teams set out in chapter 3.3 in respect of the defence of the State from armed aggression, we must bear in mind that the generation of military capabilities can have significant lead-in times.  If the definition of a crisis situation is nor sufficiently clear, it could lead to an implied view than an aggressor will effectively work to a timescale that is convenient to the Defence Forces.  In reality, maintaining military capabilities for a worst-case scenario on an ongoing basis would be prohibitively expensive.  This is where the Army Reserve and the Naval Service Reserve can provide an ability to transition immediately into an organised and capable insurgency force with established resources, skills, tactics and leadership, such as the command control we have at the moment.  Under the current Reserve model, resources, skills and leadership instruction extend from national to local level and there is a capacity to transition quickly into a well-resourced, well-organised and well-dispersed local insurgency organisation under the single-force concept, which emphasises the importance of a local Reserve Defence Force as a bedrock element of defence policy.  In order to realise that role, we must be prepared for it.  However, the definition of the crisis element within the White Paper does not allow for that.  It must be incorporated within the operational day-to-day implementation of the role.<br\/><br\/>In the case of the Naval Service Reserve, we are carrying out a role at the moment where there have been shortages of personnel within the Naval Service.  Going by the definition in the White Paper, are we to take it there will never be such shortages of personnel into the future and, if so, what exactly would define a crisis?  Will we have one commanding officer who will decide we are not in crisis through shortage of personnel, in which case Naval Service Reserve personnel will not be asked to support seagoing vessels, even though we could have a commander on a particular seagoing vessel who is seriously short of personnel during a particular trip?  It is a question of who defines what constitutes a crisis.  We have had situations where leading hands were given their own watch going forward.<br\/><br\/>Another issue to consider is that the Naval Service Reserve is currently performing an information-gathering function within the primary ports around the coast.  In the Waterford unit of the Reserve, for instance, we go out and patrol weekly, carry out sighting reports and pass them, through a reporting mechanism, back through operations within the naval base.  In other words, the Naval Service Reserve has <i>de facto<\/i>been carrying out a port security role, albeit through a voluntary organisation, within the Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Dublin port areas.  In the current economic climate, it does not make sense that, via the definition of &quot;crisis&quot;, we may be effectively undermining the assets we have within the Naval Service Reserve when it comes to protecting our ports.  Is the White Paper inadvertently undermining a vital voluntary asset for coastal information-gathering on behalf of the State?  In short, we are worried the White Paper might undermine the deterrent function we are performing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Mulligan"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Will the delegates elaborate on their reference to an employment support scheme?

It is a fantastic way of engaging with employers and showcasing the value of reservists.<\/p> <p>  The question then arises as to what the next step should be.  International trends suggest that step should be employment protection legislation to support reservists in times of activation and utilisation, coupled with employer supports.  To give an example, the Australian military will, instead of buying in a lawyer from a civilian firm, activate a reservist lawyer and pay him or her at the appropriate rank.  The individual's employer is reimbursed to a certain degree for the loss of that staff member.  This works out cheaper than hiring someone from the private sector to come in and do the job and there is a gain for the reservist, his or her employer and the military.  It is something we will need to look at doing.  The employer engagement booklet is very much a first step; deciding what comes next is where it gets tricky.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil Richardson"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":90,"content":"<p>The ending of the Reserve gratuity seems to be to be a significant problem.

If the gratuity had been retained, it would make it at least cost-neutral for them to join and that could seriously increase our numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil Richardson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Richardson for his presentation.  My colleague, Deputy Crowe, my party's foreign affairs and defence spokesperson, cannot make it today because there is a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I was my party's previous defence spokesperson and I am fairly well placed to represent him here today.<\/p> <p>  The issues during my time as defence spokesperson were around the cutbacks.  In the peak, in 2006, the budget was &euro;7.1 million and, in 2014, it was &euro;1.3 million.  It was a very serious cutback that they faced.  Allied with the issue of the centralisation of training and access facilities, it must be having an impact on recruitment.  To a degree, that has been touched on.<\/p> <p>  The Government cut the numbers of Reserve Defence Force in half, slashed the budget drastically and made it much more difficult for potential young recruits to the Reserve Defence Force from rural areas to access it.  When one talks about the White Paper - next year there will be a net gain of 100 and projections forward to 2030 - one of my concerns in the past was that when these decisions were being made RDFRA, as a representative association, was not getting access to the Minister to convey its concerns.  The Chairman was a Reserve Defence Force member for 23 years.  I would like to believe that every Member of the Oireachtas genuinely respects the role, patriotism and community participation of members of the Reserve Defence Force.  What is RDFRA's sense of how we can start to reinstate the Reserve Defence Force's place in Irish society over the next 20 years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#L00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I will pass the question over to Mr. Mulley.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil Richardson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>On the budgetary allocation, we are down to &euro;2,150,000 in the Estimates for this year.  In contrast, that is half the cleaning bill for cleaners engaged by the Defence Forces.  When one looks at the phone bill, it is four times what is allocated to ourselves.  In that context, it is a straight-line graph which has been going down since 2012.<\/p> <p>  On fulfilling the numbers in the recruitment, we have a situation now where we are not maintaining the numbers we had originally.  Even though we had 150 recruits who crossed the threshold, got in and got a boot on their foot last year, the system that is in place is now very elongated and we are taking nearly 12 months to bring somebody in, from first contact until he or she finally reaches attestation.  That is too long for any voluntary organisation.<\/p> <p>  As regards the reinstatement of the resource allocation, as the financial situation improves in the country, we would be delighted that an allocation would be improved also for the RDF.  The bottom line here is that if it is a set allocation, then that is all we can do.  We cannot recruit any more.  We do not have the clothing for them, we do not have the footwear for them and we will not have the places for them if the allocation is not increased.<\/p> <p>  The other factor going forward to 2030 would be that the RDF needs a functionality.  As the Chairman said on the previous occasion, one cannot be training and then do nothing with the training.  We need a framework whereby those who will make decisions at some time in the future at these reviews will set out the functionality.  Even if it is only barracks duties or whatever kind of in-house duties we can carry out, that would fulfil some role for a start.<\/p> <p>  The interesting part is the specialist Reserve that is talked about in the White Paper.  We have many specialists.  Even in smaller units, we have a range of specialists, from carpenters to scientists.  If those reservists were utilised in a role at home before they had any role overseas or anything like that, it would be a step in the right direction.  It is difficult for the professional combat soldier commander to turn around and say he or she has 20 RDF members for Friday next.  It is difficult for them to get to that point because we all are engaged in our own employment.  The fundamental element to address that is employment legislation.  If one can guarantee that one can take 20 guys out of their jobs on Friday next for a week and that they will be in their job the following Friday, then there is no problem.  That professional soldier will say to himself that he can count on those RDF members, that is where he has a gap and that is how he can fill it.  It is not pie in the sky to say that we need employment legislation.  The committee members will be well aware at this stage that there are zero contract hours and all sorts of turn-up-when-you-can type contracts.  Anybody who is in a job will not risk his job and would be foolish to do so.  The more responsible members of the RDF are those who would be in good jobs.<\/p> <p>  Going back to one of the questions Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l asked earlier on the benefits to the personnel themselves, we would see tremendous benefits to the community.  We would see tremendous benefits to the personnel themselves.  Over the years, very few who have been through the RDF or, as it was previously, the FCA, ever ended up behind bars or anything like that.  One or two might have along the way but I can assure the committee that there were very few because we are a little community in ourselves.<\/p> <p>  In summary, we would see employment legislation, whatever shape that might take at any future date, as essential to reassure members of the Permanent Defence Force that they can call and rely on the RDF to do a job.  We would see that the reinstatement of the resource allocation would greatly enhance what we can do within that budget framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Mulley"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I assume the transcript will be sent to the Minister for Defence anyway.

It would be a win-win situation.  It would be a stepping stone for the individual towards gaining employment.  One gains many skills in the military, other than marching, and they all add up on a CV.  From a community perspective, it would be ideal if people knew that if they joined the RDF they might be eligible to participate in such a programme, if the unemployment rate keeps going the way it is.

I mentioned an anecdotal example from Castlebar.  If one's fitness test is arranged for a Wednesday and one is asked to go from Castlebar to Athlone barracks in the middle of a working day, chances are one will not be able to get time off to do it.  The Defence Forces are trying to arrange these, where possible, outside working hours and on weekends to accommodate these applicants.  Often, the fact that the recruitment process is made somewhat difficult for people who have civilian jobs or education commitments that prevent them from attending the recruitment testing phases means the people who join the Reserve are those whose schedules happen to align with the testing.  Given the shocking difference between the thousands who apply for each recruitment competition and the 200 or 300 who are taken in, we are missing many people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil Richardson"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I have concerns about the age limit of 35 from the perspective of the RDF trying to recruit people.

We have three officers being commissioned at the end of the month, two of whom are marine watch keepers, a qualification which takes considerable study and experience to achieve.

You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <\/p><p>Members should also be aware that under salient rulings of the Chair they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#O00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and committee for inviting the Irish Council for Civil Liberties to speak with them today.  We are happy to be here to discuss the general scheme of the bail Bill, which concerns the State's use of pre-trial detention.  That involves the holding of people in prisons before their guilt or innocence in regard to a particular offence has been determined.  This, as members will know, is the holding of people on remand. <\/p> <p>  Members will also know that people who are charged with a crime are entitled to that most fundamental of rights enshrined in law throughout the centuries, that is, the presumption of innocence.  Having said that, there are accepted reasons the State can restrict a person's liberty in circumstances where he or she has been charged with an offence.  The O'Callaghan principles in section 2 of the Bail Act 1997 have, up to now, provided the main legal basis in Irish law regarding the provision of bail.  These reasons include the risk of flight, the seriousness of the offence, the likelihood of reoffending and likely interference with witnesses or jurors., among a number of other matters.  A delicate balancing act is employed by judges in determining whether to grant bail, and the seriousness of the decision in granting or refusing a bail application must not be underestimated.  <\/p> <p>  Before I talk about specifics, I would like to highlight three key issues around the bail or remand system in Ireland.  First, there is no maximum for remand duration in Ireland, unlike best practice in other European countries.  Second, in regard to people being held on remand in Irish prisons, the Irish High Court has criticised the conditions in Irish prisons in the Kinsella case in 2011.<\/p><p>Third, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment has recommended to Ireland, in the context of bail provision and remanding in custody, that it continue to pursue &quot;vigorously multi-faceted policies designed to put an end to overcrowding in prisons&rdquo;.  Under international human rights law, bail refusals should be exceptional and justified in the circumstances of specific cases.<br\/><br\/>The application of bail laws is protected so fervently under international human rights standards because taking away a person's liberty before he has been convicted of a criminal offence can, as one can imagine, have serious and significant ramifications for a person&rsquo;s right to privacy, family rights and right to a livelihood.  The consequences of remand will reverberate throughout a person&rsquo;s life and, most likely, stay with him forever.<br\/><br\/>International research shows that ethnic and religious minorities, foreigners, people suffering from mental illness and people with an intellectual disability tend to face a disproportionate risk of being held in pre-trial detention.  We are talking about the most vulnerable of the vulnerable.<br\/><br\/>Let me give some specifics on the general scheme.  The possibility of a speedy trial is one of the key factors in the O'Callaghan principles.  Members will be aware that we struggle in Ireland in terms of the length of time one must wait for a trial.  In 2008, we were found to be in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights in the case of McFarlane <i>v.<\/i>Ireland.  This has been omitted from head 26 of the Bill.  We strongly urge the committee to recommend that head 26 of general scheme be amended to include all of the O&rsquo;Callaghan principles, particularly with a view to considering the possibility of a speedy trial in determining the granting or refusal of bail.<br\/><br\/>The ICCL is a member of the Victims Rights Alliance.  We work to protect and secure the rights of crime victims in the criminal justice process in the State.  We welcome the efforts in head 26 to afford additional protections to victims and their family members by guarding against interference with witnesses.  However, we are concerned over the possibility, as set out in the general scheme, that a complainant, or alleged victim, may be able to give subjective information about the likelihood of interference by an alleged offender, or somebody who has not been convicted of anything.  Victims should have the right to participate effectively in a criminal process.  However, we suggest that the proffering of evidence as to the suitability of a person for bail, or not, should remain within the realm of the Garda.<br\/><br\/>Head 27 of the general scheme restates section 2 of the Bail Act 1997.  I refer to the refusal of bail to prevent the commission of a serious offence.  It includes a restatement of various factors that the court should take into account, such as the addiction of a person to a controlled drug.  Under the general scheme, this has been extended to include intoxicating liquor.  We urge the committee to ask the Minister to take steps to make progress on the use of alternatives to pre-trial detention, particularly where a person is an addict or suffers from another vulnerability, such as homelessness.  In addition, the establishment of bail supports and services in the community would be a more effective way to treat lower-level offending than excessive periods in pre-trial detention.  This has been proven in research, which I know my colleagues will talk about.  This is missing from the Minister&rsquo;s proposals.  Evidence shows that alleged offending by vulnerable accused persons tends to face a disproportionate chance of pre-trial detention.<br\/><br\/>The trend across democratic countries is to explore alternatives to pre-trial detention, and not to increase it, for the very reasons I outlined at the beginning of my statement.  I wish to conclude by urging members to ask the Minister what she intends to do to have a concrete impact on the integrity of the bail system.  It is welcome that various items of legislation are being codified in the general scheme but the additional factors therein do not address the key issues.  This is a piecemeal approach.  The key issues concern how the excessive periods waiting for trial are being addressed and the Government's alternatives to pre-trial detention given the current state of the Irish prison system.  We have to operate in the reality of the system as it exists and how we wish it to be in the future.  Finally, what types of bail supports will the Minister put in place to assist repeat offenders, particularly those in more vulnerable categories?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Duffy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#P00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":131,"content":"<p>The IPRT very much welcomes the invitation of the committee to address it on the general scheme of the Bill.  While the Bill is a largely welcome development, constituting a comprehensive restatement of the law on bail, it also provides an opportunity to revisit some aspects of the legislation that are problematic, in addition to flagging some concerns, especially about omissions in the Bill.<\/p> <p>  In the interest of keeping to time, which I know is very limited, I will not repeat the submission of my colleague from the ICCL.  However, I can say without reservation that we endorse each of the recommendations she has made.  I refer members to our written submission, which we stand over.  It might be helpful to address the committee on the scale and impact of pre-trial detention and go into a little more detail on the case for bail supports and services.  I will address electronic monitoring, which I believe has not been addressed elsewhere, and talk very briefly about mandatory sentencing, which finds a place within head 40 of the Bill.<\/p> <p>  There is no question but that pre-trial detention does have a place within the criminal justice system in ensuring that certain defendants will be brought to trial.  However, overuse of pre-trial detention and its impact on liberty and the presumption of innocence are really significant.  Pre-trial detention is expensive.  When used excessively, it not only has an impact on individuals but also places a strain on prisons, which are already under strain, and diverts resources away from those who are already serving a sentence and the rehabilitation of the latter.  Exposure to prison itself is damaging and makes people more likely to reoffend, not less likely.  An accused person who is remanded in custody may find it more difficult to prepare his or her defence adequately.  It is for all these very practical reasons, in addition to principled reasons, that the European Convention on Human Rights requires that pre-trial detention be used as a measure of last resort.<\/p> <p>  Given all the foregoing, it is really regrettable that the general scheme of the Bail Bill does not include any statutory provision whatsoever for bail supports.  Bail supports and services include supervised bail.  I refer to mechanisms by which supports are made available for those placed on bail to ensure they turn up for appointments and for court and so some preliminary work can be done on any issues raised that relate to offending or alleged offending.  An example would be working with factors such as addiction, which in some cases can be a contributing and significant factor when it relates to offending.<\/p> <p>  We have laid out in some detail the research from other jurisdictions, such as England, Wales, Australia and Canada.  We have seen from it that the use of the supervised bail and other schemes has a number of outcomes.  It creates positive changes in behaviour over time, including a desire to avoid trouble or jail, learn to deal with conflict and refrain from drinking or taking drugs.  It results in court attendance of 80% to 90%.  That means increased court efficiency.  We know how overstretched our courts are at present.  Punctual attendance is crucial and everybody has an interest therein.  The schemes ensure this while managing risks in the community.  Obviously, the schemes reduce the number of remands to custody.  We should not leave out the fact that there are significant cost savings.  In Scotland, for example, which is a very comparable jurisdiction in regard to criminal justice, research shows that offsetting the cost of supervised bail against the reduction in prison costs from reduced use of remand over a three-year period resulted in a net benefit of between &pound;2 million and &pound;13 million.<\/p> <p>  We recommend that the Bill include an evidence-based approach to provision of bail services and supports, obviously aimed at the prevention of offending on bail, ensuring appearance at court and reducing the number of remands to custody to the essential minimum.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the draft heads, we endorse the recommendation in both the ICCL's submission and our own on ensuring the period of remand remains at eight days and is not extended to 15.  We encourage the introduction &ndash; in head 10, we suggest &ndash; of the no-real-prospect test.  This is a test that was proposed by the Prison Reform Trust in the United Kingdom.  Essentially, it means the addition of words such as, &ldquo;or where there is no real prospect that the person who is making an application for bail will, even if convicted, be given a custodial sentence&rdquo;.  In those circumstances, it makes no sense, economic or social, to remand the person to custody.<\/p><p>We very much welcome the requirement to give reasons for bail decisions.  Victims, criminal justice analysts and anybody working in the criminal justice system would welcome more accountability and transparency around all judicial decision-making.<\/p><p> It is really important to address the electronic monitoring issue in some detail.  This relates to heads 18 and 19.  There is legislative provision for electronic monitoring but it does not happen in practice and we very rarely see it being used.  Where it is a genuine and well-resourced alternative to remanding somebody to prison while awaiting trial, particularly given the length of time we are talking about currently where trials are being listed in 2017 and there is an extremely long period of pre-trial detention, and where we have examined how it might work in the Irish system, it would be welcome.  We know from research in the UK and the recently published recommendations of the Council of Europe that we cannot lump in electronic monitoring without considering a number of issues about the way it will work and how it will affect individuals.  Proportionate and necessary use of electronic monitoring would be welcome but must be considered extensively.<\/p><p> Head 40 provides for mandatory consecutive sentences for certain specified bail offences.  I think I can say there is consensus in this regard.  The Law Reform Commission, the strategic review group on penal policy and my organisation have all come to the view that the impact of presumptive minimum mandatory sentences, prisoner numbers and questions as to the extent that those sentences have contributed to reducing crime are a concern.  The strategic review group recommended that no further mandatory sentences or presumptive minimum sentences should be introduced.  Going ahead with the bail Bill without looking at bail supports and services is akin to trying to solve a perceived illness without looking at the cheapest and most effective medicine.  It simply does not make sense.  I urge the committee to consider in more detail the research available and to examine the possibility of including a provision on that very socially and economically effective issue in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Malone","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to draw attention to certain troubling aspects of the general scheme of the bail Bill 2015, which on the whole is to be welcomed for consolidating and restating existing law on bail matters.  I will focus on notable omissions in part 1 of the proposed Bill and a number of legislative innovations of dubious value and necessity which may drive up the prison population if enthusiastically embraced by the Judiciary.<br\/><br\/>I will start by making a point about the language surrounding the discussion of bail.  The language accompanying the unveiling of the Bill to new Garda graduates at Templemore in July 2015 was reminiscent of that used in advance of the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, the bail amendment.  It was quite out of step with the recent progressive penal reform agenda pursued by this Government.  One presumes this so-called crime control language was calculated to appeal to the law and order cohort of Fine Gael voters in the run-up to the election.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, stated that the Bill &quot;will strengthen the law to protect the public against crimes committed by offenders out on bail&rdquo;, while the Taoiseach added that, &quot;This is the first comprehensive review of bail law since 1997 and demonstrates this Government's ongoing commitment to crack down on crime.&quot;<br\/><br\/>The main goal of the proposed legislation is to restate and consolidate existing Irish law in accordance with the Constitution and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, while giving judges &quot;better guidance&quot; as to how they might &quot;protect the public&quot; in certain key areas.  It is unfortunate that the Minister did not see fit to give the courts &quot;better guidance&quot; as to how they might also protect the rights of accused persons.  There is currently no explicit presumption in favour of granting pre-trial bail to an adult in Ireland, nor is the presumption of innocence explicit in the Constitution or any statute.  The European Court of Human Rights has stated that to justify the pre-trial detention of an accused person who is presumed innocent, there must be &quot;a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty&quot;.  That was in Kalashnikov<i>v<\/i>.<i><\/i>Russia.  The court also held that states should consider less intrusive measures than detention and must prove that a less intrusive alternative to detention would not meet the objection or objections to release pending trial.  Under the European Convention on Human Rights, therefore, an accused should only be detained if one of the grounds in Article 5(1) applies and a condition of bail cannot mitigate the risk in question.<br\/><br\/>In terms of reflecting the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, the proposed Bill should contain a clear statutory articulation in part 1, recognising the presumption of innocence and the presumption in favour of release on bail.  This would serve as an important reminder to judges and the prosecution when objecting to bail that people accused of criminal offences are innocent until proven guilty and should generally be released before trial, unless the evidence demonstrates that their remand in custody is necessary, proportionate and grounded in law.  This means it should not be based on unlawful presumptions or vague, unsubstantiated statements by the prosecuting garda.<br\/><br\/>A general provision should be inserted into the Bill to the effect that<b><\/b>&quot;in every bail application, the court must consider whether a condition or conditions could be attached to bail which would be sufficient to meet the objection or objections raised under head 26 or 27 of this Bill&quot;.  An additional provision should explicitly require that judges only impose such conditions as are strictly necessary and proportionate to meet the identified risk or risks to ensure an individualised approach is taken regarding the setting of conditions.<br\/><br\/>I will make a point on addiction to alcohol with respect to codifying section 2 of the Bail Act 1997.  While addiction to controlled substances and alcohol certainly is a major factor in the offending behaviour of many people who come before the criminal courts, permitting judges to remand people with addiction issues in custody to prevent further offending on bail does little to address the complex underlying issues.  In this regard, the justice committee&rsquo;s recent consideration of Ireland's failed war on drugs is timely.  Important lessons can be learned from the recent successes of the Portuguese decriminalisation strategy which has increased its focus on addiction as a public health issue rather than a social ill to be addressed primarily by recourse to the criminal courts.  In the context of a revised bail scheme and any new approach to drugs policy, holistic supports should be funded, including Probation Service supervised hostels providing access to mental health and addiction treatment and other necessary interventions in order that people can address underlying problems.<br\/><br\/>As noted by the Strategic Review of Penal Policy, Irish penal policy has suffered from a failure to plan adequately for the future and to understand the consequences of changes in policy.  The result has been an explosion in our prison population since the mid-1980s, with no evidence or suggestion that society has become correspondingly safer.  It is highly likely that proposed stringent bail measures, such as those relating to domestic burglary and the so-called guidance given to judges regarding head 27 and how they may protect the public more generally have been conceived without adequate or any assessment having been undertaken to examine their potential impact on the already overburdened prison system or of the pressure that additional remands in custody will place on the investigating garda&iacute; as well as the Director of Public Prosecutions to get the case ready for trial.  As my colleague from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties stated, the legal right to a speedy trial is all the more important and pressing when the accused is in custody.  Anyone who has any experience of the criminal justice system will attest that trials are anything but speedy at present, especially in the Circuit Court, where it can take upwards of a year and a half due to busy court lists and other inefficiencies.  The situation will only worsen if substantially more people are remanded in pre-trial detention.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Perhaps the key question for the Minister, her officials and all Members of the Oireachtas at this juncture is to consider whether it is prudent, responsible and conducive to a safer society to remand more people in pre-trial custody, primarily to incapacitate them, if it would necessitate the emergency temporary release of convicted offenders to free up beds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Jane Mulcahy"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their excellent and concise submissions.  I agree entirely with the tone, as they have all taken a very similar approach.  I share their welcome for this codifying Bill because we will see provisions relating to bail condensed in one place, which is very welcome.<\/p><p>However, I would also agree with Ms Duffy's points about the need to ensure adequate protection of the rights of due process for accused persons.  This committee has contributed to the progressive agenda on penal reform, notably with our report on penal reform some years ago.  We recommended that imprisonment be a sanction of last resort.  We also recommended various ways of enhancing these community sanctions.<\/p><p> Some of the witnesses spoke about the right to bail.  I welcome provisions 1 and 2 in head 10 where there is a clear presumption in favour of granting bail.  It states that \"An applicant for bail shall be granted bail except where ... the court does not consider\" and so on.  Is there a way any of the witnesses would suggest to strengthen that language?  I am conscious that we already have implicit, albeit not explicit, protection in the Constitution for the presumption of innocence.  We have clear protections for the right to liberty, so is there a need to say more?  Is that enough in head 10(2).<\/p><p> I have two specific questions for the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, relating to some things that were said in the submissions.  The IPRT made a strong case for bail supports and services, including some instructive figures on positive outcomes from elsewhere.  Will Ms Malone elaborate a little more on the actual content of the sort of schemes she has talked about elsewhere, including the idea of supervised bail?  The closest we have to that is curfews and the obligation to sign on daily at a Garda station.  In a sense, if we have a tightly constructed set of conditions imposed on bail, it comes close to a sort of supervision, but what exactly does Ms Malone mean by \"supervised bail\"?  Does she think that electronic monitoring can be part of that?  In Denmark, we saw electronic monitoring used in a relatively progressive manner.<\/p><p> My other question is specifically for the ICCL.  It is about the provision in head 28 that the complainant would give evidence.  I agree with Ms Duffy that we need to look at that.  Clearly there is a victim's rights element here too.  Does Ms Duffy have any ideas on reform?  Rather than ruling it out altogether, would there be merit in including provisions that are tighter, like the sort of victim impact statement we have after conviction, in order that there is a format for this evidence to be given?  Head 29 refers to Garda evidence and currently garda&iacute; give evidence about the impact on complainants.  Should we build that into the legislation?<\/p><p> I note that in the post-conviction stage, and part 6 that deals with bail applications on appeal, there is provision for complainants to give evidence.  I do not think anyone can object to the complainant giving evidence in the bail hearing after conviction.  That seems to be entirely right.<\/p><p> Head 36 is about the power of the District Court to grant bail where a sentence is being appealed.  That could have a significant impact in practice because many sentences of imprisonment are appealed from the District Court and bail is fairly routinely provided for in those cases.  We could see quite an increase of people being detained in custody who are not being currently.  That is one practical impact that this legislation could have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#Q00300","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I will deal with the question about bail supports and services.  I have brought along a document on social research.  It is a Scottish Government document about the use of supervised bail in Scotland which sets out that scheme in some detail.  I am happy to leave that with the committee.<\/p> <p>  In short, concerning that scheme, the substantive difference is that it does not ask those on remand who perhaps had a chaotic lifestyle or an addiction simply to turn up at an office, sign something and go off again.  It was a set of meetings with a tone similar to a meeting with a probation officer.  If they were admitting the offence, and it may not be the case, they spoke about any issues within their lives that they felt had contributed to offending behaviour in this instance or that could contribute to further offending behaviour.  They could be things like employment, bereavement, counselling, addiction or mental health.  The idea was that it was a wrap-around service which dealt with people in their given situation at the time and ensured their time on remand was used in the best way possible to make certain they turned up for court.  At the end of the day the justice system wants people to turn up for court in order that justice can be served, whether that results in an acquittal or a conviction.<\/p> <p>  The crucial thing was that they were looking not just at the symptoms and warehousing people until their cases came to court but also looking at what could be done in the interim, while respecting the presumption of innocence, to work with those people in their given situations to make the court system more effective.  Ultimately, it would save money for the taxpayer because that is what all those things added up to.  It is an attractive package because not only is it socially effective in dealing with the issue but also it addresses public concerns about people turning up and not offending when on bail.  This is one example of many and I am happy to share the rest of the research with the committee.  That was the qualitative difference between simply turning up to a police station and having an active engagement with something that was quite positive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#R00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Malone"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Bacik for her questions.

First, we know there have been issues before the court around garda&iacute; giving opinion evidence.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and other bodes have raised problems around that procedure.  It is important to note that a judge's role is to infer from facts.  In the ideal world, therefore, all that would be put before a judge would be facts, by which the judge would then come to a decision on whether bail would be granted.

For the benefit of the public listening, will the witnesses outline how they see that balance and their advice to legislators?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#S00500","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>Who wants to take that question?

They look at three things -  if there is a belief or a fear that the person will interfere with the witness, if there is a belief or a fear that the person will interfere with the course of justice, and if there is a risk of serious offending if the person is released on bail.  That is the starting point.  Judges are faced with that decision on a daily basis and have to weigh up all the information before them and make what is a very difficult decision.  There is no doubt and I do not think we would ever suggest that there is no place at all for pre-trial detention.  Clearly, it is a very important tool available to the criminal justice system in order to ensure that those who have been charged with a crime appear before the court, give evidence, are tried and, ultimately, there is an outcome.  The public has an interest in that regard.  What we have to remember is that within that two very important things happen.  First, there is identification of a risk, although it will not exist in every case, and if there is a risk how it can be addressed most effectively and, second, if there is a way in which we can ensure that the person returns to court, does not reoffend and engages with whatever he or she is supposed to engage with but is kept out of the prison environment.  The issue is if there is a way of doing that and, if so, we have a duty to consider it.  That means also protecting the public because remanding large numbers of people to prison does not make the problem go away.  What it does is fill our prisons with remand prisoners who are the most transient prisoners.  I checked the numbers today and six of our 14 prisons are overcrowded.<\/p> <p>  If the use of remand is increased without considering the impact that will have within our prisons, because what happens in our prisons affects what happens in our communities, we have to look at it in a joined-up way.  We would never advocate abolition of pre-trial detention but we do advocate asking ourselves if it is necessary, if it is proportionate, if there a risk and, if so, if it can be mitigated.  If not, it may be that pre-trial detention is the answer.  It is a difficult task that judges face every day.  Simplistic solutions such as making it mandatory to remand in certain circumstances are not the way.  We have gone beyond that kind of simplistic debate and I hope there is a more nuanced debate which looks at all the solutions to this problem, including bail supports services and supervised bail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#S00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Malone"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Ms Duffy wants to contribute on that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#S00800","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":147,"content":"<p>We asked victims of crime what they want to see in the system.

In fact, there is not really a balance because every single participant within the criminal justice system should have respect for their particular rights.  As Ms Deirdre Malone from the Irish Penal Rights Trust has mentioned, we would not advocate that there is no such thing as pre-trial detention in Ireland.  Of course, people need to be held on remand.  One of the main reasons they need to be held on remand is to protect witnesses and victims from further harm.  As already pointed out, the way in which that is handled has to be set out in a framework that is in accordance with human rights principles.  Again, I refer to articles 5 and 6 of the ECHR which set out the proportions and the public interest arguments that should surround a bail system.  That is what we would advocate.

In his book <i>The Culture of Control<\/i>David Garland states that in recent years distinctive policies have been developed that aim to reduce fear levels rather than to reduce crime.  I suggest that the burglary Bill is symptomatic of such a policy.  It has been born out of the perception and the reality that burglary is a very intrusive crime that causes damage in individual's lives.  In looking at the law, we have to see whether it will have the desired impact.  Will it mean that people in rural Ireland will sleep safer in their beds at night if we introduce such a law?  It is setting the definition of a prolific burglar at a very low level.  A person who has one conviction and two pending charges is setting the bar truly at a very low level.  If judges decide to adhere to this standard, it will, undoubtedly, have quite negative effects on our prison population.  It will mean that more people will be remanded in custody and this will have a knock-on effect of undoing much of the good work that has been done recently by the Irish Prison Service to stem the use of temporary release as an emergency measure, a safety valve.  If all manner of domestic burglars are being remanded in custody who otherwise, in previous times, would have been granted bail, there will be an impact.  I question whether the impact assessment has been carried out but, if not, it should be, because there is a need to be able to demonstrate that society will, in fact, be safer; if it is not, it is just talk.  It might appeal to voters at election time but really this is a serious issue that will have long-term consequences.<br\/><br\/>I reiterate the points about trying to deal with some of these problems at the front end by having some bail supports and ensuring that people turn up to trial.  Some people have such chaotic lives that they do not remember that they are meant to turn up when their case is listed for mention.  Wrap around supports can be of assistance.  If they have nowhere to live, remembering to turn up to court is the least of their worries so anything that can be done to improve compliance with conditions should be done.<\/p><p>I also suggest that there is a tendency to have an over-use of too many conditions.

There are considerable sections within rural communities, and urban communities, which hold the view that if a person has one conviction and two charges pending then that is a significant threshold within which to suspect that person is a threat to the public and for him or her to be detained.  I wonder if the role of electronic tagging could strike a balance between the analysis of the witnesses and that of the community leaders on recidivist offenders.  I agree that a rational, evidence-based approach is needed when looking at penal reform but the public also needs reassurance that the State is serious in its efforts to tackle criminals.  Confidence in the criminal justice system is undermined when statistics can show the number of times people commit offences while on bail.  Reference was made to a number of other options, particularly from the Irish Penal Reform Trust.  Could the witnesses clarify what options are available other than incarceration without conviction?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#T00300","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I believe it is crucial for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to have sufficient staff numbers within the community, time and resources to monitor the bail conditions which are imposed currently.  This is not happening at the moment because the Garda does not have any of those supports.  I spoke with a local community in Athy about this.  The first concern of the community was not about the bail laws but the fact that the local Garda station had been decimated and garda&iacute; could no longer be seen on the beat.  The community was also aware, and we know this from our own research, that where conditions are imposed that they may not be monitored.  It is important that the Garda has the resources with which to monitor bail conditions, but those resources were slashed in the past.  That situation seems to be turning around now, which is positive.  Electronic tagging can be useful in appropriate cases.  For example, if the purpose of an electronic tag is to provide an alternative to remanding a person or to ensure the person resides in a particular place or does not enter a particular place or is under curfew at certain time, these are less intrusive measures than losing one's liberty pending trial.  While they are nonetheless an interference with a person's liberty, they may be necessary and proportionate in certain cases.  This is why, when we saw the inclusion of electronic tagging, we stated in our submission that we always welcome alternatives to imprisonment as long as they are considered deeply, and that tagging may be an effective alternative to imprisonment.  However, international research shows that the contributory causes of crime in a substantial number of cases such as shoplifting and burglary can often be symptomatic of a need or desire to feed an addiction, and this is reflected in the problems we see in our prison population.  This cannot be ignored.  There is almost a consensus among speakers at this committee on the need to decriminalise drug use and the need to look at addiction as a health issue rather than a criminal justice issue.  This should never be considered as an excuse to allow people to enter other people's homes, but we have to deal with the cause of these events and not simply warehouse the symptoms of the events.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#T00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Malone"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I wish to comment with regard to burglary.  In one of the recent press releases from the Minister, she said that 75% of all burglaries were committed by 25% of offenders.  Tied on to this information was the argument about the roaming gangs and the highly organised criminal gangs.  If better statistics were available in the State we might be able to unpack this data a little bit to see that in fact most burglaries are probably committed by people who have serious addictions, but I do not know what the precise percentage is.  A more complete look at the underlying causes of crime is needed.  One can remove people from circulation and incapacitate them, but it is deeply worrying to do this before trial when they are legally innocent.  I cannot stress this enough.  These people have not been convicted.  It is one thing to talk about incapacitation if the people have already been convicted, but it is another thing if they have not been convicted.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to the issue of bringing people to trial sooner.  We see that the Garda will receive an extra &euro;5 million to allow them to respond better to crime in rural areas, but will more money be made available to the courts to enable the court lists to speed up? These are all related issues.  If a young person, for example, is on eight or ten conditions for over a year, the chance of non-compliance increases because that is a restriction of his or her liberty for a very long period.  If a person is held in pre-trial detention, the impact on the person is much greater.  That time cannot be given back.  There is an omission in this Bill on the judicial convention of backdating of sentences.  Where that has a statutory focus, then it should be in the Bill.  Maximum time limits for remand should also be looked at.

In this scrutiny of the general scheme of the Bill we are looking at codification.  There are some things which have changed but there are not huge, substantive changes.  I am not referring to the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill 2015.  This is only attaching a sticking plaster to the system of bail.  We actually need to look at other issues.  A  judge can refuse bail to serious offenders; the seriousness of the offence is one of the conditions.  We need an evidence base of statistics, as already referenced by the Chairman - maybe my colleagues have those statistics - with regard to why people are being granted bail and why they are being refused bail.  One of the positives about this Bill is that in most instances there will have to be written decisions on the adjudication of bail.<\/p><p>I do not know if I am making the point absolutely clear.  The Bill is about codifying existing provisions, and what I am trying to say is that this will not solve the big problems because it does not deal with the root causes.

We know things are not working because our remand centres are full, our prisons are overcrowded and, as previous speakers noted, we still have members of the community who do not feel safe. <\/p><p> To repeat what my colleagues said, we need to take a holistic, in-the-round view and connect this type of bail application to the investigation that preceded it, namely, what the Garda is doing and how the courts system is operating.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015110400002#T01700","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":162,"content":"<p>On the issue of dangerousness, what should be happening in a bail application is that the prosecuting or investigating garda gives evidence from the PULSE system of any previous convictions or charges against the individual in question and a judge determines, on the basis of the evidence provided and possibly some engagement with the accused, whether there is a threat in cases in which the issue is one of dangerousness.  If the person has a history of violent offending, that will be at the forefront of the judge's mind in making a decision, particularly in a section 2 bail objection, which relates to the likelihood of further offending.  If there is a risk based on prior conduct of serious violent offending, the judges will very much take that into account.  On the other hand, under the current law, the seriousness of an offence in and of itself is not a ground for refusing bail.  For this reason, one will see people who are charged with murder being granted bail because it cannot be established on the evidence that there is a likelihood that the person will commit a similar type of act again.  If the person has a very clean record, the risk may be low or may be met by setting conditions such as requiring a surety or the surrender of a passport.  Whatever the risk that is identified, it must be grounded in evidence.<\/p> <p>  The job of the garda in any bail application is to bring to the court the relevant evidence.  A court cannot possibly predict all types of behaviour.  Many people will not have committed violent acts and one cannot hold everyone in pre-trial detention on the basis that he or she may, at some point down the road, do something that is out of character.

In such circumstances, people ask me what is going on in the justice system.  My point, therefore, is the inconsistency in some of the decisions on bail.  I understand that judges must make difficult decisions and people are human and will get things wrong.  For example, someone who is perceived as not being violent may suddenly become violent.  Those are facts of life.  However, inconsistency is a regular feature of decisions on bail.

Simply having a requirement to give a reason for a decision is an improving factor for everyone, regardless of the type of decision.  It can only be of assistance to require reasons to be committed to paper in a clear and open manner.  It should not be done solely at the request of the defence or prosecution.  Victims, prosecutors, lawyers and everybody else will have an interest in understanding the reasons a decision was made in any given case.<\/p> <p>  The other point I would make regarding decision making in courts is that questions about consistency will always arise and the answer is to have transparency.

It is interesting for observers such as myself to read about inconsistencies in the application of bail laws and in sentencing.  I do not necessarily mean that I read about these cases in the tabloid newspapers.<\/p> <p>  It is incumbent on us to ensure the Bill is given a thorough hearing.  Bail laws must strike a delicate balance between the rights of the citizenry and the civil rights of individuals who have committed crimes in terms of whether they are incarcerated or have to make good for their crime in some other form.  In many cases, I do not have any difficulty with electronic tagging.  This procedure should be funded to a much greater extent than at present, not only to free up space in the prisons.  In that regard, I thank Ms Malone for pointing out that six of the 14 prisons in the State were overcrowded either last week or this week.  Such statistics are not often placed in the public domain.<\/p> <p>  I represent north Dublin, and we all know that several years ago the State paid the Thornton Hall landowner &euro;30 million for a farm worth &euro;300,000.  The State, via the Prison Service, has invested a substantial amount in that project, with no results.  Significant investment is required in the prisons, including at least one prison in Dublin, to bring them up to a reasonable standard.  This is clear from the level of overcrowding in the prisons.  While tagging and better application of the bail laws will remove people from prisons and more garda&iacute; will deter people from committing crimes and, I hope, reduce the overall number of individuals incarcerated in the prison system, at the same time, it is clear that we need at least one and possibly even two new prisons.  I will leave it to the experts to make a determination on that issue.  <\/p> <p>  Society has moved away from the \"eye for an eye\" view of crime, whereby a person who commits a crime should be locked up and the key possibly thrown away, depending on the severity of the crime.<\/p><p>We need to employ more innovative approaches and international best practice in terms of rehabilitating individuals within our prison service.  That means treating them with dignity, giving them an outlet and ensuring, for example, that prisons are completely free from drugs.  Let us suppose a person is addicted to drugs when going into the care of the Prison Service.  We have read of cases over the years - I imagine the deputations have come across them too - of individuals who go into prison clean but come out addicted to drugs.  In a societal sense, that is horrific.  The State is effectively sponsoring that by locking them behind a wall and allowing such things to occur.  I am firm in my view that we should have a zero-drugs policy in prisons.  People should go in and come out clean.  I do not care what the cost is in terms of the human cost or the addictive step-down that occurs.  That is the nature of the incarceration as far as I am concerned.<\/p><p> I wanted to touch on some other things with regard to comments made by the deputation.  I was rather confused by something Ms Malone mentioned.  She referred to the lack of garda&iacute; or the reduction in the number of garda&iacute; in the context of a bail discussion.  Why was that mentioned?  Ms Malone can reply in a moment.  I wish to ask some more questions and then the Chairman can wrap up.<\/p><p> Ms Mulcahy made a statement to the effect that there is not much empirical data on figures that are in the public domain relating to those who are committing burglaries.  The Minister has made statements with regard to certain percentages on the matter.  Anyway, Ms Mulcahy used the word \"fact\" and continued to the effect that most burglaries are carried out by those who suffer from addiction but yet she did not know.  I do not believe it is possible to make a statement like that and use the word \"fact\" in the context of an Oireachtas hearing.  It is essential, as Deputy Finian McGrath adequately outlined and as far as I am concerned, that the inconsistencies in the application of bail laws are addressed.  Ms Malone - or perhaps Ms Duffy - was right to say that we do not read about the reduction in certain crime categories and that we only read about the salacious material that sells newspapers - let us be honest about it - or, in certain instances, the horrific crimes, such as the murder of an on-duty garda and such things.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, my view is that availability of training to members of the Judiciary is required in terms of the implementation of bail laws.

These are relevant in two respects.  First, the presence of garda&iacute; in the local community has been shown to have a preventative effect on crime.  People feel safer and there is more of a sense the garda&iacute; are present, aware and know what is going on in a given community.  Community policing has always been a crucial part of any criminal justice system.  The idea of the officer on the beat who everyone knows is important in an everyday sense.<\/p> <p>  It is also important in respect of monitoring bail conditions.  My colleague will correct me if I am wrong, but, as I understand it, if a garda requests certain conditions, such as, for example, signing on in a police station, then that garda or her station is then tasked with monitoring the fact that a given person continues to sign on.  That was the point I was making in respect of garda&iacute;.<\/p> <p>  There was a comment about an extra prison.  Thornton Hall was debated at length over number of months.  Many research reports were produced and considerable debate on the question took place.  The conclusion was that penal expansion does not assist communities in reducing crime.  If that were the case, then crime rates in the United States, where there is mass incarceration, would be exemplary.  We know that is not the case.

Then they asked the public what sentences the public believed would be appropriate in given cases in the light of the public knowing all the facts of the cases.

It was harsh of me given that I am urging politicians to be careful about their language.  I suppose what I meant is that I highly recommend that people spend some time at High Court bail list hearings to get a perspective on burglary.  People would then see that on any given day most of the people being accused of burglary have addiction issues.  One might come across an armed gang member from a highly mobile group.  However, such examples capture media attention and hence political attention.  That was really what I was trying to draw attention to.  Unfortunately, because of the way we record statistics in this country, it is very difficult to get to the root of it and the accurate statistics.  That is something for another day.  Certainly, it would be better if we had more accurate statistics in this regard.  For example, if we knew what percentage of accused people go on to receive a custodial sentence, it would be helpful.  It would also be useful to know what percentage of people remanded in custody do not get convicted at all.  They may have spent six, seven or eight months in pre-trial detention, with no compensation offered to them.  That is six or seven months that they cannot get back.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to inconsistencies in bail decisions.  Obviously, it is of great concern to all of us when judges seem to get it wrong and release someone on bail.  However, I reiterate that they are dependent on the information that is presented to them from the PULSE system and the Garda.  The can predict all manner of human behaviour.  When allegations of violent behaviour are put before them, there is not a judge in the country who will not take that seriously.  They are quite risk averse and they know the way the media headlines will go if they get it wrong.  On the other hand, there is considerable inconsistency at the lower end of the scale.  We have seen women remanded in custody for failing to appear.  They may have chaotic lives or they may have gone to see a child in care but a judge might throw the book at them and remand them in custody for a week.  Is that an appropriate use of remand?

I am joined, as the Chairman mentioned, by Ms Rosemary Steen, our director of external affairs; Mr. John Fitzgerald, director of grid development; and Mr. Mark Norton, network planning manager.  In April, we presented to the committee specifically on the North-South interconnector, and we are pleased to be back today to update members on the Grid Link project.<\/p> <p>  In March we launched our draft strategy for Ireland's grid development and carried out a ten-week consultation process.  The strategy looked at the changing technical and economic context for Ireland's electricity transmission system.  It examined the energy challenges facing Ireland and identified the steps we need to take to develop a strong, secure transmission system for homes, farms and businesses across Ireland, so that the electricity grid is capable of providing for the energy needs of the country now and into the future.  A key objective of the draft strategy was to ensure it aligned with, and supported, the broader economic policy landscape, including the Government's Action Plan for Jobs and IDA Ireland's regional development strategy.  The draft strategy reflects the change in economic circumstances and where we as a country, an economy and a society are now.  When first developed in 2008, Grid 25, as it was then named, which included plans for the Grid Link project, was designed to ensure the electricity grid would continue to support the Celtic tiger economy with its high economic and energy growth rates.  The past five years have changed that reality.  There has been demand reduction to the point where estimated demand levels for 2010 will not materialise until 2025 - a 15-year delay - and, even then, growth rates will be less than a third of the rates previously forecast.<\/p> <p>  In reviewing the way in which EirGrid develops the electricity grid on behalf of electricity customers, we committed to a number of core strategic pillars upon which our work would be based.  First was a commitment to open engagement and inclusive consultation with local communities and stakeholders in our approach to network development; second, an undertaking that practical technology options will be considered for network development; and, third, a focus on optimising the existing network to minimise the need for new infrastructure.  It is in this context that the draft strategy we brought forward included the new innovative regional option to deliver the Grid Link project.  Previous strategies had looked at delivering the project via either a 400 kV overhead solution or a fully underground option delivered using high-voltage direct current, HVDC, technology.<\/p> <p>  In reviewing our grid strategy, we set about marrying existing and developing technology via an advanced technology called series compensation.  This option would use the existing network and avoid the need for significant new overhead infrastructure.  Following the publication of our draft strategy in March, and at my previous appearance before this committee in April, a number of Members, here and across the Oireachtas, expressed support for the adoption of series compensation to deliver the Grid Link project.  In addition, the feedback from communities as part of our consultation on the draft grid development strategy was very favourable to the regional option.  It is important to stress that series compensation is only possible for the Grid Link project due to the extensive transmission network in the Munster and Leinster region, more specifically the lines that run from Moneypoint in the west to Leinster and the wider eastern seaboard.  Such a network is not available to us in the development of other major projects such as the North-South interconnector.<\/p> <p>  If we proceed with series compensation, EirGrid will be among the first transmission system operators, TSOs, in Europe to deploy it on the grid.  It is a technology that enables more power to be transported on a transmission line, provided the underlying transmission network is strong enough to support it.  We have carried out extensive analysis of the network in the area and determined that it is appropriate in this case.  Coupling the deployment of this technology with a new cable across the Shannon and a series of line upratings across the south east will enable us to deliver a good solution for the area, which will negate the necessity for significant new overhead or underground infrastructure for the Grid Link project.  As a technology, series compensation has been used over very long distances in some parts of the world, such as Brazil and California, but recent advances mean it is now suitable for use on smaller transmission systems like ours.<\/p> <p>  Questions have been posed as to why this technology was not put forward by EirGrid previously.  Series compensation is not a new technology.  However, it would not have addressed the need the Grid Link project was originally designed to address for any reasonable period of time.  The key point here is that changing demand forecasts and a slower rate of growth than originally forecast, combined with advances in technology, mean the series compensation option now represents a viable solution to meet projected needs for the foreseeable future.  In addition, series compensation has the benefit of offering significantly reduced costs to electricity consumers from the delivery of Grid Link.  To deliver the project via overhead lines or through the underground option would have cost hundreds of millions, as has been previously set out.  The series compensation option we have now committed to pursue will ensure the project is delivered in the most cost-effective manner available to us.  We will ensure electricity costs to both businesses and homes are kept to a minimum by adopting this option.<\/p> <p>  The more detailed technical workings of series compensation were set out in the report presented to the independent expert panel in September and published last month on our website.  Furthermore, this solution was peer reviewed by London Power Associates in the report published in March.  However, my colleagues and I will be happy to provide detailed information to members today, or we can meet them at a later date to provide further detailed briefings as required.  We welcome any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":201,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Slye.

How will EirGrid dispel the fears that there will be further attempts to install pylons in these communities?  There needs to be clarity that the Grid West and Grid South projects are dead, so to speak.  Does EirGrid have trust in the figure on which it is basing its projections?  How much has this aborted project cost EirGrid and what was spent on advice and fees up to this point?

First, the Deputy asked how sure EirGrid was of the data underpinning the figures for the adoption of the regional grid option.  We have done extensive analysis on this.  In addition to our own analysis, we commissioned Indecon to do a review of our analysis and to look at the economy sector by sector and region by region to see whether the plans we were putting forward would meet the needs of the regions for the foreseeable future.  The Deputy asked what foreseeable future means.  The horizon of the foreseeable future is out to 2025 to 2030.  We published the review by Indecon in March and it is available on our website.  We can discuss, if the Deputy so wishes, the data and figures in the report that looked at the south east and the adequacy of the regional solution to meet the needs of the network for that period.  Given where the economy is and where we see the growth in the economy, which is great to see, the make-up of the economy is very different now from what it was before the crash.  Before the crash, construction made up a significant proportion of the GDP growth in the economy.  I think we are all acutely aware that before the crash it accounted for more than 20% but now it is below 10%.  What is driving economic growth today is very different.  That in part is a reason the relationship between GDP growth and energy growth has changed.  One no longer gets the close correlation we had in the years between 2000 and 2007 between GDP growth and energy growth.  The make-up of the economy is different and cost competitiveness has become a significant focus for industry.  Energy has become one of the areas where businesses have become acutely conscious of the need to manage their costs to ensure competitiveness.  We only have to look at yesterday's announcement of the unfortunate closure of the Michelin plant in Ballymena to understand the impact of cost competitiveness on the sustainability of businesses.  Businesses are much more conscious of managing energy costs.<\/p> <p>  We are seeing the new standards in housing coming through in the new housing stock, so the use of energy per unit of residential housing is not as good.  For all those reasons growth rates in energy are now not as correlated with growth rates in GDP.  We want to ensure any option we put forward is robust and the plans we put forward will meet the needs of society and the economy.  At the end of the day, the transmission system is there to serve society and the economy and to ensure reasonable demands for electricity are met and the economy can grow.  We underpinned our analysis with an analysis by Indecon which went through that in great detail and we published that as part of the draft grid development strategy in order that we would get feedback from anyone who believed we might have missed in any way anything in terms of economic growth.  There was no feedback on any of it.  In fact there were supportive statements from various relevant agencies around it.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's second question was on the money spent to date.  In developing the Grid Link project to the stage where it is now, with the three options developed and we are about to move forward with one option, the total expenditure to date on the project has been of the order of &euro;12 million.  This includes the development of the three options and the comparison of the three options to enable the regional option to be selected as the way to move forward.<\/p> <p>  I apologise to the Deputy if I took up his next question in the wrong way but what I have written down is whether we understood the real concerns that were raised in the submissions on the Grid Link project.  There were of the order of 38,000 submissions made on the Grid Link project during the consultation period that ran from the end of 2013 into early 2014.  We recognised the very real concerns in the communities.  That was the very reason that in January we announced a series of five initiatives designed to address those concerns.  That consultation closed in mid-January and before the end of the month we had announced a series of five specific initiatives based on a very high-level review of the themes we had seen coming through in that consultation and other consultation.  We took an immediate step to try to address those because we recognised the concerns.<\/p><p>Those initiatives included a commitment to undertake a detailed study of the undergrounding option in the cases of Grid West and Grid Link, to review our consultation and engagement process, to put in place a community gain scheme for communities, to address in a very explicit way concerns around the tourism, agriculture and equine industries and to work with the review of electromagnetic fields which is to be undertaken by the relevant Department.<\/p><p> Perhaps it is worth mentioning that during 2014, we undertook an extensive review of our consultation and engagement process.  We engaged two external agencies to come in to help us with that.  They went out to meet stakeholders, individuals and groups that had participated in consultation.  They provided us with detailed reports and feedback, all of which we published explicitly on our website.  On foot of that process, in December of last year we set out a series of 12 commitments that we were making as a company in order to improve our consultation and engagement process.  We are continuing to look at how we can improve that.  It is fair to say that we listen to communities and try to respond.  We have looked to improve the manner in which we consult and engage with communities.  We are continuing to seek to do that as we go forward.<\/p><p> The Deputy's fourth question related to why we are not looking to put the North-South interconnector underground.  He correctly referred to the last time we were in here, when we spoke about the North-South interconnector project.  He pointed out that the technology to put it underground is available.  I suppose the first thing to say is that the project in question is now the subject of a statutory planning process with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, to which we have made an application for consent.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has engaged in a process of statutory consultation and it is running through that process.  Maybe that is the first thing to say.  The second thing is that undergrounding comes at a very considerable additional cost.  In 2011, the Government appointed an international expert, who reported to this committee in 2012.  The expert's estimate of the additional cost was that it would represent an increase of a factor of three.  We have done a detailed engineering, environmental, technical and cost assessment of a route-specific option for the North-South interconnector delivered using high-voltage direct current technology.  We have identified a route, costed and assessed the feasibility of that route and determined through that detailed work that the cost of such a route would be in excess of four times the cost of the alternative option.  All of that is published and available and forms part of our planning application, which has been submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I would like to make two points. Given that EirGrid got the planning of the Grid West and Grid Link projects so wrong, without putting a tooth on it, is it feasible at this stage to take another look at the North-South interconnector?  I suggest that it should be reconsidered in light of what has transpired with the Grid West and Grid Link projects.  EirGrid has spent &euro;12 million on the Grid Link project to date.  My assessment from the outset was that a group of engineers within EirGrid looked at this project as a means of getting power from point A to point B, without factoring in the human cost or the human issue in this regard.  State funding of &euro;12 million has been spent on a project that is now being shelved or postponed.  People in the communities out there are wondering whether this project is gone forever.  Mr. Slye has said that EirGrid is looking at figures for the period up to 2025 to 2030, which is a span of ten to 15 years.  Are we looking at this project coming down the line again?  Can Mr. Slye say at this point that EirGrid's current preferred option, with which it is proceeding in the cases of the Grid West and Grid Link projects, will suffice right into the foreseeable future in terms of making sure there is energy right around the country?  Is this being done on the basis of all the scientific evidence that is available to EirGrid and all the best practice reports?  Can we be assured that EirGrid will not come back and put fear into communities again in ten or 15 years' time?  Is the technology advancing so much that EirGrid can do that?  I suggest that it needs to dispel absolutely the doubt that persists out there.  I will conclude by repeating my first supplementary question.  Given that EirGrid got this so wrong, is it time to look at the North-South interconnector as well and make a decision on it that would be more amenable to the communities in Cavan, Monaghan and Meath?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#F00200","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":207,"content":"<p>The Deputy's first point related to the robustness and longevity of the regional option.  As I have said, we have assessed that option against the demand for energy in the region that we can reasonably foresee.  We are progressing with the regional option.  We are not progressing with the 400 kV overhead line option.  That option will not be progressed with.  We need to continually look at the evolution of demand and generation in the economy and in society.  It may well be the case ten or 15 years from now that we need to do something else to reinforce the grid.  We are continually reinforcing the grid.  Maybe it is worth pointing out there are approximately 200 projects in Grid 25.  We tend to talk about three of them, but there are 197 other projects that are under way.  We are continually reinforcing and updating the transmission grid as required to meet the needs of society and the economy.  We will continue to do that.  I do not think it would be responsible of me to sit here and say that there will be no need to further reinforce the transmission network 20 or 30 years from now.  However, I can say that the 400 kV overhead line option for Grid Link is dead.  I can say categorically that we are not proceeding with it.  We are proceeding with the regional option because we believe it meets the needs of the region and the economy for the foreseeable future.  As I have said, I am using that term in the context of 2025 or 2030.  We will continue to look at the demands of the economy and what society needs to ensure the transmission network is fit for purpose.  To the extent that there might be anything additional that might need to be done in the future - I imagine that there would be as the economy and society continue to evolve - we will work with communities to do that in compliance with the new strategic pillars we have set out, which involve trying to maximise the use of the existing infrastructure, working in close co-operation and collaboration with the communities that are out there and minimising the need for new infrastructure.  It will not be the case that we will dust off or resurrect the Grid Link 400 kV option.  That would be inappropriate as time will have passed.  It will not be possible to do that.  I can say in response to the Deputy's request for me to be definitive about it that the Grid Link 400 kV overhead option will not be progressed with.

We specifically looked at that.

The fact that EirGrid has not been progressing with overhead power lines for the Grid Link or Grid West projects is viewed by myself and entire communities with amazement, bemusement and disgust at what seems to be a complete U-turn.  I speak for the people of County Meath who are reasonable, fair, very hard-working and progressive.  Our county has changed dramatically in the last 20 years and we are realistic.  We realise that change and development is necessary.  However, people should be treated with a little respect.  After eight years of public concerns and genuine fears being expressed, EirGrid has completely ignored the north east.<\/p> <p>  One of the first meetings I held when I became a Deputy two and a half years ago was attended by EirGrid and the North East Pylon Pressure, NEPP, group.  Members of that group probably feel that they are in a time machine because EirGrid has simply dusted off its original plan.  Apart from changing the height of the pylons, I would say that not even a comma has been removed from the initial plan that was put forward.  EirGrid launched a document recently entitled Your Grid, Your Views, Your Tomorrow, upgrading Grid 25.  It is a nice, shiny new document but there is nothing new in it in the context of the North-South interconnector, while Grid Link and Grid West are afforded other options, including underground lines.  EirGrid has never afforded the people of Meath, Cavan or Monaghan the same options.  The witnesses are before this committee today to discuss EirGrid's new, innovative plans but they will have to forgive me for not jumping for joy or doing cartwheels when the people of Meath have never been given other options.  I do not know if the witnesses have met many people from Castletown, Carlanstown or Kilmainhamwood.  If they have watched any football games involving the county, they will know that the people of Meath do not roll over.  We have not been treated fairly but we expect to be.  I need to say that because this has gone on for so long and people have not been treated fairly.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions for the witnesses.  They said that Grid 25 was designed to ensure that the electricity grid will continue to support the Celtic tiger economy but that the last five years have changed that reality.  For the past four years, EirGrid has continuously stated that there was an absolute requirement to achieve the Grid Link project, involving the erection of 750 pylons.  Yet, in the space of one year, the company has managed to do a complete U-turn.  A planning application, identical to the one that was lodged five years ago was lodged with An Bord Plean&aacute;la this year for the North-South interconnector.  That does not reflect the opening statement or the changed environment to which the witnesses have referred.  Why is that the case?<\/p> <p>  The witnesses spoke about new, innovative options but many would disagree with the assertion that the strategy for Grid Link is either new or innovative.  Why have new options not been put forward for North-South interconnector?  Why has nothing else been put forward?  Why are there no regional options for the north-east region?  The witnesses cannot tell me that there are no other options; there are definitely other options.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses also spoke about the cost effectiveness of the new project and that it would cost hundreds of millions of euro were the company to go ahead with the underground option.  Surely if hundreds of millions of euro will be saved, which is what the opening statement implies, then that money could be redirected and used for the undergrounding of the North-South interconnector because we now know that this is possible.<\/p> <p>  Finally, the witnesses referred to open engagement and inclusive consultation with local communities on all practical technological options but I would argue that EirGrid has not engaged with the people of north Meath.  It has not been able to provide a detailed costing for undergrounding because its representatives have not been let onto the land.  If the company has not been on the land, how can it carry out the study that would be needed in order to put forward an accurate assessment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#G00100","speaker":"1180"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":216,"content":"<p>First of all, before getting into individual questions I wish to make something clear.  On the Grid West project, we looked at various options to deliver it overhead and underground, in line with the terms of reference set out by the independent expert panel chaired by Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness.  We published the detailed assessment of both overhead and underground options earlier this year.  We have engaged with some people in the local community on questions they raised.  We have not progressed it further as we are awaiting the outcome of planning applications by some of the wind developers in the area that are in train.  Members are probably aware that one of the wind farms that was to be developed by Coillte, the Cluddaun wind farm in north Mayo, was refused planning permission.  The Oweninny development has been granted planning permission but the developers are looking to amend that permission.  We have sought clarity from the developers.  Obviously, we must await the outcome of their planning permission application before we can proceed with the project, in terms of the option that is most appropriate.  In effect, the project is on hold pending clarification from the generation developers.  The developers need to have clarity around the process they are undergoing with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.

The Deputy is correct in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked why we have changed Grid Link now.  Grid 25 was initiated in the context of the 2007-2008 grid development strategy.  We obviously reviewed the project at each stage and published those reviews as part of the various consultations that we carried out.  The drop-off in electricity demand did not happen in 2007 or 2008.  It did not actually happen until 2010-2011.  The demand curve is set out in the grid development strategy to which the Deputy referred, namely the Your Grid, Your Views, Your Tomorrow document.  We have included both the historical and projected demand growth figures in that document and members will see that it was not until a significant period after the economy went through such a shuddering that demand fell.  We continually review the project.<\/p> <p>  I referred earlier to the specific commitment we made to make a side-by-side comparison between the underground and overhead options at the start of 2014.  That, coupled with the review of the overall grid development strategy, allowed us to identify the regional grid option and the use of serious compensation which, with advances in control systems technology, allow it be deployed on smaller transmission system than the thousands of kilometres that it had previously been used on in other parts of the world.  Those advances in technology, coupled with the fact that the demand had declined in real terms and that there was a shift in the make-up of the economy, allowed us to identify that as an option and to progress it and bring it forward.  It would not have worked in the context of the high growth rates of previous years.  <\/p> <p>  In the context of the North-South interconnector, the Deputy asked two questions.  The first was why the regional option will not work for that project.  The regional option involves maximising the utilisation of an underlying mesh transmission network.  It involves pushing more power through a mesh transmission network by deploying the newer technology on some of the transmission lines.  In the context of addressing the need to transfer power between the Munster region and the Leinster region, broadly speaking, there is an extensive mesh transmission network that has been built up there since 1927 which can be utilised.<\/p><p>In the case of a North-South interconnector project, however, two transmission grids were developed separately over time in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  These are currently joined by a single interconnector.  Quite simply, there is no underlying mesh transmission network that can be maximised.  In other words, the network on which we might deploy this technology in order to allow it to work just does not exist.<\/p><p> Deputy McEntee commented on the extent of the examination of the underground option for the North-South project.  I referred earlier to the fact the Government appointed an international expert commission to review the project and that this commission submitted its report in 2012.  We did an extensive analysis on a specific route, a detailed technical, environmental and economic analysis, which we also published.  Further to that, the then Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, requested that the independent expert panel, which he had appointed, chaired by Ms Catherine McGuinness, the retired Supreme Court judge, would look at all of the work that had been done on the North-South project, in terms of the assessment of the various options and provide an opinion as to whether the work was consistent and comparable to the level of detail of an examination of options which was then being requested for Grid West and Grid Link.  In the middle of last year, the expert panel issued a statement indicating that in all material respects the analysis had been done for the North-South project.  A comparable analysis of an overhead and underground option was published on 1 July last year.  We have looked extensively at alternative options for the North-South interconnector project.  We have published them and made them available.  They also form part of the planning application file that has been submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p><p> Deputy McEntee asked whether the money saved by the deployment of a regional option for Grid Link, which is a lower cost solution than either an overhead or an underground option, could be diverted to an underground option for the North-South project.  We examine each project and have to make a decision based on Government policy and the specific needs involved.  To spend hundreds of million of electricity consumers' money on putting the infrastructure underground does not seem to be the appropriate answer.  This is also supported by the regulators, North and South, who have been quite clear in their views on the appropriateness or not of incurring the additional cost associated with an underground project.  Recently, the Northern Ireland regulator was explicit on the urgency of the project, the need to get it through and the fact that the overhead option was the only realistic one.<\/p><p> The Deputy's final question was on consultation and engagement with people on the North-South project.  We have made considerable efforts to try to continually improve how we consult and engage with communities.  We recognise that delivering transmission infrastructure which benefits the entire State and all electricity consumers but impacts more directly upon a smaller group that hosts the infrastructure is a difficult prospect.  We are always considering ways in which we can improve how we consult and engage with affected communities.  We recently appointed agriculture liaison officers, some of whom are in the Gallery, to specifically try to engage with communities located along the route.  We understand that these are very real issues for people who are concerned about the impact of the project.  We are committed to trying to work through the issues and to address them where it is possible to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":220,"content":"<p>Following the initial meeting two and a half years ago, the purpose of which was to move the project forward again, I would have thought there would have been some sort of consultation with people rather than their being informed that there is only one option.  In 2010 and 2011 we were told the lights would go out if the project did not proceed but we now know that is not the case.  There has not been a single change to the proposal for the North-South interconnector.  While we talk about the different changes, it has never been reflected in the North-South interconnector proposal.  We all know there has to be progress.  However, the company has been trying to bring forward the project for eight years and to say that something has been published on the back of a report that is probably 500 pages long and expect people in counties Meath, Cavan and Monaghan to find that and understand what it says is ridiculous.

I reviewed the questions I asked on the previous occasion they appeared and I wish to indicate that I will be asking some of them again today.<\/p> <p>  I like to start from a point of agreement.  I think we would all agree that every business, agency, politician and person on the island of Ireland wants adequate, reasonably costed, secure green energy now and into the future.  After that, we seem to run into difficulties.  It seems to me and many others that but for the massive public opposition to the overground Grid Link project, the rethink would not have happened.  Massive public opposition and serious political concerns meant that a rethink happened and a solution was found, which solved many of the problems that were causing distress to people in the path of Grid Link.  Let me say \"Well done\" to those people.  Were it not for their opposition, an incorrect decision that would have led to an increased cost being incurred by the State and taxpayers would have been made.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of specific questions which I will put to the delegates before I deal with the lessons to be learned.  One of the key lessons from the rethink on Grid Link is that people re-examined the forecast demand and came up with a realistic estimate of the projected demand for the next 15 to 20 years.<\/p><p>Has that been done regarding the North-South interconnector?  Are we dealing with reality when we talk about projected demand in the North-South interconnector scenario?<\/p><p> My second question is on the regional option or series compensation.  Am I correct in believing that means that supply can be taken from a low demand area to be used in a high demand area?  I do not know how it works so will somebody explain to me whether that involves taking supply from low demand areas and putting it into high demand areas?<\/p><p> My third specific question is about the series compensation or regional option.  Does that facilitate integration with supply in Britain or on the European mainland in terms of future energy security?  Does the technology support that integration?<\/p><p> The points I made at the last meeting lie at the heart of the North-South interconnector issue.  I suspect that the witnesses believe that because something has gone to An Bord Plean&aacute;la the job is done and there is nothing people can do about it.  When I asked questions at the last meeting such as whether the impact of over-grounding on house values, land values and tourism had been considered, the replies were to the effect that they looked at what happened elsewhere but it is subjective and difficult to put a measurable impact on it.  Is that fair on the farmer who will have pylons on his or her land or whose house will be overlooked by pylons?  Is it fair to the owners of hotels, guest houses, pubs and caf&eacute;s who will see a reduction in the number of tourists coming into their areas and who depend on tourism in those areas?  We need to be able to measure the impact of any developments.  If there are adverse impacts from good developments, that reality has to be taken into account.  Adverse impacts arising from good developments can happen.  I was not satisfied with the answers I got on the last occasions so could we explore that issue this morning?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#H00500","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":225,"content":"<p>The Deputy's first question was on forecast demand.

As I mentioned earlier, while the economy turned dramatically, the energy demand piece did not turn as rapidly.  In terms of the Grid Link project, as we do with all projects we review them before we move them to the next stage.  We continually do that.  When we did that with the Grid Link project as part of the overall review of Grid 25 and the detailed assessment of overhead and underground options, this new technology option became a viable option that was identified at that time.  It was not identified earlier because of the higher demand levels and higher demand growth rates.<\/p> <p>  It is appropriate that we continue to review projects at stage gates as they go forward to make sure that where there are new options, we identify them.  We were open about identifying this back in March.  When we published our draft review of the strategy we included this in it because we had done that, and we continued to do the detailed design and assessment of it through the rest of the year, such that we could do that full assessment of the option.  However, we felt that to mitigate the issue the Deputy mentioned about the suddenness of it coming out, and given that we had identified it as a strategic option back in March, we should be open and transparent about that and get communities' feedback on that as part of the wider grid development strategy.  That led us to a point where, in September, we had done that detailed comparison of the options against the criteria of environmental, technical and economic considerations.  We try to manage it in that way and be systematic about the way we review projects to make sure that we are only bringing forward those projects that are appropriate, and that we continue to assess them to make sure they are appropriate.  That is how that evolved, and to some extent that is the reasoning behind including it as a strategic option in the March publication.  We wanted to get communities' view on it and get that engagement on it before we even got to a point where we had all the detailed work done on it.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked us to explain how the regional option works.

We have an existing North-South infrastructure at the moment in time of 220 kV.  I realise the difficulty with running a 440 kV cable underground and the expense of that.  My question is as follows.  We have a 220 kV interconnector and need a 440 kV interconnector North-South.  Has EirGrid considered the possibility of running an 220 kV interconnector underground in parallel with the existing overhead that is there?  That is an option and if it has not been looked at, it should be.  I share the concerns of the people of Meath, Monaghan and Cavan and note their reluctance and the way they have been treated.  They see what has happened with Grid West.  EirGrid said there were no new options for the interconnector between North and South.  Has EirGrid considered the possibility of an underground solution in parallel?  It can run in parallel with the existing overhead.<\/p> <p>  On the question of demand for electricity reducing, we are talking about planning for 2025 to 2030 and 15 or 20 years ahead.  There is no guarantee that demand will not increase.  More houses and factories are being built, which we encourage, and demand will go forward.  I would like EirGrid to look at the possibility of running a complete 220 kV interconnector underground in parallel with the existing overhead.  EirGrid has looked at utilising the existing 220 kV and increasing the height of the pylons or adding the odd one in when the spans are too long.  I hope that has been looked at.  I am not happy that there is no alternative to an overhead interconnector.  I am not convinced about it and I would like Mr. Slye to convince me.

This involves a convertor station at each end and a cable between the two converter stations.  This is technically not as good a solution because one is inserting a new technology into the middle of a mesh AC network and it requires very complex control systems to manage it which have a risk of failure.  It also does not facilitate economic development along the route in the same way an overhead line does.

The scale of costs involved with an underground HVDC are so prohibitive that no industrial customer would do it, which is another reason it is not a good solution.<\/p> <p>  However, HVDC is a technical alternative and we have set out the costs associated with that technology, which are very significant.

I have sat through these meetings from the very start and from the day that the chairman designate of EirGrid was before the committee.  I asked him if he would like to live beside a pylon himself.  He said &quot;No.&quot;  Over the years the committee has heard that we were a growing economy, which we have at the moment, thank God, and that a growing economy would require this project on a regional basis.<\/p><p>The committee was told that under no circumstances could there be any option other than lattice structures.  We heard from EirGrid representatives that in the west there would be no option other than lattice structures.  I am not from either of those regions.  I am from a region where we have these structures crossing the mid-west from Loop Head, right through the centre of County Clare, up into Tipperary and down into Limerick.  I was always interested in the project and whether, in the event there was an underground option for new development, there would also be an underground option for existing networks.<\/p><p>This process appears to lack any degree of credibility.  There is zero credibility.  We are back in a situation now where the economy is growing.  The IDA tells us that one of its fundamental requirements is a need for energy in the regions and I imagine that includes the south east and the west.  All of a sudden the south east and the west are stalled or scrapped, depending on how one looks at it, but not the north east.  The north east will not benefit from this.  The committee learned from a meeting with representatives from EirGrid that the beneficiary of this project will be Northern Ireland.  We find ourselves in a situation where areas that will be worst affected will not benefit at all.<\/p><p>We are also being told that there is a possibility of laying a cable, presumably in the seabed to France with all the different technologies and voltages between the French and the Irish sides, while at the same time every excuse is put in the way of linking this jurisdiction with the Northern jurisdiction, ultimately to benefit the Northern economy.  I do not have a difficulty with that but there is a difficulty with the double standard which emerged a long time ago when this committee was told one could have any option in the south east and west as long as it was a lattice structure.  That has now changed but it has not changed for the north east.  I do not represent that area but I look at fairness and impartiality and it would seem that if we are going to have a growing economy on the entire island and if there are deficits in energy supply, there would be a universal approach on an all island basis but that is not what is happening.  It seems to be piecemeal and <i>ad hoc <\/i>and we are at a stage now where we are nearly making it up as we go along.<\/p><p>As a Member of the Oireachtas I have zero confidence in this system at the moment.  If I were representing an area that was under the microscope for this, I could not tell people I had any confidence in this as it is being chopped and changed.  Two or three years ago the committee was told that this was the only option for the south east.  Now that is gone and there are many options for the south east.  It can be solved regionally and there is a possible solution for the west but we are still being told there is no solution for the north east other than the one we are going to plough ahead with.  At the same time there is the possibility of a cable to France at God only knows how much cost and I presume it is not going to be lattice structures across the Celtic Sea or the Bay of Biscay.<\/p><p> I have a very straightforward question.  Could we stop the pretence that things cannot change and everything must be as it was three years ago?  Everything is not as it was three years ago and there have been changes.  The economy is growing and there is much more demand for electricity, as there will be in future.  It seems there is a complete lack of credibility from the organisational perspective in how this has been designed and sold.<\/p><p> I said last week with regard to another organisation that a hames has been made of this from start to finish.  We are now in a position where this is happening in one region in the country.  I do not represent it and know nothing about it but if I was from there, I would be very sore.  There is an obligation, as this body is owned by the taxpayers, to listen to people.  That has not been done at all for the past number of years.  The chairman-designate said at the time that he would not like to live beside one of these structures and his honesty was refreshing, although it nearly cost him his position.  If he would not like to live beside one of these, why should somebody in Cavan, Monaghan or Meath, as their communities will not benefit in any case?  The beneficiaries would be communities in Northern Ireland with an energy shortage.  Ironically, at the last meeting we were told the cable would go underground when it crosses the Border.<\/p><p> We have been at this a long time and we are going around in a circle.  As we have gone on the merry-go-round, two regions, namely, the west and the south east, have fallen off.  To inject any degree of credibility into what is being done, EirGrid should pull the handbrake and admit this has been a public relations farce from start to finish.  It should explain how it was to consult with people and produce nice documents but although it got 38,000 submissions, it seems it did not listen to anybody.  This is not what is needed.<\/p><p> Now that EirGrid has decided to forget about the lattice structures and pylons all over the south east and it is looking at undergrounding options, where does that leave the existing infrastructure built from Loop Head up through the centre of the country?  People in the regions have grown up with those structures and we have spoken about electromagnetic radiation, with potential health and planning impacts.  There are other concerns in the north east, the south east and the west.  Where does this leave people in the midlands and the mid-west, who have had these for the 30 years since Moneypoint opened?  People have a right to be absolutely incensed by the way in which this issue has been handled from start to finish.  There is zero confidence in this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#L01300","speaker":"1058","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I will take a brief supplementary question from Deputy McEntee before reverting for replies and taking the next three members, Senator Byrne, Deputy Fitzmaurice and Deputy Durkan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#M00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I have a clear and straight question.

Apparently, we were told it could not be done.  That is the clearest statement possible.  The people of Meath will not accept anything less.  That is a fact.<\/p><p> The opposition to this project is such that it is surely a factor in the cost calculations of EirGrid.  The fact that this project has been delayed for eight years must surely be a major factor in terms of the additional costs that EirGrid has incurred, some of which are the fault of EirGrid and others that are through no fault of EirGrid.  In any event, that cost is there and it will continue throughout an oral hearing.  There was no word in County Meath about the east-west interconnector underground.  I know some objected in north Dublin, perhaps, but not a word was said in County Meath.  Generally, EirGrid has good relations with the community in that part of the county.  That must count for something.  It is in place for four or five years at this stage and it must be looked at.  That must be the way to do it, instead of riling the people and creating considerable anger and unfairness in respect of how different parts of the country seem to be treated based, it seems to me, upon political representation.<\/p><p> I am keen to make another point.  The Deputy from Limerick is Deputy Patrick O'Donovan.  I should know him because at one time we appeared on the same episode of \"Where in the World\" some 20 years ago.  We were against each other.  That is a little known fact, but he reminded me of it some years ago.  He made the point that there would be no benefit to the north east and that this was only benefiting Northern Ireland.  I am keen to put on the record that I have no difficulty benefiting the North.  Certainly, I support anything that can lead to better integration of the electricity market on this island and working towards an all-island electricity market.  However, it cannot be done at the cost of an environmental, health, historical and heritage catastrophe.  That must be taken into account.  The people in Meath, myself included, demand that this be put underground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#N02900","speaker":"1116","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I thank the EirGrid deputation for their presentation.  I wish to clarify a point on Grid West.  The representatives from EirGrid have said it is dead in the water at the moment.  Is that for good?  I want to know that clearly.<\/p> <p>  One thing EirGrid might consider is the position around Carrick-on-Shannon.  I was down there where all the networks come together and it is like a spider with ten times the number of legs it should have.  It needs a ferocious tidying up.  If I lived around there, I would consider getting a con saw given the state of things.  It is brutal, to be honest.  I do not know how people in that area can put up with the maze of wires coming every which way.  A farmer could not even farm properly.  I call on EirGrid to look at that.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the North-South issue.  Has EirGrid examined producing more electricity in the North, perhaps with a view to there being no necessity for this to go ahead?  The EirGrid representatives have talked about two sides of the country being dead in the water now.  For the sake of the future, EirGrid representatives have said previously that they could not do it in every part of Ireland.  Part of Grid West was supposed to go underground at the time.  Why can we not facilitate the people now in Monaghan and those affected by the North-South issue and put it underground and go for it?  It may cost a little extra but I do not believe people begrudge other people in any part of the country eyesores.  I do not want people enduring eyesores, no matter where they are.  EirGrid should strongly look at this.  No one begrudges anyone electricity whether they are in the north, south, east or west.  The EirGrid representatives mentioned people with different justices and people from different backgrounds.  It is one thing to live in a place and not look at these things but it is another thing to have them 50 or 60 meters from the back door.  This is sickening equipment to have nearby.<\/p> <p>  I am not from that area, but EirGrid should consider listening to the people and the representatives from there.  Deputy Patrick O'Donovan is from Limerick country.  I am from the west of Ireland.  I have no wish to see someone from another part of Ireland disenfranchised or put out.  They deserve the same as anyone else.

I am sorry for coming in, as I am not a member of this committee but I was previously a member of a similar committee.  I was a spokesman in this area for a number of years.  I will start from where Deputy Patrick O'Donovan left off in terms of lack of confidence in the system and EirGrid.  I believe there is an inability on the part of EirGrid to do its job and not only that, but there is also the failure to identify accurately and to represent the position as inherited from a previous Government, one with which Senator Byrne has some familiarity, which entered into an international agreement that imposed certain conditions on this country in terms of electricity, alternative energy and the identification of requirements.  All of that is in addition to what will flow from the agricultural sector in terms of requirements towards carbon reduction.  EirGrid has done nothing to in any way enhance the confidence we should have in the ability of the company to do that job, because it has equivocated in respect of everything.<\/p> <p>  In the United Kingdom, people are clearly told the difference between underground and overground costs.  Whether it is five times or six times the cost, people are told straight off.  There is no equivocation.  There is no such thing as saying that it is not really five times and it may be two and half times, in which case it would amount to the same thing.  That is the cost.  At present, they are designing systems in the UK to transmit electricity overground.  If people want them to go underground, then the relevant region pays for it.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned about this and I do not believe EirGrid is going anywhere.  I do not believe EirGrid has identified the extent to which economic growth in this country is going to drive the requirement for energy in future.  EirGrid has failed in that regard.  EirGrid has changed decisions in mid-air without consultation with anyone.  That is not something to engender confidence in either the people who are affected or the public representatives who have to carry the responsibility for it.<\/p> <p>  As Members of the Oireachtas, we have shouldered the responsibility in recent years of doing what a previous Government determined we should do, that is, develop alternative energy.  However, there are few options.  We have been left swinging.  I totally disagree with what Senator Byrne has said.  His organisation knew full well what was going on.  I was invited to Cavan, Monaghan and north Meath when I was a spokesman on this matter to address these issues well before the last general election.  What was going on there was well known.

We prepared the report as per the terms set out by the independent expert panel on the underground and overhead options.  We published that earlier this year and we have engaged with communities around that.  The project is on hold, pending clarity from the developers of the various large wind farms around Mayo and their intentions.  As we mentioned earlier, one of them, the Cluddaun wind farm developed by Coillte, was refused planning permission earlier this year.  The Oweninny wind farm, parts of which are being developed by Bord na M&oacute;na and other parts in a joint venture with the ESB, currently has planning permission but an application to alter this is currently with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Obviously, we would envisage that the developers would want to see the outcome of that planning process before they can provide clarity.  We do not think it is appropriate to move forward with an engagement with communities around selecting an option until we get clarity from the developers as to what developments in terms of renewable generation in Mayo will be proceeding.

At the outset, I want to say that we are statutorily barred from engaging in generation in any way, shape or form, contracting for it or engaging in the buying or selling of it.  What we have is an all-island energy market that was initiated in 2007.  Part of that is a mechanism that encourages generators to develop the appropriate generation facilities to meet the needs of the island as a whole.  That was a core premise of the all-island energy market, that it would serve all customers on the island.  What we have seen is that there is sufficient capacity on the island but that in the specific jurisdiction of Northern Ireland there is not, hence the need for the North-South interconnector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#P02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":345,"content":"<p>If there were 40 km underground, could the line be upgraded without putting anything else in the overhead part of it?

We are acutely conscious this is a difficult project which impacts on communities along the route, and we need to continue to engage with them and listen to their concerns, which are real, to try to address them as best we possibly can.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan also asked questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan Slye"},{"type":"speech","time":1446629400,"counter":354,"content":"<p>Deputy Durkan has left but Mr. Slye may put his response on the record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#Q00400","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":355,"content":"<p>He spoke about an international grid and I am not 100% sure which one this is.  Perhaps it is the EU's 2020 targets by which Ireland is bound.  To set out the process we have gone through, we published the Grid25 strategy and consulted on it in 2008.  This set off a number of individual projects on which we consulted and engaged with people.  We are quite adamant it is appropriate that we continually review projects as we go forward, to ensure they remain appropriate for the society, economy and people who are ultimately going to pay for them.  This is what we did.  We did a full review of the overall strategy itself and published it as a draft.  We engaged in a consultation for ten weeks and did a series of roadshows and public meetings throughout the country with members of the public, facilitated by Irish Rural Link.  We also met chambers of commerce and other interest groups to get their input into the decision.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to changing decisions without consultation and this is not what we have done.  We have been very transparent in terms of how we looked to develop the grid, the overall strategy and how we consult and engage with people on this strategy and on individual projects.  Ultimately, our commitment to looking at all available technology options to maximise the use of the existing grid will serve the people by ensuring the best solution is developed and will serve communities by ensuring we engage with them properly with all the options being discussed.  As I referred to earlier, we have done extensive analysis of our consultation and engagement process to ensure we learn and improve.

Is the reduction what was forecast or is series compensation giving EirGrid half as much again, with the two meeting in the middle?

It is a direct result of a solution that would have been too short-term to have been viable in the past, but now the slower growth and the longer time it will take to reach the same demand levels mean it will be an enduring solution for a much longer period and will make a sound investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015110400002#Q00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Norton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446629400,"counter":359,"content":"<p>It inherently increases the transfer capacity of the underlying transmission grid to move power.
