I find it extraordinary that when Caranua and the Department were here before us, and please correct me if I am wrong but I think the Secretary General of the Department attended on that occasion, nobody seemed to know the rental position and least of all Caranua.  Originally Caranua said it did not pay rent and the matter has since been clarified.  I mention this matter because at that point, Caranua said it was not paying rent and subsequently corrected itself.  The Department official who attended the meeting did not know anything about rent.

I have a difficulty with the fact that the official from the Department of Education and Skills sat in on the meeting on that day yet it took until 16 June and our persistence to find out the position.  I still have no idea why further provision was not made for Caranua in the circumstances but that is for a different forum.  I am most unhappy with the way the information has been relayed to us.  I am also unhappy that rent amounting to approximately &euro;250,000 will be taken every year, if one takes VAT into account, in a fund that was specifically set up under statutory obligations to support victims who had attended institutions.  I shall leave the matter at that for today.

That is UCC, CIT and some information from DIT on the library issue.  We note and publish all of those and will deal with them in private session before we complete our report later on today.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 649C, correspondence from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, in reply to a request from the committee for a response to correspondence sent to the committee by an individual on the use of public funds to obtain legal advice.  I propose to forward the reply from the Department to the correspondent.  We have dealt with it extensively and that is a further reply from the Department.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Next item is No. 650, correspondence of 23 June from an organisation on a complaint being investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the winding up of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland in 2014.  The committee has been copied with the correspondence but it is addressed to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As such, we note it but someone else is acting on it.<\/p><p>No. 651C is correspondence received from a number of individuals with regard to Clonkeen College in Blackrock, County Dublin.  This was discussed last week and the secretariat has written to the Department of Education and Skills for a response.  I propose that we write to the correspondents informing them that we are awaiting a response and will contact them when have it.  Is that agreed? Agreed.  <br\/><br\/>No. 656C is correspondence dated 30 June 2017 from the chief executive officer of Horse Racing Ireland in response to a query sent by the committee about Dundalk racetrack and how much it actually costs, as well as various issues around loans and debenture which had been granted over the assets of the company.  This issue goes back several years but we will note this and send a copy of that response to the individual who wrote to us. <br\/><br\/>No. 657C is correspondence dated<b><\/b>2 July 2017 from an individual and concerns an investigation by the Revenue Commissioners into a complaint made by the individual as an employee.  I propose we write to Revenue to establish the process for hiring companies to carry out investigations of this nature.  The individual is, I believe, now a former employee.  We will wait for a reply and ask Departments and public bodies questions on their processes and procedures if there is a loss to the taxpayer.<br\/><br\/>Before I complete the correspondence there are two more items I want to bring to the committee's attention.  The first of these is item No. 658B, dated 3 July 2017, from Mr. John Barrett, executive director of human resources and people development at An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The document refers to matters concerning evidence heard by this committee about Templemore Garda College that Mr. Barrett believes is incorrect.  Other matters covered include the handling of a complaint about Mr. Barrett, a tracing methodology in respect of EU funds and a timeline of events from 2015 to present.  We will note that and consider it as part of drafting our report.  We had a meeting in private session yesterday and are scheduled to have another meeting next Tuesday.  We can discuss that then.

We will have no more public meetings so we have to conclude.  If there are issues on which we cannot conclude then we will just have to state that and consider them for further examination in part two of our report, which will be carried out after the summer recess.<\/p> <p>  Finally, we come to No. 663(i).  This is from Mr. John Nugent, chief administrative officer, and concerns various questions we asked in public session.  It is a short letter, less than a page, and I think we need to put it on the public record because it follows up on matters on the public record and directly replies to us.  I am also informed that further information from Mr. Nugent arrived in this morning.  This is currently being circulated.  All of this will have to be taken into account before we finalise our report on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The information here is not extensive but there is some information that is relevant to what we have been discussing. <\/p> <p>  The first issue in this letter concerns Mr. Culhane and Mr. Howard and responds to Mr. Culhane's earlier correspondence about the draft internal audit interim report.  The letter states that a recent meeting of the Committee for Public Accounts confirmed the Garda Commissioner initially sought legal advice over this serious matter and that Mr. Culhane was consequently invited to respond to Mr. Howard's correspondence.  The letter then goes on to say that Mr. Culhane responded and confirmed that he has withdrawn the two letters to Mr. Kelly, the internal auditor, at the Committee of Public Accounts, including the comments he made about Mr. Kelly's professionalism, personal motives and integrity.<\/p> <p>  We need to verify the transcript.  I know that I discussed this issue with Mr. Culhane and that he certainly did withdraw certain comments.  I do not specifically recall him withdrawing those two letters before this committee, which is what this letter said he did.  When the Commissioner was in here the second time I specifically asked her about the status of that letter, whether it still stood and whether it would still be standing by the time we came to producing our report. If that was the case, we would have to conclude that it reflected the official position of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both she and Mr. Nugent said that the matter was going through a process.  We now have a letter saying that it was withdrawn in public session several weeks earlier.  This letter contradicts what we were told at the subsequent public meeting.  We need to get this verified.  It is possible that we missed the full withdrawal of the letter in public session.  If we did then we would be happy to put that formally on the record but first we need that verified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017070600002#D00900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1499328000,"counter":70,"content":"<p>We sought a lot of correspondence from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and we have now received some from Mr.Nugent.

In the afternoon, we will have those from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in regard to its Votes.  That session will also include the special report on financial reporting in the public service which the Comptroller and Auditor General produced a little while ago.  We will discuss that with the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the afternoon.<\/p> <p>  Before we get to that session, I want to have a private meeting to utterly finalise the education report which we hope - it is not definite - to launch next Tuesday.  We are at a very advanced stage.  If we complete the session with the Department of Finance before the voting block, we will start into that private session.  If not, I really want to finish with the Department of Finance before the voting block and then we will commence immediately after the voting to sign off on the education report during a short private session.  We will then move onto the session with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is the working plan.

I will commence by speaking about the finance accounts.  The annual finance accounts present the receipts into and issues from the Central Fund of the Exchequer, together with a set of statements that itemise the transactions.  The financial statements of the national debt, which are prepared by the National Treasury Management Agency, are presented in full as Part 2 of the finance accounts.<\/p> <p>  The finance accounts provide a statement of Central Fund transactions on a cash basis and are not a comprehensive set of annual financial statements for the State or central government.  All revenues of the State are paid into the Central Fund of the Exchequer, unless otherwise determined by law.  Examples of State revenue which is not paid directly into the Central Fund include PRSI receipts which are paid into the Social Insurance Fund and the proceeds of motor tax which are paid into the local government fund.<\/p> <p>  The chapters that are the subject of today&rsquo;s meeting were compiled to highlight key aggregates and trends in Central Fund transactions and in broader State liabilities. <\/p> <p>  Chapter 1 summarises the Exchequer outturn for 2015.  Receipts in 2015 totalled &euro;58.6 billion, representing an increase of &euro;8.9 billion, or 18%, compared with 2014.  This was mainly due to increases in tax revenues of &euro;4.3 billion and a number of one-off capital receipts totalling &euro;3.6 billion.<\/p><p>Issues from the Central Fund in 2015 of &euro;58.7 billion were &euro;750 million or 1.3% higher than in 2014.  The movement in Central Fund receipts and issues is shown in the diagram which is now on screen.  This indicates that in 2015 the Exchequer deficit was almost eliminated - the shortfall for the year was just &euro;64 million.  This compares to an Exchequer deficit of &euro;8.2 billion in 2014.<\/p><p> Members may wish to know that I issued my audit report on the finance accounts for 2016 last week.  It is the Department's responsibility to present the accounts to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p> In chapter 2 of my report, I outline the trends and composition of Government debt and the cost of debt servicing.  The most comprehensive measure of Government debt is general Government debt.  This is an internationally standardised measure of the total gross debt owed by all Government bodies to third parties outside government.  At the end of 2015, the general Government debt stood at just over &euro;200 billion.  There was a very small decline in the level of debt year on year.  However, the ratio of general Government debt to GDP declined to 79% at the end of 2015 from 108% at the end of 2014.  This sharp reduction reflected an exceptional increase in the estimated value of Ireland's GDP in 2015, attributed to the activities of a small number of large multinational firms, including the relocation to Ireland in 2014-15 of a few big economic operators.<\/p><p> The main component of Ireland's general Government debt at the end of 2015 was the gross national debt.  This is the cumulative borrowing undertaken by the National Treasury Management Agency on behalf of the State.<\/p><p> Gross national debt stood at &euro;196.6 billion at the end of 2015, down marginally from the end of 2014.  The cost of servicing the national debt fell by 6% to &euro;7.1 billion in 2015.  This reflected a fall in the estimated average cost of servicing the debt, from 3.8% at the end of 2014 to 3.5% at the end of 2015.  By June 2016, the average had fallen further to 3.4%.<\/p><p> Turning now to chapter 18 in relation to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 requires me to report to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with respect to the correctness of the sums brought to account by the council each year.  Chapter 18 is my report for 2015.  My report on the audit was issued on 30 June 2016 and I gave a clear audit opinion.  Expenditure by the council in 2015 amounted to &euro;823,000.<\/p><p> The 2015 appropriation account for the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Finance records expenditure totalling &euro;26.3 million on five programme areas.  The expenditure on financial services policy recorded in the appropriation accounts is &euro;7.6 million.  However, it should be noted that this does not include costs associated with staff who are seconded to the Department from the NTMA to deal with banking sector issues, and certain related consultancy costs.  Those costs are borne by the NTMA and are not recouped from the Department.  The level of costs in that regard is not disclosed in either the appropriation account for Vote 7 or the NTMA's financial statements.

I am joined by Ms Ann Nolan, second Secretary General, Mr. John McCarthy, chief economist, Mr. Derek Tierney, head of corporate affairs, and Mr. Fiachra Quinlan of the finance unit.<br\/><br\/>I would like to focus on the four specific items on today&rsquo;s agenda.  The first is Vote 7 and the 2015 appropriation accounts for the Department.  The Estimate for 2015 was set at &euro;30.6 million.  Spend for 2015 was &euro;24.4 million, leaving a surplus to be surrendered of approximately &euro;6.2 million.  This surplus arose for a number of reasons.  Recruitment did not progress at the pace anticipated, resulting in a pay bill underspend of around &euro;1.1 million and a further &euro;600,000 underspend on non-pay administration expenses.  There was also an underspend of &euro;3.1 million on programme related costs arising from the completion of some work in-house and lower costs in relation to the shareholder management unit.  The Department also recouped an additional &euro;500,000 in respect of costs associated with the stabilisation of the banking sector.  We remain committed to seeking to minimise costs where possible, subject to achieving the best outturn for the State.<br\/><br\/>I draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to the following key points.  Tax revenues for 2015, at &euro;45.6 billion, were up &euro;4.3 billion or 10.5% year on year and &euro;3.3 billion or 7.8% on profile.  Within that figure for tax revenues, the increase was distributed across the three key tax heads.  Income tax grew by 7%, corporation tax by 48.9% and VAT by 7.1% year on year.  On the expenditure side, total expenditure, at &euro;58.6 billion, was up &euro;700 million or 1.2% year on year.  This was driven by increased voted expenditure which showed an increase of &euro;600 million.<br\/><br\/>General Government debt as a percentage of GDP fell to 78.7% in 2015 from a peak of 119.5% in 2012.  This downward trend is projected to continue with a debt to GDP ratio of some 72.9% forecast for 2017, which is in line with the euro area average. <br\/><br\/>I would like briefly to turn to performance and outputs in recent years.  The Department was restructured around two directorates in 2016 &ndash; the economic and fiscal directorate and the finance and banking directorate.  This structure remains largely unchanged in 2017.  The Department is working towards achieving two broad goals, namely, a sustainable macroeconomic environment and sound public finances; and a balanced and equitable economy enabled by a restructured, vibrant, secure and well regulated financial sector. <br\/><br\/>I am greatly encouraged by the robust pace of the recovery in the economy, with GDP increasing by 5.2% last year.  The increase in economic activity is broadly based and economic fundamentals are strong.  Export growth in recent years has been robust and exports continue to contribute positively to growth.  This is a reflection of the progress which has been made to restore our competitiveness.  Notably, the domestic sector is now driving growth in the economy, with private consumption up 3% in 2016. <br\/><br\/>Recovery is perhaps most clearly evident in the labour market, with annual employment having increased in each of the last 18 quarters, representing an increase of 231,000 jobs since the low point in 2012.  Strong employment gains have driven a substantial turnaround in unemployment, which has fallen from a peak of more than 15% to 6.4% in May.<br\/><br\/>Key economic indicators point to continued solid growth this year.  The Department is forecasting growth of 4.3% this year and 3.7% next year.  Despite the pace of the recovery and the strength of our underlying economic fundamentals, we must be conscious of the uncertainty in the external environment which underlines the need for caution supported by prudent economic and fiscal policies.<br\/><br\/>Public finances also continue to move in the right direction, with significant progress being made on the general Government deficit.  Ireland exited the excessive deficit procedure in 2016 and it is planned to reach the medium-term objective of a structurally balanced budget in 2018.<br\/><br\/>Underpinned by a growing economy, the hard won improvements in our public finances provide a sustainable budgetary platform upon which funding for the provision of public services can be provided in the years ahead.  The market reaction to our management of the public finances has been positive but it is vital that we sustain our progress.  We must guard against complacency, maintain our prudent management of the public finances and continue with competitiveness oriented policies. <br\/><br\/>Brexit is one of the serious challenges for the economy<b>. <\/b>The Government approach has outlined twin Brexit goals, the first to secure the closest possible economic and trading relationship between the EU and UK, and the second to prepare the economy to cope with turbulence of coming years and the structural shift of new realities of Brexit.  The best and most immediate policy within the Government's control to counter the likely turbulence of coming years is to prudently manage the public finances to ensure Ireland's economy continues to remain competitive in the face of future economic headwinds. <br\/><br\/>The last budget outlined a number of policies targeted at the most exposed sectors, measures to support small and medium enterprises, entrepreneurship, agrifood, and exporters, while also targeting potential economic opportunities, such as competing for mobile international investment in the international financial services sector.  The Government has also put forward Dublin as an excellent location for the European Banking Authority post-Brexit.<br\/><br\/>A key focus for the Department in the past year has been the sale of the State's investment in AIB.  The successful capital reorganisation of the bank in 2015 provided a supportive backdrop for the commencement of this process and significant work has been undertaken by the Department and its advisers over this period to achieve a successful outcome for the State.  The recent completion of the initial public offering, IPO, represents a significant milestone and not only has it resulted in a substantial sum of money being returned to the State, but it also creates a strong platform for the State to recover all of the money it has invested in AIB over time.  At the end of this process, the State will continue to hold 71% of AIB, which is worth around &euro;9 billion, and will continue to be a substantial focus for the Department for some time. <br\/><br\/>As with any organisation, we must strive to evolve, improve and embed the skills necessary to the job at hand.  This is an ongoing process.  I am pleased to report that the Department was awarded the best learning and development organisation for 2017 for a medium-sized organisation as part of the Irish Institute of Training and Development awards.<\/p><p>The award is an endorsement of the commitment of the Department and its staff to the development of a learning culture focusing on both hard skills and those of leadership and management necessary for the job.<\/p><p> I express my appreciation to the staff at the Department for their ongoing hard work.  It is only through their continuing commitment and dedication that we can deliver on our objectives.  The Department will strive for continuous improvement and develop into the best organisation it can possibly be.

I will tell the witnesses what we are talking about in the Committee of Public Accounts which we feel the Department is missing entirely.  The first is the amount that is due under the redundancy and insolvency fund.  We have heard the Taoiseach - the witnesses need not get into the politics - talking a lot about publishing the names of people caught for social welfare fraud of more than &euro;5,000 while it is &euro;33,000 for taxpayers.  There is a lower threshold.  We understand the majority of the redundancy and insolvency fund will not be paid.  We are satisfied from what we have heard that no one gives a hoot about collecting it in public bodies.  It used to be in the Department of Enterprise and Employment, which shipped it over to the Department of Social Protection, which has not done an analysis of how much of it is actually collectible.  Some of it has to be collected.  Some of it refers to companies that have been restructured and are still there.  We have had correspondence from the Department of Social Protection.  It says that it writes to Revenue to find out if PAYE numbers are still valid.  However, there is no connection.  If it related to interest on a deposit account of someone on social welfare, the State would be able to match that up and track that down.  However, there is no proper tracking down of it here.  I am just saying that there is a gap in the Department's national accounts and it needs to look at it.<\/p> <p>  I will give a second example.  When companies are liquidated, sometimes there is an asset at the end of the liquidation process which, ultimately, if there are no shareholders, is to be transferred to the State.  We have not established the Department has a mechanism to do that.  The Department got a big receipt the year before last of &euro;10 million.  A company in England sent it over to us.  We heard about that during a meeting last year.  To put it in layman's terms, it is the corporate equivalent of someone dying intestate.  I am satisfied that there is no mechanism in place by anyone.<\/p> <p>  I am just giving three examples that have crossed our desk in the past 12 months.  The third example relates to the household charge.  Before the local property tax was introduced, there was a &euro;100 per annum charge.  If it was not paid, interest was charged.  If it was never paid, &euro;7,200 is now due.  In the year in question, the Department collected &euro;30 million.  The following year, it collected &euro;30 million.  Last year, it was a lesser amount.  When selling a house, a person has to get an up-to-date certificate from the local authorities and normally has to discharge that charge before the sale can go through.  That proves to me that there is money out there to be collected but the Department is doing nothing about it.  It is only if someone is selling a house that he or she gets caught at that point.  There has to be a mechanism in place.  The Department has to talk to the people who are over collecting the money.  This is not just the Revenue Commissioners.  The Department collects money separate from them.  The Department needs to talk to those people about having a mechanism to compare those houses which have come into the local property tax net, which I think is nearly 100%, with those that should have had a liability for the household charge.  There is tens of millions of euro out there that zero effort is being made by the State to collect.  It collects some of it by default when someone tries to sell a house.  Some of that is contingent income which I think the Department does not take into account.<\/p> <p>  How much is in the rainy day fund?  I think it was established last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017070600002#R02600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499328000,"counter":583,"content":"<p>Perhaps Mr. McCarthy-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017070600002#R02700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derek Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1499328000,"counter":584,"content":"<p>How did that work last year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017070600002#R02800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499328000,"counter":585,"content":"<p>It does not come in until after we balance the books.

I understand that.  Has the Department calculated the interest that Irish taxpayers paid through current revenue on the borrowings to bail out AIB since 2008, since the bailout?  I would expect a minimum of that because it was interest paid on a year-by-year basis that came out of current revenues.

I understand the minimum amount for 2016 to 2018 was &euro;500 million a year.  According to a reply to a parliamentary question I got last night, it was &euro;3 billion in 2016.  It is &euro;2 billion so far in 2017.  That is way ahead.  We met the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Philip Lane, maybe a year ago about this.  I think he said that they would be \"extinguished\".  My understanding is that we printed money and have to take it back out of the economy and that is what the IOUs were, and that we have to extinguish them.  We do not have to extinguish them as quickly, and the witnesses explained about how money is cheap at the moment.  If we can park that and just spend it, and pay it down in the timeframe - I have a real problem with it and do not think we should be doing that - does that not leave some capacity to borrow for things that we can borrow for now and save later on?<\/p> <p>  I want to come back to a point that Deputy Catherine Connolly made.  We are going to have cash fines imposed on us as a consequence of not meeting our 2020 climate targets.  It will become a real issue for the Department of Finance when there are cash fines.  It will not be something theoretical but something in practice.  We are going to miss the 2020 targets and by virtue of the fact that we are on the wrong trajectory, we are going to have a real challenge with the 2030 targets.  We should spend on some of the things that would ensure we avoid those fines, which could be very substantial.  Would that not be a more prudent approach if there is the ability to pay this other way?  Does that space exist if we do not approach the payment of those floating rate notes and have not accelerated it?  Does that create a space to spend money in a different way where it is cheap to borrow and we will save money in hard cash and fines as early as 2020?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017070600002#U03900","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499328000,"counter":738,"content":"<p>I think we have gone through the promissory note matter in a bit of detail.

In 2015 or 2016, after we came out of the excessive deficit procedure we were concerned about the reference rate, which is a key metric which feeds into the calculation of fiscal space.  It is updated in the rules every three years.  It is calculated out over a ten-year timeframe and it has backward and forward-looking components.  We felt that process was unfavourable in an Irish context because in 2015 it would have taken into account the negative potential growth rate in 2010 and 2011, when the economy was in the depths of the crisis.  We made a very strong economic argument to the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, DG  ECFIN, that it should be updated on a annual basis, which would have meant eliminating those years from the calculation.

That would be helpful.  Mr. McCarthy offered up a staunch defence of the fiscal rules a number of times.  That is fair enough.  He also spoke a number of times about the economic crash and said that the reason it occurred was because we did not have rules to the extent that we do now.<\/p> <p>  We need to bring a big elephant into the room, and park it there, in terms of the reason for the crash.  In the first instance, there was an over-reliance on consumption taxes.  There was excessive commercial borrowing and excessive lending by the banks which led to the crash.  The Department of Finance, the people who in the past sat where Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Moran sit now, were also asleep at the wheel and did not see any of the flags.  Let us be realistic when Mr. McCarthy throws this issue back at us in respect of the crash.  We understand there was a crash.  The people we represent suffered greatly because of it.  The Department of Finance, however, needs to take responsibility for having been partly responsible for a lot of the policy decisions and their implementation.  Does Mr. Moran think it is possible that in making sure that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past that we are now going too far in the opposite direction?  Are we restricting spending to the extent that we are creating pressures in health, housing and infrastructure?  Everybody accepts that these pressures are there.  Does he understand how difficult it is for us as public representatives to see these huge pressures in public services?  They are obvious and real.  They are not imagined.  Yet all we hear is that academic, economic language about the fiscal rules, which may or may not be appropriate.  A debate can be had on them.  Mr. Moran can imagine our frustration.  That is why I am asking this question.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister has said today that the fiscal rules which currently exist are not fit for purpose because of the demographic pressures in this State.  For once I agree with the Minister for Finance.  Changes need to be made.  What work has Mr. Moran and his Department done specfically up to now to make sure that we can get the changes we need to allow us to spend money - not unrealistically or recklessly - in the way that is necessary to ensure that the people who need health care get health care and that the people who need a roof over their head get a roof over their head?

It goes back to this concept in the rules.  I will say this carefully, the fiscal rules as they stand are in general probably a good thing as a framework.  We have a set of rules that apply to the totality of the EU.  The economies of the area are very different in terms of scale, size, dynamics, recent history and so on.  To that extent, there are occasions where they can be entirely counterintuitive in terms of how they apply at any point in time.  I absolutely recognise that.  In the end, we have come from a situation - and I think we began some of this discussion earlier - where in 2007 we had a debt rate of 25% and we reached 120% within a couple of years, which exposed the country to huge problems.  We have to try to get the balance right to prevent that happening again.  In the end of the day, the rules are an integral part of the overall fiscal pact.

If I was to be political about it, and I do not want to be, I measured the policies of the Tea Party in the United States against the fiscal rules and found very little difference between them.

It is not a response, but I will make it seeing as it was mentioned that he chairs a group dealing with some of the fiscal rules at EU level.  There would be a concern in some countries - I am not saying it is a unanimous view - that the fiscal rules and this drive to be off-balance sheet to keep within the fiscal rules is resulting in what I would call social engineering.<\/p><p>It is having a serious social engineering effect because of the issue with building houses. We had a financial crash, the banks went bust and some people have large mortgages.  We are very quickly moving from a position where 80% of Irish people owned their own houses in one generation to being lucky if 20% of the next generation will own their homes.  That is what happens at European level.  The attitude to that is so be it, but in the way that Irish people live their lives that represents social engineering in Ireland.<\/p><p> Does the way society operates in various countries come within the financial strictures of Mr. McCarthy's work at EU level?

I stressed this point when responding to Deputy Catherine Murphy at the start, and the Secretary General also made a reference to it.  The fiscal rules do not constrain what one spends, they simply constrain the bottom line.  If one wants to choose a Swedish type of expenditure model, one can do it but one has to be able to finance it.  If one chooses an UK type, where Government spending as a portion of GDP is at the lower end of the spectrum, one can do that as well.  It is a policy choice.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to go into policy but it is a policy choice as to whether we want to spend to address these issues, and certainly there are issues to address.  We do not live in a bubble.  There is nobody present who is not conscious of the issues, but it is a question of how to finance them.  We would be concerned.  The Chairman has a view, which is legitimate.  I have a view that fiscal sustainability is the issue, because if we loose that it is back to the troika again.  That would create issues.  We spoke of the &euro;201 billion debt.<\/p> <p>  Other countries have issues.  I chair a very technical group on how one measures the structural balance, rather than the policy about it.  There is another element to it in which I am not involved, that is, the statistical treatment of some of these issues, to which the Secretary General alluded.  EUROSTAT does not like anything that Government tries to put off balance sheet.  EUROSTAT had its fingers burnt with Greece, where Greece got the data wrong and suddenly it had a deficit that was three or four times what they thought it was going to be.  EUROSTAT has become increasingly strict in terms of the balance sheet treatment of anything.  We saw that with Irish Water.  We considered that, in conjunction with our colleagues in the CSO and in the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government that we had done enough to keep it off balance sheet, but EUROSTAT came up with obscure reasons, which we still do not understand, as to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017070600002#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1499328000,"counter":873,"content":"<p>Known as common sense.

The 2015 appropriation account for the Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform records gross expenditure totalling &euro;40.8 million, divided across two programme areas: the public service management and reform programme, on which &euro;24.1 million was spent, or 59% of the expenditure, and the public expenditure and sectoral policy programme, which accounted for the balance.  At the end of the year, the Department had underspent by a net &euro;4.1 million relative to its budget.<\/p> <p>  Vote 12, superannuation and retired allowances, is used to pay for Civil Service and prison officer pensions.  Pension payments for other public servants are charged, directly or indirectly, to other votes, including those for education, health, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Army pensions.  The gross expenditure on Vote 12 in 2015 amounted to &euro;499 million, an increase of 5.3% compared with 2014.  Appropriations-in-aid, mainly comprising employee pension contributions, amounted to &euro;136 million in 2015, up 30% from 2014.  The increase was due mainly to employee contributions in respect of the public service single pension scheme, which was introduced for all public servants appointed since 2013.<\/p> <p>  An unusual feature of the account for Vote 12 is the absence of administration expenses.  The Department of Finance administered the pension payments charged to Vote 12 on behalf of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and charged the associated administration costs to its own Vote.  In December 2015, responsibility for administration of the pension payments transferred to Vote 18, shared services.<\/p> <p>  The 2015 appropriation account for the Vote for shared services records gross expenditure totalling &euro;26.2 million.  Overall, there was underspend of &euro;18.7 million, almost 42% relative to the Estimate.  A sum of &euro;13.2 million was spent on activities related to PeoplePoint, which handles human resources activities centrally.  A sum of &euro;9.3 million was spent on payroll shared services, and &euro;2.3 million on other shared services projects, including a shared financial management project.  Expenditure on the payroll shared services centre was &euro;7.8 million, or 46%, less than provided for in the Estimate, mainly due to the later than anticipated transition of certain payroll clients to the shared services office.  Expenditure incurred on set-up costs for the financial management project was &euro;8.2 million, or 78%, below estimate.<\/p> <p>  In the statement on internal financial control, the Accounting Officer draws attention to salary overpayments and steps taken to address this issue.  I am carrying out a review of the issue this year and expect to include a chapter in my report on the 2016 accounts of the public services later this year. <\/p> <p>  The year 2015 was the second year of operation for the Office of Government Procurement.  Gross expenditure of &euro;14.3 million was &euro;5.3 million, or 27%, lower than estimated.  Note 3 explains that a delay in obtaining office accommodation impacted on recruitment with knock-on effects in other areas of planned non-pay expenditure, resulting in an underspend of &euro;2.8 million.  Procurement and subsequent implementation of external support services for the office also took longer than originally planned, resulting in an underspend of &euro;2.4 million.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 3 is a standard report that aims to consolidate and summarise Vote expenditure for 2015 across all Votes and to demonstrate medium to long-term trends.  Gross voted expenditure across all Votes in 2015 was &euro;46 billion, the same as in 2014.

There are issues in regard to underexpenditure across a number of the Votes.  The reasons for that have been set out very clearly.  They relate mainly to a number of reform projects that have been committed to.  We had a slower than expected take-up on a number of initiatives, slow recruitment processes and retention of contractors involved in delivering some of these projects.  These projects are very significant.  Obviously, what Mr. Paul Quinn is driving in terms of procurement reform and what we are doing in shared services comprise very significant transformation projects.  We have an issue all the time in respect of trying to get the pacing right and trying to pace our projects in a sensible way, ensuring value for money while at the same time ensuring we are spending what is allocated and keeping within profile.  We are aware that, for 2015, there were significant underspends, as set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  As a Department, we are very much conscious of ensuring we set out only Estimates and draw down amounts as close as possible to those, consistent with the financial procedures.<\/p> <p>  More generally, in terms of managing spending, the committee will be aware that a key part of our job is not just preparation of the budget but also executing it during the year.  A key issue for us is to ensure overall spending stays within profile.  Again, the Comptroller and Auditor General has set out in the report our performance in this respect.  It varies from year to year.  On average in recent years, we stayed at about 2%.  The variance against profile is around 2%.  There are many reasons for that.  They relate to forecasting errors, issues around forecasting demand, particularly in regard to the health service, and specifically Government decisions on issues such as the Christmas bonus or additional moneys allocated for capital programmes.  Especially during 2015, as taxes exceeded profile, the Government had the opportunity to make some additional investments in capital infrastructure and it provided for some restoration of the Christmas bonus.  That was the first time it was done since the economic crash.  It is an ongoing challenge for our Department in terms of managing spending in line with profile.<\/p> <p>  I will touch on some of the reform issues with which we are pushing ahead.  Procurement reform, shared services and digitalisation are issues we discussed previously at meetings of this committee.  We are pushing ahead with those.  Two issues that have taken up a lot of our time this year relate to the negotiations on the recent pay agreement.  Deputies will be aware that the unions are now in a process of balloting in respect of the new agreement, the extension of the Lansdowne Road agreement.  It is very important in terms of securing industrial peace and co-operation with ongoing reform but also necessary to ensure we have a pay settlement that is affordable and sustainable for the State.<\/p> <p>  My next point is on the capital review.  I heard some of the discussions this morning when the members were debating with colleagues from the Department of Finance on capital spending and issues associated with that.  The Government is now considering the mid-term review of the current capital plan.  The Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, hopes to announce on budget day some additional projects and allocations in respect of capital spending.  It is a key part of what the Department is engaged in now.<\/p> <p>  We are delighted to be here and to answer any questions that arise.  I thank colleagues in the Department for all their work.  It is very rare we get the opportunity to thank people in the Department for all the effort they put in.  Members are aware of the significant work that goes on in the Department in terms of the various projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017070600002#WW00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1499328000,"counter":894,"content":"<p>We are conscious that we have a representative from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform present at most meetings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017070600002#WW00700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499328000,"counter":895,"content":"<p>Yes<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017070600002#WW00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1499328000,"counter":896,"content":"<p>We acknowledge the Department's continued presence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017070600002#WW00900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499328000,"counter":897,"content":"<p>The Chairman asked for that previously and we decided we would keep doing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017070600002#WW01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1499328000,"counter":898,"content":"<p>That is good.

The single pension scheme has reduced the pension benefits for people who came in after 2013.  They are also making the contribution to the pension.  This will help in the future sustainability of pensions.  With regard to the agreement that is now subject to balloting, the pension related deduction, which was seen as emergency measures during the crisis, this year yielded &euro;740 million.  Some &euro;550 million will turn into a permanent contribution that people are making to their pensions - some 70% of the public service are now making a greater contribution - if that agreement is put in to force.<\/p> <p>  The steps we are taking to ensure the sustainability into the future involve changes to the pension benefits and also the higher contribution, especially those who came in before 2013 and who benefit from the higher pensions.  We believe that measures have been taken.  The Comptroller and Auditor General commented on one of our reports that looked at the actuarial liability of pensions.  In 2007 public service pensions were estimated at around &euro;115 billion.  In the most recent analysis this figure was down to between &euro;85 billion and &euro;90 billion.

In 2009 the contract was entered into at a fixed price of &euro;19.7 million, plus 21% tax.  What was the contract for?  It was to produce 3 million cards by 2013.  Mr. Watt's Department and the Department of Social Protection were to work together, ag obair as l&aacute;mh a ch&eacute;ile.  That was the target.  Was it reached?  The answer is no.  Have we even reached that target?  The answer is no.  By June 2016 there were 2.6 million cards.  According to the report, the figure is now &euro;60 million.  Mr. Watt might update me, but the current position is that the Department has entered into a contract with a provider.

I am telling him that so far &euro;60 million has been spent and that the 2016 contract provides for an advance payment to be made by the Department of Social Protection in January 2017 of 50% of the outstanding balance.  We will be paying in advance.  The cost of cards produced in 2017 is to be deducted in full from the advance payment.  Should the target of 3 million cards not be reached by the end of 2017, the cost of cards not produced will become payable in full.  It is late, but I cannot accept Mr. Watt telling us that the process is exemplary.  I ask him to look at that comment.  He could not possibly call it exemplary.  There is, however, a bigger issue.  This started as a social welfare card, but it has changed, at huge cost to the taxpayer and with no business case being made in advance.

We are almost done.  <\/p> <p>  I get the point on the public services card.  As I have not yet had to apply for one, everyone has not had to apply.  It started with the Department of Social Protection as a card that was needed or else a person would not receive anything.  It has since moved on and is now required to be issued with a passport or have one renewed.  It is a system that will eventually catch most adults.  If a person does not depend on receiving something from the State, separate from a passport, for now he or she can get by without it, but the need to have a passport will be the hook from which people will not be able to escape.  If a person does not want to have a passport or claim a pension or social welfare payment, he or she will able to survive without it.  That is how I see it.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to Deputy Catherine Connolly's questions, there are benefits to the card, but our job in this committee is to inquire about costs, the contract and lessons to be learned.  There are benefits, but we have to look at something else.

We are talking now about planning, zoning, sites and speeding up the planning process.  That should have been done three years ago at very little cost so that the houses we need now would have been built rather than in the next two or three years.  The housing plan is going out.  The troika left in 2013 and while another country would have planned for the recovery, we made no plans.  We waited till we got to where we are and sat back for two years.  We are two years behind catching up in the housing situation.  I am not saying this is the fault of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but collectively, the Government and the Oireachtas did not plan adequately and we are playing massive catch up and it is getting harder and harder to catch up.<\/p> <p>  As there are no more questions I thank everybody for coming here today.

A comprehensive strategy against organ transplant abuse in China has two prongs: efforts to combat the abuse directly in China and to combat complicity abroad in the abuse in China.  I have ten recommendations addressed to each prong.<\/p> <p>  In terms of efforts to combat abuse in China the foreign policy of Ireland should incorporate these features: organ transplant abuse in China should be condemned; the Irish Government should conduct an investigation into organ transplant abuse in China and international instances should be asked to conduct such an investigation, which request should be made to the Council of Europe, the European Union, the United Nations Human Rights Council and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, with China being asked to provide historical and present death penalty statistics; China should be asked to make publicly accessible its aggregate data from its four transplant registries for heart, liver, lung and kidney; China should be asked to allow independent outside investigators access to hospital patient and organ donor files; China should be asked to allow independent outside investigators access to hospital financial records and in particular, the amounts received from patients for organ transplants and the amounts spent on all pharmaceuticals related to transplantation; China should be asked to allow independent outside investigators to make unannounced visits to transplant hospitals and organ donation centres; China should be asked to allow access to its prisons by the International Committee of the Red Cross; China should be asked to stop the persecution of prisoners of conscience, including specifically Falun Gong, Tibetans, Uighurs and House Christians; and China should be asked to disqualify from the transplant profession any person involved in the persecution of Falun Gong or other prisoners of conscience.<\/p><p> The second prong is governmental policy and parliamentary legislation to avoid complicity in transplant abuse in China.  Legislation combatting complicity in foreign organ transplant abuse should incorporate the following ten features.  Extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction should be enacted to allow prosecution for participation in organ transplant abuse.  The law should allow the courts to assume jurisdiction over any accused within the territory irrespective of the status of the accused in the territory, whether the accused is a citizen, permanent resident or visitor.  A Council of Europe treaty currently commits state parties to enact extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction for nationals but it does not go beyond that to permanent residents or visitors.<\/p><p> Legislation should ban brokerage, advertising, soliciting, trafficking and trading in organ transplantation.  Reporting of transplant tourism by health professionals to the health system should be compulsory.  Aggregate data accumulated from the reporting of transplant tourism should be publicly accessible.  Entry bans should be imposed on those who have been complicit in organ transplant abuse.  The ban should encompass visitors, students and workers, as well as immigrants.<\/p><p> The Government should be mandated to maintain a list of those banned entry because of their participation in organ transplant abuse.  An exception needs to be made to state immunity legislation to allow those acting in an official capacity to be sued civilly for organ transplant abuse.  Both public and private health insurance systems should be prohibited from providing coverage for transplant tourism.  This form of health service should be uninsurable.  Professionals should be subject to disqualification, losing their professional licences for complicity in transplant tourism.  Pharmaceutical companies should be prohibited from engaging in anti-rejection drug trials in China.<\/p><p> Those are my recommendations.  I and other researchers have come to the conclusion we did that organ transplant abuse against prisoners of conscience, primarily Falun Gong, is happening and that no precautions were put in place to prevent it from happening.  Regrettably, that is still largely so.  I submit that Ireland needs to put those precautions in place. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017070600002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Matas","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499329800,"counter":1332,"content":"<p>I understand the members were up a bit late last night.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017070600002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ethan Gutmann"},{"type":"speech","time":1499329800,"counter":1333,"content":"<p>We work late here every night.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017070600002#B00300","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499329800,"counter":1334,"content":"<p>I understand that.  I am rooting for Ireland to get the contract on the Rugby World Cup.<br\/><br\/>Four years ago, I gave testimony to the committee on how the forced organ harvesting of prisoners of conscience evolved from a handful of Uighur political prisoners being exploited for party cadres into a medical procedure employed in every province of China.  Back then - it is wonderful to see familiar faces - I also gave the committee casualty estimates, including 65,000 dead Falun Gong, several thousand Uighurs, Tibetans and house Christians.  In the passion of that moment the committee released a spontaneous statement condemning China for this procedure.  Just outside these doors, people hugged and cried that day.  <br\/><br\/>However, my testimony contained an error.  My casualty estimates and those of my colleagues David Matas and David Kilgour were too conservative.  In 2013, we spoke of tens of thousands murdered by the Chinese state.  Today, we count the deaths in the hundreds of thousands.  In 2013, we accepted Beijing&rsquo;s claim of 10,000 organ transplants per year.  Today, we know that is a lie; our 700-page update published last year presented explicit evidence that annual Chinese transplant volume is 60,000 to 100,000 per year.<br\/><br\/>In Washington DC, three Chinese researchers from the Congressional-Executive Commission on China act as sentries, warding off false information from reaching the US Congress.  After examining our report for six weeks, the researchers delivered the verdict that Congress should hold a hearing.  On the eve of that hearing, the House of Representatives passed a detailed and explicit resolution condemning China&rsquo;s practice of harvesting prisoners of conscience.  Two weeks later the European Parliament passed an identical resolution.  Over the past year, every major Western newspaper has broken their silence on this issue.  <i>The<\/i><i>New York Times<\/i>has had seven articles and counting.  Given this global momentum, why am I in Ireland today?  The answer is that history is not changed by resolutions, but by actions. <br\/><br\/>Back in 2008, one man, a heart surgeon and son of a Holocaust survivor, challenged the Israeli Parliament to ban Israeli citizens from going to China for organ transplants and that parliament did so.  Spain followed.  In 2015 Taiwan did so.  In 2016 Italy did so.  One might ask what these countries have in common.  Integrity is one aspect, as is a highly developed sense of tragedy and the historical wisdom to know that the big players - the US, UK and so forth - may not interfere with an ongoing crime against humanity.  We cannot leave it up to them.  None of these states paid any measurable price in terms of contracts with China or even in their relationships with China.  I would be happy to answer questions on that.<br\/><br\/>This is an ongoing slaughter.  In two high-profile conferences, including at the Vatican itself, Beijing pushed the line that Chinese harvesting of prisoner organs is pretty much over and done with.  Neither attempt persuaded the conference, the press or, at the Vatican conference, the Pope, because he did not address the conference as he was scheduled to do.<br\/><br\/>David Matas, David Kilgour and I see no reform.  Instead, we see an $8 billion to $9 billion Chinese transplant industry engaged in business as usual.  We see a British architectural firm, TFP Ryder Healthcare, intending to build an organ-harvesting centre in Dalian, one of the most notorious organ harvesting locations in China.  It is also the origins of the body show that is currently in Dublin.  Human Rights Watch sees a comprehensive Chinese attempt to gather the DNA of the entire Uighur population of Xinjiang.  Those DNA samples can then be used for tissue matching the organs of 15 million highly vulnerable people.  We can no longer rule out the unthinkable.  My name is Gutmann, so I do not take comparisons to the Holocaust lightly, but the phrase &ldquo;Final Solution&rdquo; persistently enters my mind and I suspect that phrase also occurred to many of the committee members just now. <br\/><br\/>What does this mean for Ireland?  It means that if it is going to act, this is the critical moment to do so.  I ask the committee members to seriously consider introducing some sort of ban regarding organ tourism to China or anywhere else we suspect illegal organ transplants are taking place.

Born to the Chinese society, born straight into the washing machine and having one's brain washed from the very beginning, one then became a fully programmed member of the society, ready to fulfil the task ahead without asking why.  This is the society created by George Orwell in his novel <i>1984<\/i>, but in the real world.<br\/><br\/>Rumour of organ thieves can be traced back to 1990.  I was then a young, energetic physician, an oncologist surgeon with a bright future in the society, working in the central railway hospital of &Uuml;r&uuml;mqi.  During my time in our outpatient department, I saw at least three children with a scar on their bodies, indicating an organ had been stolen. <br\/><br\/>In 1995, it came to my turn to do it.  It was a Wednesday, my two chief surgeons called me into their office and told me to assemble a team with the capability of the largest possible surgery and report to them on the morning of the next day.  At 9.30 a.m. next day, we met at the hospital gate and headed towards the western mountain execution ground, where I was told to wait for them until hearing the gunshots.<\/p><p>After the gunshots were heard, we rushed in.  An armed officer directed us to the far-right corner, where I could see a male in civilian clothes lying on the ground with a single bullet wound to his right chest.  My chief surgeons ordered me to extract the liver and two kidneys.  The man was alive and tried to resist my scalpel cut but was too weak to avoid my action.  There was bleeding.  He was still alive but I did not feel guilty.  In fact, I did not feel anything but like a fully programmed robot doing its task.  I believed I was carrying out my duty to eliminate the enemy of the state.  After the operation, the chief surgeons took organs to strange-looking boxes and told me to take my team back to the hospital and remember nothing happened.  I followed the order.  We never talked about it.<\/p><p> It is not acceptable that a normal buy-one-get-one-free shopping pattern can be seen in organ transplantation.  A predetermined date for one's heart transplantation means that someone has been made dead for one.  Giving away organs to promote business means there are plenty of organs.  An unlimited supply of organs can be achieved only if those organs are carried in living bodies and are waiting to be taken on demand.<\/p><p> News broke last June that the Chinese Communist Party, CCP, is giving Uighur people in Xinjiang a free national health check-up.  With no explanation, we suspect that the CCP is building the national database for organ trade.  It is also widely reported that the CCP is carrying out DNA tests in the region with the stated objective of improving the quality of life for the Uighurs.  I believe this is a lie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017070600002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Enver Tohti Bughda","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499329800,"counter":1337,"content":"<p>Many thanks to the committee for hearing our statements today.  I am a transplant surgeon in Belfast.  Organ transplantation saves many lives but there is a big problem with inequality of access to organs in addition to a lack of organs.  That is a problem in both the developed and developing world.  Kidney, liver, lung, pancreas and heart transplants were once experimental treatments but they are now very much mainstream in medical practice.  There is a movement to incorporate tissue donations, such as face and arm transplants.  In spite of successful moves to increase organ donation rates, waiting lists for organs in Ireland and throughout the world continue to grow.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland last year, 280 transplants were carried out.  There are currently approximately 650 people on the waiting list.  The committee will hear more about that from Dr. O'Seaghdha shortly.  People die waiting for organs.  Quality of life while waiting is often very poor because of the severe symptoms of end-stage organ failure, including renal, heart and liver failure.  These difficult circumstances place enormous strain on families and patients and can give rise to relationship breakups, job loss and many other problems.<\/p> <p>  The waiting time for organs varies from country to country.  Depending on the organ, it is typically between one to five years.  Between 5% and 20% of patients die waiting for organs.  This very poor outlook and the very poor quality of life drive many people waiting for organs to seek them from sources other than the deceased donor waiting list.  For kidneys, live donation from a family member or friend is a possibility but this fails to meet excess demand for organs.  Some people have sought to obtain transplants through organ trafficking or transplant tourism.  Unscrupulous medical teams and middlemen brokers exploit vulnerable donors and recipients for selfish profit.<\/p> <p>  China has been a major hub for transplant tourism for several years.  Other hotbeds for this criminal practice include Pakistan, Egypt and India.  At present, with the considerable amount of people trafficking through Libya, vulnerable individuals are exploited and sent to Egypt in order to pay for passage across to Europe on boats.  China is unique among all these countries in executing prisoners for the sale of organs.  Members of several ethnic and faith groups have been imprisoned for their beliefs and callously executed for their use of organs in transplant operations.  This arguably constitutes a crime against humanity and must be condemned in the strongest terms.  China sent two surgeons to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences' Summit on Organ Trafficking and Transplant Tourism in February 2017, which I attended.  They openly admitted to the unethical execution of prisoners for organs.  They described efforts in China to reduce the number of these executions but highlighted the difficulties in policing the laws in such a massive country.<\/p> <p>  Ireland must take a very critical stance during diplomacy with China in light of its horrific human rights abuses.  Transplant tourism must be considered a crime, with prosecution of all involved parties.  Global attention needs to be drawn to this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017070600002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. James McDaid"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499329800,"counter":1338,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this important Oireachtas hearing on organ tourism, forced organ harvesting and trafficking in human organs.  I am the medical director of the National Kidney Transplant Service in Ireland.  My clinical specialty is transplant nephrologist, which is a medical consultant with expertise in kidney transplantation.  All kidney transplantation in the Republic of Ireland is performed by the National Kidney Transplant Service, based in Beaumont Hospital, where I work.  Last year, 172 kidney transplants were performed in the Republic of Ireland, comprising 50 living donor kidney transplants and 122 deceased donor transplants.  As of the beginning of last month, there were 439 people on the kidney transplant waiting list in the Republic of Ireland, with a further 18 on the kidney-pancreas or heart-kidney waiting lists and an additional 87 people temporarily suspended from the waiting list for clinical or personal reasons.  In total, there are 544 on the waiting list.<\/p> <p>  Due to welcome improvements in road safety and neurosurgical care, the rate of deceased organ donation has been steadily decreasing.  The average waiting time for a deceased donor kidney transplant is currently 35 months.  This datum is very skewed, however.  Some patients on the list have been waiting over ten years, with little prospect of receiving suitable kidneys.  The median waiting time, or the time by which half of the people on the waiting list have a transplant, is currently 19 months, which again underscores the skewed nature of the data.<\/p> <p>  While we have no official data on transplant tourism from Ireland, I can confirm there have been cases where patients resident in Ireland underwent kidney transplantations foreign countries and returned to Ireland for their post-transplant care.  For the most part, these were patients born outside Ireland who travelled to their region of ethnicity for transplants and returned to Ireland for care afterwards.  We are aware, however, of at least one case of an Irish citizen having engaged in transplant tourism also.<\/p> <p>  I wish to add my voice to those condemning the practice of transplant tourism globally and, in particular, I call for an end to the obscene practice of live organ harvesting in China.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017070600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conall O'Seaghdha"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499329800,"counter":1339,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman, Deputy Brendan Smith, the Vice Chairman, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, and the members for having us today.  On behalf of the Falun Dafa Association of Ireland and all Falun Gong practitioners in Ireland, I acknowledge the help, kindness and compassion of the Irish people and Government over the past 18 years during the inexplicable and barbaric persecution of almost 100 million people in China.  We have outside this room today over 50,000 petition signatures, collected mainly last year but also in previous years on the streets of Dublin and of various other cities and towns throughout Ireland.  They are collected by my fellow practitioners, some of whom are sitting here and others of whom sit outside the gate in all weather, including heavy rain, cold, storms and baking sun.  This petition came from selfless people who made a stand during this very dark hour for humanity.  We dearly request - I was told this is not possible - that the signatures be handed to the Government.  We presented the Government with many other signatures in previous years.<\/p><p>The petition demonstrates the peaceful appeal made by Falun Gong practitioners in Ireland and elsewhere.<\/p><p> One of two most commonly asked questions when we meet people is what is Falun Gong.  Falun Gong is an ancient Chinese spiritual discipline that teaches people to follow the principles of truth, compassion and forbearance.  We do five gentle exercises to make people fit and healthy.  However, under the dictatorship of the communist party, large groups are not allowed to adhere to any ideology other than communism.  For this reason, Falun Gong was banned in China on 20 July 1999 and nobody is allowed to practise it.  The government estimated that between 70 million and 100 million people were practising Falun Gong by 1999.  Many practitioners have been locked up in labour camps, prisons and brainwashing classes.  These provide a possible source of organs, an issue about which the other respected guests spoke.<\/p><p> Besides organ harvesting, other forms of persecution and torture are also practised.  Some members may be familiar with the case of Mr. Zhao Ming, a gentleman in the Gallery, on whose behalf we had a major campaign seeking his freedom.  Mr. Ming was locked up in a labour camp for almost two years when he visited China on holiday and during that time, he was subject to various means of torture, which included sleep deprivation and the use of electric batons.  He is only one of more than 1 million people who have been persecuted and he is lucky to be sitting in the Gallery today.  We were able to secure his return because he was studying in Trinity College and had a connection to Ireland.  Many other vulnerable, innocent Chinese people who are engaged in harmless practice have no way to have their voices heard.  I refer in particular to those whose organs have been harvested. <\/p><p> I thank the committee and hope it will be able to do something.  Ireland has helped a great deal already by securing the return of Mr. Ming and another student who is not present today.  The joint committee has also held a number of hearings at which Falun Gong representatives have made presentations.  We are very thankful for all the help we have received.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017070600002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Dongxue Dai","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499329800,"counter":1341,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for their presentations.

He indicated this morning that he underestimated the numbers of victims of this particular practice at that time.<\/p><p>Mr. Bughda used the phrase &quot;buy one get one free&quot;.  In civilised society, we never thought such a phrase would be applicable to human organs.

We have heard testimony on this matter previously.  When I first heard of it, I was shocked and did not believe that any human being would do this to another.  Maybe I was a bit naive about whether a country would do this to its citizens.  Even the associated language appals me - \"organ tourism\".  I know of people who travel abroad to get dental treatment or have operations, such as facelifts, done.  That is common, but we are discussing someone travelling abroad for a transplant not knowing, or maybe not wanting to know, from where the organ came.<\/p> <p>  I know people who have donated kidneys, for example.  A colleague - a councillor out my way - donated a kidney to a friend of his this year.  A close friend of mine died while awaiting an organ transplant.

How would that work?  The witnesses gave examples of other countries having done this.  People can genuinely claim to be travelling on a tourist visa, but an onus arises when they return seeking treatment.  How would that work physically?  How can it be inserted into law?<\/p> <p>  Although I asked this question previously, people at home will want to know the answer.  Is this just happening to Falun Gong practitioners in China?  I believe not, but the witnesses might explain whether it is happening to other political prisoners as well, for example, the Uyghur minority and Tibetans.<\/p> <p>  Does China allow the Red Cross to visit prisoners in jail?  Could the Red Cross play a role in stopping this?<\/p> <p>  We have a note asserting that China has embarked on reforms of organ donation and is stamping out illegal and unethical practices.  I have been told that the embassy here is in co-operation with other EU states and is supposedly monitoring these reform efforts.  What does that entail exactly?<\/p> <p>  The British firm TFP Ryder Healthcare intends to build an organ harvesting centre in Dalian, which was referred to as one of the most notorious areas for organ harvesting.  Can any legal action be taken in that regard?<\/p> <p>  I am conscious that many of those involved are travelling out of desperation and want themselves or loved ones to stay alive, but what can we do to close off that option?  The moral argument is probably lost on them.  If people break a legislative embargo, should they be sent to jail or fined?  What is the ultimate sanction?<\/p> <p>  I am sickened to my stomach by the idea of organ harvesting.  I presume that is why some of our members are missing.  There is a sense of disbelief.  The idea that anyone would do this to another individual is immoral and all of those words.

There is much misinformation on this globally and this has been something that the Chinese state has encouraged.  There is much talk about organ brokers and the shadowy criminal network operating in this area.  There is one, and it is called the Internet.  It is that simple.  If members do not believe me, they can go onto the Internet, type \"help, I need a liver\" in Google and within the first 20 response they will find a website which changes constantly, but is always there, and which has a discussion board involving people who have had transplants or are looking to have one.  Very quickly, one will find advice that a person can go to Tianjin central.  That is not surprising because the Chinese were advertising Tianjin central on the web for years.  They only stopped in 2014 because it became such a major issue and it was a huge embarrassment that this advertisement was up there.<\/p> <p>  We estimate that Tianjin Central hospital does over 5,000 transplants each year.  This is half of what the Chinese claim they do annually, in just one hospital.  They speak English.  Everyone will say that and the message board is one of two sources that one will find this information.  It is that simple.  If one can come up with the money, they can secure the transplant in record time.  In other countries, one can find kidneys because people will sell a single kidney but it is only in China where they can come up with a liver.  It has been documented in around 25 cases that it can be done within four hours.  No one can live without a liver and there is no way to come up with a liver unless one has a living human being, or should I say, a huge stable of living human beings, where they have all been tissue matched, are ready to go and someone can come in and get that organ within several hours.  The warm ischemia time, the time when an organ is being transferred from one person to another, is estimated to be two minutes or zero in most cases of these emergency liver transplants.<\/p> <p>  This is more evidence of something the committee has heard from Dr. Enver Thohti Bughda, that this is done while people are alive.  There is not a huge mystery about organ tourism; it is an intentional piece of monkey dust which the Chinese have thrown up about this.  I do not doubt that one can go to Egypt and get a kidney.  I do not doubt that there are several countries in the world where one can do that but there are only two countries that harvest political and religious prisoners and they are the People's Republic of China and ISIS.  I do not recommend the hotel facilities in Syria right now.  It is true that there is a bigger problem overall, but this goes beyond it.  We are not merely looking at Falun Gong but Uyghurs, Tibetans, and House Christians.  The Uyghurs may be coming online with DNA testing, which is also tissue matching testing, but it has dual purpose.  It tells us that the Uyghur population, the Muslims of China, are suddenly under great threat when millions of them have been DNA tested.  The Chinese say it is for their health but we cannot believe that.  There may be many purposes, and we can discuss that further, but there is no question that there are still prisoners who are being harvested for their organs.<\/p> <p>  We do not know the exact percentages but anyone who has been close to the data in the way that myself, David Matas and David Kilgour have, has concluded that they are mainly prisoners of conscience.  They are often arrested without any due process whatever.  They cannot be charged with any capital crimes and in the case of Falun Gong they are absolutely non-violent.  Often, they are people who are not even on the books and are being put to death.  This is where this huge pool of organs is coming from.  I would like to say that this is science fiction but I was here in 2013 and I am afraid that the evidence has become exponentially worse and more explicit since  then and that is why we are starting to see the reaction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017070600002#F00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ethan Gutmann"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499329800,"counter":1354,"content":"<p>One should bear in mind that Chinese society is one which believes the body is taken to the next world, and they do not want the body to be taken apart.

There has been, both in China and abroad.  Mr. Gutmann mentioned four countries which have enacted legislation, and that is some progress.  There are other signs of progress also.  Within China, legislation has been enacted which made promises, and gave priority to locals.  The trouble is that it has not solved the problem and it has not been comprehensive.  Before there was nothing, and now there is something, but we still have the problem.  Mr. Gutmann answered the question about advertising.  On the role of international organisations on international crime, the Council of Europe has come up with a treaty and the World Health Organisation has stated some principles.  The UN rapporteur on torture and religious intolerance has put questions to China at the UN committee against torture, and asked China to conduct an international investigation.  Generally, when one is dealing with international crime, there is a legal principle of complementarity which means that states should do it locally first.  I do not think that we should be relying entirely on international organisations to deal with this issue.  The first line of defence for international crime should be states rather than international organisations.<\/p> <p>  On the role of international medical organisations, the transplantation societies developed a couple of good policies, one on China and another on sourcing organs from prisoners, but the first line of defence should be a national transplantation society.  What I see with national transplantation societies is that their ethical systems are underdeveloped to deal with this issue.  They do not deal comprehensively with transplant tourism.  Those need to be developed.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Crowe's question about the onus is an important one.  The onus should be first on China to explain its source of organs and anyone dealing with China should be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that its source of organs is proper.  That is not now the case, rather there is much wilful blindness, which is a problem.  <\/p> <p>  On how a ban on travel would work, I am not in favour of putting patients in jail.  What one needs to do is get at the brokers and advertising.  This is a point that Senator McFadden made, that there has to be as much public education as possible.  A number of city councils in Ireland have passed resolutions on this which is very useful in public education.  The health Ministry could be doing more and the foreign Ministry could do more about alerting people about what happens.<\/p><p>Again, the profession could be alerting people more.  How many doctors tell their patients that if they go to China there is a risk that somebody will be killed for his or her organs?<\/p><p> On the question of whether the Red Cross visits prisoners in jail, the answer is that they are not allowed to do so.  At one time a Chinese official said they could, but when the Red Cross tried to arrange a visit it was not allowed.  In regard to legal action against a British firm, I am a lawyer so I cannot answer that question.  The problem is that legislation that would prevent something like this happening locally is not extraterritorial in effect.  What Ireland, Britain and other countries need to do is put in place legislation that allows for extraterritorial rights such that they can impact upon things that locals are doing outside of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017070600002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Matas","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499329800,"counter":1359,"content":"<p>Would anyone else like to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017070600002#G00150","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499329800,"counter":1360,"content":"<p>On Deputy Crowe's question of how one human being could do this to another human being, from my perspective the problem is the brainwashing machine of the Communist Party.

When doctors previously did the harvesting they did not feel guilty because they were only carrying out a task but nowadays they are paid large sums of money for doing so.  Following the destruction of traditional culture and several political movements, including cultural revolution, the former party leader encouraged everybody to make money.

I cannot speak knowledgeably about that except to say that I know of a patient of Egyptian origin who returned to Egypt to receive a kidney transplant this year.  The matter of mandatory reporting is complex.  Any legislation around that would need to take into account that there are some circumstances where patients can legitimately return to their country of origin for transplantation.  The usual story we are told is that their brother or other family member is living in Pakistan, Nigeria and so on and they have to return home to have their transplantation.  There is some complexity around this.  It is not possible as a physician to tease that out.  There are also circumstances where patients can legitimately travel to other countries.  We have an organ sharing programme and we have a paired exchange kidney programme which we are currently setting up with Belfast.  Paired exchange arises when a person wishes to donate a kidney to a spouse but cannot do so for immunological reasons and a similar pair exists such that we can swap organs.  For this to function well, we need a large pool of patients to draw from.  We have a memorandum of understanding with Belfast, which is being drafted.  In circumstances where that arises, patients will legitimately travel to receive transplants.

The Pope, in a statement he made a couple of years ago, said that he wanted to do his best to stamp out people trafficking and, as an aside, organ trafficking.  This is what gave rise to the summit in the Vatican.  With regard to China's role in the summit, it was steeped in controversy in that from the outset there were questions about whether the Chinese should even have been invited to the summit, against the background that China, Egypt, Pakistan and India are countries that are deeply involved in organ trafficking.  There was no controversy around inviting delegates from India and Pakistan but there was a big question about whether the Chinese should have been invited.  Earlier, Mr. Gutmann made the point that the Pope was supposed to address the summit and meet with us all but he pulled out at the last minute because of controversy over the Chinese.  He did not want to be seen to be endorsing the Chinese visit or to be photographed with them.  The Chinese presented their data.  I spoke briefly afterwards with the Deputy Health Minister, Huang Jiefu.  In their statement they admitted that they have been executing prisoners for organs in China.  They would not be drawn on prisoners of conscience, Falun Gong, and so on but they admitted to large-scale execution of prisoners.  The summit was shocked by this, understandably, and people condemned it.  It was the one time in the summit when one could palpably feel the temperature was rising.  People were arguing and questioning the Chinese delegates and they did not really believe what they were saying.  The Chinese said that they have now made it illegal and they are trying to stamp it out but that it is difficult to police with so many hospitals and so on involved.  They were met with a lot of scepticism and condemnation.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Egyptian situation, there have been many reports recently about Libya being a hot bed of people trafficking.  Many refugees from Syria travel to Libya to get transport to Europe on inflatable boats, as a result of which thousands of people have died.  In addition, thousands of economic migrants from Sudan, Somalia and Nigeria are congregating in Libya, which right now is a country without a Government.  It is lawless and akin to the wild west.  The people from Syria and the economic refugees from North Africa pay enormous amounts of money to people traffickers to get passage to Europe.  When they arrive in Libya to get on the boats to cross the Mediterranean the people traffickers ask for further payment.  When the refugees point out that they already paid in Syria or Sudan for passage to Italy the traffickers tell them that they cannot get on the boats unless they pay again or, that if they donate a kidney it would pay passage for five people, the refugee and four members of his or her family.  They do not do the organ harvesting in Libya.  It is done in Egypt where there is a better developed health care system.  In Egypt their organs are harvested for local people or paying foreign people.  Interestingly, the European Union has a special prosecutor in Libya, an Irish man named Aonghus Kelly, who is working on this issue.  I told him I was coming here and he is very keen to get involved.  I can pass on his contact details to the committee if it is interested in furthering the Egyptian transplant tourism issue.  The big difference between Egypt, Pakistan and China is that in China this is veiled in secrecy but in Egypt and Pakistan the cases have been uncovered, reported in the press and people have been arrested.  Many of surgeons and physicians have been put in jail in Egypt but in China organ harvesting is veiled in secrecy, the media is suppressed and so it is difficult to know what is going on there. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017070600002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. James McDaid"},{"type":"speech","time":1499329800,"counter":1363,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McDaid for his contribution.

My name is Sam Taylor and I am the director of M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, Doctors Without Borders, in Ireland.  I am joined by Dr. Conor Kenny, who has recently returned from one of our vessels in the central Mediterranean.  M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res is an independent, medical, humanitarian organisation that delivers emergency aid to people affected by armed conflict, epidemics, natural disasters and exclusion from health care.  We offer assistance based on need, irrespective of race, religion, ideology or political affiliations and our actions are guided by medical ethics and the principles of neutrality and impartiality.  We are 96% funded by private donors and do not rely on government funds for our activities.  We opened our office in Ireland in 2006 and to date have placed more than 150 Irish staff in MSF projects all around the world, from Afghanistan to Uganda.  We go where we are needed, to where the patients are.  Unfortunately, that now includes the Mediterranean Sea.<br\/><br\/>MSF started its search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean in April 2015, following the decision of the European Union and Italy to discontinue Mare Nostrum, the joint large-scale search and rescue mission led by the Italian Navy.  At the time, it appeared that Europe was prepared to let many people fleeing war, poverty and oppression die at sea.  We in MSF took the difficult decision that we could not stand back and watch from the shore as thousands of men, women and children drowned while trying to reach Europe.  Death at sea continues at an alarming rate and the numbers of deaths are comparable to what M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res is used to seeing in the war zones in which we operate.<br\/><br\/>Our work, responding to displacement in Europe over the past two years, has led us to set up projects in the south of the continent as well as along what became known as the Balkan route.  From reception centres to refugee camps, we have established projects to respond to the health and medical needs of people on the move.  While the recent EU-Turkey deal has meant that fewer people are attempting the journey along the Balkan route, the journey has only become more dangerous for people still attempting to cross.  To date, MSF teams in the central Mediterranean have rescued or assisted over 30,000 people in distress on over 200 operations.  In 2017 alone, we have rescued and assisted more than 9,000 individuals.<br\/><br\/>According to data from the International Organization for Migration, IOM, the number of people who died trying to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean has reached an all-time high with over 5,000 reported deaths in 2016.  This year is shaping up to be another deadly year, with more than 2,170 deaths so far, according to the IOM.  However, these figures betray the reality of this crisis as the actual number of deaths is likely to be much worse.  We have no idea how many dinghies overloaded with terrified passengers set sail from Libya in the direction of Italy each day and sink without trace.  This morning, Dr. Conor Kenny, an MSF Ireland field worker who spent three months on board our vessel, the <i>MV Aquarius<\/i>, in the central Mediterranean, will outline his very difficult and challenging first-hand experiences of providing medical care to those rescued aboard the vessel.<br\/><br\/>Last week, the Italian Government signalled to the European Commission that it may move to block foreign-flagged vessels from docking in Italian ports due to the strain on their systems coping with the rescues.  Search and rescue is a desperately needed emergency response but our work at sea is just a sticking plaster on a gaping wound.  Our search and rescue operation is not the solution to this ongoing crisis, nor is it the cause, as some have claimed.  After Dr. Kenny&rsquo;s testimony, we will briefly conclude by outlining a number of our key concerns related to search and rescue operations for this committee to take into consideration, before we open the floor to any questions members may have.<br\/><br\/>Once again, I thank the committee for this timely opportunity and I ask Dr. Kenny to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017070600002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sam Taylor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499329800,"counter":1370,"content":"<p>My name is Dr. Conor Kenny and I come from County Sligo.  I have been qualified as a medical doctor for four years with interests mainly in general medicine.  From February to May 2017, I was part of the M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res medical team on board the <i>MV Aquarius<\/i>, located in international waters, patrolling at 25 nautical miles from the coast of Libya.  I served as the ship&rsquo;s medical doctor, alongside a small medical team comprised of one midwife and two nurses.  I will speak about my work and experience on this MSF assignment, detailing how we conduct rescues in the central Mediterranean, the medical care we provide and the recent developments and areas of concern.<br\/><br\/>We existed in a world of two extremes aboard the ship.  My team and I would spend days at a time diligently watching the seas and running near-daily medical drills, ensuring that we were fully prepared for the next emergency rescue.  Then, upon receiving instruction from the Italian maritime rescue co-ordination centre, MRCC, we would enter an intense 72-hour period involving rescue, provision of care and safe disembarkation.  I would repeat this process many times during my three and a half month assignment in the central Mediterranean.<\/p><p>Images of my experience there can be found at the end of the document distributed.  <br\/><br\/>Typically, as the ship&rsquo;s medic, my initial role in a rescue was that of first response.  That means that I would go with a rigid hull inflatable boat, RHIB, to the vessel in distress.  Next to the boat in distress and from the RHIB, I would survey the scene and prioritise the people we rescue first, focusing on those who are seriously unwell, as well as children and women.  Sadly, the sickest are usually the ones one cannot see, often lying on the floor of the overfilled boat.  Retrieving these people from their boat may often be complicated because they may be panicked, for example, if their boat is sinking.  This may lead to crush situations or even capsizing.  Throughout this process I was in constant contact with the rest of the team aboard the <i>MV Aquarius<\/i>which allowed us to prepare the necessary medical response back on boat based on their health needs.  This could include a mass casualty response or a multiple casualty response.  From the point of rescue to disembarkation, we responded to whatever medical needs arose from emergency care to outpatient consultations.  As one can imagine, demand was high and we got very little sleep over the usual 72-hour period between rescue and disembarkation.  During this time in the MSF clinic, I treated wounds, broken bones were set, and we provided psychological first aid.  Sometimes babies were born. <br\/><br\/>The majority of our rescued patients were suffering from hypothermia, dehydration and exhaustion when they reached us and often had been severely burned by the gasoline used to power these boats' engines.  It is important to note that when the fuel powering the engines mixes with the seawater, it turns into a highly corrosive and hazardous substance.  Many of those who ended up in my clinic had been forced to sit in this substance, often resulting in severe burns to their genitalia.  Many had also swallowed and inhaled the toxic liquid mix into their lungs during a drowning process.  One occasion that sticks in my mind is the attempt my team and I made to resuscitate an unconscious young women who had been brought on deck by staff on one of our RHIBs.  As I approached her the toxic smell of the gasoline fumes emerged from the patient as I noticed that the skin on the right side of her face had dissolved in the fuel.  Tragically, resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful and this young woman died.  On closer examination this facial burn extended the length of her thorax to the bottom of her chest.  Clearly she had been face down in the fuel lining the base of the rubber boat she was in.  This is an horrific way to drown. <br\/><br\/>The other types of medical conditions we were faced with in the medical clinic include respiratory tract disease, gastrointestinal tract disease and trauma.  The greater part of people on board the boat had been subject to, or had witnessed, physical, and in some cases sexual, violence while in Libya and presented with the marks and scars of those abuses.  They often spoke to us about this abuse, which they had suffered at the hands of smugglers, armed groups and private individuals in Libya when they were on the boat.  Here, many told us stories of how they were bought and sold on trade markets as a commodity, working in hellish conditions as labourers without payment.  I have heard testimony from many patients who were duped into working in Libya, seemingly offered good jobs there where they would have the opportunity to send money to their families at home.  However, in reality, Libya is not a functioning state.  With three competing governments and virtually no rule of law, many people whose final destination was to be Libya and not Europe, are rounded up by the state security forces and other armed groups and forced into detention centres and asked to work off unreasonable sums for their freedom.  Some are then forced onto boats and into the sea, while others view it as their only chance of escape from what they told us is a slavery-type situation and the violence they face if they stay in Libya.  <br\/><br\/>One such story that sticks with me is that of three boys we rescued in April.  Incredibly, once taken on board, two of the boys recognised a medical nurse on the ship who had treated them as small children in the Darfur region back in 2003.  Fourteen years later they told us the harrowing story of how they had ended up in the Mediterranean Sea.  Two of the boys, Samir and Abbas - which is not his real name - had at the age of 17 left the conflict in Darfur to seek out a better life working in the Libyan economy.  They told us about how they had left Darfur with many others, travelling through Sudan and into Libya.  Things began to go wrong when after a number of days on the road, their Libyan driver shot dead a fellow passenger following an argument.  Furthermore, their driver was overheard making numerous phone calls, auctioning them and their fellow travellers to prospective buyers in Libya.  After a number of hours they heard that they were to be sold for &euro;70 each based on their physical attributes such as their height and muscle mass.  After reaching Libya they were sold on to different owners many times in the coming months, enduring regular beatings and abuse at the hands of their captors.  It was when they were auctioned for the third time that they met the third boy, Ahmed.  After 50 days together and again facing severe abuse, the three boys, along with others, found an opportunity to escape from where they were being held.  However, as they made their dash to freedom a neighbour of their captor spotted the attempted escape and fired at them as they fled, hitting Ahmed in the leg.  Samir and Abbas, who had now evaded capture, reached a market in Tripoli.  Adamant that they would not leave Ahmed behind, they found a Sudanese man who helped them by raising enough money within the Sudanese community in Tripoli to buy both the freedom of Ahmed, as well as their escape into the central Mediterranean. <br\/><br\/>There have been worrying recent developments at sea involving unsafe behaviour of those identified as the Libyan Coast Guard.  On 23 May this year, my colleagues aboard the<i>MV Aquarius<\/i>reported that while we had a rescue operation under way a boat with men identifying themselves as Libyan Coast Guard approached one the boats in distress we were assisting, intimidating the passengers and firing their guns in the air.  Armed and in uniform, members of the Libyan Coast Guard then proceeded to board one of the rubber boats.  They took phones, money and other belongings from the passengers.  They attached a line to one rubber dinghy and towed it back towards Libyan waters.  The testimony of the survivors of this encounter paints a worrying picture.  According to one of the people on board one of these boats:<\/p><blockquote>When the Libyans pointed their weapons at us, asking us to give them all our money and cell phones and telling us to jump in the water, we did what they said and many of us jumped in.  I was not afraid.  I preferred to die at sea rather than being repressed and to die in Libya.<\/blockquote><p>Fortunately many had already received their life jackets from the MSF rescue team before they jumped into the sea out of fear that the Libyan Coast Guard would again fire into the air.  Our teams pulled 67 people from the water.  The behaviour of the Libyan Coast Guard was reckless, if not directly threatening to the people on the boats, and it is a miracle no one drowned or was injured.  We know that predominantly, those returned to Libya by the Libyan Coast Guard are taken to detention centres where they are held in inhumane conditions.  The fact that the Libyan Coast Guard has been in receipt of training and support to build its capacity from the European Union makes the incident all the more disturbing and casts a shadow on the training provided by the European Union.  While countries have a right to have a coast guard and to engage in their missions, we would flag this recent worrying incident that put people in great danger. <br\/><br\/>From my testimony as outlined this morning, it is clear to see why people are looking to flee Libya.  They need help and safety regardless of where they come from or what took them to Libya in the first place.  It appears to be a place of extreme danger with no rule of law.  We must make every effort to make it clear.  Ireland needs to know that returning people to Libya, within this context and in this way, is simply not an option.  This humanitarian crisis will continue in the central Mediterranean.  There needs to be some solution found, and NGOs and we in MSF are not it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017070600002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor Kenny","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499329800,"counter":1372,"content":"<p>On the basis on Dr. Kenny&rsquo;s testimony this morning and MSF&rsquo;s continued search and rescue in the Central Mediterranean, we wish to conclude by highlighting our key concerns and conclusions for the committee&rsquo;s consideration.

Yesterday morning, I listened to the Italian ambassador on the radio.  He spoke about the difficulty facing the Italian people due to the number of refugees coming from Libya directly to Sicily and Italy.  The Italians are threatening to refuse entry to NGO charity boats to ports in Italy.  Will this include the MSF boats and what will that mean for its work?<\/p> <p>  Italy is rightly angry about the EU countries' lack of solidarity and so forth.  I have mentioned that at other meetings, including at yesterday's meeting of the European affairs committee when this matter arose.  The Italians are saying that some of the charity boats are acting as a pull factor and some of them are going into Libyan waters and so forth.  The witness says that MSF's boat is 25 miles off the coast.  When these boats are seen by people on the Libyan coast, do they act as a type of beacon or attraction?  How do the witnesses respond to the Italian concerns in that regard?  The Italians say that the majority of the people are not coming from areas of conflict but are economic migrants.  In some cases they are not co-operating with other EU countries with regard to moving forward.  What should Ireland be doing about those refugees?  Should we increase the number we are taking?  I believe we took three from Italy last year.  Clearly, the system is flawed and is not working.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses appeared before the committee earlier to discuss organ transplants.  One of the doctors from Ireland spoke about the link between stealing organs and refugees.  Have the witnesses encountered that in their work?  The doctor said there is a clear link between people from Libya going to Egypt and then being allowed on the boats.  Have the witnesses seen that?<\/p> <p>  I saw photographs of the so-called detention centres run by the Libyans, basically armed militias.  The witness said there are three disputed powers, but they are effectively armed militias on the ground.  Hundreds of people are crammed into overcrowded centres.  What is MSF's view of the European response of sending people back to Libya?<\/p> <p>  The witness mentioned the work of the Libyan coastguard.  What is its official role?  Is it its role to bring people back or to stop people leaving the coast?  Part of its role appears to be to rob people.  Members of the coastguard are on very bad pay.  Do the witnesses believe EU member states should be supporting the Libyan coast guard in any way considering its record of abuse?<\/p> <p>  With regard to the military response, there is talk that EU ships will move away from search and rescue missions to carrying out military missions.  What is the witness's view on that?  I recall David Cameron talking about going in to take out the traffickers, boats and so forth.  How do the witnesses think that will impact on the refugees who are vulnerable?<\/p> <p>  The witness referred to a legal and safe pathway.  Should that be in Libya or in some of the countries where the refugees come from?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017070600002#N00200","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1499329800,"counter":1375,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  The representatives of the earlier group painted a picture of people arriving after giving all their money to get on the boat and then being asked for more money, and the way they could pay this was through donating a kidney or whatever.  It is opportune, therefore, that MSF is appearing before us now.<\/p> <p>  I was fortunate to be able to watch the film last night.  I saw in that what the witnesses spoke about today.  The witnesses spoke about the range of injuries.  Obviously, the physical injuries are dealt with on the spot but there are also psychological effects.  There are people who were tortured, sexually violated and raped.  Is MSF able to do follow-up work?  I realise that must be difficult, but it is aware of the people who need the psychological and mental health care afterwards.  It was interesting to see the party after 72 hours and how MSF presented it.  When they had gone through the initial trauma they were able to sing and dance on the boat.  Human resilience is something else.  It appears that these migrants are just left on the boats to drift and that there is nobody in charge of the boats.  That is another extremely dangerous situation.  When the film showed the middle of the boat beginning to sink one can imagine people's terror that they were going to drown.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps the witnesses would outline their knowledge of the slave markets in Libya.  I raised this as a Topical Issue some time ago.  It is incredible that we are relying on Libya to deal with this when the country is in turmoil.  It does not have basic necessities for its citizens and its economy is in danger of collapse, yet we have turned to it to deal with it.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is that when Libya was a very rich country a number of people came to that country to work in the oilfields.  We mention them but we need to know more about them.  They are mainly from other African countries but at some point they would have had a quite decent standard of living in Libya.  They are part of the migrant issue now.<\/p> <p>  I have a general question about co-ordination of services.  The work of M&eacute;dicins San Fronti&egrave;res is amazing, but there are other organisations in place.  Are the organisations coming together on that and on where we go from here?  The awful question must be asked: why are people being rescued?  I have heard some of them say that they would prefer to die by drowning in the Mediterranean than deal with what some of them are going to face.<\/p> <p>  The Malta Declaration has great sounding principles regarding building capacity and having adequate reception centres, but there is no doubt that it is a complete failure.  To date I have counted &euro;120 million and &euro;90 million going to it and I am sure there is a great deal more, but it is not addressing the needs it should be addressing.  I believe the money could be given to MSF because it would be done in a more humane way.  We wrote to the previous Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade asking that this be raised, as he was attending that foreign affairs Council meeting in Europe.  We do not hear concerns at European level that funding is going into the abuse and torture of people and making life much worse for them.  We know the root causes of many people leaving their countries but they are ending up in a much worse situation.  The coastguards need training but I am also sure there are rogue coastguards who have no interest in training and who are using this situation for themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017070600002#N00300","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1499329800,"counter":1376,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentation.

In response to Deputy Crowe's question about the potential closure of Italian ports, that is obviously very concerning.  We run missions of approximately 72 hours in order to get people back to disembark with them in Italy but if that time is increased it will mean more deaths at sea because we will be spending less time looking for people and picking them up.  As Deputy Crowe said, Italy has been absorbing a huge burden.  We are quite concerned about the discussion in terms of the code of conduct around NGOs.  We have not received any official notification on this matter yet but preventing NGOs from disembarking in the closest safe harbours will increase the danger.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the other EU countries, we believe very strongly that people should follow Ireland's lead and provide humanitarian maritime assistance, which is what this country has been doing.  It is the only EU country to do so.  We very much respect and admire that, but we are concerned that this activity is moving more towards prevention of people getting into Europe and returning them back to Libya.  The conditions in those detention centres are completely appalling.  As Dr. Kenny outlined, we are seeing victims of torture, trauma and all kinds of things.  At MSF we believe very strongly that what is needed is more search and rescue capacity, not turning people back.  As Dr. Kenny outlined as well, we have seen smugglers firing into the air and stealing from the people that are on their boats so it is an extremely challenging situation.<br\/><br\/>In terms of NGOs being a pull factor, they are not.  An academic study was done by Goldsmiths college two weeks ago that showed that irrespective of whether there are ships there people are going to go to sea.  In terms of responding to Deputy O'Sullivan's question about why we rescue people, if 5,000 people were dying of Ebola we would feel the need to respond.  That is an unacceptable amount of people to be dying because they want to cross a border, which is not a particularly good reason.  From a humanitarian medical perspective that is why we feel we have to put those three boats into the water there, but we are not the solution.  The solution lies with individual European states.  We do not know what the solution is.  Compared to the weight of the European Union we are a relatively small organisation.  We know that sending people back is not the correct response.  We do not differentiate between whether people are economic migrants or they are fleeing Darfur, Somalia or Eritrea.  People do not get on those boats lightly.  I have Syrian friends who have made the journey.  They know what they are getting into.  They are fully informed of the risks in Libya and on the way.  That is not something we would necessarily differentiate.<br\/><br\/>In terms of co-ordination of services, all the activities are co-ordinated by the Maritime Security Council, MSC, out of Rome.  We are not cowboys.  We run watches on deck where we look for people but we are told where to go, as is the Irish Naval Service and the other NGO boats.  All the rescues are co-ordinated by Rome.  Dr. Kelly can provide more details about this.  We follow the instructions.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the distance, on five occasions over the past three years we have entered into Libyan territorial waters up to 1 nautical mile, but that was to save lives.  We could see people drowning in front of us and we felt obliged to save them.  We were told to go there by Rome, so we went.  Just to make it very clear; there is no contact whatsoever between M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res and any smuggler.  All the activities are co-ordinated out of Rome.  We are directed in terms of what to do.<br\/><br\/>There is a legal obligation on any vessel to go to the aid of another vessel in distress.  That is not something we made up.  What we are doing is adding capacity.  The commercial vessels that were previously taking a lot of the slack on this, after<i>mare nostrum<\/i>finished, complained to the European Union, saying the volume was too high.  It is not that we are providing an ambulance service or a taxi service.  There is a legal obligation based on the laws of the sea which dictate that vessels in distress must be attended to by other vessels in the area.<br\/><br\/>In terms of funding, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res stopped taking European Union funding in June, because of the EU-Turkey deal to which Ireland was a party.  We stopped taking Irish Aid money at the same time.  The boats are another illustration of that, as is sending people back to Libya.  There is a very dangerous movement now to prevent people from seeking asylum.  People have the right to seek asylum, to flee war, to flee persecution and natural disaster.  We believe that putting borders and barriers up, whether they be in Libya or on the Balkan route, is a worrying development of outsourcing European borders.  We understand that Europe has a massive problem with this but we feel that people should have the right to flee Syria and Eritrea.  We feel quite strongly on that.<br\/><br\/>The work of the Irish Naval Service is something that is very respected both by M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res and by the other people doing this work but we remain concerned that the work should stick, as it has for the past three years, to humanitarian search and rescue, rather than looking to go on border control missions, which we feel sends a very concerning message.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017070600002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sam Taylor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499329800,"counter":1379,"content":"<p>In response to the rest of the questions, I will return to what Mr. Taylor said about NGOs being a pull factor.  It is very frustrating to work in that environment and for the narrative to be there focusing on the pull factor instead of the fact that people are dying at sea and that has been the case for many years.  We should bear in mind that NGOs only got involved in the water in 2014 and 2015.  There were naval vessels well before that.  The majority of rescues still continue to be done by Government vessels.  NGOs serve to take the burden off merchant navy oil tankers and other people who are ill-equipped to deal with the situation.  It is frustrating to hear that when the narrative should be on the number of deaths at sea.  Regarding organ donation and migration, I have never heard of anything like that and I have not come across it in the medical clinic at all.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the medical care provided when people reach Italy, the night before disembarkation I draw up my list of people whom I need to refer to the Italian Ministry of health.  The number of people on the list is directly proportional to the poor quality of detention centres from which they have come.  Often, many people suffer from the same infection as a result of horrific sanitation.  I then refer those people to the Italian Ministry of health.  I also refer people whom we could deem to be vulnerable cases.  They may be unaccompanied minors or people who have suffered serious psychological distress after being tortured for many months or witnessing people being killed.  The problem I face is that I could refer everyone on the boat, all 600 or 900, but I cannot.  I have to think of an arbitrary threshold to make the referrals on psycho-social issues people have.  It is very difficult to do that.  There is a strain on what the Italian health care system can do.  One has to be selective in whom one can refer on.  MSF does work in Italy.  It is doing new projects in Sicily to manage the psycho-social issues on land and to help support the Italian health care system that way.<br\/><br\/>As Mr. Taylor said, the co-ordination of rescues is done through the MRC in Rome.  Very often we work with naval vessels and other NGOs to support them doing a rescue.  We may provide the life jackets and they may take the people on board their boats or <i>vice versa<\/i>.  If a naval vessel needs to go back to port we disembark people onto the naval vessel or <i>vice versa<\/i>.<\/p><p>My experience is that the co-operation has been positive.  The problem is that often there are not enough assets in the water.  More often than not, our boat has been overloaded by almost double its capacity.  Going into port in Catania or Sicily, we have been found to be listing to one side because we were well over double our capacity.  That is an insanely and incredibly dangerous situation but we have no other support.  We do not even have a merchant navy vessel to assist us in rescues.  This is a major issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017070600002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conor Kenny","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499329800,"counter":1381,"content":"<p>On Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s question as to whether this is being spoken about at European level, the answer, in a sense, is \"Yes\".

I compliment MSF on the tremendous work it is doing in this regard.  What is happening there is horrendous.  In 2016, there were 5,000 deaths of migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean and already this year there have been 2,700.  We must do something to tackle this.<\/p> <p>  What is the average age of migrants trying to reach Europe?  More importantly, how do we stop it?  This cannot continue.  Does MSF feel enough is being done?  What more can be done in these various countries?  The West has much to answer for what it did in Libya.  It deposed the former Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, and then ran away leaving a lawless state behind.  We did not have an issue with this when Gaddafi was in power.  I do not agree with what he did, but he exercised some sort of control.<\/p> <p>  These are human beings we are dealing with.  They are the same as ourselves and breathe the same air we breathe.  Some of them are genuine migrants trying to get away from war.  Will MSF outline from what countries most migrants are coming and why?  Some of them are financial migrants coming to better themselves and to travel.  I was in Berlin recently and I saw many of them begging.  I walked up Shop Street in Galway quite late one night recently and noted that the majority of those sleeping rough on the street were non-Irish.  This shows that they are getting to the cities and that many of them are, unfortunately, sleeping rough.<\/p> <p>  Who are the people providing the service to bring migrants across the Mediterranean?

To the best of my knowledge, this issue is not high on the agenda of the European Parliament.  This is a European issue.  In fairness to the Italian authorities, one can understand their difficulties being the drop-off place.  When the Italian economy goes bad, they come under pressure.  That is not solving the problem.<\/p> <p>  The problem, as I understand it, is the breakdown on the African continent.  Many countries there seem to be in bits on a regular basis.  We have to take this issue to the floor of the European Parliament, to the European Commission and to the Council of Ministers.  We can do our little bit, but it is like a drop in the ocean.  Listening to Dr. Conor Kenny and those risking their lives, it is obvious that the level of frustration they experience must be horrific.  They are picking up people - dragging them out of the sea - bringing them to Italy, going back again to do the same, yet nobody seems to be grasping the major problems.  We have conferences around the world about issues, but this has to be brought to a European level.  Has MSF had the opportunity of addressing Members of the European Parliament?  If not, has it any proposals to do so?  It is unfair to expect MSF to carry a heavy can on behalf of all of us.

It is only when we go there and see with our own eyes the way these people are not even existing that we realise it.  Children were in orphanages and the only things they had were the vests they wore and a bowl of rice per day.  We look around the world and ask how this can go on.  That was 20 years ago but it is still happening.  I am searching the brains of the deputation for opinions on whether we can do something to bring this a step further.

We do not have the solution.  Although M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res has been active in this area for several years, we do not have the solution.  We ask ourselves what we would recommend.  The simplest and clearest message we can transmit is that there have to be alternative channels.  There have to be safe and legal channels for this process to happen.  As we have mentioned, the NGOs are not a pull factor.  People would continue to come even if the NGOs were not there and more people would die.  No one takes these risks unaware of what they are, whether they are from Egypt, Syria or Sudan.  People talk to each other through social media.  People know there is a high risk of dying but they are prepared to take it until or unless there are safer and legal channels.<\/p> <p>  We have mentioned the European Union.  Ireland can do more in raising these issues at European level.  Ireland has leading positions in some of the bodies in Europe.  As a nation that has a deep and admirable humanitarian history, it behoves Ireland to raise these issues in whatever fora are available, as my colleague, Mr. Dunne, said.  All we can do is tell committee members what we are seeing.  All M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res can do is explain what it is our people there are seeing on the ground.  It is the responsibility of policymakers to turn that into policy.  Of course, ending the war in Syria would be great and stabilising Somalia would be fantastic.  However, it is not within our remit to do this.  These are political issues.  The part of M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res is to save lives.

This is the first meeting of the Estonian Presidency and will be my second Council to attend since my appointment as Minister for Finance, having attended the June Council in Luxembourg.  In light of these developments, I want to discuss quickly the issues that are before finance Ministers at the ECOFIN meeting.  In the committee's invitation, it asked if I would also provide a brief overview of the proceedings of the June ECOFIN meeting, so I will address that first.<\/p> <p>  The June ECOFIN meeting took place in Luxembourg on 16 June and it was the last under the Maltese Presidency.  The June agenda included discussions relating to the reduced VAT rate for electronically supplied publications, known as ebooks, the general reverse charge mechanism, which I will explain quickly for the benefit of members, strengthening of the banking union and risk reduction measures, and an update on the current financial services legislative proposals.  On the non-legislative part of the meeting there were discussions on non-performing loans, the fight against the financing of terrorism, the capital markets union, the contribution to the June European Council meeting, and the Stability and Growth Pact.  As usual for the final meeting of a Presidency, it was busy.<\/p> <p>  The first item on the agenda was a proposal to amend the Council directive dealing with a reduced VAT rate for epublications.  At present, the EU VAT directive prevents member states from applying the same VAT rates to epublications as currently applies to physical publications.  The result is a less favourable VAT treatment of epublications in most member states.  The modernisation of VAT on ecommerce proposals published by the Commission on 1 December 2016 includes provision to grant all member states the possibility to apply the same VAT rates to electronically supplied publications as member states currently apply to printed publications.  Furthermore, the proposal also allows all member states to apply a zero or super-reduced VAT rate, which is below 5%, to publications in any format.  Until now, only member states that applied such treatment to physical publications on and since 1 January 1991 could avail of zero or super-reduced rating.  Unfortunately, no agreement was reached on this.<\/p> <p>  The second item dealt with a proposal to amend the directive on the common system of VAT specifically relating to the temporary application of a generalised reverse charge mechanism relating to supplies of goods and services above a certain threshold.  This item was last discussed at the March ECOFIN meeting.  The current EU VAT directive provides for sectoral reverse charge mechanisms to apply in certain circumstances where known fraud exists.  However, it is proposed to introduce a generalised reverse charge mechanism which extends the reverse charge to all supplies of goods and services in a member state and not just to a specific sector.  Under the reverse charge mechanism, the person liable for payment of VAT to the tax authorities is the consumer and not the supplier.  This is an anti-fraud mechanism.  As with the ebooks proposal, no agreement was reached on this matter either, as they both require unanimity to proceed.<\/p> <p>  Ministers also discussed a number of legislative proposals that dealt with strengthening the banking union and also dealt with risk reduction measures.  Two of the proposals, namely, a draft directive on the ranking of unsecured debt instruments in insolvency proceedings relating to bank creditor hierarchy and a draft regulation on transitional arrangements to phase in the regulatory capital impact of International Financial Reporting Standard 9, IFRS 9, were agreed by Ministers.  The first general approach seeks to harmonise the ranking of unsecured debt instruments across Europe, that is, to establish a common hierarchy for the repayment of creditors when an institution is resolved.  The second general approach introduces transitional arrangements to phase in the impact on bank capital of IFRS 9, an accounting standard that comes into effect on 1 January 2018, and to phase out the exemption of sovereign bonds from the large exposure rules due to expire at the end of 2017.  This means that the Presidency can commence discussion on these draft proposals with the European Parliament as soon as the Parliament has approved its own negotiating stance.<\/p> <p>  The Council noted the progress made by working parties on the remaining four draft proposals.  These relate to bank capital requirements, the directive on bank recovery, a regulation on the Single Resolution Mechanism and a regulation establishing a European deposit insurance scheme.  The first three proposals are aimed at reducing risk to the financial sector and are designed to incorporate into EU law standards agreed at the global level by the Basel committee on banking supervision and the financial stability board.  The final proposal sets out to establish an EU-level insurance scheme to strengthen the protection of bank deposits.  Work will now continue at a technical level on these proposals.  We were given an update on non-performing loans in Europe, the mid-term review of the capital markets union action plan and progress made on the implementation of the action plan for strengthening the fight against terrorist financing.  As the Council will return to the first two topics in July, I will say more about them later.<\/p> <p>  Let me now turn to the remaining two items on the June ECOFIN agenda: the contribution to the European Council meeting to the European semester and the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact.  The EU semester refers to the EU economic governance rules and related monitoring.  This is an annual cycle of economic and budgetary policy guidance which culminates in the adoption of country-specific recommendations.  The Council discussed and approved the recommendations on each member state's country-specific recommendations.  This is a routine part of the annual EU semester process and these recommendations were endorsed by the European Council in June and will be adopted at the July ECOFIN meeting.  We are broadly satisfied with the policy guidance contained in the three country-specific recommendations addressed to Ireland.  Finally, ECOFIN was asked to approve the draft Council decisions to abrogate the excessive deficit procedures of Portugal and Croatia.  Both countries outlined the progress made with respect to their economies and welcomed this.  The Council also agreed to launch a significant deviation procedure for Romania as part of the preventative arm of the Stability and Growth Pact with a view to correcting its significant deviation from the structural adjustment path towards its budgetary objective.<\/p> <p>  Next week will be the first ECOFIN meeting under the Estonian Presidency and I wish it well.  I remind the committee that this is a draft agenda and there may be changes between now and the meeting.  On the legislative side of the agenda, Ministers will be informed, as usual by the Presidency, of the state of play on the current financial services legislative proposals.  The Commission will make a presentation about its recently published proposal on the mandatory disclosure of tax schemes by tax advisers.  This would require tax advisers to disclose to tax authorities when they market or promote tax planning schemes that meet certain so-called hallmarks.  The disclosures would be shared with all other member states.  The logic for that proposal is that tax authorities would be made aware of arrangements that may constitute tax avoidance and therefore would be able to carry out more detailed audits or introduce legislative changes to close loopholes.  The proposal stems from the recommendation in the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process.<\/p> <p>  This is a Commission proposal that has not been contributed to yet by member states.  Ireland and other member states will now examine the proposal in detail and discuss it at Council working parties under the Estonian Presidency.  These technical discussions have not yet begun.  The Presidency has not made this proposal one of its tax priorities but the Commission will be eager for agreement to be reached in the coming months.  Ireland already has mandatory disclosure rules in place and is one of only four member states to have such rules.  A Government decision in September 2016 confirmed Ireland's support in principle for all member states agreeing a directive to introduce similar rules to the extent that they are in line with the BEPS Action 12 report.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the non-legislative side of the agenda, there are three topics down for consideration.<\/p><p>The first item will be a presentation on the work programme of the Estonian Presidency which will be made by the Estonian Finance Minister, Mr. Toomas T&otilde;niste, as is usual at the start of a presidential term.  The main overall objectives of the Estonian Presidency are: an open and innovative European economy; a safe and secure Europe; a digital Europe and free movement of data; and an inclusive and sustainable Europe.  The Presidency views an open and innovative European economy as developing a business environment which supports knowledge-based growth and competitiveness.  It is also committed to the principle of better regulation and will examine opportunities for e-solutions.<\/p><p> The second item will be the topic of the Commission's mid-term review of the capital markets union action plan, on which Ministers will seek to adopt draft Council conclusions which we generally support.  As I mentioned, this item featured on the agenda for the June Council.  The mid-term review which was published on 8 June details the progress made so far and sets out timelines for new actions in the coming months.  Ireland is broadly supportive of the capital markets union project and welcomes the continued efforts of the Commission to implement the action plan, including through the review which shows that significant progress has been made across many measures.  The capital markets union action plan has the potential to increase the sources of finance for Irish businesses and investors.  The creation of larger and deeper capital markets in Europe would also be of benefit to our financial services industry.  The majority of the proposed new measures will help to achieve these objectives.  It is generally the case that the cumulative effect of many measures will have an impact, rather than any single measure being transformative by itself.<\/p><p> The report of the expert group of the financial services committee subgroup on non-performing loans will be presented to Ministers and followed by an exchange of views.  The Council will also be asked to adopt draft conclusions.  From an Irish perspective, notwithstanding the progress made and the strong pace of reductions in 2014, 2015 and 2016, pressure remains on Irish banks to reduce the value of non-performing loans at a faster pace.  The value of impaired loans in Ireland has fallen by approximately 63%, from a peak of &euro;85 billion at the end of 2013.  In 2016 alone it fell by approximately 25%.  The momentum of this reduction in the value of non-performing loans has continued into 2017.  Ireland is broadly supportive of proposed measures which cover 19 policy proposals across four core areas: supervision; insolvency and legal frameworks; the development of secondary markets; and the restructuring of the banking sector.  The aim of the proposals is to introduce consistent and strong supervision of non-performing loans; improve the legal frameworks and efficiency across the European Union; enhance the consistency of approaches to secondary markets; and assist member states in setting up asset management companies.  However, we do have some concerns about specific elements of the proposals.  For example, we are concerned that restructuring activity will be disincentivised in favour of loan sales, or that possible changes to legal and insolvency frameworks might need to make allowance for the independence of the courts system and our common law framework.  The draft conclusions make it clear that the matter will be reviewed.  Accordingly, we are broadly supportive of the draft Council conclusions.<\/p><p> I trust that the Chairman and members of the committee have found the summary of last month's meeting and the outline of this month's agenda informative.  I thank them for their attention and will be happy to respond to questions or observations members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017070600002#D00200","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499329800,"counter":1408,"content":"<p>This is the Minister's first time in front of the committee and I hope we will have many good engagements during his period as Minister for Finance.

I referred, in particular, to Northern Ireland and will continue to do so.  I used, as an example, the investment of the European Investment Bank in Derry and pointed out that by facilitating the building of the peace bridge and other such projects, it had played a role in the economic rejuvenation of a fabulous city, as well as producing a far more important political dividend.

If the Minister has not seen them, I will send them to the Department again.  They concern flexibilities which are possible within the existing fiscal rules and rules on state aid.  They also deal with changes that need to take place to the globalisation fund to alleviate distortion as a result of Brexit.  A number of practical solutions should be considered and I call on the Minister to raise them, with the other things bring raised by the Department.  I ask him to put forward more concrete proposals at ECOFIN meetings.

It has been acknowledged by all sides with regard to the impact they are having on our inability to invest in certain areas.  The Minister's Department officials are scrambling to try to find vehicles that are off-balance sheet so we can invest in social housing and elsewhere.  The reason we have to do it off-balance sheet is because the fiscal rules do not allow us to spend money we may have at our disposal on these matters.

We have to see if they fit the needs of an economy at any point in time, in this case the European economy.  This could be an area in which we have different views but I contend that many of the objectives contained in the fiscal rules are appropriate and necessary for our economy.  To have a deficit below 3% and a debt as a percentage of our national income that is below 60% are sensible choices for our economy.  Even if the fiscal rules were not there, they are good, sensible choices for a small, open economy that has a currency but does not print its own currency.  That being said, we had low debt levels and low deficit levels before the crisis began and all these things unravelled with shocking speed.  I would never say those things on their own provide full insulation in the uncertain waters we are working our way through.  They are an essential part of what insulation and security looks like for an open economy like Ireland.  Although I welcome that for a number of years under the fiscal rules capital expenditure has been treated differently from current expenditure, I have indicated we will continue to look for recognition of the needs of the Irish economy.  The objectives of the fiscal rules are sensible and appropriate for Ireland.

The fact that this has not happened - we have seen the resolution of two national banking issues without a contagion effect within their national economies or the eurozone - proves that the system has improved significantly in recent years.

The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's chief economist told the Oireachtas Committee on Budgetary Oversight that it was worried that the figures from the Department of Finance were too optimistic, on three grounds, that the model used did not take into account the fact that exports to Britain were more labour intensive than in other export markets; that COSMO could underestimate the shock impact of Brexit and that the model did not take into account the exchange rate changes which had been a feature of the Brexit process to that point.  When he was pushed on the possible implications, he confirmed that the effect could be significant.  That is a significant statement which adds to the argument against cutting the universal social charge.

It is considering supervisory tools - for example, extending non-profit loan guidance to all European Union banks - the use of insolvency and debt recovery frameworks, such as how there could be better transparency in the context of insolvency outcomes, the development of secondary markets, which goes back to another point on the agenda regarding the development of a single capital market for Europe and what measures need to be taken in the context of restructuring the European banking sector.  Those are the four ways in which the committee is considering the issue.  The Government will engage constructively with what is being proposed.  I have said that certain matters need to be monitored.  We must ensure that the forced loan route is not unnecessarily favoured over the restructuring route.  Both can play a very valuable role, which is the experience we have had in the economy in recent years.  There is a need to be sensible regarding additional powers such as the Single Supervisory Mechanism that are made available to other bodies and we must ensure that any developments in respect of the restructuring directive currently being debated in Europe recognise Ireland's legal framework and, in particular, its common law framework.

The development of a banking union and a capital market by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will be of benefit to Ireland in the long run.  I am always open to deliverable ideas that make sense in dealing with this kind of issue.  Significant progress has been made in respect of non-performing loans.  The point is being approached where non-performing loans that have been extant for a significant period are being dealt with and some choices for those holding such loans could be difficult.  People with non-performing home loans in particular should consider the role of the Abhaile scheme offered by the MABS because engagement with banks, backed up by professional support, can yield outcomes which, while not always ideal, might be more acceptable to people than if they do not engage with banks.

In this case, the State could be bumping up the price of homes unbeknownst to itself.  It would be better if State funds were used more directly with developers and builders to build houses rather than to be helping companies such as Cairn Homes, which might have thousands of sites around Dublin and which is quoted on the stock market in London.  That company is, in its own right, capable of getting funding elsewhere rather than from the State's pension fund, which should be helping smaller banks here to fund developers and builders who are building.  The Minister should look at the issue.  The smaller companies seem to be starved of capital.

At the same time, however, there is all this debt.  Sometimes people forget just how much debt we have and sometimes the debt-to-GDP ratio is only falling because the GDP figures are rising.

I would like our national income to begin to grow in a sustainable way and for us, by running budget surpluses over a reasonable period, to begin to steadily reduce our level of debt.

In the years that follow we will run a moderate surplus, just as we have at other points in our history.  This would be the quickest way of incrementally taking down our debt.

I accept that there needs to be unanimity but there may be pressure in other ways to get us to adapt our position.  We have a very significant reliance on a small number of foreign multinationals, with approximately 40% of our corporation tax returns coming from about ten of them.  Approximately 80% of the corporation tax comes, by and large, from American FDI more generally.  We welcome the fact they are here and the tax is, as we all acknowledge, very welcome.  As a State, however, we are very dependent on a relatively small number of large businesses.  What is the Minister's take on this and how can it best be managed?

We will engage constructively in any action from the European Commission on matters like this.  We will not, however, agree to any proposal that might undermine our competitiveness as a country.  We need to be very clear here about corporation tax.  Many other countries have made choices around how they want to deliver a competitive edge for their citizens.  Due to our size, location and relatively small population, it is entirely appropriate that we have a corporation tax policy that reduces the kind of costs and risks faced by a small, open, island economy as it tries to do business.  Like every other recent Minister for Finance, I too will maintain that approach.<\/p> <p>  The Senator's second question concerned the role of corporation tax and its effects on our tax base.  The first point I would make is that many other countries face the same challenge, but that does not mean that we should not do something about it here in Ireland.  In the coming years we are going to see a change in how our dependence on corporate tax take is driven by a certain number of companies.  The simple reason for this is that as the rest of our domestic economy grows, as our banks begin to recover profitability, for example, all these developments will change the composition of our corporate tax base.  To answer the question as to how I want to deal with this matter in the coming while, the first thing is to continue to support a change in our economic prospects that means that more companies of different kinds and, it is hoped, more investors will pay corporation tax here in Ireland.  That is change number one.  The second change is simply to make other decisions on other forms of personal tax, meaning that we do not end up being over-reliant on corporation tax in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017070600002#M00400","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1499329800,"counter":1534,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for that.

Yesterday morning, the Cabinet agreed to begin drafting the heads of a Bill to consider how we can deal with the consequences of the Setanta ruling and what it means for the level of capital that insurance companies based in Ireland need to hold.  I have been informed by the Irish insurance industry that the level of capital holding and how high it has been in the past has, in turn, contributed to increased premia.  As we put in place measures to address these issues, I want to see this play a role in reducing premia in the long run.  I cannot force that to happen because neither I nor the State owns the insurance companies.  If we put in place measures that address issues that the industry has, I expect to see that reflected, in the long run, in the level of premia that people pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017070600002#N00900","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1499329800,"counter":1559,"content":"<p>Obviously, the Minister cannot go into the following but when a report or outcome is finalised and is released into the public domain, if there is a need for an initiative to be taken by the Department relative to insurance and insurance companies or what might arise, will the Minister either pass legislation or take action?

Either the rules have been breached or they have not.  I do not expect the Minister to know the detail of it now but I ask him to raise the matter with the Governor of the Central Bank.<\/p> <p>  There is unease about the manner in which the Central Bank offers consumer protection as it is not extensive.  The Central Bank's response to the tracker mortgage issue has been pathetic.  and it must do more to protect consumers.  The committee hears complaints about the Central Bank on a regular basis.  I have expressed my opinion and I ask the Minister to raise the matter with the Central Bank.   <\/p> <p>  On a more important issue to me, the National Housing Co-operative Bill 2017 was discussed in the Seanad last week with the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy D'Arcy.  A Bill to establish a co-operative is part of an overall approach.  The legislation was not voted on and the debate will resume, but the Minister of State spoke against the Bill.  The main Opposition party contributed to the debate but only hinted at the real situation, did not offer much of a solution and avoided the issue.  I think the issue should be taken up.  In line with what Deputy Pearse Doherty asked earlier, is it possible for Department officials to engage with the people who wrote the Bill, including the Master of the High Court, Mr. Ed Honohan?  The latter has expressed an interest in meeting the Minister.  Liaising would be worthwhile as the legislation could be developed into a Bill that offers solutions.  In the past week or so, the legislation has been cleared with the Ceann Comhairle, with an amendment.  It is not a money Bill and I hope, in the same spirit as what Deputy Doherty asked earlier, we could discuss this legislation with Department officials.<\/p><p>The committee has received a submission and we have had a good debate with those who are putting the Bill forward.

The level of debt in the economy is between &euro;200 billion and &euro;205 billion, which is a very high figure.  The percentage of Government tax revenue absorbed to service that debt is high by comparison with the norm.  It puts us among the countries that have a debt issue requiring management.
