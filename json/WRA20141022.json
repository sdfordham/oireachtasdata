Raised bog habitats are in danger of disappearance in Ireland and in the EU. 53 SACs, including Coolrain Bog, were nominated for designation as SACs to meet our legal obligations and safeguard a relatively small number of our raised bogs for future generations.   My Department has engaged a consortium of ecological and hydrological experts to undertake a comprehensive assessment the current status and future conservation prospects of the 53 SACs. Led by RPS consultants, the results of their analysis for each site are contained in the appendix to the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, which was issued for public consultation earlier this year.  The assessment shows that Coolrain is a small bog that contains a significant area of active raised bog habitat. This is the area of the bog which is actively forming peat and which is a habitat in particular danger of disappearance within the European Union. As such, it is deemed a priority habitat and afforded particular protection under EU law. Active raised bog is very sensitive to the drainage impacts of turf-cutting.<\/p><p>  The draft National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan provides for the future restoration and management of the 53 raised bog SACs, including Coolrain. The draft sets out the approach to how each of the raised bog sites is to be conserved and restored, in partnership with the local community, and how the needs of turf-cutters are to be addressed.<\/p><p>  I note that 62 turf-cutters from Coolrain Bog have engaged with my Department under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme. Of these, 11 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation to a non-designated bog. Relocation options are being actively explored by my Department and Bord na M&oacute;na.<\/p><p>  Coolrain Bog is a site of considerable conservation value, containing significant areas of active raised bog. Restoration efforts by Coillte under the EU LIFE programme have already partly secured the future of this site.  My Department will work with other land-owners and with the local community to manage and restore the remainder of what is an exceptional bog. Our first priority is to ensure that turf-cutters are looked after and we are doing this through providing them with financial compensation or in helping them to continue to cut turf in an alternative bog, if that is their preference. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102200030#WRA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":24,"content":"<p>Question No. 16 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge","counter":25,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102200030#WRA01750"},{"type":"question","counter":26,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[40145\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102200030#WRA01800","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"cad iad na hacmhainn&iacute; breise at&aacute; faighte ag Roinn na Gaeltachta sa bhuis&eacute;ad chun an Strait&eacute;is Fiche Bliain a chur i bhfeidhm.","asker":"1080","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":27,"content":"<p>Cuireadh fomh&iacute;r nua, fomh&iacute;r C10, le V&oacute;ta mo Roinne in 2014 chun tionscadail ar leith a bhaineann le cur i bhfeidhm na <i>Strait&eacute;ise 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge <\/i>a mhaoini&uacute;.

In this regard, my officials are working closely with their colleagues in the other relevant Departments and Agencies, in the development of the operational processes that will be employed to deliver the relief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102200034#WRE00800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":116,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102200034#WRE00850"},{"type":"question","counter":117,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[40501\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102200034#WRE00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a person will be able to claim both the water charge tax credit and the &euro;100 payment as a recipient of the household benefits package; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":118,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[40630\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102200034#WRE01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"in relation to the relief measures in respect of water charges announced in budget 2015, if someone in receipt of the household benefits package and who is also in the income tax net, will be permitted to claim the relief measure available to recipients of the household benefits package as well as tax relief on the remaining part of their water charges.","asker":"1178","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":119,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 73 together.<br\/><br\/>As the Deputy is aware, I announced in the Budget that tax relief for water charges will be introduced.

It was required by legislation to acquire a designated portfolio of assets from five participation institutions at a time when the Irish property market was highly distressed.  Unlike the position currently prevailing whereby there are numerous investors interested in acquiring Irish assets, there were no such buyers in 2009 and 2010 when NAMA was being established.<\/p><p>  The valuation methodology which was approved by the European Commission required NAMA to acquire assets at 'long term economic value' which incorporated a State Aid uplift averaging 22% above market values.

NAMA is not, therefore, in a position where it can hold assets for a long-term horizon as would be the case, for instance, with a pension fund.<\/p><p>  For the reasons outlined above, it is entirely invalid to suggest that NAMA should be judged by the same IRR criteria as private equity investment funds which are free to operate without the asset acquisition, pricing or asset disposal restrictions applicable to NAMA.<\/p><p>  Unlike NAMA, these funds are free to acquire assets across a broad range of asset classes and jurisdictions and to dispose of them freely. In order to generate double-digit investment returns, it is necessary for private equity investors to have a much higher appetite for risk than would be appropriate for NAMA and any other State entity which is responsible for the management of public funds.

The suggestion in the question that NAMA operates to a target annual rate of return of 0.5% is untrue.  NAMA's objective is not only to maximise the commercial return from its activities both annually and over its lifetime but also to maximise the wider public and social benefits that its activities generate.<\/p><p>  NAMA has designed and implemented a highly robust Management Information System and has clearly defined key performance indicators (KPIs) in place, which form the basis of its internal reporting and monitoring framework.

This assumption is not in line with the requirement in the NAMA Act that NAMA deals expeditiously with the assets acquired by it and it is not in line with the strategy which has been set out by the NAMA Board and endorsed by me at the conclusion of the Section 227 review which was completed this year.<\/p><p>  In interpreting its statutory mandate, the NAMA Board, with my endorsement, has taken the view that the best financial outcome for the State would be achieved through a managed process of\u00a0disposals in an orderly way with the target of redeeming 80% of senior debt (a cumulative &euro;24 billion) by end-2016 and a growing expectation of\u00a0being  in\u00a0a position to redeem\u00a0all senior debt by the end of 2018.\u00a0 NAMA's senior debt is a contingent liability of Irish taxpayers and reducing and ultimately eliminating it has to be a major priority at a time when Ireland's sovereign indebtedness is still at very high levels.  Indeed, this leveraged condition fundamentally contrasts that of an investment market awash with liquidity, which goes some way towards explaining the diverging motives of sellers and acquirers.  NAMA deliberately withheld from significantly divesting of its Irish positions until the end of 2013 until this market liquidity appeared, thereby providing an opportunity for the State to de-risk itself of property exposures at strong pricing levels. \u00a0To draw comparisons with those purchasing the assets would be to infer that NAMA should prolong the State's exposure to the property market, adopt a speculative risk profile, ignore the\u00a0requirement to reduce the State's debt burden and add uncertainty to the market's perception of Ireland's recovery process.  For that reason, given that it is engaged in a process of deleveraging, I do not expect NAMA to measure its performance by reference to investment entities which have full commercial autonomy in terms of seeking and generating returns.<\/p><p>  When international private equity companies make investment decisions, they typically aim for an Internal Rate of Return ('IRR') target in the high single digits given the low returns generally prevailing in the bond markets.

This includes a specific provision in relation to the retroactive application of the instrument.  Therefore, the agreement, that we were active in negotiating, keeps open the possibility to apply to the European Stability Mechanism for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks, should we wish to avail of it.<\/p><p>  What is now required is a decision by mutual agreement of the ESM Board of Governors to create a new ESM instrument in accordance with Article 19 of the ESM treaty.  The aim is to have this process completed by early November this year, subject to completion of national approval procedures.  For Ireland the European Stability Mechanism (Amendment) Bill 2014, which is currently passing through the Houses and is expected to be enacted by the end of this month, will fulfil this purpose.  Once the Single Supervisory Mechanism is in place and operational, on 4 November this year, it is expected that the ESM Board of Governors will then take a decision to include the\u00a0DRI among the list of ESM instruments.<\/p><p>  In relation to retrospective recapitalisation, the draft guideline states that the potential application of the instrument for this purpose should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.  As I have stated previously, it will not be possible to make a formal application to the ESM for retrospective recapitalisation before\u00a0the Instrument is\u00a0in place as expected in November.<\/p><p>  However I would remind the Deputy that unlike back in 2012, the ESM is no longer the only option open to us to recover the money provided to recapitalise our banks. \u00a0Investors are now willing to\u00a0invest in Irish banks again and the market value of our investments has improved accordingly.<\/p><p>  The decision on any application once the instrument is in place is a matter of timing.

Therefore, the debt component relating to the recapitalisation of the banks can only be estimated.<\/p><p>  The previous parliamentary question provided in detail the type and level of capital injections injected into Irish banks since the start of 2009 and indicated that they can be separated into three categories.<\/p><p>(1) Capital injections that were made under Ministerial direction by the NPRF Commission amount to &euro;18.8 billion (net of the sale of Bank of Ireland preference shares in 2013). There is no debt effect associated with these payments as they did not require borrowing.<\/p><p>(2) The promissory notes to IBRC and EBS added &euro;30.85 billion to the general government debt, but not the national debt, in 2010.  The IBRC promissory notes were cancelled and replaced with a portfolio of eight floating rate Government bonds for a total amount of &euro;25 billion which will lead to a reduction in general government debt over time.<\/p><p>(3) By the end of 2013, &euro;10 billion (net of the sale of Bank of Ireland equity in 2011, the sale of Irish Life and the sale of contingent capital notes in 2013) is estimated to have been paid through direct payments from the Exchequer account to the banking sector.  Although no specific borrowing was made in the cases of interventions paid through the Exchequer they would have impacted on the cash reserves held by government.<\/p><p>  In addition to the recapitalisation payments made to these institutions there have been some developments which have offset these measures.

Strategic deployment of limited resources in response to Workforce Planning reviews, ongoing prioritising and reprioritising of work and advocating for key or mission-critical posts to be filled to enable the Department meet its current mission are the key tools at the Department&rsquo;s disposal regarding staffing resources at this time - with the challenge remaining to do so in a resources-constrained environment.<\/p><p>  My Department continues to proactively and productively engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on resources for the Department, its Offices and its Agencies.

While the Department engages with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on sanctioning the filling of key vacancies within the ECF\/Moratorium framework, the respective management of each agency has had to reconfigure their organisation and adapt to a constrained-resources environment.  Notwithstanding these constraints, through a comprehensive series of reforms and changed work practices, the Department and its agencies have been able to deliver a comprehensive range of services and supports.  <\/p><p>  In light of the foregoing, resources for all Business Units in my Department are reviewed periodically and local managements advocate on behalf of their Units in terms of resource allocation.  In this context, there would be ongoing dialogue between the management of NERA and the Personnel Unit of my Department regarding resources.

The GP would also be entitled to claim the maximum applicable contribution towards locum costs for periods of sick leave, annual leave, study leave, maternity leave and adoptive leave.  In remote areas, where an alternative to dispensing by the GP is considered not to be feasible by the HSE, a dispensing GP is entitled to receive payment for dispensing to his\/her GMS patients.<\/p><p>  The Rural Practice Allowance has not been abolished.  Since 2009, a number of reductions have been applied under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 (FEMPI) to the fees and allowances paid to health professionals, including GPs who provide services under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme.  Over this period, the Rural Practice Allowance under the GMS capitation agreement has been reduced from &euro;20,712.29 to the current annual rate of &euro;16,216.07.  This has resulted in an overall reduction in the payments made by the HSE for this allowance from some &euro;3.762 million in 2009 to approximately &euro;3.121 million in 2013.    <\/p><p>  GPs contracted under the GMS Scheme are paid an annual capitation payment in respect of each patient on their GMS list.  Up until 2010, this capitation payment was based on the patient's age, gender and the distance they lived from the GP's surgery.  In 2010, under FEMPI, the aspect relating to distance from the GP's surgery was removed as a factor in calculating capitation fees.  In this context, it should be noted that the 2010 Regulations imposed a variety of reductions across a range of fees and allowances averaging just over 9% in total.  While the reduction in certain fees was more than 9%, the reduction in others was less than 9%.  In making such determinations, the Department was mindful of information from the HSE which indicated that 90% of GP consultations take place at the GP surgery and do not involve a home visit &ndash; also many of the home visits are undertaken out-of-hours by GPs in co-ops, where the GP has the use of a car and driver funded by the HSE, which they can also use for home visits to private patients.  The Department, in arriving at its final determination in relation to the range of percentage reductions also ensured that the reduction in relation to the superannuable fees was kept to a minimum, thus minimising the reduction in the GPs&rsquo; pensions at a later stage (superannuable fees were only reduced by 3.5%).  In relation to the removal of &ldquo;distance&rdquo; as a factor in calculating certain fees, the total estimated full year saving for this measure in 2010 was &euro;5.2 million.<\/p><p>While GP   numbers are keeping pace with overall demographics, this does not always prevent shortages occurring at local level.  GPs once qualified tend to work for existing GP practices or as self-employed contractors - and are free to decide where to establish practice.  Isolated rural areas and deprived urban areas, very often with limited private practice opportunities, may sometimes find it difficult to attract GPs to fill vacant posts.<\/p><p>The HSE is actively seeking to address this issue at present with the medical organisations with a view to developing practical measures - including reorganising lists with existing doctors in local areas, and through the development of more flexible contractual arrangements which would encourage young GPs to work in such areas.  This will be examined as part of the overall GMS contract discussions between the Department, HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation, which will begin shortly.<\/p><p>  In relation to the particular aspect relating to the breakdown of spend by County for the Rural Practice Allowance, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102200044#WRP01400","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabled Drivers and Passengers Scheme","counter":327,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102200044#WRP01500"},{"type":"question","counter":328,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[40795\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102200044#WRP01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when is the replacement for the motorised transport grant scheme and the mobility allowance scheme likely to come into place; if he will make it a priority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":329,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[40617\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102200044#WRP01650","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide an update, with a clear timeframe as to the progress that has been made on developing an appropriate scheme to replace the mobility allowance scheme and motorised transport grant; the progress that has been made in the development of new schemes; when we will see this in operation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1093","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":330,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[40629\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102200044#WRP01675","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he will have a decision, and details of, the replacement for the mobility allowance scheme and motorised transport grant; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1093","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":331,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120, 138 and 142 together.<\/p><p>The policy proposals to be brought for Government's consideration for the drafting of primary legislation for a new travel subsidy scheme for people with severe disabilities, are currently under consideration in the Department of Health.

Each year, as part of its ongoing awareness raising about Lyme disease and methods of preventing or minimising potential exposure through tick bites, HPSC holds a &quot;Lyme Disease Awareness Week&quot;, in which media releases are sent out with the intention that media outlets would take up the important Lyme prevention messages.

Research carried out to date by the relevant international organisations, including by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), has concluded that depleted uranium does not pose a significant radiological risk.  Other research has consistently returned inconclusive results.  Ireland has voted in favour of the four resolutions on depleted uranium taken at the United Nations General Assembly since 2007, most recently in December 2012 when General Assembly Resolution 67\/36 was supported by 155 States.  These resolutions requested the UN Secretary-General to seek the views of member States and relevant international organisations on the effects of the use of armaments and ammunition containing depleted uranium.  I have instructed my delegation to again vote in favour of the resolution at the General Assembly this year.<\/p><p>  Following consultations with the Department of Defence, Ireland provided a national report to the UN Secretary-General in 2009.  Ireland&rsquo;s submission confirmed that while there is no practical method of testing people that may have been exposed to depleted uranium, thorough medical examinations are carried out on all Defence Forces personnel returning from deployment overseas.

The apparent arrest, detention and prosecution of Mr Rajab for the peaceful exercise of the right to freedom of expression is of great concern.  Reports indicate that his trial, which commenced on Sunday, will continue on 29 October.  Mr Rajab was released from prison earlier this year, and, since then, has been continuing to act as an important voice on human rights matters in Bahrain, including, inter alia, by his participation in the work of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.  Officials from my Department have met with Mr Rajab since his release to discuss with him the circumstances of his previous detention and the human rights situation in Bahrain more generally.  In 2013, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention found that Mr. Rajab&rsquo;s previous detention was arbitrary.  Ireland has always attached priority to safeguarding the position and rights of human rights defenders and has continually advocated that civil society actors must be free to operate in a safe and enabling environment, free from repression.

Discussions were largely dominated by the Ebola crisis in West Africa, as well as by developments in the EU&rsquo;s Southern and Eastern Neighbourhoods.  In opening remarks, High Representative (HR) Ashton gave a short update on the progress of the negotiations with Iran on the nuclear dossier.  In addition, HR Ashton welcomed the orderly conduct of elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina on 12 October. Council Conclusions on Bosnia-Herzegovina were adopted without discussion.  The first formal agenda item for discussion was the Ebola crisis and there followed an extensive exchange of views, involving the participation of European Commissioners Georgieva (International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response) and Borg (Health).  Clearly the outbreak and spread of the disease is a cause of great concern to all EU Member States. During our discussions there was a strong commitment to step up efforts to prevent the spread of the disease, and to increase efforts to improve the coordination of efforts on the ground, including in terms of providing appropriate support to medical personnel. In my intervention, I welcomed the discussion, stressing both the leading role of the UN, as well as the importance of EU coordination. I also provided the Council with a read-out from Minister of State Sherlock&rsquo;s recent visit to Sierra Leone. The Council Conclusions received strong support and draw together the key aspects of cooperation and coordination at EU and the wider international level.<\/p><p>  Ministers were later joined by the UN Special Representative on Libya and Head of UNSMIL (United Nations Support Mission in Libya) Bernadino Leon who updated us on recent developments in Libya and ongoing mediation efforts. Council Conclusions on Libya were adopted by the Council.<\/p><p>  The Council adopted conclusions on the situation in Iraq and Syria. These Conclusions unequivocally condemn atrocities, killings and human rights abuses perpetrated by ISIS and other terrorist groups in both Syria and Iraq, as well as by the Assad regime in Syria. The Conclusions also highlight the ongoing humanitarian challenges, and the need to implement UN Security Council resolutions 2139 and 2165 which provide for the lifting of restrictions on humanitarian relief and cross-border assistance. The Council also agreed to expand restrictive measures against the Assad regime, including a new ban on the export of aviation fuel to Syria.<\/p><p>  Ministers then had a short exchange on Ukraine. The Conclusions adopted by the Council noted the decreased level of violence while regretting and condemning the continued numerous violations of the ceasefire. The Council called for all parties&rsquo; full engagement and swift implementation of the Minsk document.<\/p><p>  Finally, the Council turned its attentions to the Middle East Peace Process and the situation in Gaza where there was a useful exchange of views.  High Representative Ashton debriefed Ministers on the outcome of the donor's conference for Gaza on 12 October in Cairo, which I attended. My comments welcomed the outcome of the Conference &ndash; where Ireland pledged &euro;2.5 million in humanitarian assistance and reconstruction aid &ndash; while emphasising that this funding could only be effective in an environment where the conflict was not going to resume. As I have stated before, it is imperative that the underlying issues in Gaza are addressed and resolved politically.

The Council recognised that a united and increased effort is needed to contain the outbreak and to provide the necessary assistance to the countries affected.  In this respect, we stressed the importance of reinforcing regional and international cooperation and welcomed, in particular, the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s decision to establish the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER).  It represents an important step in the global efforts to contain the outbreak; to assist with the management and coordination of the international response; and to take a strong leadership role at national levels.  The Council recognised also the need to support international health workers who are essential in responding to the emergency and agreed that the EU will provide appropriate care for them, including the possibility of medical evacuation if necessary.<\/p><p>  During the discussion, I reiterated the urgent need to intensify support for the West Africa region in particular by addressing gaps in leadership and coordination through UNMEER, by addressing funding needs and by addressing the urgent need for more international health-care professionals in the isolation and treatment centres.

Part of this process involves the collection of information in relation to the social context of schools.<br\/><br\/>The working group report recommended that a school's social context should be used because it can contribute strongly to the level of learning needs that students have.  The report considered that, on the basis of available research evidence, the use of a school's social context is valid in developing an educational profile, as socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with the incidence of certain types of special educational needs, including low achievement in academic learning and emotional or behavioural disorders. <br\/><br\/>The report also noted that a school within a disadvantaged social context may have a higher share of students presenting with emotional or behavioural disorders. While some of these needs are likely to be reflected in low test scores, others may not, as students with relatively high levels of educational achievement can have emotional and behavioural disorders. <br\/><br\/>My Department therefore, in conjunction with the NCSE, asked the Educational Research Centre (ERC) to conduct a survey of schools to assist the development of an educational profile.<br\/><br\/>Though recognising that all schools would not be able to have specific detail regarding all of the questions asked in relation to their pupil populations, schools were asked to provide their best possible estimates in relation to the questions being asked in the survey, in order to ensure that as accurate as possible a social context allocation component of any revised allocation model could be developed for each school.  <br\/><br\/>The data which schools were requested to return as part of the survey was non-personal, anonymised data and, schools were not asked to return data in relation to the social circumstances of individual pupils.<br\/><br\/>Schools were also advised that the ERC had put in place a dedicated phone help line in order to provide assistance and support to schools in completing the questionnaire. I understand that many schools used this help line to gain assistance in completing the questionnaire.<br\/><br\/>Whereas I understand that the return of this survey has caused extra work and some difficulties for some schools, I am confident that having up to date social context data will be highly beneficial to my Department and the NCSE in developing proposals for a new profiled allocation model for schools.<br\/><br\/>I also wish to advise the Deputy that following publication of the working group report, my Department invited education partners, stakeholders, and parent representative groups to make written submissions in relation to the NCSE report. 26 written submissions have been received to date, from interested parties. <br\/><br\/>My Department also held a number of consultation meetings on 1 and 3 October last with stakeholders, education partners, and parent representative groups. <br\/><br\/>Consultation has been a key feature of the development of this policy advice to date and I can confirm that consultation will continue to take place at each stage of the development of proposals for any new model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102200055#WRAA00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Provision","counter":531,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102200055#WRAA00500"},{"type":"question","counter":532,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[40685\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014102200055#WRAA00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding school transport in view of the recent expansion of Solas, ETB, Momentum courses here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The Council supports over 50 multidisciplinary venues (also supported by local authorities), large festivals (such as the Galway, Kilkenny and Earagail Arts Festivals), a significant number of artform specific festivals and up to 150 small-to-medium sized festivals spread all through the country.  <br\/><br\/>In January 2013, the Arts in Education Charter was launched as a joint initiative with the Minister for Education and Skills. The Charter places new responsibilities on Government Departments, agencies, cultural institutions and arts organisations to provide and promote arts-in-education among children and young people. <br\/><br\/>A High Level Implementation Group, chaired by Professor John Coolahan, Professor Emeritus, NUI, Maynooth, was set up to oversee the implementation of the Arts in Education Charter.  Progress is being made on a number of initiatives, including increasing the number of Artists in Residence<i><\/i>in colleges of education and developing a website\/portal as a key communications and information channel for both the education and arts sectors. Suitable models for artists to become involved in the programme are also being examined by this Group.<br\/><br\/>There is a range of ways in which my Department is supporting arts, cultural and heritage initiatives in conjunction with local groups and communities.

I consider it very fitting that this project is being advanced as part of the 1916 Commemorations Programme since the development of Teach an Phiarsaigh will bring together the legacy of P&aacute;draig Pearse&rsquo;s contribution to Irish history and education and, in particular, his involvement with the Irish language and the Gaeltacht community.
