This was introduced as a measure of solidarity with other workers.  Those whose income is less than &euro;100 per week do not pay PRSI and return their income under PRSI class M.  All public office holders are liable to pay the contribution regardless of age. <\/p>  <p>  All workers pay PRSI on their earnings from employment or self-employment.  In the case of individuals who have more than one income source, PRSI is generally paid on all forms of income.  <\/p>  <p>  Up to 2013 certain exemptions applied to specific groups.  The removal of the exemption in relation to modified rate contributors with income from a trade or profession was introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 and the removal of the exemption in respect of employed contributors and occupational pensioners under age 66 years whose only additional income is unearned income was introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2013.  <\/p>  <p>  This means that, with effect from 1 January 2014, unearned income such as rental income, investment income, dividends and interest on deposits and savings of the individuals who were previously exempt, is liable to PRSI at 4% provided the person is a chargeable person in accordance with the Revenue definition.  <\/p>  <p>  A chargeable person does not include a PAYE taxpayer (i) who does not have other income or (ii) who has an element of other insignificant income that is fully taxed through the Office of the Revenue Commissioners PAYE system (Revenue regard amounts not exceeding &euro;3,174 as insignificant).  Individuals with income exceeding &euro;3,174 must pay and file under Revenue's self-assessing system. <\/p>  <p>  This income is chargeable at the class K PRSI rate of 4%.  This PRSI charge does not give rise to any additional social insurance benefits.  Individuals may however qualify separately for social insurance entitlements based on PRSI paid on other sources of income i.e. PRSI paid on income from their employment.<\/p>  <p>  Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory) as well as guardians payment (contributory), maternity benefit and adoptive benefit.  Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer's PRSI is 8.5%).<\/p>  <p>  Self-employed workers who find themselves out of business and become unemployed or ill may access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker's allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker's allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker's allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband\/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.<\/p>  <p>  If income from self-employment falls below &euro;5,000 in a contribution year or a person is unable to work, he or she may opt to pay voluntary contributions. <\/p>  <p>  To become a voluntary contributor a person must:<\/p>  <p>  -  have paid at least 468 weeks PRSI (since 6 April 2014) in either employment or self-employment,<\/p>  <p>  -  apply within 12 months of the end of the tax year during which he\/she last paid compulsory insurance or were last awarded a credited contribution,<\/p>  <p>  -  agree to pay voluntary contributions from the start of the contribution week that follows the week in which he\/she leaves compulsory insurance.<\/p>  <p>  To become a voluntary contributor on or after 6 April 2015 a person must have previously paid 520 weeks PRSI.<\/p>  <p>  My Department undertakes advertising and awareness activities to ensure that all members of the public are made aware of their rights and entitlements and that they are kept informed of significant changes and improvements in schemes and services as they occur.<\/p>  <p>  Information on the full range of social welfare schemes and services is available from the Department's INTREO\/local office network and the nationwide network of Citizens Information Centres.

Budget 2014 further extended the reduced rates of jobseeker's allowance to recipients under 26 years of age. This is a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency. It aims to incentivise young jobseeker's allowance recipients to avail of education and training opportunities.  If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker's allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160. Any change to provision in this area would be a matter for Government to consider in a Budgetary context.<\/p>  <p>  Based on data from February, 2015 the additional full year cost of providing a weekly rate of &euro;188 for all jobseeker's allowance recipients aged 25 and under is some &euro;143m.<\/p>  <p>  To guard against the development of welfare dependency I believe that it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If they do not improve their skills, it will be much more difficult for them to avail of job opportunities as the economy recovers and they are at risk of becoming long term unemployed from a young age.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is through policies to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.  This strategy has been succeeding, with an increase of over 80,000 in employment over the last two years.<\/p>  <p>  Reflecting the improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall. For example the youth unemployment rate in Ireland as estimated by Eurostat was 21.6% in December 2014 as compared to 30.8% in December 2011. However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular. This is the rationale behind the Government's Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400056#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Allowance Eligibility","counter":118,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400056#WRC01650"},{"type":"question","counter":119,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[11249\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400056#WRC01700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if parents' disability benefit or social welfare payments will be made non-assessable for means tests for adult children who are living with their parents and applying for the jobseeker's allowance (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1195","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":120,"content":"<p>Social welfare legislation provides that where a person under 25 years of age claims jobseeker's allowance and is living with a parent or step-parent in the family home, an assessment is made of the yearly value of any benefit and privilege enjoyed by that person by virtue of residing there.<\/p>  <p>  The value of the benefit and privilege assessed is based on the level of the parents' assessable income.

As of 19<sup>th<\/sup>March 2015, over 38,269 interns had commenced on the scheme, while there are 6,033 interns currently participating on the programme. There are currently 1,086 internships advertised on the JobsIreland website.<\/p><p>The numbers of JobBridge interns under 25 years of age by County of serving local welfare office are attached in table 1.<\/p><p>The Department does not routinely maintain separate records of an intern's rate of Social Welfare payments prior to commencing and during the internship. As noted there are currently 6,033 individuals on JobBridge.  The cost of paying those interns an extra &euro;50 per week would amount to circa &euro;11.76m over a nine month period of an internship. <\/p><p>A total of 11,606 internships commenced between 30<sup>th<\/sup>December, 2013 and 18<sup>th<\/sup>December, 2014.  A contribution of &euro;500 in respect of each of these internships would amount to &euro;5,803,000 in respect of 2014.<\/p><p>The &euro;50 weekly top-up paid to interns is in acknowledgement of extra expenses that may be incurred over and above those of the normal job search. It is not related to training and development expenses.  There is nothing to prevent a Host Organisations reimbursing an Intern for expenses incurred as part of the internship.  However, expenses should not be provided for normal activities such as travel to and from the main location of the internship.<\/p><p>The purpose of JobBridge is to help unemployed jobseekers break the cycle whereby they cannot find a job without appropriate experience but cannot find appropriate experience without a job. To date it has been very successful in delivering on this objective with this success being partly attributable to the wide variety of internship opportunities that it supports.<\/p><p>Given that unemployed jobseekers are drawn from many walks of life and have varying levels of work experience and educational qualifications it is essential that Internship opportunities cover many occupations\/disciplines from high skill specialist placements to lower skilled general placements.  Therefore JobBridge opportunities are not confined to the type internships that were, and continue to be a feature of, some 'white collar' professions.<\/p><p>Pathways to Work 2015 includes a commitment to evaluate a range of activation processes and programmes, including JobBridge.  A high level evaluation work plan has been agreed and endorsed by the Labour Market Council. The Department is currently in the process of implementing the work plan, which will consist of a number of separate evaluations across a number of programmes including JobBridge. These evaluations will assess the impacts of programmes in terms of employment outcomes for participants. It is expected that the evaluation of JobBridge will commence later in 2015 with results anticipated by Q1 2016.<\/p><p>I have no plans at present to restrict internships in sectors with low levels of progression into employment. JobBridge interns gain marketable skills and work experience that can take them into employment in organisations and sectors other than those with which they participate in JobBridge.  An independent evaluation of JobBridge found only minimal levels of displacement. The Department takes any complaints of abuse of the JobBridge Scheme seriously.  All such complaints are investigated thoroughly, and necessary action is taken, if required.  The Department also operates a monitoring system to ensure that all internships are of a high quality. If any individual knows of specific instances of abuse of JobBridge details should be provided to the Department for investigation.<\/p><p>Host Organisations are also subject to conditions, including cooling-off periods, to limit any abuse of the scheme. If an internship finishes and the Intern concerned is unsuccessful in gaining employment the Host Organisation is subject to a six month cooling off period before they can re-advertise an internship in the same filed of work.  In circumstances where an intern moves into employment with either the host organisation or another organisation the cooling off period of six months is waived. The Department does not routinely keep records of the number of times the cooling-off period is waived.<\/p><p>With regard to levels of dissatisfaction interns and host organisation can contact the dedicated JobBridge team, the established Departmental complaints system and the staff at the local Intreo centres to register any concerns that they might have. <\/p><p>A charter is already in place in the form of a standard agreement that must be signed by the intern and the host organisation. It is not in the form of a statutory obligation as JobBridge is an administrative (i.e., non-statutory) scheme. <\/p><p>Each host organisation are required to nominate an individual to support and\/or mentor the Intern during the placement. This person will have responsibility to ensure that the Intern receives a proper induction, ensure that the work experience as described in the standard agreement is progressing, and that monthly compliance checks are being completed (to ensure the Internship allowance continues to be paid by DSP). If an organisation has a formal mentoring programme, they include the Intern in this programme. The Department provides a range of resources and toolkits to support the mentoring of interns.  Host organisations are instructed to read these carefully before offering an internship.<\/p><p>First Steps is a new under which employers are being asked to sponsor work experience places of four days duration per week for very disadvantaged young people. All participants will be selected by the Department of Social Protection (not as under JobBridge by the host organisation), will be allocated a dedicated case officer throughout their placement and will receive pre-placement training.  The Department of Social Protection will only select clients who are available for, and whom it believes will benefit from, a First Steps placement.  In such circumstances the Department believes clients should have a very strong reason not to participate and in the absence of such a reason participation should be mandatory.  The short preparation course for participants will be provided by Education and Training Boards and will consist of basic workplace skills and etiquette, timekeeping and communication skills and will last approximately one week.  A total of &euro;57.111m has been allocated for First Steps up to the end of 2017.  As of 19<sup>th<\/sup>March, 89 places have been committed by host organisations for the First Steps programme.<\/p><p><b>JobBridge Interns under 25 by County<\/b><table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>Finished<\/th><th>Current<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>DUBLIN<\/td><td>2,948<\/td><td>413<\/td><td>3,361<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CORK<\/td><td>753<\/td><td>104<\/td><td>857<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GALWAY  <\/td><td>550<\/td><td>84<\/td><td>634<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LIMERICK<\/td><td>454<\/td><td>88<\/td><td>542<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DONEGAL<\/td><td>340<\/td><td>70<\/td><td>410<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILDARE <\/td><td>343<\/td><td>56<\/td><td>399<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY <\/td><td>319<\/td><td>63<\/td><td>382<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WEXFORD<\/td><td>299<\/td><td>52<\/td><td>351<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LOUTH<\/td><td>289<\/td><td>52<\/td><td>341<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WATERFORD<\/td><td>267<\/td><td>65<\/td><td>332<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH<\/td><td>250<\/td><td>50<\/td><td>300<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MEATH<\/td><td>241<\/td><td>49<\/td><td>290<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MAYO<\/td><td>239<\/td><td>50<\/td><td>289<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KERRY<\/td><td>226<\/td><td>52<\/td><td>278<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WICKLOW <\/td><td>203<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>236<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN <\/td><td>177<\/td><td>25<\/td><td>202<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SLIGO  <\/td><td>171<\/td><td>29<\/td><td>200<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CLARE<\/td><td>163<\/td><td>31<\/td><td>194<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LAOIS<\/td><td>143<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>176<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILKENNY<\/td><td>144<\/td><td>23<\/td><td>167<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>OFFALY<\/td><td>127<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>155<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CAVAN<\/td><td>125<\/td><td>29<\/td><td>154<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CARLOW<\/td><td>119<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>136<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON  <\/td><td>75<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>97<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LONGFORD<\/td><td>69<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>78<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LEITRIM  <\/td><td>50<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>56<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Grand Total<\/td><td>9,084<\/td><td>1,533<\/td><td>10,617<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400056#WRC03600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":141,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[11254\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400056#WRC03700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the total number of JobBridge participants who were awarded a training employment support grant since July 2011.","asker":"1028","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":142,"content":"<p>The numbers of JobBridge participants awarded a Training Employment Support Grant (TESG) are only available from 2012 when my Department took over the administration of the scheme.<\/p><p>The number of JobBridge participants who were supported by TESG for the period 2012 to end of February 2015 is 1,976.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400056#WRC03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Allowance Data","counter":143,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400056#WRC03850"},{"type":"question","counter":144,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[11255\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400056#WRC03900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of young persons under 25 years of age, by county, in receipt of jobseeker's allowance, jobseeker's benefit or signing on for credits for four months or more.","asker":"1028","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[11258\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400056#WRC04000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of persons under 25 years of age in receipt of jobseeker's benefit, jobseeker's allowance or signing on for credits for less than 12 months; for 12 to 24 months; for 24 to 36 months; for 36 to 48 months; for 48 to 60 months; and for more than 60 months; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1028","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":146,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 172 and 175 together.<\/p><p>At the end of February 2015 a total of 42,088 persons under the age of 25 years old were in receipt of jobseeker's benefit, jobseeker's allowance or signing on for credits.

The forum will also showcase projects involved with the UN Day for the Eradication of Poverty and other social inclusion initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately 200 delegates are registered to attend from community and voluntary groups across the country, including people experiencing poverty and social exclusion. Officials from government departments and agencies will also be in attendance.<\/p>  <p>  The Social Inclusion Monitor 2013 will be published to coincide with the forum.

Therefore, when assessing whether an individual is entitled to a State pension, and to ensure that they can maximise such entitlement, all contributions (paid or credited) from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account. <\/p>  <p>  The State already assists those with caring roles to qualify for a State pension (contributory). The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated people to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which their contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average contribution.  Given the valuable nature of the State pension (contributory), those who qualify under the homemaker's scheme still need to fulfil the eligibility requirements for that scheme, and have at least 520 paid contributions over the course of their working lives. <\/p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support.  If someone has been a carer for nearly all of their adult life and has paid little or no PRSI, they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;219, which amounts to just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory).  Alternatively, if their spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;206.30, which is just under 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory). <\/p>  <p>  It is expected that a total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) from 2020, although that date is subject to change.  Issues such as equality of outcomes for women and men, including those who spend some years outside the labour market on caring duties, will be considered carefully in the context of that reform. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400058#WRE00600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"JobsPlus Scheme","counter":198,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400058#WRE00650"},{"type":"question","counter":199,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[11450\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400058#WRE00700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will extend JobsPlus to those in receipt of the One-Parent Family Payment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1045","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":200,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[11451\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400058#WRE00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason persons on apprenticeships cannot qualify for JobsPlus; her views on relaxing this rule; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1045","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":201,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 194 and 195 together.<\/p>  <p>  JobsPlus provides a direct monthly financial incentive to employers who recruit employees from the Live Register and those transitioning into employment.

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer's PRSI is 8.5%).<\/p>  <p>  Self-employed workers who find themselves out of business and become unemployed or ill may access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker's allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker's allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker's allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband\/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.<\/p>  <p>  Self-employed people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance have access to the full range of activation measures available through the State.  Given the scale of unemployment levels, the key objective of activation policy and labour market initiatives is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency.  This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people.  However, many services are available to the formerly self-employed who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.<\/p>  <p>  Some employment services, such as assistance with job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department's employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status.  Unemployed persons, including the previously self-employed, not in receipt of payments may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities but are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course.  Springboard courses are open to people who were previously self-employed, regardless of their social welfare status.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.<\/p>  <p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker's allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker's allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker's benefit.<\/p>  <p>  The Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.<\/p>  <p>  This recommendation will require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which indicated that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  The Actuarial Review found that the effective annual rate of contribution needed to provide the full rate State pension (contributory), currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%. <\/p>  <p>  My colleagues in Government and I will continue to reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue and will further consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400058#WRE02600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":228,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 206 to 220, inclusive, answered with Question No. 170.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Guarantee","counter":230,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400060#WRG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":231,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[11751\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400060#WRG00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide an update on the implementation of the Youth Guarantee, including information on the number of education, training and work experience places provided in 2014; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1190","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":232,"content":"<p>The Government's primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people. This strategy has been succeeding, with an increase of over 80,000 in employment over the last 2 years. <\/p><p>However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular. This is the rationale behind the Government's Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.<\/p><p>Within this framework, the Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed. The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs. For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for. Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training. Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and Tus, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment. <\/p><p>Overall, the Youth Guarantee provided nearly 25,000 places for young people in 2014. This figure excludes some 24,000 places provided for young people through PLC courses and apprenticeships. These PLC and apprenticeship places, together with the wide range of vocational third-level courses provided for the young, although not reserved for unemployed jobseekers, nevertheless contribute to the spirit of the guarantee. <\/p><p>Pathways to Work 2014 targets with respect to the Youth Guarantee have largely been achieved. Models for the engagement of young people through Intreo have been agreed and will form the basis of the national roll-out of the Youth Guarantee in 2015. Potential refinement of these models may be considered on the basis of outcomes and learning from the Ballymun Youth Guarantee Pilot Project.

The telephone allowance was introduced at a time when telephones were expensive and uncommon and a landline service was the only option available to the client. The market has changed considerably since the introduction of the allowance, with several companies providing a range of services and rates with bundled services including television, telephone, broadband and pay-as-you-go mobiles. In addition, the cost of the telephone allowance scheme has risen each year with the number of eligible clients also increasing significantly. In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance compared with almost 396,000 at the end of September 2013, an increase of 25%. Each year almost 10,000 extra clients became eligible for the allowance because of the increased number of pension recipients.<\/p>  <p>  The overall concern of the Government in recent budgets has been to protect the primary weekly social welfare rates. Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is key in protecting people from poverty. To allow us to preserve these core payments, we have had to look very carefully at other additional payments. Accordingly, the telephone allowance was discontinued from 1 January 2014.  This decision provided annual savings of &euro;48 million and meant that the Department was able to retain the other elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence. The fuel allowance scheme and the free travel pass were also protected for older people and people with disabilities.  These are valuable supports for recipients.<\/p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of the impact on the Department's clients and particularly those who are living alone. As the Deputy is aware, in Budget 2015, we partially restored the Christmas Bonus and increased the living alone allowance to &euro;9.00 per week.  In these circumstances, I have no plans to restore the telephone allowance. Any decision to increase the household benefits package would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400061#WRH00600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Eligibility","counter":283,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400061#WRH00650"},{"type":"question","counter":284,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[12005\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400061#WRH00700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the circumstances which will allow a person rejoin a community employment scheme when the person's permitted time as an employee of the scheme expires.","asker":"1048","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":285,"content":"<p>With effect from 3<sup>rd<\/sup>April 2000, lifetime cumulative participation on Community Employment (CE) by an individual is as follows:<\/p><p>-  3 years (156 weeks) maximum for persons under 55 years of age.<\/p><p>-  6 years (312 weeks) for persons of 55 years of age up to State Pension age.<\/p><p>-  For people in receipt of a qualifying disability-linked social welfare payment, for those under 55 years of age (Part-Time Job Option only), 4 years cumulative time on CE applies and 7 years cumulative time for those between 55 and State Pension age (Part-Time Job Option only).<\/p><p>-  For referred clients to drug rehabilitation schemes, the standard eligibility requirements are waived and the maximum participation can be up to 4 years.<\/p><p>Participation on CE prior to 3<sup>rd<\/sup>April 2000 is not counted. <\/p><p>Once a person has exhausted their maximum duration of participation as detailed above, they must leave the scheme and can no longer participate. <\/p><p>All CE employment contracts are for one year's duration.

A Relationship Framework has been specified that defines the nature of the relationship between the Minister for Finance and each bank. These Frameworks were published on 30 March 2012 and can be found at .  <\/p><p>However from a general policy perspective, the approach of the Government is to support people in genuine mortgage arrears and where feasible, to put in place a sustainable restructure to address and resolve such a difficulty. This is clearly set out in the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears where it requires a lender in respect of a cooperating borrower to explore all of the options for an alternative repayment arrangement offered by that lender and that a lender must document its consideration of each option examined and the reasons why the options offered\/not offered to the borrower are\/are not appropriate and sustainable. <\/p><p>If a solution cannot be agreed between borrower and lender, or if it is agreed that a mortgage restructure is not a sustainable solution, there are alternative mechanisms available to allow a debtor remain in the house in appropriate cases. For example, the Mortgage to Rent scheme is available in cases where the house and household would be appropriate and eligible for social housing. Where the borrower and lender cannot agree on a sustainable mortgage restructure, the debtor has the option to formulate and propose a PIA to his\/her secured and other creditor(s). This initiative rests solely with the debtor and in formulating a PIA, a personal insolvency practitioner is under an onus, insofar as is reasonably practicable, to formulate the proposal on terms that will\u00a0not require the debtor to dispose of an interest in or cease to occupy a principal private residence.<\/p><p>I also note,\u00a0BOI's focus on the resolution of Irish mortgage and business related loans, by agreeing suitable and sustainable solutions, and the progress the bank has made in this regard. In its 2014 annual report,\u00a0BOI has stated that more than nine out of ten of its challenged owner occupied mortgage customers in Ireland\u00a0with restructuring arrangements are meeting the agreed repayments.\u00a0It is also worth noting that\u00a0BOI met the targets set by the CBI in relation to addressing mortgage arrears.<\/p><p>At the time of announcing its 2014 full-year results, Bank of Ireland management stated that it was prioritising the capital it was generating to facilitate the de-recognition of the 2009 preference shares. The remaining 2009\u00a0preference shares stand at &euro;1.3bn. Furthermore, management has stated that following de-recognition of the preference shares its ambition is to progress to payment of\u00a0dividends.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the fact that\u00a0management has indicated that the accelerated pace of the\u00a0bank's capital build has ensured that it is firmly on track to de-recognise the 2009 preference shares in 2016, it will be some time before there is clarity around the robustness of the bank's capital position which would allow such a de-recognition to take place\u00a0and subsequently the commencement of dividends. In addition\u00a0the SSM, as regulator, would have to satisfy itself, at the appropriate time, as to the\u00a0bank's dividend capacity in the context of its overall capital position. Accordingly, I am not willing to speculate\u00a0on how any plan the bank has in relation to dividends\u00a0might evolve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400062#WRJ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Repossession Rate","counter":331,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400062#WRJ01750"},{"type":"question","counter":332,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[11417\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400062#WRJ01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of private dwelling home repossession cases that were before the courts on 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":333,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[11418\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400062#WRJ01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of court orders that had been made but not yet enforced in respect of private dwelling home repossession cases as of 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":334,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 259 and 260 together.<\/p><p>While the Courts Service\u00a0operates as an independent corporate organisation,\u00a0primary responsibility for reporting on\u00a0matters before the Courts, including\u00a0home repossession cases, lies with the Department of Justice and Equality.\u00a0 We have asked that Department to source the data on repossession cases from the Courts Service and to forward it\u00a0directly to you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400062#WRJ02000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Universal Social Charge Application","counter":335,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400062#WRJ02050"},{"type":"question","counter":336,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[11436\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400062#WRJ02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if an official will contact a person (details supplied) in County Louth regarding a matter in relation to the universal social charge; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1069","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":337,"content":"<p>The Universal Social Charge was introduced by Section 3(1)(a) of the Finance Act 2011 and applies to specified income received on and after 1st January 2011.

In this regard, in Budget 2012, I fulfilled the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the rate of mortgage interest relief to 30 per cent for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period. This was the period during which house prices peaked.<\/p>  <p>  A mortgage holder will qualify for the increased rate if they made their first mortgage interest payment in the period 2004 to 2008 or if they drew down their mortgage in that period. In addition, the increased rate of tax relief for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period will continue up to and including the 2017 tax year.<\/p>  <p>  Individuals that purchased their home within this specified date range are entitled to a 30% rate of relief on interest paid up to an interest ceiling of &euro;20,000 if married\/widowed and &euro;10,000 if single, for the first seven years. Thereafter, the ceiling reduces for the remaining years to a maximum of &euro;6,000 if married\/widowed and &euro;3,000 if single. The ceilings reduce in recognition of the fact that interest makes up a larger proportion of the mortgage payable in the earlier years of the mortgage period, and that capital makes up a larger proportion of the mortgage payable thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy's question concerning the month during which the mortgage is first taken out, Mortgage Interest Relief is granted up to the full appropriate ceiling for that year, and each subsequent year up to 2017, regardless of which month the mortgage payments actually commence. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy's question concerning individuals who built their family home at the end of 2004, it is not clear from the question which particular circumstance the Deputy has concerns about. However, I would point out that the look back period for tax relief purposes in respect of the tax years 2004 and 2005 has now passed.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the issue of mortgage difficulties, the latest publication from my Department shows the continued improvement in Principal Dwelling House (PDH) mortgage arrears since August 2013. The number of mortgage accounts in arrears of greater than 90 days has declined by almost 25%, while those accounts in arrears of less than 90 days fell by almost 28%. Total PDH mortgage accounts in arrears show a decline of almost 26% over the same time period from 118,438 in September 2013 to 87,818 at end January 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Total Mortgage accounts that have been restructured now stand at 106,275. The number of mortgage accounts in arrears of greater than 90 days continues to fall, decreasing by 1,398 accounts to 60,868.\u00a0 Engagement between consumers and lenders has resulted in an increase of 2,764 permanent mortgage restructures in January.<\/p>  <p>  Given that the next Budget is almost seven months away it would be inappropriate for me to become involved in speculation on this matter. However, I will say that as part of the normal budgetary preparations, my officials continue to monitor the situation and will be examining potential options for changes to the tax system for my consideration as part of the overall Budget package. However, given that Mortgage Interest Relief has effectively been abolished since 2013 for new mortgages, I am not predisposed to reopen it to further amendment to provide additional benefits to existing claimants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400063#WRK00600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information Data","counter":366,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400063#WRK00650"},{"type":"question","counter":367,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[11799\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400063#WRK00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of occasions since the start of 2014 in which the Secretary General of his Department has been involved in the clearing or approval of material for release under freedom of information legislation.","asker":"983","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":368,"content":"<p>Under section 20 of the Freedom of Information Act, 2014 I have delegated the powers of decision maker and reviewer to officers in my Department.\u00a0In practice this means that Assistant Principal Officers or equivalents are decision makers and Principal Officers or equivalents act as reviewers of Freedom of Information requests made under the Act to my Department.

I have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change or\u00a0to the mortgage interest rates charged.\u00a0 It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.\u00a0 It is not appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to comment on or become involved in the detailed mortgage position of mortgage holders.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations. The Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. As I stated in previous Parliamentary Questions, a previous Deputy Governor indicated that, within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise.The Deputy should be aware that the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr Patrick Honohan in his opening statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last November stated that, as in most advanced economies, including Ireland, it has long been understood that tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counterproductive in ensuring a sufficient flow of properly priced credit on a lasting basis. Such control would strongly discourage new entrants. In this regard, ongoing competition in the banking sector will be crucial in ensuring that the economy is provided with efficient and cost effective banking services. In this regard, there has been some movements on mortgage interest rates of late by a number of institutions which suggest that the market may well be entering a new and more competitive phase. The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned. This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding.However, as part of the Central Bank's work on mortgage arrears, lenders were asked to consider all avenues to help customers in arrears, including interest rate reductions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400064#WRL01000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabled Drivers Grant Appeals","counter":405,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400064#WRL01050"},{"type":"question","counter":406,"qnumday":286,"qnumall":"[12019\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400064#WRL01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a person (details supplied) in County Meath has made an appeal through the Medical Board under the Disabled Drivers and the Disabled Passengers Scheme 1994; if the appeal was unsuccessful, the other options available to this person especially if their condition has not deteriorated after six months of the appeal.","asker":"1180","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":407,"content":"<p>The Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal has informed me that the person (details supplied) had her appeal heard and was unsuccessful in the appeal. \u00a0If an appeal is refused, a citizen can reapply after six months if there is a deterioration in their condition. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400064#WRL01200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Levy","counter":408,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400064#WRL01250"},{"type":"question","counter":409,"qnumday":287,"qnumall":"[12021\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400064#WRL01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the level of funds that have been generated by the non-life insurance levy to date since it was first applied in 1982; the amount paid out by the insurance compensation fund during the same period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":410,"content":"<p>The Central Bank of Ireland has responsibility under Section 6 of the Insurance Act 1964 to assess the\u00a0Insurance Compensation Fund\u00a0from time to time to see if it needs financial support.

The USC rates cited in Option 4 are applied to both PAYE and self-employed income. I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, consistent with the Option 4 proposal, the aforementioned estimates do not make any provision for exemptions currently available\u00a0 to either medical card holders or individuals aged 70 or over\u00a0 on income less than &euro;60,000.<\/p>  <p>  All figures above are estimates from the Revenue tax forecasting model for 2015, using the actual data for the year 2012 (the latest year for which data are available) adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim.

As a result of the Review the Government decided in Budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the Universal Social Charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum. It is estimated that this removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge.\u00a0 In Budget 2015 I extended this exemption threshold to &euro;12,012 to apply from 1 January 2015 onwards.

This funding has allowed substantial works to be undertaken which will have reduced the flood risk considerable in the town.

While OPW representatives sit on the Project Steering Group which oversees the project, responsibility for the day to day running and management of the scheme, including Health and Safety matters, site supervision and public liaison, rests with WCC.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Deputy's question on the Castle Street junction with the Dargle road, I am informed by WCC that, in its view, the junction and road condition is not in a very unsafe condition. While the footpaths and road lining in the area require further work, the area cannot be finally re-surfaced until the piled river wall is complete and the boardwalk is installed.  If footpaths and road lining at this location were re-laid now it would have to be ripped up and re-done at a later date to facilitate the boardwalk. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to your query on the prevention of unsafe access to the flood relief construction site, I am advised by WCC that two security companies using cameras and night time patrols are employed  by WCC for site security. The monitoring of site safety hazards and the repair and strengthening of security fencing is carried out on an ongoing basis by WCC and its agents. The statutory safety file is being maintained, in line with statutory requirements and best practice, by the consultants hired by WCC. As the OPW is not the contracting authority for the project it is not required to approve the Safety Statement.  I am further informed by WCC that regular safety inspections are being carried out by the construction team and consultants, as required by law and best practice.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the People's Park, I understand that a substantial part of it was handed back for public use in November last year and that WCC plans to hand back the remaining, relatively small areas, which are currently being used for works compounds in September 2016. <\/p>  <p>  As the OPW is not the Contracting Authority on the project it is not responsible for conducting traffic audits.  Satisfactory management of construction traffic will be required of the successful contractors as part of their methodology for undertaking the works. WCC will arrange regular inspection of traffic safety measures as part of its management of the works construction.<\/p>  <p>  I am further advised by WCC that works to the river bank at La Vallee were emergency works, arranged because of the imminent danger of collapse of the river bank adjacent to apartment and office blocks. The landscaping works being carried out at the apartment blocks at present are re-instatement works and regular and detailed consultation with the apartment owners is ongoing. The opposite bank will be planted in the near future to further stabilise the bank. This planting will be undertaken in accordance with the general principles of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), and as this bank was envisaged by the EIS to be excavated, it will be planted to the standard envisaged by the EIS, or better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400065#WRM02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1106"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pensions","counter":477,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400066#WRN00150"},{"type":"question","counter":478,"qnumday":312,"qnumall":"[12117\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400066#WRN00200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will meet with the Alliance of Retired Public Servants, in advance of the completion of his annual review of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009 to 2013; if consideration will be given to the imposition of the public service pension reduction on pensions, in view of the improvement in the Exchequer balance; if he has discussed the application of the universal social charge with the Minister for Finance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Indeed, the first of the five strands set out in Pathways to Work is to ensure better engagement with unemployed people and jobless households.  To that end the Department of Social Protection committed to preparing a report on jobless households to assess the factors influencing the level of jobless households and develop a range of recommendations to allow Government to take tangible steps to assist these households to return to work.  In June 2014, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, published the report \"Jobless Households: An Exploration of the Issues\".  The report notes the sharp increase in jobless households in Ireland following the economic crash in 2008 and that Ireland has a high level of household joblessness compared to other European countries, with nearly one-quarter, 23 per cent of households in Ireland described as jobless (in 2010).  NESC refer to the responses made to address the problem of unemployment, if not specifically household joblessness namely, Action Plan for Jobs (APJ), Pathways to Work as well as the work of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare.  Notable reforms, according to NESC, include the transformation of the public employment and education and training services, as well as reconfiguration of the One Parent Family Payment. <\/p>  <p>  For my Department the focus continues to be on creating the conditions to support export-led, broadly-based economic growth and job creation via the Action Plan for Jobs.  The latest APJ was published in January and contains 382 actions broken down into quarterly steps and owners.  The objectives and actions set out in the Plan are designed to achieve specific impacts such as in terms of jobs, exports and startups, market penetration and innovation, efficiency of public interaction with business, finance and access to talent.  In terms of employment, almost 90,000 more people are at work since the launch of the first Action Plan for Jobs in 2012.  In terms of unemployment, last year over 141,000 people left the live register to take up work.  Unemployment is still at 10.4 per cent and many people and firms around the country are yet to feel the full benefits of the recovery.  The Government has pulled in by two years our full-employment target of 2.1 million at work from 2020 to 2018, and the Action Plan for Jobs and related strategies are in place to ensure that the unemployment problem and the associated issue of household joblessness is addressed.  It is also worth noting the role that budgetary policy has in this area, and a recent social impact assessment of the main welfare and tax measures in the Budget for 2015 finds that for the first time since the economic crisis, budgetary policy will result in an increase in average household incomes of 0.7 per cent.  Welfare increases favour lower income households, and there is a marked contrast between the impact of the 2015 and 2014 budgetary measures as gains replace losses, with the most significant improvements for the poorest and richest households.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400066#WRN01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Microenterprise Loan Fund Applications","counter":504,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400066#WRN01950"},{"type":"question","counter":505,"qnumday":321,"qnumall":"[12121\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400066#WRN02000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the position in respect of the 41% of microenterprises who applied for funding under the Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme which were rejected in the period 1 October 2012 to 31 December 2014; his plans to address concerns regarding this rejection for funding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It is expected that delegated sanction arrangements will be finalised shortly and will provide some flexibility to fill critical posts within agreed pay ceilings. <\/p>  <p>  Until such time as a delegated sanction is issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the existing Moratorium and ECF arrangements continue to apply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400068#WRP01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Milk Quota Data","counter":582,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400068#WRP01350"},{"type":"question","counter":583,"qnumday":347,"qnumall":"[11536\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400068#WRP01400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the measures that need to be put in place in the event of Ireland facing a substantial milk superlevy fine in the order of &euro;100 million, if Ireland stays at over-quota when the milk quota ends on 31 March 2015; if those measures could include reaching agreement with the European Union that farmers could spread the cost of the superlevy fine over a number of years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1194","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":584,"content":"<p>The end of February 2015 milk quota position, which is the latest currently available, shows that Ireland is an estimated 5.07% over quota, when account is taken of the butterfat content of the milk deliveries.  While this figure continues a downward trend in the over-quota position, coming down from 7.15% in October, indications are that Ireland will still end the milk quota year in the region of 5% over quota which equates to a super levy bill of about &euro;80m.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware I have, on numerous occasions, called on the Commission to take action to mitigate the impact of super levy fines, e.g. via utilisation of an adjustment to the butterfat coefficient, as this would not have required an amendment to existing regulations.  Unfortunately, there was no realistic prospect of any movement on the super levy or on the butterfat adjustment at EU level given the level of opposition of MS who did not share our views on this matter.  <\/p><p>However, in recent weeks the Commission has acceded to a request from Ireland and other Member States for an instalment facility to pay the super levy.  The Commission has come forward with a Regulation which introduces an instalment facility over a three year period, for farmers who are facing a super levy liability.  Ireland voted in favour of the proposal when it came before the Management Committee earlier this month.  The Department will be required to pay the super levy in full to the European Commission by the standard deadline of 31 November 2015, with the terms of the scheme requiring farmers here to repay a minimum of one-third of the payment this year and two thirds by next, with the remainder payable in 2017.  My officials are working out the practicalities of implementing this scheme in consultation with the relevant stakeholders.<\/p><p>I welcome the Commission's initiative on the basis that it <i>can help to reduce the burden on dairy farmers entering the post-quota era in full readiness for the opportunity which awaits.

The eligibility inspection involved the inspection of lands declared in counties Clare, Limerick, Roscommon and Tipperary.  This inspection identified discrepancies between the area declared and area found, resulting in an intentional over-declaration in area of greater than 20% in respect of the Single Payment Scheme. Based on the Terms and Conditions of this Scheme this resulted in no payment in respect of the 2012 scheme and the application of an administrative fine to be offset against any future EU payments.  The person named was notified of this decision on 19 November 2012.<\/p>  <p>  The cross compliance inspection identified breaches relating to requirements applying to Special Areas of Conservation and sheep identification and registration requirements, resulting in a 5% penalty.  The person named was also notified of this decision on 19 November 2012.  The person named sought a review of both inspection decisions.  As part of this review process the person named was afforded the opportunity to provide any new evidence and supporting documentation for consideration by the reviewing officer.  The outcome of this review was to uphold the original inspection decisions and the person named was notified of this decision on 12 February 2013.<\/p>  <p>  During the course of this review the application of the administrative fine was also examined.  Following a review of the applicable EU legislation and the receipt of legal advice from my Department's Legal Services Division, it was determined that the application of the administrative fine was incorrect given that the area of the intentional non-compliance was less than 3%.  Following this determination, arrangements were immediately put in place to refund the value of the administrative fine applied and the relevant amounts issued to the person named on 20 December 2013.<\/p>  <p>  The person named appealed the inspection decisions to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office.  As part of the appeal process an oral hearing took place on 18 September 2013 where the person named was afforded the opportunity to seek clarification on any issues relating to how the inspections were carried out and their findings and also to present any additional information in support of the appeal. While the decision of the Appeals Office was to partially allow the appeal in relation to the eligibility over-declaration, this had no monetary impact as the overall over-declaration was still greater than 20% and less than 50%.  The Appeals Office upheld the decision in relation to the Cross Compliance penalty of 5%. The person named was notified of the Appeals Office decision on 7 February 2014.  The person named was also advised of their right to pursue the matter further with the Office of the Ombudsman. <\/p>  <p>  At the request of the person named, officials from my Department, independent to those officers involved in the inspection process, met with the applicant and agreed to undertake a review of the procedures applied during the inspection process.  One of the areas of concern was that the eligibility inspection was carried out without notification.  EU regulations governing inspections provide that an inspection may be carried out on an unannounced basis where it is considered that the inspection may be jeopardised by giving notice.  The outcome of this review was that there were no grounds to overturn the inspection findings and the consequential financial penalty.  The person named was notified of this decision by letter dated 14 December 2014.<\/p>  <p>  The person named has availed of the option of internal reviews by officials within my Department, including a review by official's independent to the original inspection process.  In addition, the person named has availed of the right to appeal the inspection decisions to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office.  The person named was advised of their right to raise the matter further with the Office of the Ombudsman and my Department understands that this option has not been availed of to date.  In addition, I understand that the person named has been in contact with the Director of the Independent Appeals Office with what he states is new information concerning this case and this is currently being considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400069#WRQ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Administration","counter":612,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400069#WRQ00450"},{"type":"question","counter":613,"qnumday":358,"qnumall":"[11585\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400069#WRQ00500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason the terms and conditions of the single payment scheme for the years 2012 to 2014 have been changed from year to year, in relation to controls and inspections.

Their professional expertise and experience are vital to the preparation of reliable GLAS applications that fully comply with regulatory and scheme requirements. That is why I have made it mandatory for all GLAS applications to be submitted by an approved GLAS Advisor.<\/p>  <p>  The negotiations with the European Commission in relation to the details of the Scheme were long and protracted, which is why the earliest date I could open it was 23rd February, 2015. I appreciate that the deadline of 30th April for submission of applications under GLAS is tight but there was no real opportunity to extend this without impinging upon the regulatory deadline for direct payment applications generally, which has been fixed for many years now as 15 May. With this in mind, I have been working closely with colleagues in Europe to see can this regulatory deadline be extended and I am delighted to say that we have achieved some flexibility on this front, with the European Commission extending the overall deadline up until 15th June, 2015.  In deciding whether to now extend the GLAS deadline, I will take account of the feedback from\u00a0farmers and advisors, the need for the efficient management of the different Departmental on-line systems and the effect, if any, on commencement dates in GLAS.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the question of the training of Advisors for GLAS, training days were held in several locations throughout the country in November and February and were very well attended. In terms of the GLAS on-line system, this system has been custom-built to allow Advisors to access their clients' lands, with pre-determined assets and characteristics on those farms identified in order to aid the Advisor in choosing the correct actions. The system is designed to streamline the application process, with built-in validations to assist in the preparation of the application. From the feedback received the system is relatively easy to navigate, once the user follows the user manual provided. In addition there is a dedicated GLAS e-mail address and Lo Call phone number which deals with any queries farmers or Advisors may have in relation to the Scheme or in relation to the on-line application system. My officials are dealing with these queries promptly and any issues arising are examined and acted upon if necessary. Furthermore, information sessions on GLAS and the BPS Scheme which commenced on 16th February, 2015 are being rolled out across the country and are open to all to attend and my officials are available for question and answer sessions at these meetings.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of Commonage Management Plans is one which my officials have dealt with at Commonage Information meetings held at various regional locations in September and October of last year. A dedicated and separate session was held for Advisors in most locations, at which it was outlined that in order for these plans to realise an environmental return on these hills, one cohesive plan for all participating GLAS shareholders was needed. This, of necessity, means one Master Commonage Advisor, who has responsibility for deciding, along with shareholders, the activities and stocking densities suitable to the entire commonage. It is not feasible for all GLAS Advisors to draw up an individual Commonage Management Plan for their clients and it would not be acceptable on environmental grounds.<\/p>  <p>  My officials will be in direct contact with the Advisor who raised these issues to answer the specific technical questions addressed directly to them in relation to the operation of GLAS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400070#WRR02500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Payments","counter":686,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400070#WRR02550"},{"type":"question","counter":687,"qnumday":383,"qnumall":"[11917\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400070#WRR02600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if  payments for the 2013 and 2014 under the Single Payments Scheme will issue in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry following a successful review; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":688,"content":"<p>A review of the land parcels declared by the person named under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme revealed that a number of the land parcels declared by the person named contained ineligible features.

Ireland's total EAFRD allocation for rural development is some &euro;2.19 billion (or some &euro;313 million per annum), as agreed at the EU Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF) negotiations in 2013.

The standard co-financing rate applied to these measures in the draft RDP is 53%, with higher rates of 56% applied to expenditure under Measure 10 (Agri-Environment and Climate) and 65% applied to Measure 19 (LEADER).

The primary aim of our PfP participation is to enhance the Defence Forces' interoperability with other professional military forces for the purpose of engaging in UN authorised peacekeeping and peace support operations led by the UN, EU or NATO. Participation in PfP is fundamental to Ireland being able to meet its obligations in providing trained peacekeepers for international crisis management and peacekeeping operations mandated by the UN.

The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that the accused person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses or evidence.  Section 2 of the Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, permits the courts to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where refusal of bail is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  A &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo; is an offence listed in the Schedule to the Bail Act that is punishable by at least five years imprisonment.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Criminal Justice 1984 as amended by section 22 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 provides that any sentence of imprisonment for an offence committed while on bail shall be consecutive but if imposed in the District Court the aggregate term of imprisonment shall not exceed two years.<\/p>  <p>  As regards reform of the bail laws, I can inform the Deputy that the drafting of the General Scheme of a Bail Bill to modernise the law on bail is at an advanced stage in my Department.

While the primary aim of the proposed Bail Bill is to consolidate and update bail law, I am taking the opportunity in this legislation to seek, as far as is possible, within the constraints of the Constitution and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public.

Prison education includes a core element of basic education incorporating reading, writing, numeracy and IT literacy. The aim of the Education Service is to deliver a high quality, broad, flexible programme of education that helps prisoners cope with their sentence, achieve personal development, prepare for life after release and establish an appetite and capacity for life-long learning. Programmes   are adapted to take account of the diversity of the prisoner population and the complex nature of prison life, including segregation requirements and high levels of prisoner turnover.<\/p>  <p>  Educational services are available at all institutions and are provided in partnership with the Education and Training Board  s (ETBs) and a range of other educational agencies.  The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of whole-time teacher equivalents to the prisons through the ETBs (220 in the academic year 2015\/16).  Organisations who provide in-reach education roles include Open University, the Samaritans, the Red Cross, Grow, Toe by Toe, Writers and Artists in prison etc. Other courses run through the education centres include pre-release programmes, parenting, hairdressing, Alternatives to Violence etc.<\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that in January 2015, the latest month for which figures are available, 46.1% of the total prisoner population attended education classes during this time. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years. Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), and the Guild of Launders and Cleaners and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled us to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification.<\/p>  <p>  Prisoners involved in work and training activities may do so with a view to gaining accreditation in a particular area or in order to keep busy during their sentence. Engagement in vocational training can have added benefits in the form of boosting self-confidence, imparting useful practical skills and improving social skills. On any given day, prisoners work in areas such as the laundry, kitchens, horticultural or gardening, industrial cleaning, waste management and picture framing shops where the labour they provide can be of benefit to the effective running of the prison and for which they may or may not receive accreditation.<\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that in January 2015, the latest month for which figures are available for prisoner participation in work and training (accredited and non-accredited), 30% of the total prisoner population attended workshop sessions.<\/p>  <p>  The restriction of a prisoner's regime can occur due to a number of factors including, the protection of vulnerable prisoners.  This is provided for under Rule 63 of the Prison Rules 2007.  A prisoner may, either at his\/her own request or when the Governor considers it necessary, in so far as is practicable and subject to the maintenance and good order and safe and secure custody, be kept separate from other prisoners who are reasonably likely to cause significant harm to him\/her.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Governor may decide, for the maintenance of good order in the prison, to remove a prisoner from general association or structured activity to reduce the negative effect that a prisoner or prisoners may have on the general population.  This is provided for under Rule 62 of the Prison Rules 2007.  There may also be a smaller number of prisoners who would be restricted for medical (Rule 64) or discipline reasons (Rule 67).<\/p>  <p>  The fact that prisoners seeking protection are immediately separated from the general population or from specific prisoners identified as presenting a threat, clearly demonstrates the commitment of the Irish Prison Service to ensure their safety and security.  The status of each prisoner on restricted regime within the prison system is regularly reviewed.  If possible, prisoners can be transferred to other institutions where a restricted regime would not be necessary.<\/p>  <p>  Education is available to prisoners seeking protection in all Dublin prisons with the exception of Cloverhill prison. Protection prisoners in Cloverhill had access to education from 2007\/08 to 2012\/13 academic year for 6.25 hours weekly. To facilitate this non-protection prisoners did not have access\u00a0to education at those times. In those five years the numbers of prisoners on protection who availed of education was less that 5% of the numbers on protection at those times. In the academic year 2013 - 2014 a decision was taken to revert\u00a0access times for protection prisoners only\u00a0back to non protection prisoners so that already limited resources could be used more effectively and efficiently.<\/p>  <p>  Access to training for prisoners seeking protection is only available in Mountjoy and Cloverhill.

Indeed, funding was also set aside within the funding allocations in both 2014 and 2015 for new developments and the expansion of some existing services.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service work closely through their joint strategy to provide community support schemes.  Community support is now operational in Dublin, Cork, and Limerick and includes all female offenders in this category.  In 2014, Care After Prison, which is in receipt of funding from the Irish Prison Service and employs ex-offenders as support workers, was able to extend the community support scheme in Dublin.  These programmes are aimed at prisoners who are serving sentences of between 3 and 12 months. <\/p>  <p>  I might add that rehabilitation and reintegration are at the centre of our penal policy and are significant factors in reducing crime and offending behaviour. The Community Return Scheme is considered to be a most effective support model to reduce recidivism rates for those prisoners with longer sentences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400074#WRV01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Data","counter":837,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400074#WRV01100"},{"type":"question","counter":838,"qnumday":434,"qnumall":"[11167\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400074#WRV01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 344 of 3 of March 2015, the number of persons who were in the witness security programme in 2013 and 2014, and who are in the programme in 2015 to date; and the breakdown of expenditure of the allocated &euro;1.198 million for this programme.","asker":"1190","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":839,"content":"<p>I refer to Question No. 346 of 3 March 2015.

I understand that once the Bill is commenced, there will also be designated contact people in the HSE to advise the women concerned.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to advocacy, it is important to point out that Judge Quirke makes a very clear distinction between what is required for most women and what is required for those lacking full mental capacity including those women that are in institutional settings.<\/p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that women who were in the Magdalen laundries are already covered under section 21 of the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009 which makes provision for persons to act as care representatives in respect of any person applying for support under that Act.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Bill 2014 is awaiting committee stage in the D&aacute;il.  This provides for a range of options including decision making assistants, co-decision makers, decision making representatives and the public guardian, which are well suited to look after the best interests of the women who were in Magdalen laundries and have capacity issues.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is looking at options with regard to the provision of advocacy and my officials are  currently in discussion with the Citizens Information Board and will have further discussions with the Department of Social Protection on this issue.  The advocacy services provided by the National Advocacy Service of the Citizens Information Board is provided for in the Citizen's Information Act 2007.  It is important to note that a personal advocate has very limited powers with regard to a person who lacks capacity.  A personal advocate does not have power of attorney, to make decision or otherwise to manage the affairs of the person.  That is why the provisions of Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Bill 2014 will be so important.<\/p>  <p>  My officials are careful to ensure that applicants do have the necessary capacity to understand the scheme and sign the relevant legal documentation and they cross check with other Departments to establish if there any issues.  A medical assessment is sought if there is any indication that an applicant under our scheme has capacity issues. We have identified about 40 such women to date and are delaying payment until proper safeguards are in place.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to women who do not lack capacity, the Government has provided a grant to the Irish Women Survivors Support Network to provide advice and support to the women who are residing in the UK.  My officials will be looking at how to develop the idea of an ongoing dedicated unit to assist the women and advocate on their behalf now that the dedicated unit in my Department has almost completed its primary task of processing applications and paying out cash benefits.

I anticipate that this draft plan will be issued for consultation to civil society organisation active in this field in the near future. This new Plan seeks to build on progress made to date in this area and address issues raised in independent international evaluations of Ireland's response to this important issue.<\/p><p>The new National Action Plan will outline both the Government's strategic approach to this issue as well as setting out a clear work programme for the relevant state authorities to collaborate with civil society in advancing the fight against trafficking and enhancing the protection of victims. Among the key priorities of Ireland's Anti-Trafficking Strategy are to:<\/p><p>-  Prevent trafficking in human beings,<\/p><p>-  Identify, assist and protect victims of trafficking in human beings,<\/p><p>-  Ensure an effective criminal justice response,<\/p><p>-  Ensure effective co-ordination and co-operation between key actors, both nationally and internationally,<\/p><p>-  Increase the level of knowledge of emerging trends in the trafficking of human beings, and<\/p><p>-  Continue to ensure an effective response to child trafficking.<\/p><p>These key priorities will be reflected in the new Plan and the approach to its implementation will, first and foremost, be victim-centred.  Allied to that will be the aim of ensuring an effective criminal justice response to the perpetrators of this evil crime. The partnership structure, which was put in place under the first National Action Plan, will continue to be supported.<\/p><p>I have, since my appointment as Minister for Justice &amp;amp; Equality, met with a number of stakeholders, including civil society organisations, to discuss the issue of human trafficking and have received submissions in relation to their views on the matter which will be further considered in the formal consultation process which will be commenced with the issuing of the draft Plan. This consultation process will encompass both an invitation for comment as well as formal meetings with key stakeholder groups through standing working group structures.<\/p><p>The drafting of the new National Action Plan provides an opportunity to address in detail the full range of support and protection policies in place; the issue of independent oversight in this area will also be considered in this context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400077#WRY02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":988,"qnumday":490,"qnumall":"[11861\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400077#WRY02300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to ensure an all-island approach to combat human trafficking, by publishing her proposals on sex buyer laws before similar legislation comes into force in Northern Ireland on 1 June 2015; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":989,"content":"<p>On 27 November, I published the General Scheme of a Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill which includes two new offences of purchasing, in the context of prostitution, sexual services.<\/p>  <p>  The first is a general offence of purchasing sexual services which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the more serious offence of purchasing a sexual service from a trafficked person and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and\/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not be subject to an offence.<\/p>  <p>  These new offences are comparable to those introduced in section 15 of the Human Trafficking and Exploitation (Criminal Justice and Support for Victims) Act (Northern Ireland) 2015 which the Deputy correctly states will come into force on 1 June.<\/p>  <p>  As an additional means of combating the exploitation which is associated with prostitution, these offences will target the demand side of prostitution.  However, there is already significant legislative provisions addressing the trafficking of persons for the purposes of exploitation (including sexual exploitation) which can attract significant penalties.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 which prohibits trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  Any person found guilty of such an offence shall be liable to imprisonment for life or a lesser term, and at the discretion of the court, to a fine.  It is also an offence for a person to solicit or importune a trafficked person for the purposes of prostitution with a potential penalty of imprisonment for up to 5 years and\/or a fine.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that there are also extensive legislative provisions to address the more exploitative aspects of prostitution.  For example, under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 it is an offence to organise prostitution, coerce or compel a person to be a prostitute, to knowingly live on the earnings of a prostitute, or to keep or manage a brothel.  In addition, public order legislation prohibits the advertising of brothels and prostitution.<\/p>  <p>  Taken as a whole, the existing and new offences that I am introducing in the forthcoming Bill, will achieve a comprehensive approach to combatting trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is priority legislation and is currently being drafted.

The aim is to seek to effectively eliminate, in so far as is possible the need for a judge to commit anyone to prison for the non-payment of a fine.  As well as introducing an option for persons to pay by instalment, there are also changes in the way in which those who fail to pay fines are dealt with, with a range of options available to judges which are recovery orders, attachment to earnings and community service.  Such change has implications for agencies across the Justice sector, including the Courts and the Courts Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service.  Changes of the scale proposed in the Fines (Payments and Recovery) Act 2014 require a major overhaul of IT systems and of administrative systems.<\/p>  <p>  Work is ongoing in preparing for the implementation of the Act.  The area most directly affected by the changes is the Courts and the Courts Service is working on a number of developments which will ensure that the implementation of the legislation, and the new procedures which will operate under it, are as efficient as possible.<\/p>  <p>  This has required work to upgrade the IT systems to ensure that the instalment payment system operates effectively and that the necessary accounting procedures are in place for the recording of payments. Changes are also required in the way that information is transferred between the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that both organisations have fully up to date information on the cases and their current status.<\/p>  <p>  Good progress is being made in the preparatory work.  All aspects of the recovery of fines are being outsourced to an external provider and the procurement process is nearing conclusion.

Full vetting checks are conducted by the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account.<\/p>  <p>  The current procedures for Garda vetting ensure the integrity of the system.  This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original Garda Vetting Disclosure would not include information regarding any recent criminal convictions, and the second employer could not safely rely on it.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the Data Protection Acts, any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date and employers would be exposed to civil liability if they knowingly recruited staff based on out-of-date criminal records information where the person in fact had a more recent criminal conviction.  Effectively, the non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service and such procedures are in line with best practice internationally.<\/p>  <p>  There are, however, certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.  For example, persons involved in voluntary work may be doing work with more than one voluntary organisation at the same time, and may agree with the vetting applicant to share a single vetting disclosure.  Similar arrangements arise in the health sector in regard to persons working as locums, agency nurses or other temporary employees in a number of different organisations, or in the education sector where substitute teachers are on panels for substitute teaching in more than one school.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the current average processing time for vetting applications is four weeks.  Any vetting process will take a certain minimum amount of time to complete and, taking into account  the need to protect children and vulnerable adults while providing an effective and efficient service, I do not think that this time period is unreasonable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400078#WRZ03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Operations","counter":1027,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400079#WRAA00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1028,"qnumday":506,"qnumall":"[11956\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400079#WRAA00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on an incident on Henry Street, Dublin, on 13 March 2015 (details supplied).","asker":"1195","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":1029,"qnumday":507,"qnumall":"[11957\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400079#WRAA00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on the proper use of pepper spray by members of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.","asker":"1195","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1030,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 506 and 507 together.<\/p><p>In view of the fact that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission has launched a public interest investigation into the incident referred to by the Deputy under powers granted to them by Section 102(4) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter while this investigation is ongoing.<\/p><p>However, on the general issue raised by the Deputy I can say the following.<\/p><p>The fundamental principle underpinning Garda operational actions is the need to ensure compliance with the requirements of legality, necessity, proportionality and accountability.

The manual sets out the detailed considerations which must always be taken into account by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na before using incapacitant spray.  Any use of incapacitant spray, as with any use of force in general, must be in accordance with law, in particular the law on the use of force set out in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  In effect, the use of incapacitant spray must be  necessary and must be reasonable in the circumstances.<\/p><p>Garda members are trained in the lawful use of incapacitant spray and, as the manual makes clear, are individually responsible and answerable for their actions in its use.  It is also the case that every incident where incapacitant spray is deployed is notified to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, which can investigate any question of misuse.<\/p><p>I believe, therefore, that comprehensive policy and procedures in relation to the use of incapacitant spray, and appropriate safeguards to ensure compliance with those standards, are in place within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400079#WRAA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Process","counter":1031,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400079#WRAA00600"},{"type":"question","counter":1032,"qnumday":508,"qnumall":"[11969\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400079#WRAA00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide an update on a matter (details supplied) regarding the wards of court system; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1033,"content":"<p>The system of wardship will be abolished under the provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 which proposes a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties.

Further to this meeting, the Deaf Community prepared a report to reflect their views on key actions and priorities.

Section 35 of the 2009 Act, which entered into operation on 1 December 2009, contains specific provisions in respect of easements acquired by prescription, i.e. acquired on the basis of long enjoyment of the easement concerned.

However, where the Authority is not satisfied that there is such an entitlement, e.g. where there is disagreement as to its existence between the parties concerned, a court order under section 35 of the 2009 will continue to be required.

In the case of a judgment mortgage, the right of action accrues from the date on which the judgment becomes enforceable and not the date on which it is registered as a judgment mortgage. As regards a reduction in the current limitation period, the risk is that any such reduction might simply trigger earlier commencement of court proceedings since the commencement of such proceedings operates to suspend application of limitation periods under the Statute of Limitations. While I have no current plans to amend the law in this area, the matter is being kept under review by my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400079#WRAA03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":1058,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400079#WRAA03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1059,"qnumday":517,"qnumall":"[12106\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400079#WRAA03400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when she will finalise legislation to deal with Ireland's prostitution laws on foot of last year's Oireachtas joint committee's report on this issue; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1045","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1060,"content":"<p>On 27 November, I published the General Scheme of a Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill which includes two new offences of purchasing, in the context of prostitution, sexual services.<\/p>  <p>  The first is a general offence of purchasing sexual services which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.

Prior to this, the HSE had statutory responsibility for this service. These concerns can either relate to a child's welfare or where there is a concern of child abuse, that is, physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse or neglect, As the Deputy may be aware the respective roles of State agencies in the area of child protection are set out in Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children.  I am not aware of specific cases the Deputy may have in mind.  I have asked the Agency to comment and I will revert to the Deputy at that time.<\/p>  <p>  Reporting a child abuse concern should, whether it is ongoing or historical, be reported to the Child  and Family Agency and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in line with the Children First Guidance.  Under Section 3.6 of the Children First (2011) guidelines, when a retrospective disclosure of abuse is made, an assessment must be taken to ensure there is no current risk to any child that may be in contact with the alleged abuser. Should risk be identified, the information should be passed to the Agency immediately who will work with other agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, for investigative purposes. <\/p>  <p>  While child protection and welfare services of the HSE were transferred to the Child and Family Agency on 1 January 2014, other services for children and adolescents remain with providers such as the HSE, including disability services and the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).  As the Agency carries out its child protection functions, the onus remains on the service provider to ensure that adequate safeguards are in place and to examine its own role in respect of abuse disclosures.  The HSE, as a service provider, could be expected to carry out investigations into its service provision, separate from those of the Agency or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400080#WRBB00900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence Refuges","counter":1080,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400080#WRBB00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1081,"qnumday":525,"qnumall":"[11390\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400080#WRBB01000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of refuge places for persons escaping domestic violence per 10,000 of the population; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"984","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1082,"content":"<p>The information sought by the Deputy has been requested from the Child and Family Agency and I will respond directly to the Deputy when the information is received.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400080#WRBB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Provision","counter":1083,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400080#WRBB01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1084,"qnumday":526,"qnumall":"[11870\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400080#WRBB01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his plans to ensure that adequate affordable child care places are available for the approximately 33,000 one-parent families who in July 2015 will no longer be in receipt of the one-parent family payment, in order to ensure that this sector will not be excluded from the workplace and forced into poverty; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1085,"content":"<p>The issue of the One-Parent Family Payments is, in the first instance, a matter for the Department of Social Protection (DSP).

As the Deputy is aware, the Child and Family Agency was established on 1 January, 2014 and brought together nearly 4,000 staff from three separate organisations, the Health Service Executive (HSE), the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board. This represented one of the most ambitious and far reaching public sector reforms undertaken by the Government.  The Agency places a strong emphasis on prevention, early intervention, family support, therapeutic and care interventions, all of which are key to the provision of integrated, multidisciplinary services for vulnerable children and families but it cannot do this alone and relies on other sectors including health and education.  This is entirely appropriate as children's health needs will be met by the HSE and their educational needs by schools.  For example, some children have specialist needs that need to be met by child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS - which remains part of the HSE) as referenced in the Deputy's question.  <\/p>  <p>  The Agency and the HSE have a Memorandum of Understanding and a Joint Protocol for inter-agency collaboration in place which underpins service provision for those children attending services provided by both agencies.  The Memorandum of Understanding sets a partnership agreement between the HSE and the Agency whereby pre-establishment levels of service are maintained across both organisations. The objective of the Joint Protocol is to specify a pathway and associated responsibilities for children and families whose needs cross between the HSE and the Agency.  <\/p>  <p>  Both the Memorandum of Understanding and the Joint Protocol are subject to regular monitoring and review to ensure that they are working effectively in the best interests of children and families.  Additionally, the Agency and the HSE are working to finalise a service level agreement to underpin the provision of psychological services by the HSE which will assist the Agency in fulfilling its statutory obligations.  The service level agreement with the HSE will determine the quantum of service needed to meet the Agency's requirements and will be an interim arrangement pending the Agency providing the service directly.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400080#WRBB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Workers Recruitment","counter":1108,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400080#WRBB02850"},{"type":"question","counter":1109,"qnumday":535,"qnumall":"[11654\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400080#WRBB02900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will act to ensure the adequate provision of social workers to ensure the needs of the 3,000 plus children at risk are met; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1110,"content":"<p>The impact of vacancies on service provision is risk-assessed on an ongoing basis.

This reduction is indeed welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  A National Clinical Care Programme for Stroke was started in 2010; its aim is to improve patient healthcare and outcomes and it can point to some very positive achievements. Emergency clot-busting thrombolysis therapy is provided now to patients in all regions of the country by improved hospital and ambulance protocols, health professional training and the appointment of new physicians. There is National 24\/7 access to safe stroke thrombolysis, the rate of which has increased from 1% in 2006 to a current rate of 11%. This exceeds the national target of 9% and is amongst the best in national rates worldwide. <\/p>  <p>  Access to stroke unit care has been shown to improve stroke patient outcomes through reduced rates of death, dependency and shorter lengths of stay.  Since the commencement of the National Clinical Programme for Stroke, nine new stroke units have been opened. This brings the total number of stroke units in acute hospitals to twenty-four. It is a major improvement from the first national stroke care audit report in 2006 which reported one stroke unit in the country.<\/p>  <p>  Meanwhile, less stroke patients are dying in hospital; the rate has dropped from 16.1% in 2009 to 15.1% in 2013; this represents an average of three fewer deaths per month in 2012. There are less stroke patients being discharged to nursing homes &ndash; an indication of improved disability outcomes; more stroke patients are being discharged home directly from acute hospitals; and the average acute hospital length of stay for stroke has fallen from 10 days in 2009 to 9 days in 2013.<\/p>  <p>  Of course the risk factors for stroke and other diseases are smoking, alcohol, poor diet leading to overweight and obesity, and physical inactivity.

Under community rating, everybody is charged the same premium for a particular health insurance plan, irrespective of age, gender and the current or likely future state of their health. This means that the level of risk that a particular consumer poses to an insurer does not directly affect the premium paid. It also means that premiums for younger or healthier lives are typically higher than their expected claims would require, whereas for older or less healthy lives, premiums are typically lower than the expected claims would require. <\/p>  <p>  The policy objective of introducing Lifetime Community Rating (LCR) is to encourage people to purchase health insurance at a younger age, as community-rated markets depend on a continuing influx of younger people to keeps premiums down for everybody. LCR, which is being introduced from 1 May 2015, modifies community rating so that the premium that\u00a0individuals pay for health insurance increases with the age at which they enter the\u00a0private health insurance market. The premium does not vary in relation to their current age. For example, under LCR a 50 year old who has held insurance since he or she was 30\u00a0will continue to pay the same as a 30 year old, but a 50 year old who purchases insurance\u00a0for the first time will pay more than a 30 year old. If you take out private health insurance earlier in life, and retain it, you will pay lower premiums compared to someone who joins when they are older. <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of LCR will encourage more people to join the market at younger ages, thus helping to spread the costs of older and less healthy people across the market and helping to support affordable community-rated premiums for everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400082#WRDD02800","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":1184,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400083#WREE00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1185,"qnumday":565,"qnumall":"[11208\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400083#WREE00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the proposed soft opt-out system for organ donation; when this will come before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":1186,"qnumday":694,"qnumall":"[11928\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400083#WREE00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his legislative plans to change the current practice to an opt-out consent as per the Government's consultative process for organ donation; the timeframe for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"953","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1187,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 565 and 694 together.<\/p><p>Legislative proposals to give effect to the opt-out system of consent for organ donation are being progressed and it is hoped to finalise the Heads of a Bill this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400083#WREE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointment Status","counter":1188,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400083#WREE00450"},{"type":"question","counter":1189,"qnumday":566,"qnumall":"[11209\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400083#WREE00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when an operation will be carried out in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Laois; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1190,"content":"<p>The National Waiting List Management Policy, <i>A standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, January 2014,<\/i>has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.

Each recommendation has an identified business owner and progress updates are sought by my Department on a regular basis.

There is a nine month grace period, which expires on 30 April 2015, during which time as many people as want to can take out health insurance without incurring loadings. From 1 May 2015, late entry loadings will be applied to those who join the private health insurance market at age 35 or over. <\/p>  <p>  There are exemptions available for people who previously had health insurance but cancelled it. A credited period can apply for any periods of inpatient cover from age 23 years where a full adult premium rate has been paid. The responsibility rests with the individual to prove to the insurer their credited period. When a full adult premium is paid in respect of anyone, including spouses and dependent students, such periods of cover are taken into account for the purposes of Lifetime Community Rating. In such cases, the level of loading will then be reduced by the relevant credited period(s). <\/p>  <p>  These credited periods apply for periods of health insurance cover purchased with registered health insurers in this country. However, anybody who lives outside the State on 1 May 2015, and who moves to take up residence in Ireland, will have a grace period of 9 months to purchase private health insurance without incurring loadings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400088#WRKK04200","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HIQA Reports","counter":1437,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400089#WRLL00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1438,"qnumday":656,"qnumall":"[11730\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400089#WRLL00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans following the Health Information and Quality Authority report into Redwood in Stamullen; if he has concerns that there are persons with disabilities residing there; and the safeguards in place to protect them; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1192","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1439,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.

Persons with full eligibility (medical card holders) are entitled to a range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultant services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and maternity and infant care services. People with limited eligibility (non-medical card holders) are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services and out-patient pubic hospital services including consultant services.<\/p>  <p>  Separate to the public health system, my Department oversees the maintenance of a competitive and sustainable private health insurance market, under the provisions of the Health Insurance Acts 1994 to 2014, and monitors developments on an ongoing basis to ensure that the market is regulated appropriately. The policy objective of introducing Lifetime Community Rating (LCR) to the health insurance market is to encourage people to purchase health insurance at a younger age, as community-rated markets depend on a continuing influx of younger people to help spread the costs of older and less healthy people across the market and helping to support affordable community-rated premiums for everyone who wishes to purchase insurance. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the purchase of private health insurance is optional. The regulatory framework governing health insurance, such as late entry loadings under LCR and the application of waiting periods for new health insurance customers, applies to all persons choosing to purchase health insurance and is not related to a persons eligibility, or previous eligibility, for public health services. Therefore, I do not consider there to be any anomaly in treatment. <\/p>  <p>  On the issue of waiting periods specifically, I recently signed amending Regulations to standardise the waiting periods for everyone taking out private health insurance. The revised maximum waiting periods to be served for all persons, irrespective of age, will be 26 weeks for the initial waiting period and  5 years for pre-existing conditions. The Regulations will apply to all health insurance contracts entered into on or after 1 May 2015 and will include contracts that are 'renewed' after this date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400089#WRLL01400","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1450,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400089#WRLL01500"},{"type":"question","counter":1451,"qnumday":660,"qnumall":"[11758\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400089#WRLL01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding medical treatment in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1452,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.

An implementation framework for the Neuro-Rehabilitation Strategy is being developed by both the HSE Rehabilitation Medicine Clinical Programme and the HSE Disability Services Division.

This review placed significant emphasis on international best practice and the application of these practices to existing service provision in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The major deliverable of the review was a detailed report  based on three key components: capacity and data, work practices, admission polices &amp;amp; related clinical issues. The report recommended that the number of critical care beds should increase from 289 to 579 over the period 2010 to 2020.  It also recommended a model for the delivery of adult critical care that is underpinned by a network approach, whereby 'hub', 'spoke', and 'local' hospitals  work together to provide the patient with safe and high quality critical care, in a timely manner. At the time of the 2008 report adult critical care services were provided in 37 hospitals (52 units) across the country including in a number of the smaller hospitals where beds were described as critical care beds but in practice treated low volumes of critical care patients. <\/p>  <p>  The report recommendations have  informed the work of the HSE critical care clinical programme which was subsequently established. In 2014 the National Clinical Programme for Critical Care designed and launched a  'hub-and-spoke' Model of Care for Adult Critical Care, which is a centralised critical care delivery model, designed to meet the complex needs of critically ill patients across the acute healthcare system. The Annual National Clinical Programme for Critical Care Capacity Census records adult critical care capacity i.e. the commissioned and actual critical care bed stock and critical care staff provided in critical care services in hospitals, and available to care for critically ill adult patients.  There is now a  more  a co-ordinated approach to the planning and delivery of critical care, within and across hospital groups, with a focus on small hospitals  managing  routine  urgent or planned care locally and more complex critical care managed in the larger hub  hospitals where the relevant clinical critical care expertise can be provided. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query regarding the implementation of the report recommendations, as this is a service matter, I have asked  the HSE to respond to you directly.

The HSE has now begun implementing the Policy across all health and social services.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, I intend to bring legislation forward to give effect to recommendations made by the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance to facilitate open disclosure of adverse events to patients.  The Commission recommended that legislation be enacted to provide legal protection for open disclosure and said that such legislation should ensure that open disclosure, which is undertaken in good faith in compliance with national standards, cannot be used in litigation against the person making the disclosure.  These provisions will be in the Health Information Bill.  Because of changes to the Bill since the general scheme was approved by Government, I will be bringing a revised general scheme to Government in the coming months, with a view to publishing the Bill this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400091#WRNN01100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1539,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400091#WRNN01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1540,"qnumday":691,"qnumall":"[11918\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400091#WRNN01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 445 of 24 February 2015, the reason no response has issued from the Health Service Executive","asker":"1074","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1541,"content":"<p>I understand from speaking to my colleagues in the Health Service Executive that a response issued to the Deputy on March 19 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400091#WRNN01300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Treatment Purchase Fund","counter":1542,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400091#WRNN01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1543,"qnumday":692,"qnumall":"[11919\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400091#WRNN01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a person is ineligible for treatment or a procedure through the National Treatment Purchase Fund by reason of the fact that the person is covered by a private health insurance policy, notwithstanding the fact that the person's private health insurance does not provide cover in respect of the treatment or procedure in question; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1544,"content":"<p>The National Treatment Purchase Fund ceased direct treatment provision in 2013, focussing instead on data and analytics, audit and quality assurance to assist hospitals and the SDU in addressing waiting list and scheduled care issues.  <\/p><p>In instances where a clinical decision is made that a particular course of treatment or procedure is required, and where this treatment\/procedure is available in Ireland, normal eligibility criteria will apply, regardless of an individuals insurance status.<\/p><p>I hope that the above response clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400091#WRNN01500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme Review","counter":1545,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400091#WRNN01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1546,"qnumday":693,"qnumall":"[11926\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400091#WRNN01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the review of the nursing home support scheme will be completed","asker":"1034","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1547,"content":"<p>The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is broader than was first envisaged and the various issues arising are now being  systematically considered with a view to completion and publication as early as possible.

Under the Scheme, nursing home residents contribute towards the cost of their nursing home care based on their means, and the HSE pays the balance. In 2015 a total amount of &euro;948m is available for the Scheme. As of the end of January 2015 (latest figures available) 22,324 people were being supported by the Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income (which includes any rental income) and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held. The first &euro;36,000 of an individual's assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment. The capital value of an individual's principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care.<\/p>  <p>  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme has incorporated a number of safeguards to ensure that: <\/p>  <p>  -  Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care<\/p>  <p>  -  An applicant will keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is the greater<\/p>  <p>  -  If an applicant has a spouse\/partner remaining at home, he\/she will be left with 50% of the couple's income or the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is the greater<\/p>  <p>  -  If both members of a couple enter nursing home care, they each retain at least 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the safeguards, an applicant has the option to opt for the loan element of the Scheme known as Ancillary State Support. An applicant can opt for this loan where their assets include land and property held in the State. By availing of the loan, the portion of the contribution based on an applicant's assets may be deferred and collected from their estate. A nursing home resident can apply for the loan at any stage.<\/p>  <p>  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Allowable Deductions) Regulations 2014, which came into effect on the 1st September 2014, expanded the definition of \"Allowable Deductions\" in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 to allow the HSE to make allowance for dependent children. <\/p>  <p>  The Regulations are not arbitrary but are based on rates applied elsewhere by the Department of Social Protection. Under the Regulations, the HSE may deduct from the means assessed for the Scheme the equivalent of Child Benefit, plus the full rate of the Increase for a Qualified Child in respect of each dependent child. (Individuals in receipt of certain Social Welfare payments may claim an Increase for a Qualified Child for each qualified child under the age of 18 who lives with, and is being maintained by, the claimant. The increase may also be paid in respect of a child between 18-22 if s\/he is in full-time education at a recognised school\/college. The full rate of the Increase for a Qualified Child is &euro;29.80 per week (&euro;119.20 ever 4 weeks).)<\/p>  <p>  The costs of caring for children, where it is relevant, will also be taken into account by deducting a fixed amount from declared means equivalent to the amounts allowed for dependent children for the purposes of medical card income assessments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400091#WRNN01900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Remuneration","counter":1552,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400091#WRNN01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1553,"qnumday":696,"qnumall":"[11933\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400091#WRNN02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the Health Service Executive is refusing to implement a Labour Court direction to pay 400 social care workers twilight premium payment arrears in counties Galway and Roscommon; if he will confirm that such back-payments have been paid by the Health Service Executive in other primary community continuing care areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1554,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly on the matter.

There is a nine month grace period, which expires on 30 April 2015, during which time as many people as want to can take out health insurance without incurring loadings. From 1 May 2015, late entry loadings will be applied to those who join the private health insurance market at age 35 or over, set at 2% per year for each year over the age of 34, up to a maximum loading of 70% at age 69 and over.<\/p>  <p>  There are exemptions available for people who previously had health insurance but cancelled it. A credited period can apply for any periods of inpatient cover from age 23 years where a full adult premium rate has been paid. In relation to the specific scenario raised, I can confirm that an 'insured person' under a health insurance contract means any person who is party to or named in an inpatient indemnity health insurance contract. Therefore, where a person was named on a health insurance contract and the spouse died, all prior cover is recognised under LCR. Loadings can be avoided where the individual maintains their health insurance cover or has a break in cover of less than 13 weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400092#WROO02500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointment Status","counter":1592,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400092#WROO02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1593,"qnumday":709,"qnumall":"[12008\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400092#WROO02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Clare will be facilitated with a medical appointment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"976","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1594,"content":"<p>The scheduling of appointments for patients is a matter for the hospital to which the patient has been referred.

This must mean an end to attacks from Gaza on Israel, but also an end to the unjust blockade which has endured now for seven years.  This should begin with a real opening of supplies of materials needed for reconstruction, including of essential infrastructure such as water, sewage and power.  Every effort must be made to ensure that humanitarian goods and personnel are guaranteed safe and unimpeded access to Gaza.  But it must then continue to the end of senseless restrictions on ordinary economic and human life.  The only way to reduce support for militarism among people in Gaza is to allow them to work and export their produce, to find jobs, to feel part of the wider Palestinian people and the wider world.&rdquo;<\/p><p>During my recent visit to Gaza I saw the huge scale of the humanitarian needs there.  I saw that some reconstruction has begun, but that much more is needed.<\/p><p>It was also clear, unfortunately, that there had been no real progress on addressing the wider issues which had underlain the previous conflict.  Like many others, I have warned that without such progress, Gaza and Israel will remain trapped in a cycle of uneasy truces punctuated by recurring, increasingly violent but ultimately inconclusive conflicts.  Sadly, the BBC report referred to by the Deputy confirmed that warning, reporting the views of figures on both sides who saw renewed conflict as inevitable and were planning for such an eventuality.<\/p><p>It is difficult for us to assess security in Gaza.  I did not of course meet there with any officials from Hamas or other militant groups.  The general view is that the ability of Hamas to control the actions of smaller and more militant groups such as Islamic Jihad may be weakening, and that this may affect the stability both of the current truce with Israel and the situation inside Gaza itself.<\/p><p>The supply of construction materials into Gaza is controlled by the Israeli security forces, under agreements between Israel and relevant agencies such as UNRWA and the Red Cross.  This has allowed some repair and reconstruction to begin, but the quantities allowed need to be significantly increased.  I have discussed this issue with representatives of the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross, and others.  There are divergent views about the degree to which materials are being diverted for the building of tunnels.  While it is not possible to police the end use of every bag of cement, there has been no evidence put forward of any significant diversion of these materials. <\/p><p>The construction of tunnels and military works by groups in Gaza is indeed a problem.  It impacts upon Israeli communities living near Gaza; I met such a community when I visited.  However, it is worth noting that tunnel construction has taken place at all periods, even when no construction materials were being officially allowed into Gaza at all, and indeed even when the Strip remained under direct Israeli military control.  These activities therefore cannot justify denying the entire population of 1.8 million people, many of whose homes have been destroyed, access to basic construction materials. <\/p><p>Finally, the nature of pledges made at the Cairo conference, including through what agency such funds would be channelled, varied widely among donors.  Ireland's contribution is being directed essentially through UNRWA and other UN agencies, and is spent directly by them.  There was no role for the former <i>de facto<\/i>(Hamas) authorities in Gaza.  These have now in theory been dissolved, and control returned to the Palestinian government, but in practice there is a vacuum of real authority in Gaza, which is a matter of real concern.<\/p><p>Many other donors have made similar arrangements.  I hope that all pledges made in Cairo will be made available in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400094#WRQQ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":1676,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400094#WRQQ01650"},{"type":"question","counter":1677,"qnumday":739,"qnumall":"[11278\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400094#WRQQ01700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the impact the conflict in Syria and Iraq is having on the security situation in Lebanon, in particular with reference to the fact that Irish troops are participating in peacekeeping operations in southern Lebanon and in the Golan Heights region; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"966","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1678,"content":"<p>At the request of the United Nations, and following Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approval, contingents of the Permanent Defence Forces have been deployed to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) since 2011 and to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF), on the Golan Heights since 2013.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.<\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.<\/p>  <p>  I have made enquiries in the matter raised by the Deputy and am informed that, while the assigned NEPS Psychologist is currently not available to the school due to maternity leave, a provision has been made under the above described SCPA scheme to answer the immediate assessment needs of the school in question.

A number of previously funded organisations were not funded on this occasion.  <\/p><p>Pobal were asked to undertake the management of the scheme and, in that context, put in place a dedicated team to deal with any inquiries from applicants and to provide detailed feedback. Furthermore, an appeals process was put in place, on foot of which Pobal submitted a report, which is currently being considered.  <\/p><p>On 18 July 2014, it was announced that bridging funding of &euro;1.4million would be allocated for a twelve month period to a number of previously funded health, disability and other organisations that were not approved for funding under the new scheme, pending the carrying out of a review of the public funding of national organisations in the health and disability sector. This bridging funding in 2014\/2015 will enable organisations to plan for their future, whether with or without State support, such as that provided under the SSNO. Details of the bridging funding provided to the various organisations referred to by the Deputies are set out in the table below. <\/p><p>It should be noted that t he review process is well underway and is being advanced in consultation with the Department of Health. The review is designed to rationalise the funding of these organisations to ensure efficiency in the use of public money and avoidance of duplication, while providing appropriate support to organisations working in the sector. The Health Service Executive and Pobal are also participating in the review. All organisations in receipt of bridging funding have been contacted to make submissions as part of the review process.

Accordingly, my Department is conducting a two stage process. The first stage, which is an Expressions of Interest (EOI) stage, was launched on 23 March 2015 and any entity wishing to be considered as a Local Action Group for their area has until 15 May 2015 to submit an EOI. Further details are available on my Department's website on <\/p><p>Entities successful in the first stage of the process will be invited and supported in Stage Two of the process, which is the design of a Local Development Strategy for their area. I expect that some Local Development Strategies will be operational and funding available by late Autumn 2015. <\/p><p>&euro;220 million of the LEADER Programme allocation of &euro;250 million has been allocated by my Department to the 28 sub-regional areas. &euro;15 million from the remainder of the fund is allocated for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine Artisan Foods Initiative, &euro;5m for the REDZ Initiative and &euro;10 million for cooperation projects. <\/p><p>EU Regulation 1303\/2013 which governs the Rural Development Programme states that it is the responsibility of the Member State to &ldquo;<i>define criteria for the selection of community led local development strategies<\/i>&rdquo;. In this context it was decided to determine county allocations in advance of beginning Stage One of the selection process. This will allow any entity that wishes to make an application to deliver the Programme to tailor their strategy for their area accordingly. I believe that this process will support the design and development of more robust and implementable strategies. <\/p><p>In determining the county allocations three objective criteria were used, namely, minimum allocation, population density and a Resource Allocation Model (RAM). Each Sub-Regional area was given a minimum allocation of &euro;3 million to ensure that each county received a viable allocation in line with European Commission guidelines. Cork was allocated &euro;6 million as a minimum in order to ensure a viable allocation to each of the three administrative districts within the county. The fact that the population in Cork, outside the city, is almost twice that of any other county and more than three times many, was also taken into consideration. Nationally, these minimum allocations total &euro;81 million.<\/p><p>A measure of population density (county population divided by km<sup>2<\/sup>) was used to distribute one half of the remaining fund (&euro;69.5m). An 'average amount' based on 26 counties was calculated. Each county's population density was then compared to the average population density for the country. For those counties where the density was above or below average the average amount was adjusted upwards (below average) or downwards (above average) based on the percentage deviation from the average to determine an allocation to each county. <\/p><p>The second half of the remaining fund (&euro;69.5m) was allocated to each county using a Resource Allocation Model (RAM). The model was developed by Trutz Haase using information from the 2011 census and the Trutz Haase deprivation index as a measure of deprivation. The underlying variables of the model include consideration of demographic decline, social class deprivation and labour market deprivation. The model also used CSO area classification to measure the urban-rural spectrum. These calculations were weighted towards rural areas and considered areas with low and medium deprivation. <\/p><p>The final allocations for each county determined using the methodology outlined above is set out in Table 1.<\/p><p><b>Table 1: LEADER Allocations 2014-2020<\/b><table><tr><th>County <\/th><th>Programme Allocation <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Rural Dublin <\/td><td>&euro;6,370,438.43 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare <\/td><td>&euro;5,261,600.01 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath <\/td><td>&euro;6,903,123.57 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow <\/td><td>&euro;6,336,549.00 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow <\/td><td>&euro;6,416,803.43 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny <\/td><td>&euro;7,791,572.91 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford <\/td><td>&euro;9,840,140.56 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary <\/td><td>&euro;10,103,443.28 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>County Waterford <\/td><td>&euro;7,522,796.18 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>County Cork <\/td><td>&euro;13,938,823.22 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry <\/td><td>&euro;10,219,868.29 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare <\/td><td>&euro;8,920,224.65 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>County Limerick <\/td><td>&euro;9,276,593.96 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>County Galway <\/td><td>&euro;12,195,883.61 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo <\/td><td>&euro;11,121,431.88 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon <\/td><td>&euro;8,852,659.22 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth <\/td><td>&euro;6,101,862.01 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim <\/td><td>&euro;5,998,474.74 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo <\/td><td>&euro;7,655,647.81 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan <\/td><td>&euro;8,522,285.84 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal <\/td><td>&euro;12,913,877.86 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan <\/td><td>&euro;7,592,719.51 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois <\/td><td>&euro;7,124,586.86 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford <\/td><td>&euro;7,597,623.07 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly <\/td><td>&euro;8,036,763.90 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath <\/td><td>&euro;7,384,206.22 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total <\/td><td>&euro;220,000,000.00 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400103#WRZZ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"964"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Maintenance","counter":2068,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400103#WRZZ01100"},{"type":"question","counter":2069,"qnumday":869,"qnumall":"[11218\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400103#WRZZ01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will intervene in the case of persons (details supplied) in County Cork on humanitarian grounds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":2070,"content":"<p>My Department provides funding to local authorities for various social housing supports, including for adaptations and extensions to the social housing stock to meet the needs of local authority tenants with a disability or to address serious overcrowding.

Subject to certain conditions, a payment to a landlord, net of the tenant contribution for the relevant period, can now be backdated to the date of receipt of a valid and complete HAP application by a local authority.

Section 13A(2)(c) of the Foreshore Act 1933 empowers the Minister to rely on the advice of officials, consultants, experts or other advisors in making a determination on foreshore applications requiring environmental impact assessment.  There are a number of statutory consultees with whom I am obliged to consult on foreshore consent applications.  Among these are the public bodies that generally participate in the Marine Licence Vetting Committee (MLVC); the Marine Institute, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport (Marine Survey Office), Department of Arts, Heritage &amp;amp; the Gaeltacht (Underwater Archaeology and Nature Conservation), Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and Inland Fisheries Ireland. <\/p><p>The MLVC is an <i>ad hoc<\/i>mechanism used to bring together key stakeholders in the foreshore consent process and is not comparable to either An Bord Plean&aacute;la or the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  The constitution of the MLVC, as a non-statutory committee, can change depending on the scale, location, and type of foreshore application.  With regard to the expertise of the participants, it is a matter for each relevant public body to ensure that its officials are appropriately qualified and experienced. Information on the qualifications and experience of employees of other organisations is not held by my Department.  Those representatives of my Department that participate in the MLVC have the appropriate professional qualifications and experience commensurate with my Department's role in foreshore consenting.  The names of the individuals that participated in the MLVC as part of the consideration of the application concerned will be compiled and forwarded separately.<\/p><p>In 2005, when the lease for an offshore wind-farm was granted to Codling Windpark Ltd, the then Minister with responsibility was the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  The offshore grid elements of the Codling I project, including cable routes and an offshore sub-station, were considered as part of the environmental impact assessment carried out as part of the decision-making process.  The requirement for Ministerial consent to commence operations is dealt with under Section 6 of the executed lease document, where by the Minister is not obliged to grant consent pursuant to clause 6, unless and until the lessee has obtained and provided to the Minister in respect of the relevant works, activities or operations copies of all necessary consents including, the appropriate licences to generate and supply electricity.

The Expert Advisory Council is to comprise a chairperson and between 8 and 10 ordinary members, four of whom shall be <i>ex officio<\/i>members comprising the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, Teagasc and the Economic and Social Research Institute. In terms of appointing a chairperson and the remaining ordinary members, it is important to note the Expert Advisory Council is not a stakeholder\/representative entity and that the Government will consider the range of qualifications, expertise and experience necessary for effective performance of the advisory body.  The inclusion of the <i>ex officio<\/i>members will help underpin this much-needed expertise and experience on these matters, as well as providing a link with relevant agencies working in the field to ensure effective implementation.  Within this context, it should also be noted that it is intended to put in place appropriate arrangements so that the Expert Advisory Council can operate effectively in performing its functions. <\/p><p>With regard to a mitigation target for the year 2050, the Bill explicitly commits the State to compliance with both current and future EU and international obligations in respect of climate change.  Ireland already has greenhouse gas mitigation targets up to the year 2020, and discussions are ongoing with respect to targets up to the year 2030.  This target-setting process will undoubtedly continue in relation to the periods up to the years 2040 and 2050. Putting in place our own statutory GHG mitigation targets would cut across and interfere with this EU target-setting process.  Given that Ireland will likely be subject to binding greenhouse gas emission reduction targets up to the year 2050 as part of the EU process in any event and that a long-term vision of low-carbon transition is already set out in the National Climate Policy Position, published in April 2014, I do not consider it either appropriate or necessary to include a national 2050 target in legislation.<\/p><p>Finally, with respect to climate justice, one of the most effective ways of lessening the effects of climate change in developing countries is for developed countries such as Ireland to engage in developing further their national mitigation measures in respect of greenhouse gas emissions, and the Bill provides for just such action.  Ensuring that all citizens have the option and means to access information and participate in the development of climate policies and actions that affect them is a further crucial action to ensure that climate change and our response to it protects and promotes the rights of all and again the Bill provides for that participation. <\/p><p>Furthermore, it should be noted that Ireland, through the EU, is active in the international negotiations that aim to deliver a legally binding global agreement on combatting climate change at the next Conference of the Parties in Paris in December 2015.  The Bill recognises the importance of these international discussions in terms of having regard to existing obligations under international agreements. <\/p><p>By providing support to those countries that need it to respond and adapt to climate change, we can ensure that Ireland's transition is part of a global transition to a more climate-resilient world.  It would be important to note in this context that despite difficult economic circumstances, Ireland has maintained significant support, primarily through public finance, for climate action on adaptation in developing countries.  While the vast majority of Ireland's annual climate finance comes from Irish Aid, Ireland's overseas development programme which falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, it should also be noted that my own Department also made a contribution of &euro;33 million over two years during the Fast-Start Finance period (2010-2012), supporting the Global Climate Change Alliance and the Least Developed Countries Fund.  Ireland has maintained significant support, reporting &euro;34 million in 2013 in climate finance, mostly for adaptation projects in Ireland's key partner countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Work is continuing to explore options of how to maintain and enhance such support well into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400105#WRBBB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":2148,"qnumday":898,"qnumall":"[11777\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400105#WRBBB01400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the reason the Government has extended to two years the deadline to provide a national mitigation plan under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1105","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":2149,"content":"<p>The deadline of 24 months referred to within the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill represents a maximum deadline and all reasonable efforts will be made to provide for a National Mitigation Plan in advance of that legislative deadline.

In transposing the Directive, the European Communities Environmental Objectives (Groundwater) Regulations 2010, as amended, give legal effect to measures for the protection of groundwater.<\/p>  <p>  Local Authorities are charged with the protection of water quality, including groundwater quality, within their remit.  The protection of drinking water sources, however, is a matter for Irish Water.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the protection of groundwater, the Water Framework Directive classification assessments have identified that the main pressures impacting on groundwater quality include the input of nutrients from diffuse sources and, to a lesser degree, historical pollution from industrial activities.  Local pollution is considered to be caused primarily by farming activities and the inputs from domestic wastewater treatment systems.\u00a0 Pollution from agricultural sources has been targeted through significant investment by farmers and the State under the Farm Waste Management Scheme and by the implementation of the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2014, as amended.  Pollution from domestic waste water systems is being addressed by the requirements of the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012. <\/p>  <p>  The Waste Water Discharge (Authorisation) Regulations 2007 - 2010 provide for an authorisation system for all wastewater discharges to waters from treatment plants or collection systems owned or controlled by local authorities.

As part of the authorisation process, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) can place conditions on the operation of individual plants and systems and it can set emission limit values for the discharges.\u00a0 In December 2011, the EPA published guidance on the technical assessments that are needed to authorise discharges to groundwater, as a means of satisfying the requirements of the European Communities Environmental Objectives (Groundwater) Regulations 2010, as amended.\u00a0   <\/p>  <p>  In relation to Cape Clear Island, I am advised by Cork County Council that a ground water protection scheme has been in place for the entire county (including Cape Clear Island) since 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400105#WRBBB02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2165,"content":"<p>Question No. 905 answered with Question No. 842.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2166,"content":"<p>Question No. 906 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage to Rent Scheme Administration","counter":2167,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400106#WRCCC00350"},{"type":"question","counter":2168,"qnumday":907,"qnumall":"[11887\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400106#WRCCC00400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to restructure and recast the mortgage-to-rent scheme; if he will focus specifically upon increasing the eligibility limits by at least 30%, as they have not been adjusted since 2011, as well as permitting persons with low incomes but with some positive equity in their homesteads to participate in any such revised scheme with particular emphasis on local authorities as the vehicle for implementing an enhanced mortgage-to-rent scheme to help alleviate the ever-increasing mortgage crisis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1063","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":2169,"qnumday":910,"qnumall":"[11941\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400106#WRCCC00500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his views on the operation of the mortgage-to-rent scheme to date including plans for expansion of the scheme; the number of homeowners in mortgage arrears who have availed of the scheme, on a county basis; the number of homeowners on mortgage arrears he estimates could qualify for the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":2170,"qnumday":912,"qnumall":"[11968\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400106#WRCCC00600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will raise the threshold up to a realistic level on the mortgage-to-rent scheme to protect families in their homes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":2171,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 907, 910 and 912 together.<\/p><p>There are currently two mortgage-to-rent schemes in operation through my Department. <\/p><p>A scheme exists whereby a local authority (LA) can acquire ownership of properties with unsustainable local authority mortgages, thus enabling the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (LA- mortgage-to-rent).  The other scheme provides for an Approved Housing Body (AHB) to acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage, which also enables the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (AHB-mortgage-to-rent). Both schemes assist families with income difficulties whose mortgages are unsustainable, and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. <\/p><p>To be eligible for the AHB-mortgage-to-rent scheme a household must have had their mortgage position deemed unsustainable under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, agree to the voluntary surrender of their home, be in negative equity, and be deemed eligible for social housing in accordance with section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009.  Where a property is in positive equity other options are open to the household. <\/p><p>In order for a property to be considered under the AHB-mortgage to rent scheme it must be purchased by an Approved Housing Body for less than &euro;220,000 (per property) in the Greater Dublin Area and &euro;180,000 (per property) in the rest of the country.  These limits were determined by a working group taking account of available market data including the current social housing acquisition limits.  These limits are considered to be reasonable in respect of the income bracket that is targeted by the scheme. <\/p><p>A total of 2,762 cases had been submitted to date under the AHB-mortgage-to-rent scheme.  Of these 1,897 were deemed ineligible or terminated during the process, of which 277 cases were not progressed because the household in question was deemed to be over or under-accommodated. <\/p><p>Of the remaining 865 cases submitted, agreement on the sale could not be agreed in 42 cases, 88 have been completed, 169 are currently with the lenders and the remaining 566 are still being actively progressed.<\/p><p>My Department has issued funding approval in respect of 122 cases.  There has been an increase in cases being progressed through the scheme this year since a revised protocol was put in place.  The operation of the Scheme is closely monitored on an on-going basis by my Department and the Housing Agency who are in regular contact with AHBs and financial institutions. <\/p><p>The LA - mortgage-to-rent (LAMTR) scheme, which was rolled out nationally in February 2014, allows local authorities to offer the mortgage to rent scheme to local authority mortgage holders with unsustainable mortgages.

Where acquisitions are undertaken for social housing purposes, I expect local authorities to do so in a way that is sensitive to issues such as tenure mix and impact on the local housing market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400106#WRCCC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rights of Way Registration","counter":2193,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400106#WRCCC02250"},{"type":"question","counter":2194,"qnumday":916,"qnumall":"[12010\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032400106#WRCCC02300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the process for registration of a right of way on private lands; if a register of rights of way is kept and by whom; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":2195,"content":"<p>Section 7 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 requires the inclusion of a mandatory objective in an area's development plan for <i>&ldquo;the preservation of public rights of way which give access to seashore, mountain, lakeshore, riverbank or other place of natural beauty or recreational utility, which public rights of way shall be identified both by marking them on at least one of the maps forming part of the development plan and by indicating their location on a list appended to the development plan&rdquo;.<\/i><\/p><p><i><\/i>It is, of course, a matter for planning authorities to implement such policies in the context of their development plans.

In accordance with the legislation, certain types of accommodation, such as hotels and guesthouses are statutorily obliged to register, whereas other accommodation segments, such as B&amp;Bs are not.  In addition to the statutory regulation, F&aacute;ilte Ireland also offers a quality assurance approval and listing system for the non-statutory tourist accommodation segment.

These rates were subsequently increased in 2004, following agreement with the farming organisations under the Partnership talks. In May 2010, the then Government announced the closure of the voluntary bog purchase scheme to new applicants. While my Department is continuing to process applications in respect of special areas of conservation received before this date, it has received no applications from Ardgraigue Bog under this scheme.<\/p><p>In May 2010, an interim compensation payment scheme was established. This provided interim funding to those who had been cutting turf on raised bog special areas of conservation nominated for designation between 1997 and 1999. As Ardgraigue Bog was not one of these sites, this scheme did not apply to that bog. Consequently, no applications under the scheme were received for the site.  <\/p><p>This scheme has been replaced by the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme, established in 2011.<\/p><p>The qualifying criteria for the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme, administered by my Department, are that: <blockquote>- The claimant must have a legal interest in one of the raised bog special areas of conservation &ndash; ownership or turbary right;<br \/><br \/>- The claimant must have been the owner or entitled to exercise turbary rights on the land in question on 25 May 2010;<br \/><br \/>- The turbary on the site must not be exhausted;<br \/><br \/>- The claimant must have been cutting turf on the land in question during the relevant five year period; and<br \/><br \/>- No turf cutting or associated activity is ongoing on the property.<\/blockquote>The cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme has applied to Ardgraigue Bog special area of conservation since 2012 and 25 applications under the scheme for this site have been received and acknowledged by my Department. A total of 60 payments have been made in respect of the applications received. In addition, 13 once-off incentive payments of &euro;500 have been made to applicants who have signed and returned legal agreements under the scheme to my Department. <\/p><p>This equates to some 21 individual applicants having received payments under the scheme thus far. <\/p><p>Table 1 below shows the number of applications received in respect of Ardgraigue Bog broken down by year. Table 2 below shows the number of payments made in respect of Ardgraigue Bog broken down by year.<\/p><p>In one case relating to Ardgraigue Bog special area of conservation, compensation has been paid under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme to the land owner\/turbary right holder and to two other applicants who had been cutting turf on the same bog plot. <\/p><p>Details of the amounts paid in each case in respect of year 1 (2012), year 2 (2013), and year 3 (2014) of the scheme are set out in Table 3 below.<\/p><p>I am advised that, at this stage, no applicant from this site has been informed by my Department that he\/she does not fulfil the qualifying criteria of the scheme. While it may be anticipated that there will be instances where applicants will be informed that they do not fulfil the qualifying criteria, current priority is being given to providing compensation to those who clearly appear to fulfil the criteria on the basis of the information they have provided.
