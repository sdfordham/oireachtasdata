Today's meeting is focused on two specific areas relating to the HSE Financial Statement 2015: (i) Internal financial control and the governance of grants to outside agencies under section 39 agreements; and (ii) an update on the payment of specified remuneration and allowances to senior managers, known as top-up payments, in the section 38 agencies and the requirement to comply with Government pay policy.  <\/p> <p>  This meeting is being held principally because of the litany of revelations across the media in recent weeks.  We should all allow time for the appropriate public bodies carrying out legal investigations to take place with regard to that organisation, Console.  However, the HSE as a body is responsible for distributing more than &euro;3 billion of public taxpayers' money to approximately 2,600 organisations and this is very much of concern to the committee.  The committee wants to ascertain what protections are in place to ensure the moneys distributed to these organisations is well spent and provides good value for money for the taxpayer.<\/p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE.  He is accompanied by  Ms Anne O'Connor, national director, mental health division; Ms Rosarii Mannion, national director, human resources; Dr. Geraldine Smith, assistant national director, internal audit operations; Mr. Gerry Raleigh, director, National Office for Suicide Prevention; Mr. Brian Purcell, head of compliance unit; and Ms Martina Queally, chief officer community health care organisation, area six.<\/p><p>We are also joined by Mr. Pat O&rsquo;Mahony, who is a deputy secretary general in the Department of Health; Dr. Siobh&aacute;n O&rsquo;Halloran, who is the chief nursing officer in the internal financial control division; Mr. Greg Dempsey, who is an assistant secretary in the internal financial control division; and Ms Teresa Cody, who is an assistant secretary in the pay policy division.  We are also joined by Ms Annette Murray and Mr. Paddy Howard of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We are also assisted today by the permanent witness to the committee, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is the Comptroller and Auditor General; and by Ms Ruth Foley, who is the director of audit in the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.

If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of that evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  As always, members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

I would like to begin by giving a little outline of our approach to the audit of the HSE's funding of section 38 and 39 bodies.  The HSE's expenditure for 2015 amounted to almost &euro;14 billion.  Grants to section 38 and 39 agencies accounted for &euro;3.6 billion, or just over a quarter of the HSE's spend.  The HSE's annual financial statements include a comprehensive statement on the system of internal financial control.  This includes disclosures in relation to the HSE's regime of monitoring and oversight of grants to outside agencies.  Further details on this can be found on pages 120 to 124 of the HSE's financial statements for 2015.  Our audit of grant expenditure in the HSE includes an examination of the operation of the HSE's monitoring and oversight arrangements for grants advanced to a small sample of section 38 and 39 agencies.  This includes visits to the selected agencies.  Such visits are undertaken by agreement.  As this work is conducted as part of the HSE audit, any audit issues identified are communicated to the HSE by way of management letter.<\/p> <p>  In our consideration of grantee oversight, we use a general model that focuses on the key functions that are indicated on the screen that can be seen by members.  I will go through that briefly.  The first issue that arises is the assessment of grantees when they are being considered for funding.  The allocation of funding is another area of interest and concern.  When decisions are being made on how much funding is to be provided to an agency, particular attention must be paid to the balance between the level of funding and the service that is expected to be delivered.  When a service agreement is put in place, it should formally explain the amount of funding that is being provided, the service that is expected in return for that funding and any conditions that attach to the granting of that funding.  The monitoring and reporting mechanism that needs to be in place usually focuses on three areas: financial reporting, governance issues and performance issues.  The HSE should have a facility for the audit or investigation of grant-funded agencies, as required.  This would be equally true of any organisation that has a significant grant funding structure in place.  It is important that mechanisms are in place to evaluate the outcomes so that the Oireachtas can be assured that where moneys have been provided, the services for which they were provided have actually been delivered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016071500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1468573200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I congratulate all the other members of the committee as well.  They will have received a copy of the HSE internal audit report on Console, together with other information relating to the topics for examination this morning.<\/p> <p>  The HSE funds over 1,700 voluntary agencies, which operate over 2,600 separate funding arrangements to a value of approximately &euro;3.3 billion. \u00a0Some 39 of these agencies, accounting for &euro;2.6 billion, are funded under section 38 of the Health Act 2004.  The remaining agencies are funded under section 39 of the Act.  In 2009, the HSE developed a formal national governance framework with national standard governance documentation, service arrangements and grant aid agreements to manage the funding provided to these agencies.  This came into operation throughout the HSE in 2010.  Four standard documents are in use.  First, section 38 service arrangements cover the 16 voluntary hospitals and a group of 23 major non-acute voluntary community agencies.  St. John Of God Community Services is one of the 39 agencies covered by these arrangements.  Second, section 39 service arrangements cover all voluntary and community agencies, other than the above, that receive funding of more than &euro;250,000.  Some 304 agencies, which include - perhaps I should say \"included\" - Console, are currently covered by these arrangements.  Third, section 39 grant aid agreements cover all agencies in receipt of funding under &euro;250,000.  The vast majority of agencies fall into this category.  Some 1,362 agencies are currently funded under these agreements.  Fourth, for-profit service arrangements cover all agencies in the commercial for-profit sector regardless of funding level.  Some 218 agencies currently fall into this category.<\/p> <p>  The HSE has sought to enhance governance arrangements with section 38 and 39 agencies in recent years.  In particular, it has established a compliance unit to support the development of a strong and consistent compliance culture across all agencies funded by the HSE.  The service arrangements underpin the HSE&rsquo;s relationship with the funded agencies.  The HSE has introduced an annual compliance statement process, whereby the chair and another director of the board of each section 38 agency sign and confirm that the agency is compliant across a range of requirements on behalf of the board.  In early 2015, as part of the ongoing development of the compliance process, it was decided that a review of governance by external consultants would be carried out in these agencies to provide external assurances to the HSE.\u00a0 These reviews commenced in March 2016 and are ongoing.  The HSE has a number of processes in place to assure itself that the services it purchases from HSE-funded agencies are of a high quality and provide value for money.  I will describe some of the processes that have been in place since 2013 as I provide an overview of two agencies: the charity Console, which is a section 39 agency, and St. John of God, which is a section 38 agency.  As the service arrangements underpin the relationship between the HSE and these funded agencies, it is important to note that the HSE's powers in this regard are confined to the funding it provides and the services provided in return for that funding, subject to the terms and conditions set out in the service arangements.\u00a0 In this context, and given the limited number of HSE internal audit and compliance unit staff, careful consideration needs to be given to the section 38 and 39 agencies that are subject to audit and review.<\/p> <p>  There has been much media coverage in relation to Console and the findings of the recently completed HSE internal audit.  I thought it would be helpful to outline briefly the sequence of events that led to this audit.  Console is a section 39 agency that receives approximately 40% of its funding from the HSE.  Funding to Console remained relatively static between 2006 and 2013, when it increased to &euro;599,000 from &euro;252,000 the previous year.  HSE funding increased at this time to prevent the collapse of a national suicide helpline that was previously funded by another organisation.  The increase in funding to Console at that time was predicated on the charity agreeing to a greater level of scrutiny and enhanced governance by the National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP.  The increased level of scrutiny by NOSP gave rise to a number of concerns, including Console&rsquo;s continued failure to respond to requests for information, its delivery on its commitments to commission independent reviews of its service and its failure to attend significant meetings, particularly relating to the helpline and its annual accounts.  Arising from these concerns, in late 2014 NOSP approached HSE's internal audit division and requested that Console be included in its audit work plan for 2015.  In April 2015, the internal audit division wrote to Console to advise that the audit would commence on 27 April 2015.  Following a request from Console, the audit start was deferred and commenced on 19 May 2015.<\/p><p>This audit should have taken approximately 12 weeks to complete.  However, the audit was particularly complex and challenging and the auditors met considerable resistance from the then chief executive officer.  The audit was completed in April 2016 and at all times the auditors were careful to follow fair procedures and due process.  The audit report, copied to members, sets out the sequence of events that followed.<\/p><p> With regard to St. John of God, I advise the committee that on 1 July, the St. John of God Order informed the HSE that a number of payments had been made to 14 senior staff in 2013.  It is important to point out that in September 2013 the HSE sought written confirmation from all section 38 agencies, including St. John of God, that all remuneration paid to employees was in accordance with Department of Health consolidated payscales and non-Exchequer sources of funding were not being used to supplement employee remuneration to give rise to rates of individual remuneration exceeding the Department's consolidated payscales.  If unsanctioned payments were previously paid, the HSE sought confirmation that all such payments had ceased and the recoupment of any overpayments would be pursued as expeditiously as possible.<\/p><p> An important element of the declaration sought at that time was full disclosure on these items.  St. John of God has declared itself as non-compliant with public sector pay policy.  This declaration and other recent revelations regarding the payments to the 14 staff members are a very grave concern for me and the HSE.  Consequently, I have asked the HSE's internal audit division to conduct a review of these matters as a matter of urgency.  In this regard, St. John of God was written to by the HSE's internal audit unit on 8 July and asked to provide information and points of clarity by 20 July.  The HSE received a solicitor's letter in response to the audit process.  The HSE intends to pursue its internal audit process notwithstanding that correspondence.<\/p><p> That concludes my opening statement.  Together with my colleagues, I will endeavour to answer any questions the committee might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016071500002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468573200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Is the witness happy for us to publish that opening statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016071500002#C00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1468573200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016071500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1468573200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I find it extraordinary that there are 229 pages of very detailed information in the report, none of which I intend to go through today because we are more concerned about the HSE's control over the issue, rather than the specifics of the report.  We have been told the biggest State organisation, with the largest internal audit section, the most staff and resources, spent months in an organisation carrying out this detailed report.  There were remarks yesterday in the High Court by Mr. Justice Gilligan to the effect that he was satisfied that Console appeared to be &quot;hopelessly insolvent&quot;.  The HSE was in there for months carrying out detailed investigations into an organisation that everybody, including the High Court, accepted was hopelessly insolvent when the investigation was ongoing.  Mr. Hall indicated it was insolvent for a considerable period.  What was the HSE doing running around checking how much was spent on bunches of flowers when the organisation was insolvent?  Will Mr. O'Brien respond to that comment?  It is bizarre that all this work was ongoing.  That is my last point.  I am just asking for a quick remark but that is the substance of what was going on.  We have the report about Console and it does not deal with anything I would like to see in an audit report about Console and its solvency status.  It is not mentioned in the 229 pages.<\/p><p>This is like the financial equivalent of the HSE moving around the deckchairs on the <i>Titanic<\/i>when it was already sinking.

It is not good enough, quite frankly.  Many people contribute, donate and volunteer their services to charities and there are wonderful staff in these charities including in Console.  These people do not have a voice and we, in this committee, are their voice.

I have never come in here and tried to do that and I am sure the Deputy did not imply or wish to imply that I have done that.  Clearly at any point in time we could have done things sooner.  It is true.  Whenever one conducts an internal audit, one of the questions one asks is, \"Should we have done it sooner?\", particularly when one finds a can of worms such as this.<\/p> <p>  However, I have to concern myself with whether the decisions the individual officers made at the time appeared reasonable in the circumstances.  I believe it was reasonable in the circumstances for this audit to be triggered when it was.  Yes, it might have been better if it had been triggered sooner, but all of the wrongdoing that this internal audit uncovers was not done by HSE officials; it was done by others.  This was not a public body.  It was a body in the public domain, raising funds from members of the public.<\/p> <p>  One of the questions I have asked myself was whether we should have potentially compromised the internal audit process by doing things sooner, which would have made it impossible to complete the internal audit, but might have had an impact on people who have, in good faith, been raising funds for Console in the last period.  Our objectives were simple in this: to get this internal audit; not to allow the process to be jeopardised; and to safeguard the services.  We have done those things.  We could have done other things, but had we done those other things, it would probably have compromised our primary objectives.<\/p> <p>  We are not the regulator of charities.

That does not come across in respect of Mr. O'Brien's report.<\/p> <p>  I will get to a number of other issues, if I can.  I will start with the sequence of events because it seems that the clock starts in 2013 in respect of Mr. O'Brien's view as to what the trigger was for the internal audit, and maybe even 2014 because Mr. O'Brien talks about the concerns the National Office for Suicide Prevention had in relation to the helpline funding and that led to the internal audit report.  However, in terms of the clock starting, one must go back further than that because concerns were raised, as was said earlier, in 2006.  There was an exchange between Mr. O'Brien and the previous speaker on that, and we have heard what Mr. O'Brien had to say.  We also had an RTE report, which states that in 2009, an official in the National Office for Suicide Prevention wrote a memo highlighting deficiencies in Console's governance and accounting saying that the 2004 expenditure did not add up, the 2006 accounts had wrong membership of the Console board, the 2007 were not signed-off on by the chairperson and questions needed to be asked of the &euro;145,000 spent on professional fees charged over years.  In 2011, further concerns were raised with the then Department of Health and Children.  We also know that concerns were raised by a former parliamentary assistant to the former Minister, Senator James Reilly, and subsequently, to an official in the HSE or the Department as well.  The clock, with respect, goes back much further than the 2013 start which Mr. O'Brien would have us believe is when concerns were first brought to the HSE's attention in respect of this.  The reality is that there were many flags raised and the flags were missed, and there was nine-year gap between when the flags were first raised and when the internal audit report commenced.  Would it be fair to say that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016071500002#G00500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1468573200,"counter":229,"content":"<p>It is certainly true that there is a nine-year gap between the earliest date Deputy Cullinane mentioned and the start of the internal audit but I think it is useful to the committee if we provide further information on the nature of the different concerns that were raised at different times and why they would not have triggered the process that this latest issue triggered.

The concerns related particularly to clinical issues within the organisation.  One could argue more governance related matters was the concern raised in 2009, which was internal to the national office where a staff member there raised concerns.  At that time, Console were met by the then director of the national office - as Mr. Gerry Raleigh has previously said, everybody has changed in the national office since that time.  However, they were met then.  They were brought in.  They were then signed up to a formal performance management process.  At that time, the funding to Console was in the region of &euro;250,000.  It increased slightly in 2008-2009 because they were developing standards but the funding was substantially the same.  They were advised that they could not get additional funding from the HSE.  They were brought in for regular meetings.  The concerns were addressed at that time to the satisfaction of the national office.  The requests that they made for additional funding between 2009 and 2013 were refused.<\/p> <p>  It is also important to say that the funding that had been provided to the National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP, pre-2013 really had them in the space of being a grant-aid agreement rather than a service arrangement.  The arrangement differs once you get past a certain threshold of funding and it is a difference type of governance process.  It is a different structure.  Their funding in the overall scheme of things was relatively low compared to many other organisations so it did not trigger a significant audit.  It did not trigger significant scrutiny because the funding was very low.<\/p> <p>  The critical point here was 2013 when their funding increased, as we have discussed earlier, on the basis of the helpline.  That then moved the organisation into a different category, if you like.  It moved it into a service arrangement where there was a different governance.  At the time of the increased funding, the organisation were advised that they would be signed up to intensive scrutiny on the basis of their funding, and that happened.<\/p> <p>  It is fair to say that in 2009, they were met on a regular basis and I suppose a limit was put on their funding.  Their funding was not increased and they were advised but the concerns were addressed at that time by the organisation, again, as the director general has said, in terms of the decisions that were made at that time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016071500002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1468573200,"counter":231,"content":"<p>With respect, what I was trying to get to is as follows.

First, I do not doubt that Console provides quality services and we are all conscious that people working for the organisation provided a top class service to clients and I do not want to take away from that.  However, I would like to focus on the call centres.  Finding No. 52 states:<\/p><blockquote>Console reduce the number of its helplines from six to two between 2012 and 2014.  Console confirmed to internal audit that the cost of running its two helplines in 2014 was &euro;346,652 of which the HSE provided &euro;294,000.  During the audit, internal audit was not provided with documentation to support these costings.<\/blockquote> <p>Mr. O'Brien is the Accounting Officer who signed the cheque book giving an organisation &euro;294,000 and we cannot find documentation to support the costings.  We do not know, and Mr. O'Brien does not know, therefore, whether that money was used for the purpose for which it was intended.  If that is the case, he cannot say he got value for money.  Console responded to this in the report stating: &quot;With regard to internal audit's comment that information was not provided to support cost allocations for the Console 24-7 helpline, Console confirms that all support information was included in the general accounts framework provided to the internal audit for the years 2012, 2013, 2014.  No other information was requested by internal audit for the helpline&quot;.  It goes on to say, &quot;No HSE request has ever been made to Console management to allocate a specific helpline code in Console's general ledger.&quot;  The auditors responded by saying, &quot;The issue is not about allocating a specific helpline code in Console's general ledger.  The issue is that Console did not provide any supporting documentation during or after the audit to show how it determined these costs as being allocated to helpline costs&quot;.  On that basis, I cannot see how Mr. O'Brien can again say with accuracy that he got value for money.  He can, of course, say that the service itself was a quality service but he cannot say he got value for money if he does not have documentation to support the costs.  He is the Accounting Officer.  The internal report we are discussing states there are national implications for the HSE.  Mr. O'Brien does not grasp these implications at all and there is an element of downplaying this.  Earlier, I pointed to the finding that states, &quot;Systemic means that this could be replicated elsewhere in the HSE&quot;.  Nobody can say with certainty that it is not replicated elsewhere in the HSE.  People will not be comforted by anything that has been said because of what is in the report.  They will be concerned that the reality of the situation has not been grasped by the chief executive officer of the organisation.  That is extraordinary.  Will he respond to my questions on the helpline?  Given there is no documentation to support the costs, how can he say he got value for money?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016071500002#H02000","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1468573200,"counter":252,"content":"<p>My view and the organisation's view on value for money is grounded on what it would typically cost to provide helpline services of this type - services we know were provided.  Benchmarked against other activities, it was good value for money in the sense that we were getting a service, which we now know from information provided to us by the interim chief executive officer was costing Console more to provide than we were paying and, indeed, it will cost us more to provide the alternative service than we were paying to Console.  That is a reasonable basis on which to say that we got value for money.  As the Deputy said, there has never been a question mark around the quality of that service in recent times.  In 2006, there were questions raised about the quality of the counselling supervision for that type of headline, which the organisation at that time addressed by bringing in a separate person as its chief executive officer, who remained there for two years.  That is one of the reasons those issues were dealt with satisfactorily at that time.<\/p> <p>  This is a slightly different matter, though, from the broader issues within Console that have been uncovered by the internal audit, which go far beyond the resources provided by the HSE, but because of the relatively chaotic nature of the way matters were handled in that organisation, which led to its inability even to demonstrate to us at the time that it was spending more money providing services to us than we were giving it, it was impossible for the internal audit to audit everything in the organisation, which is what has given rise to all the information in the internal audit report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016071500002#H02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1468573200,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I call Deputy MacSharry.

I am not sure that the HSE meets that standard.  I did not get that sense from the presentation.  I wish to ask Mr. O'Brien about the strengths and weaknesses of the HSE's oversight arrangements.  In his opening statement, he made an extraordinary comment when referring to oversight.  He stated: \"In this context, and given the limited number of HSE internal audit and compliance unit staff, careful consideration needs to be given to the section 38 and 39 agencies that are subject to audit and review.\"  Mr. O'Brien has told us that one quarter of the HSE's large budget goes to sections 38 and 39 organisations.  That &euro;3.6 billion is the equivalent of many Departments or even groups of Departments.  It is a considerable amount of money.  Why is it that, with a spend of &euro;3.6 billion, Mr. O'Brien is telling us that there is a limited number of internal audit and compliance unit staff?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016071500002#K02100","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1468573200,"counter":319,"content":"<p>It is a good question.  There are three distinct reasons.  Prior to 2014, there was no compliance unit.  I will deal with that separately, if I may.  Prior to the implementation of the public sector recruitment moratorium, the internal audit function was somewhat larger at approximately 55 staff.  As the Deputy will recall, there were a number of targeted exit programmes that sought to reduce the number of staff employed in the public service generally, but also in the HSE in what is known as the management and administration category.  Large numbers of people were able to raise their hands and leave the organisation.  The internal audit function shrank to approximately 40 staff during that period.  Although I have had to do so by reprioritising, I have increased that figure to 50 in recent years in response to some of the issues that have emerged.  In addition, I have established the compliance unit specifically to examine how effective we are in monitoring our service arrangements and service agreements.  Mr. Brian Purcell heads that unit.  He has 11 whole-time-equivalents, WTEs, but I am seeking to prioritise three more in order to strengthen that area further.<\/p> <p>  In all respects, there are limitations on our ability to recruit management and administration staff.  There is a bit of a fatwa in that regard, as colleagues will be aware.  Management and administration grades are not properly valued in general, but without such staff, one cannot have an internal audit function.  Nonetheless, and given the scale of the organisation, although it is the largest internal audit function in the public sector, it is probably significantly undersized.  In a previous question, we were asked about why we relied on external auditors' annual financial statements and certificates.  Essentially, it is because we have to.  We could not replicate that through some other mechanism.  It is worth noting that, between 2007 and 2015, Console received a clean audit certificate every year from its auditors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016071500002#K02200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1468573200,"counter":320,"content":"<p>It should be a matter of extreme concern to this committee that, as someone who is responsible for a spend of more than &euro;13 billion in the HSE, with &euro;3.6 billion going to sections 38 and 39 agencies, Mr. O'Brien stated that the HSE's audit function and the allocation of resources to oversight were \"probably significantly\" underfunded.

There is no individual percentage of total spend that would be appropriate to dedicate to internal audit or oversight.  That is why when I made my opening remarks I presented a sort of overall framework in which audit and investigation is just one part.  It is very important to recognise that internal audit is only a part of an overall system of financial control.  Looking at the HSE's financial statements, the statement on the system of internal financial control is very extensive and covers very many other risks that exist within the organisation.<\/p> <p>  There must be controls around the taking on of grant-assisted bodies.  There must be awareness throughout the organisation that is dealing with grant-funded entities; information must be shared within the oversight organisation.  If anything untoward comes to light, it should be brought together and assessed as a whole.  It is certainly important to have an adequate internal audit function but it must be set in a context that there are other controls relied upon.<\/p> <p>  References were made earlier to reliance on the sets of audited financial statements.  If the public sector is not able to rely on the audited financial statements of grant-funded bodies, we will grind to a halt.  We must rely on them.  Bodies like the HSE and the Arts Council, among other entities, rely on those kinds of financial statements.  There is an assumption that there is a regime existing meaning the quality of the audit will be sufficient and it can be relied upon.  That does not mean it will not fail from time to time.  I am not judging what has happened in this case but it is certainly a key control.<\/p> <p>  The other question was around the adequacy of carrying out 13 audits from a total of a couple of thousand funded bodies.  It is a point we have made on a number of occasions.  One certainly needs the capacity to respond and carry out investigations where suspicions are raised.<\/p><p>It is also probably very important that there be a regime of random audits conducted for no particular reason other than that it is time to look at a selection of bodies.  It may alert them to weaknesses in their own control systems.  Even looking at 13, there will be lessons to be learned.  The important thing is to harvest those lessons and feed them back into the rest of the control system.  Stating there will be a process of random selection may have a deterrent effect, which is probably one of the most important aspects of that type of internal audit function.  A body may be selected for no particular reason, it may not have done anything wrong.  Sometimes there is a criticism that resources are put into the wrong area by auditing entities about which there is no suspicion, and that it may be a waste of time when auditing should be trying to detect irregularities, but the random selection and testing of a reasonable number should tell things that perhaps need to be addressed.  It also has that deterrent effect that anybody can expect an audit at any particular time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016071500002#L02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468573200,"counter":347,"content":"<p>Does Mr. McCarthy accept that 13 out of 1,700 cannot be regarded as a reasonable number and for people who are so inclined to misappropriate money, their chances of getting away with it are pretty strong?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016071500002#M00200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1468573200,"counter":348,"content":"<p>Yes, there does need to be visibility on a scale and publicity around it also, stating that 20 or 30 random audits were carried out which found lessons that need to be learned.

First, the matters that arose and were identified by internal audit were brought to the Garda bureau of fraud investigation in February 2016.  Second, while we are satisfied that while the agreement continued we had been obtaining value for money, we were concerned to ensure by one means or another - and we now know what that other means is - these services would continue to be available to clients, which must be a primary concern of ours.  The only reason we had to go through the sequential steps is because that is the appropriate process for bringing an internal audit to conclusion.  I give an example of how the Comptroller and Auditor General or any auditor conducts his or her work.  They reach preliminary findings and give the person against whom the findings are made an opportunity to comment and that is the normal process.  When this came to the national director of mental health, her concern was to ensure that this audit report and her ability to act on it were not in any way compromised.  She had to follow appropriate procedure and give the organisation, with all that we know about it, an opportunity to make submissions to her before she reached her final decision.  That final decision, undoubtedly, would have been to withdraw funding from this organisation and to move services elsewhere.  That is something that was already well under consideration long before \"Prime Time\".  Just to be clear, without the internal audit, there would have been no \"Prime Time\" programme.  So, there is absolutely no foundation for suggesting that we were sitting back and saying \"Oh, we are getting great value for money; we will let Console continue\".

Again, as I mentioned, prior to that it was relatively low in the overall scheme of things, but once the helpline funding was added to it, a more comprehensive engagement took place in respect of performance management.  It was that more robust process that identified or highlighted the difficulties with the organisation.  The engagements that took place on foot of the allocation of that additional funding became very difficult.  The organisation did not supply the information that was being sought.

However, if we are to get to the bottom of this, we must know the dynamics at that time, what was done, what letters were sent, what meetings were held, what was not done and why it was not done.  We must establish that there was no inner sanctum or circle or just pure sloppiness on the part of people who were charged with protecting public money.

At a previous committee hearing, information was furnished to members in respect of the internal audit and the outstanding recommendations.  Two recommendations were not fully implemented at the time, May 2015.  One of these related to the sizing and payments for staff in the section 38 agencies.  A second issue related to 85 business cases.  These would previously have been brought to the attention of committee members.  HSE staff were engaging with colleagues in the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of a process around red-circling these business cases and ceasing these business cases, etc.<\/p> <p>  There was significant interaction between the HSE, the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform from September last year.  On 14 September, the Department of Health furnished us with the relevant circular.  We can establish this as we go on but it might be more helpful to committee members if we give the committee all this correspondence in one go because we may need to reference it.  I have all the correspondence that I will be referring to before me.  On 14 September, we received clarification from the Department of Health relating to the salary rates for chief executive appointments at section 38 agencies.  On 3 September, we received interesting correspondence from the Department on how we would deal with unapproved allowances and remuneration levels in section 38 agencies.  This gave us a mechanism to deal with the 85 business cases that had gone to the Department of Health which I have referenced.  Using the criteria set out in this circular from the Department, we were able to analyse each of the 85 business cases and make determinations on them.  We have done that.

Finally, the correspondence stated that where appropriate all overpayments had been or were in the process of being recouped as expeditiously as possible.<br\/><br\/>Again, I have the correspondence and I can share it with committee members.  We were notified on 1 July by St. John of God.  The correspondence goes through the full chronology in a detailed letter.  St. John of God notified us that significant payments had been made to 14 senior managers.  One paragraph of particular interest in the letter states:<\/p><blockquote>It is acknowledged that details of the above regularisation arrangements and the external financial advice received at this time was not shared with the HSE. The order... understood and took it that arrangements entered into on the basis of salary advice received was regularised in salary arrangements in compliance with consolidated pay scales.<\/blockquote><p>It is very important to note that 1 July was the first time that the HSE was made aware of these payments to the 14 managers.  The names and payments are listed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016071500002#V03100","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosarii Mannion","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468573200,"counter":617,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Mannion.

One has to introduce things continually, find out what loopholes people have found and then try to plug them.  As I said, we introduced the annual compliance statement for section 38s, which is where the vast bulk of this money goes.  It is typical, when managing risk, that one starts with one's greatest area of risk which is, generally speaking, related to the greatest amount of money.  We established the compliance unit because, frankly, over the years of massive change, reduction of staff and a lot of attrition of people with significant experience, I reached the view that many of those at local level were overstretched in terms of what was being required of them and did not have either the time or the ability to track this in an efficient way.

Our statements of internal financial control are probably the frankest statements of internal financial control that will be found anywhere.  We identify very specifically what we see as the weaknesses and what, in the year in question, we are seeking to do.  We have followed through on all of those.

One was the Commission on Health Sector Finance by Niamh Brennan.  She set out what the infrastructural requirements would be to have a national statutory health executive and how it could function to the best effect in terms of financial systems and so on.  I can say that was not part of the design of the HSE.  The HSE had some inherent weaknesses when it was created.  We are seeing the product of that and we are moving step by step to address those weaknesses.

As Deputy Kelly put it in his pie metaphor, if 42% of the money is going to an organisation from the HSE in a given year and 58% of the money is coming from other sources, that goes into a bank account.  If I donate &euro;1 to an organisation and the HSE also donates &euro;1 to it, if &euro;1 is spent inappropriately, it is 50% of the money from both of us that is spent inappropriately.

That is a poor reflection on systems within the HSE.  If there were robust oversight systems, it would not be down to individuals.  The system should operate properly and records should be kept of complaints.  I acknowledge there has been constant churn in the HSE but saying that everybody has changed roles is not an answer to a question about whether there was a complaint ten years ago.  There is an acceptance that concerns had been raised of one kind or another since 2009.  I think the officials will accept that.  How was it then that, in 2013, Console's funding increased by 120% given many of those concerns were live and under consideration?  Why did the HSE increase the funding by 120% without, apparently, due diligence?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to St. John of God and why action was not action.  We were told that the HSE was informed by St. John of God in 2013 that it was in breach of public sector pay rules.  The Comptroller and Auditor General told us that he informed the HSE in 2013 in the same vein, yet Mr. O'Brien said in his opening statement: \"Consequently, I have asked the HSE's internal audit division to conduct a review of these matters as a matter of urgency.\"  This matters were brought to his attention by St. John of God and the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2013 and, therefore, it is hardly \"as a matter of urgency\" that he is dealing with them in 2016.  What is the reason for the three-year delay?<\/p> <p>  My final question relates to auditing.  The HSE funds 304 organisations in excess of &euro;250,000 a year.  There are questions about others.  Could Dr. Smith take us through the procedure?  Presumably, all 304 organisations are required to have audited accounts.  Does the HSE receive copies of those accounts?  What is the oversight scenario regarding such accounts?  Dr. Smith referred earlier to accounts on which she conducts the external audit.  Who were Console's auditors?  Did they at any stage raise concerns with Dr. Smith about probity issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016071500002#EE03700","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1468573200,"counter":897,"content":"<p>I will deal with the St. John of God issue first.

The helpline was about to collapse and there was a very significant focus on supporting people who were bereaved by suicide at that time.  An immediate action had to be taken.  Console were already a provider of a similar helpline and it was felt that was the best fit at that time.

The heading is &quot;A note to editors&quot;.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>A review is underway into the St John of God Order&rsquo;s payments to mitigate a future possible pension liability and contractual obligations in 2013, which resulted in payments of &euro;1.64m to 14 employees.  On Friday 8th July, the HSE stated to the media that the Saint John of God Order was not in compliance in respect of these payments.  This statement was made before the review had even commenced and the Order believes such a statement is seriously prejudicial to a fair review.<br \/><br \/>Separately the Order is still awaiting a response from the HSE on this matter, following a letter it sent to the HSE on Monday of this week.<\/blockquote> <p>I will cut in here to say that that letter was from a firm of solicitors acting for the order.  It goes on to state:<\/p><blockquote>The Order is very keen to co-operate fully with the HSE review once a fair and due process is followed.<br \/><br \/>Understandably, subsequent media coverage has reflected the prejudicial nature of the HSE statement confirming the result or final determination of the proposed review.  Radio and TV interviews and commentary and press headlines and reporting have included frequent references to &quot;salary top-ups to 14 St. John of God&quot; personnel.<br \/><br \/>In the interests of fairness and factual correctness, the order humbly requests that editors would use &quot;payments (totalling &euro;1.64 million) to St. John of God employees, which are now subject to HSE review&quot;.<\/blockquote> <p>Then in bold print one line appears which states:<\/p><blockquote>To describe them as salary top-ups is simply incorrect.<br \/><br \/>The payments were made following independent professional advice to discharge a possible future pension liability and contractual obligations, and should not be described as a salary top-up.<br \/><br \/>Further, also note the St. John of God Order is a worldwide organisation.  St. John of God Community Services (Ireland) is a section 38 entity.  Unfortunately, there have been frequent general references to the St. John of God Order and also references to St. John of God Hospital.  The hospital is not a section 38 entity or part of St. John of God Community Service.<br \/><br \/>We would therefore request that TV footage or photographs do not feature the hospital.<br \/><br \/>Our office will be happy to accommodate the media by arranging permission to shoot or photograph the appropriate facilities that are part of the section 38 St. John of God Community Services.  <br \/><br \/>Kind regards.<\/blockquote> <p>It is signed by a named individual for a named PR company.

Obviously, it is important, having put the system in place, to check that it is working.

In fairness to the HSE, I would have to say it does take that very seriously.  It does carry out that review of the effectiveness of the system and it accepts and discloses in the statement on internal financial control that it is not perfect and that it needs to be improved.

That could produce a situation whereby the HSE pays Console for all the services it provided, whereas the people who provided those services, that is, some of the people on the helpline, may not have been paid.  The HSE could find that, even though the service was provided, some of the resources that it provided for the service were not used to pay the people who provided the service.

We will discuss that in private session, but I just wanted to be clear on that.  Mr. O'Brien has made it clear in correspondence submitted to the committee, although the point was made more subtly earlier, that the HSE does not normally publish the internal audit report on its website.
