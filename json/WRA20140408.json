The ECB stated that incoming information confirms that the moderate recovery of the euro area economy is proceeding in line with its precious assessment. However, the ECB also expects that there will be a prolonged period of low inflation. The ECB is committed to doing anything that will keep this period of low inflation from dragging on too long. Therefore key ECB interest rates are expected to remain low for some time yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800052#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":8,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 7 and 8 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Meetings","counter":9,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800052#WRA00650"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[16183\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800052#WRA00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the discussion that took place recently between Finance Ministers in Athens; the decisions made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":11,"content":"<p>European\u00a0Finance Ministers met\u00a0recently in Athens as part of\u00a0the Greek Presidency.\u00a0 The Eurogroup (a meeting of the Finance Ministers of the 18 Eurozone countries) met first on the morning of 1st April chaired by the President of the Eurogroup and Dutch Finance Minister, Mr Jeroen Dijsselbloem.\u00a0 The second meeting was an Informal Ecofin meeting\u00a0of the 28 members of the EU represented by Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors.\u00a0 This meeting took place on the afternoon of the 1st of April and the following day, 2nd April.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ireland was represented by\u00a0Minister of State, Brian Hayes TD and Governor Patrick Honohan. <\/p><p>  The President of the Eurogroup speaks on behalf of the Eurogroup and, as is normal, held a press conference after the meeting.\u00a0 His remarks are available on the Eurozone press website.\u00a0 In summary, the Eurogroup meeting discussed the situation in Greece and in\u00a0Portugal and it was updated on the state of play in the Ukraine.

To a certain extent this is a necessary process given the high and ultimately unsustainable levels of lending to households in the years to 2008. Households are also reducing their indebtedness in response to the large reduction in the value of their assets, mainly due to the considerable decline in the value of housing wealth in the years to 2013.<\/p><p>  Consumption by households in Ireland fell by 7 per cent between 2008 and 2013 according to the CSO. This was due to a number of factors, both the substantial decline in employment over the period but the reduction in lending to households is likely to have played a part. Over the medium term high levels of household indebtedness and the need to repair household balance sheets are likely to mean that the savings rate will remain relatively high, with implications for household consumption.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>  Nonetheless, recent developments in the domestic economy have been positive of late. Employment grew by 3.3 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter of last year. Unemployment has fallen by three percentage points over the last three years.

It must, be borne in mind, however, that the quantity of cigarettes seized in a given year can be influenced significantly by the occurrence of a particularly large seizure or seizures, and the level of seizures in 2013 must be viewed against the background of a number of very large seizures in the preceding years. I understand also that the Revenue Commissioners participate actively in multilateral controlled deliveries of smuggled cigarettes and tobacco, resulting in the seizure of illicit products in other jurisdictions before they reach Ireland.<\/p><p>  I am advised also that the quantity of cigarettes seized has declined in most EU Member States over the last number of years and that this reflects, in considerable part, a changed practice adopted by the organised crime gangs that are responsible for a large element of the illicit trade. There has been a movement from large consignments in containers to smaller consignments in deeper concealment within groupage loads, and these can be more difficult to detect. The Revenue Commissioners and their counterparts in other EU Member States are working together to combat this form of smuggling and to ensure that the disruptive effect of seizures on the illicit trade is maximised.<\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners arrange for annual estimations of the extent of the illicit cigarette market, through surveys of smokers undertaken for them and the Health Services Executive. The survey for 2012 found that 13% of the cigarettes consumed in Ireland were illicit. The comparable figure for 2011 was 14%. This would suggest that the extent of the problem is being contained, as a result of the action being taken against the smuggling and sale of illicit product.<\/p><p>  I am aware that some other surveys indicate a higher level of illicit tobacco consumption. However, I do not accept the validity of these other surveys, as they are not representative of the entire smoking population and do not take into account legal personal imports from other jurisdictions.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  The action to combat the illicit trade will continue to be a high priority for the Revenue Commissioners and they will continue to operate an extensive range of measures designed to identify and target those who are engaged in the sale or supply of illicit products, with a view both to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible.<\/p><p>  In relation to staff numbers, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that  they are a fully integrated tax and customs administration and that it is not possible to disaggregate resources deployed exclusively at any given time on action against the illicit trade in tobacco products. Revenue currently has approximately 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to targeting and confronting non-compliance. These front-line activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection.<\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are subject to the Employment Control Framework staffing reductions imposed since 2009. Revenue's overall staffing levels have reduced from a total of 6,581 full-time equivalents at the end of 2008 to the current level of 5,757. Notwithstanding this reduction, Revenue staff resources assigned to compliance activities have been maintained at around 2,000. The Revenue Commissioners are committed to ensuring that, despite the staffing reductions, enforcement work generally, and action against the illicit tobacco trade specifically, will continue to be resourced to the maximum extent possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800052#WRA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services Regulation","counter":19,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800052#WRA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":20,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[15986\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800052#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his view on light touch regulation in the financial services industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":21,"content":"<p>The experience of the financial crisis has discredited 'light touch' regulation.

However, I have also said that although it is my intention to alleviate the burden I can only do so when the public finances allow it. Lest it has escaped anybody's attention, the general government debt at end 2013 is currently estimated to be just over &euro;200 billion and each year where we incur an annual deficit that figure grows. It is imperative that we, at the very least, are able to meet the interest costs on this debt if this is not to spiral ever upwards. Interest payments are the least productive area of government expenditure and what we currently spend on interest could be put to better use elsewhere.<\/p><p>   Although we have successfully exited the EU\/IMF bailout this does not mean that we will ever allow a return to past practices where expenditure grew to unsustainable levels while the tax base was simultaneously hollowed out.<\/p><p>   The Government remains committed to returning the public finances to sustainability. Under the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact, until Ireland has reached its objective of a balanced budget in structural terms, we may not introduce discretionary revenue reductions unless they are matched by other revenue increases or expenditure reductions. This means that Government must consider carefully any tax changes as any reductions will have to be offset elsewhere.<\/p><p>  Having said this, it should be acknowledged that Ireland has a progressive taxation system which ensures that the burden of taxation falls most heavily on those with a higher ability to pay. The latest data from the OECD's 2013 Taxing Wages report shows that Ireland has one of the most progressive income tax systems in the developed world. It is in this context that the Government has committed in the Programme for Government not to increase the marginal rate of income tax. <\/p><p>  The Programme for Government also contains a commitment not to change tax credits which at current levels ensure that an estimated 856,000 income earners are excluded from the charge to income tax entirely. The low effective tax rates for low income earners ensure that work pays and is a growth friendly aspect of Ireland's tax system. However against this Ireland has one of the highest top marginal tax rates in the OECD, whilst also having a very low entry point to the application of the top marginal rates. These aspects are less growth friendly due to their negative labour supply incentives. <\/p><p>  Recent research from my Department has indicated that growth and employment prospects can be enhanced through a careful rebalancing of the tax system away from labour taxation towards greater use of capital and consumption taxes. Research by the OECD and the European Commission would also support such a rebalancing. These insights are useful given the fiscal constraints to which\u00a0I have already referred.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  It is a little early to consider, let alone set out, changes to the tax system in advance of the Budget, which is\u00a0just over\u00a0six months away.

There is significant engagement with representatives of legitimate business, through the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group, which is chaired by the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p><p>  Revenue's tax compliance programmes\u00a0are under constant review to ensure that they are focussed on the areas of greatest risk, including risks from the shadow\/hidden economy.\u00a0 I am informed that Revenue tackles the problem of tax and duty evasion through\u00a0their range of compliance and audit interventions including through targeted special projects. Case interventions are undertaken based on Revenue's assessment of compliance risks, the level of those risks and other relevant information available.\u00a0 The Revenue Commissioners are assisted in the process of assessing risks and identifying suitable cases in which to intervene by using their Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling (REAP) system.\u00a0 REAP integrates data from a range of sources, including internal Revenue information and external third party sources and risk rates taxpayers accordingly.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  Revenue deploys the full range of compliance interventions to tackle those risks and activities undertaken and these include covert surveillance, cold calls to businesses and venues as well as aspect queries on specific items.<\/p><p>  For my part, I have it made clear that I am committed to introducing measures that will assist the Revenue Commissioners in their work to combat shadow economy activity, and that I will respond positively where a case is made for further powers or other statutory measures that would strengthen Revenue's hand in dealing with such activity. <\/p><p>  In the specific case of the illicit tobacco trade, I am aware that combating this trade is, and will continue to be, a high priority for the Revenue Commissioners. Their work against this illegal activity includes a range of measures designed to identify and target those who are engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible. This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and within the country. Revenue will continue to act against all stages of the supply chain for illicit tobacco products and will make every effort to ensure that those involved in the illicit trade are brought to account before the Courts for their criminal activities.<\/p><p>  I have provided for a number of new measures in recent Finance Acts that are designed to assist the Revenue Commissioners in the work against the illicit tobacco trade. Provisions in the Finance Act 2013 will allow them to deal more effectively with the risk of the illicit manufacture of tobacco products, and include a new offence relating to illicit production of tobacco products, as well as provision for forfeiture of equipment or material used in illicit production. In addition, the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 has made provision for a power of search of baggage and receptacles, where there is reasonable belief that a person is guilty of an offence of dealing illegally in unstamped tobacco products.<\/p><p>  Action has been taken also against fuel fraud. Following on from initiatives that have strengthened the licensing of fuel traders and brought about enhanced control of the fuels supply chain, the Finance (no. 2) Act 2013 makes a supplier who is reckless in supplying rebated fuel liable for duty where that fuel is used for an illicit purpose. In addition, Revenue and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom have worked together to identify a more effective marker for marked gas oil, for use in both jurisdictions. The new marker, which was announced on 13 February 2014, will be more resistant to laundering and will, therefore, be a key element of Revenue's overall strategy for dealing with that problem. The new marker will be introduced in consultation with the oil industry and is expected to be in place within 12 to 18 months.<\/p><p>  I have also introduced specific Finance Bill measures to counteract shadow economy activity and fraudulent practices that undermine the VAT base.\u00a0 One such provision seeks to deter possible collusion between a supplier and customer for the purpose of taking part in, or facilitating VAT fraud. A second measure provides that credit for VAT on goods and services purchased is disallowed where a business has not, within a six month period, fully or partly paid for them, and repayment of the VAT claimed on those purchases will be required. Thirdly, the Revenue Commissioners will be able to issue notices requiring businesses to provide specific information in circumstances where Revenue has reasonable grounds for believing that the information might assist in identifying shadow economy activity.<\/p><p>  I should add that legitimate businesses can also assist in combating the shadow economy, by providing information on shadow economy activities to the Revenue Commissioners or other relevant State agencies, and I would encourage them to support the extensive work that is being carried out against illicit activities by doing so.  \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800053#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Availability","counter":96,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800053#WRB01650"},{"type":"question","counter":97,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[16174\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800053#WRB01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of the announcement that KfW will provide credit facilities in the Irish economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":98,"content":"<p>Senior officials of the Department of Finance have already exchanged working papers on this subject with KfW and the German Ministry of Finance.\u00a0 There have been meetings on this matter in Berlin, Frankfurt and Dublin as well as numerous teleconferences.<\/p><p>  The NTMA and the Department of Finance are currently working on the detail of the debt products to be offered to the SME sector with a view to making them attractive in terms of both cash flow and accessibility to the sector.\u00a0 As we are trying to ensure that any initiative that comes out of this process is as effective as it can be, we will be discussing approaches that meet the strategic objectives of\u00a0 all stakeholders and ultimately facilitate lending to the real economy, in particular SMEs in Ireland.<\/p><p>  The precise arrangements for the structure, level of funding and distribution options are currently the subject of the discussions between the relevant officials at present and will have to adhere to EU State Aid considerations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800053#WRB01800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Banking Sector","counter":99,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800053#WRB01850"},{"type":"question","counter":100,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[15984\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800053#WRB01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his position on retaining the State's shares in Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Bank and Permanent TSB.","asker":"1020","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":101,"content":"<p>I have stated\u00a0in the past that I do not see the State as a long-term investor in the banking sector and I am keen to return the banks to private ownership at the appropriate time, having considered the overall interests of the taxpayer.<\/p><p>  The State has already executed the successful disposal of some of its investments in the banks.

The objective of the review is focused solely on determining whether the banks have enough provisions against their loans and capital. Irish banks have just undergone such an exercise, their second in less than three years, which led to a substantial increase in their loan loss provisions at year end.

In the case of adaptations to a property, the exemption will only apply where the cost of the adaptations exceeds 25% of the market value of the property before it is adapted. <\/p><p>  Also, where an exemption cannot be claimed under section 10B of the Act, an incapacitated person may qualify for a reduction in the market value of their property under section 15A of the 2012 Act.  This section provides for a reduction in the market value of a residential property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person where the adaptation has been grant-aided or approved for grant aid, by a local authority, and where the adaptation increases the market value of the property. Furthermore, the person with the disability must occupy the property as his or her sole or main residence after the adaptation is completed.  The reduction in value is limited to the lesser of the chargeable value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property and the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme.  The relief ends on the sale or transfer of a property unless the person with the disability continues to reside in the property.  It should also be noted that the impact of such adaptations on a property may decrease its value which may in turn impact on the LPT liability.<\/p><p>  In regard to the specific case to which the Deputy refers I can confirm that there is no provision in the legislation to provide for an exemption from LPT in the circumstances outlined.

The objective of the ESM's DRI will be to preserve the financial stability of the euro area as a whole and of its Member States in line with Article 3 of the ESM Treaty, and to help remove the risk of contagion from the financial sector to the sovereign by allowing the recapitalisation of institutions directly.<\/p><p>There is a specific provision included in the main features of the DRI, which states that &quot;The potential retroactive application of the instrument should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.&quot; Therefore, the agreement, that we were active in negotiating, keeps open the possibility to apply to the European Stability Mechanism for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks, should we wish to avail of it. <\/p><p>The operational framework of the DRI has been discussed at ministerial level and the aim is to complete this discussion as soon as possible in order to allow the ESM Member States sufficient time to complete any necessary national procedures before the SSM is in place and operational later this year.

Its purpose is to ensure that resolution can take place at the same level as supervision, rather than being conducted at national level.\u00a0 \u00a0It is considered as an important contributing factor to breaking the link between the sovereign and the banking sector.\u00a0<\/p><p>    The SRM will allow decisions to be made in a more objective and independent fashion than if they were been made by national supervisors. The proposal which has been agreed sees the SRM taking its decisions in line with the principles of resolution set out in the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive in particular that shareholders and creditors should bear the costs of resolution before any external funding is granted, and private sector solutions should be found instead of using taxpayers' money.\u00a0 It is felt that in most scenarios, contributions by shareholders and creditors should be sufficient to finance resolution. If exceptionally, additional resources were needed a Single Resolution Fund with a target level of 1% of covered deposits within the Banking Union (approx. &euro;55bn) will come into place as a last resort to finance the bank resolution process.<\/p><p>   In the General Council approach reached on SRM at the extraordinary ECOFIN on 18 December 2013, it was agreed that as part of the overall compromise that aspects of the SRM relating to financing be carved out of the Regulation, in particular the transfer of contributions from national resolution funds to national compartments in the SRM, and gradual mutualisation of national compartments in the SRM. This approach was adopted because certain member states \u00a0were not satisfied that Article 114 provided an appropriate legal basis for the operation of the Single Resolution Fund. <\/p><p>  Under the recently reached agreement between the Greek Presidency and the European Parliament, the transition period to a fully mutualized SRF has been reduced to 8 years. In addition the pace of\u00a0mutualisation has been significantly increased in such a way that within two years 60% mutualisation will occur with the balance being achieved in a linear fashion up until the end of year 8. <\/p><p>  What this means in practical terms is that if a bank is failing or likely to fail the first step is that the bail-in rules will be applied to losses. If there are still losses to be absorbed, the next point of contribution will be the funds within the Member State's national compartment in the SRF, followed by the mutualised part of the national compartments of other Member States. After 8 years the SRF will be fully mutualised.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800055#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabled Drivers Grant Eligibility","counter":232,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800055#WRD01350"},{"type":"question","counter":233,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[16003\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800055#WRD01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding fund raising; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1184","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":234,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the relevant legislation governing the Drivers &amp;amp; Passengers with Disabilities Scheme is contained in Section 134(3) of the Finance Act 1992 (as amended) and Statutory Instrument No: 353 of 1994 (Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994 (as amended). <\/p><p>The Scheme provides for relief from VAT and VRT (subject to limits) on the purchase and adaptation of a vehicle by an organisation for use in the transport of people with severe and permanent disabilities.

This deadline was widely publicised both on the Revenue website, in newspaper advertisements and through interviews with Revenue spokespersons on local and national media during the six week period between 18 February and 31 March.\u00a0 The Deputy will also be aware that, due to the volume of calls received on their helpline on 31 March, the Commissioners extended this deadline by two days to 2 April. <\/p><p>I am advised that as a result of their information campaign, many property owners have taken the necessary action to sort out their LPT affairs. To date, a compliance rate of 93% has been achieved for 2013 and the rate for 2014 currently stands at 88%. In relation to payment of Household Charge arrears, the Commissioners have confirmed that to date about &euro;5.6m has been paid directly to Revenue in respect of about 28,500 properties.\u00a0 I am informed that Revenue is still handling significant numbers of contacts from property owners anxious to regularise their affairs.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The Revenue Commissioners have confirmed to me that no interest or penalties have been charged to date on Local Property Tax arrears, however, as they have consistently stated over the past number of weeks, they will begin to impose these charges where a property owner does not engage with them.\u00a0 In that regard, Section 149 of the 2012 Act provides for the charging of interest on late payment of LPT (including Household Charge) at an annual rate of 8%.\u00a0 I should add that this rate is the same rate of interest charged on overdue income tax.<\/p><p>I, therefore, strongly encourage property owners to make immediate arrangements to pay any outstanding LPT and Household Charge arrears by accessing their LPT record on-line using their Property ID, PIN and PPSN.\u00a0 Where assistance is required to file on-line, or where a person does not have their Property ID or PIN, they should call the LPT helpline on 1890 200 255. <\/p><p>While I appreciate the Deputy s comments about the hardship involved for certain sections of the community, as I explained earlier, the LPT legislation provides a wide range of payment options for property owners to avail of and to choose from based on the payment type that best suits their needs.\u00a0 These include phased payment options by way of direct debit from certain credit union or bank accounts, or by deduction at source from occupational pensions and certain Government payments, including Department of Social Protection payments.\u00a0 The property owner can also make regular weekly or monthly payments to one of the three payment service providers which are An Post, Payzone and Omnivend. <\/p><p>Also, specifically in cases where a person is having difficulty meeting their obligations,\u00a0 Part 12 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for a system of deferral arrangements for owner-occupiers where there is an inability to pay the tax and the person meets certain criteria based on income thresholds.\u00a0 For example, an older person, whose only source of income is a payment from the Department of Social Protection would qualify for full deferral of the LPT charge, including any arrears of the Household Charge.\u00a0 However, if a person has income in addition to any DSP payment, they will qualify for deferral if their gross annual income is less than &euro;15,000 for a single person or &euro;25,000 for a couple. They would qualify to defer 50% of their LPT charge where their gross annual income is less than &euro;25,000 for a single person or &euro;35,000 for a couple and the remaining 50% of the tax must be paid. <\/p><p>Further details of the deferral arrangements available are set out on the Revenue website at .\u00a0 The Commissioners also engaged extensively with Citizens  Information Centres and the deferral principles are well understood by their staff.\u00a0 It is very important at this stage, as the Revenue Commissioners move into their compliance campaign, that anyone qualifying for deferral of the tax applies to the Revenue Commissioners as a matter of urgency.\u00a0 Again, this can be done very easily by going on-line or contacting the LPT helpline.\u00a0 <\/p><p>It is my firm view that LPT, in common with all other taxes and duties, must have a robust but reasonable set of sanctions open to the Revenue Commissioners to apply in appropriate cases.\u00a0 Given the very high levels of voluntary compliance to date for LPT, there is an onus on the Commissioners to pursue the non-compliant and to impose appropriate additional charges.\u00a0 The deferral options that I have legislated for are there to address hardship cases.\u00a0 In view of the foregoing, I have no plans to amend the legislation in relation to the charging of interest and penalties on late payments of LPT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800055#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Rebates","counter":241,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800055#WRD01950"},{"type":"question","counter":242,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[16015\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800055#WRD02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of deductions for universal social charge and PAYE in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Galway; the reason in view of their income level this person is liable for USC and PAYE; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1185","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":243,"content":"<p>The Universal Social Charge (USC)\u00a0is payable when an individual's gross income exceeds a threshold of &euro;10,036 per annum.

This includes providing customer support, updating the register and processing returns and payments for LPT. This year, up to 31 March, some\u00a0 82,000 telephone calls and about 90,000 items of correspondence have been handled by Revenue staff in relation to LPT and Household charge.<\/p><p>  As the Revenue Commissioners announced some weeks ago, a final opportunity was afforded to property owners to bring their LPT and Household charge affairs up to date before they begin to focus on tackling LPT non-compliance. This\u00a0 will commence in the coming weeks as soon as Revenue has processed the large volume of payments and correspondence, of which there is about 40,000 items on hand, received up to 31 March.\u00a0 The Commissioners advise me that they expect to deploy 40-50 full time staff initially on this work.<\/p><p>  In regard to LPT staffing, it is internationally recognised that property taxes require proportionately more resources to administer compared to other forms of taxation.\u00a0 However, the introduction of property taxes needs to be considered in the context of broadening the overall tax base to achieve a more sustainable fiscal position.\u00a0 I am satisfied that Revenue has prioritised its staffing resources appropriately to ensure the successful introduction of a significant new tax.<\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners are subject to the Employment Control Framework staffing reductions imposed since 2009 in the context of government policy\u00a0\u00a0 Revenue's overall staffing levels have reduced from a total of 6,581 at the end of 2008 to its current level of 5,757.\u00a0 Notwithstanding this reduction, Revenue staff resources assigned to compliance activities have been maintained at around 2,000. These front-line activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt management.\u00a0 I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners have accorded a very high priority to tackling tax and duty evasion, including the shadow economy. Revenue is committed to ensuring that despite the staff reductions that this compliance work will continue to be resourced to the maximum extent possible.<\/p><p>  The return on investment can vary depending on the activity and the availability of suitably trained and experienced staff. There is a very different grade and skills mix, for example, between LPT and\u00a0 revenue audit activity.\u00a0 Reassigning staff from one activity to another would require significant investment in learning and development before they become fully effective in their new role. Once fully trained, the direct return on investment for a Revenue auditor could be expected to be &euro;10 for every &euro;1 spent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800056#WRE02400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":296,"content":"<p>Question No. 112 answered with Question No. 83.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Debt Restructuring","counter":297,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800056#WRE02600"},{"type":"question","counter":298,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[16304\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800056#WRE02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the options available to persons (details supplied) in Dublin 8 regarding a write down; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1030","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":299,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, I,\u00a0in my role as Minister for Finance,\u00a0have\u00a0no statutory function in relation to banking decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time.

On that basis, property owners have had significant periods of time to get their affairs in order.

The CCMA was put in place under section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989 and lenders covered by the Code are required to comply with it as a matter of law.\u00a0 The Central Bank has the power\u00a0to administer sanctions\u00a0for a contravention of the CCMA.<\/p><p>The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers in mortgage difficulty.

","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":331,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that with effect from 1 July 2013, Section 156 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) converted all outstanding Household Charge (HHC) liabilities to Local Property Tax (LPT) and increased the outstanding charge to &euro;200. Section 156 also made Revenue responsible for the collection of the outstanding arrears.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  In setting up LPT, Revenue received the HHC Register from the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) and used it to form part of the building blocks of the LPT Register. As part of the matching process, Revenue cross-referenced both registers to identify a database of properties for which the HHC is still outstanding. However, it is accepted that the database may not be 100% accurate for a number of reasons, including:<\/p><p>  - The LGMA Register captured the name of the person who paid the HHC rather than the owner of the property, therefore, for example, where a son or daughter paid the HHC on behalf of a parent and particularly where the address of the property was a 'non-unique' rural address, Revenue may not have been able to match the HHC payment to the right property.<\/p><p>  - The legislative basis for both the HHC and LPT are different. For example, some properties that are liable for LPT were exempt from the HHC but the LGMA Register did not capture such exemption details in all cases. For that reason, Revenue could not identify every property that was exempt from HHC through the cross-referencing process.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, Revenue has advised me that any property owner can look up the Revenue online system and see if the Register shows an outstanding HHC arrear in respect of their property. Given the difficulties in matching the records to 100% accuracy, I would strongly recommend anyone who has paid the HHC or who was exempt from the HHC to do this and if the &euro;200 charge is on record, correct the information before Revenue starts its compliance programme.\u00a0\u00a0Revenue has also confirmed to me that it is still in the process of dealing with the large amount of payments, correspondence and telephone queries received in respect of HHC in the period up to the extended 'compliance' deadline of 2 April 2014. This work will be completed in approximately two weeks at which point Revenue will begin its compliance campaign. I would strongly encourage anyone who owes the HHC to go online and pay the &euro;200 before the compliance campaign begins.<\/p><p>\u00a0 In regard to the compliance campaign, none of the actions listed in the Deputy's question have yet taken place in relation to the Household Charge.\u00a0 Revenue has advised that because liable persons did not previously receive any correspondence from the LGMA in respect of amounts outstanding and because Revenue never initiates debt collection\/enforcement activity without prior warning, the initial step will be to write to those people that have a HCC charge arrear on the Register. They will be advised of the liability and the steps they should take if they have already paid the amount indicated as due. They will also be advised on the steps to take if they were exempt from the HHC. For those who are taxed through the PAYE system they will also be advised that an instruction will issue to their employer or occupational pension provider to deduct the &euro;200 charge from their wages\/pension between May and December of this year. Recipients of the letter will then have a ten-day period to choose an alternative payment method to prevent the instruction issuing to their employer.<\/p><p>\u00a0\u00a0For those whose only income is from the Department of Social Protection and who are likely to qualify for a deferral, they will be offered that opportunity. Revenue will also write to non-PAYE\/DSP property owners to provide them with the opportunity to correct the record and to advise them that the charge will be subject to the debt collection and enforcement measures as outlined in the Deputy's question.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, Revenue has assured me that any liable person in respect of HHC who left contact details with the LPT Helpline, or who wrote or emailed and has yet to receive a reply will be considered compliant and will not be subject to either debt collection\/enforcement activity or interest charges, providing they meet their obligations immediately after their queries are resolved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800057#WRF00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":332,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800057#WRF00350"},{"type":"question","counter":333,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[16416\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800057#WRF00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the yield from stamp duty on credit and debit cards and yield from stamp duty on cheques in each year from 2008 to 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":334,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the net receipt from Stamp Duty on financial cards and cheques, including credit and debit cards, broken down by specified years, is as set out in the following table.  \u00a0<table><tr><th>Card Type<\/th><th>2008<br \/><br \/>&euro;m<\/th><th>2009<br \/><br \/>&euro;m<\/th><th>2010<br \/><br \/>&euro;m<\/th><th>2011<br \/><br \/>&euro;m<\/th><th>2012<br \/><br \/>&euro;m<\/th><th>2013<br \/><br \/>&euro;m<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Credit &amp;amp;<br \/><br \/>Debit<\/td><td>107.3<\/td><td>61.6<\/td><td>57.2<\/td><td>51.8<\/td><td>51.6<\/td><td>49.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Debit<\/td><td>0.00<\/td><td>1.00<\/td><td>0.37<\/td><td>0.03<\/td><td>0.03<\/td><td>0.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Combined<br \/><br \/>(ATM\/Debit)<\/td><td>27.4<\/td><td>12.9<\/td><td>12.6<\/td><td>15.7<\/td><td>15.5<\/td><td>17.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ATM<\/td><td>10.6<\/td><td>2.7<\/td><td>1.7<\/td><td>1.5<\/td><td>1.0<\/td><td>1.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cheque<\/td><td>30.5<\/td><td>37.4<\/td><td>34.4<\/td><td>33.2<\/td><td>31.0<\/td><td>25.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>175.8<\/td><td>115.6<\/td><td>106.3<\/td><td>102.3<\/td><td>99.2<\/td><td>93.3<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>In Budget 2008, the Stamp Duty on credit cards, debit cards, combined cards and ATM cards was reduced, while the Stamp Duty on cheques was increased.

The Central Bank is responsible for prudential supervision and financial regulation including consumer protection.

Implementation of the redress plan was actively monitored by the Central Bank via submission of weekly reports from Ulster Bank checking the level and type of complaints. Two on-site visits were carried out in September and November 2012 to ensure that the redress plan was being followed and that customers  interests were being protected. These concluded that Ulster Bank was dealing with claims in accordance with the redress plan.

In this regard, the Central Bank expects firms to communicate clearly and promptly with affected customers when a technical incident occurs, including details of the impacted service, details of alternative access to services and an undertaking that identifiable loss will be remediated.\u00a0 The Central Bank's expectations have been communicated to banks.<\/p><p>  The payments system is monitored by the\u00a0Irish Payments Services Organisation (IPSO).

Its purpose is to ensure that resolution can take place at the same level as supervision, rather than being conducted at national level.\u00a0 \u00a0It is considered an important contributing factor to breaking the link between the sovereign and the banking sector.\u00a0<\/p><p>  The SRM will allow decisions to be made in a more objective and independent fashion than if they were been made by national supervisors. The proposal which has been agreed sees the SRM taking its decisions in line with the principles of resolution set out in the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD)\u00a0in particular that shareholders and creditors should bear the costs of resolution before any external funding is granted, and private sector solutions should be found instead of using taxpayers' money.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  In relation to the Deputy's question regarding the size of the fund, the expectation is\u00a0that in most scenarios, contributions by shareholders and creditors should be sufficient to finance resolution. If exceptionally, additional resources were needed,\u00a0the Single Resolution Fund with a target level of 1% of covered deposits within the Banking Union (approx. &euro;55bn) will come into place as a last resort to finance the bank resolution process. This target level was calibrated by the European Commission when the proposal was first published and it\u00a0takes account of the fact that losses will firstly be applied to the institutions' shareholders and creditors. The SRM regulation also requires the Board of the SRM to contract financial\u00a0 arrangements for the Single Resolution Fund \u00a0where the amounts raised through contributions from institutions' are not sufficient to meet the Fund's obligations. <\/p><p>  It is important to keep in mind that resolution is just one aspect of the package of financial reforms being introduced to restore confidence in the banking system and to make it more resilient to future financial crisis. There are also a number of measures within the\u00a0resolution proposals\u00a0and within other legislative reforms that require banks to organise themselves in such a way that greatly reduces the risk of their failure but also ensures they have appropriate mechanisms in place to withstand future crises should they arise. The powers of supervisors will also be significantly enhanced to ensure that they are in a position to impose requirements on banks that are commensurate with the level of risk on their books. <\/p><p>  Better regulated and supervised banks will be stronger, more resilient, and operate to benefit the real economy at large, as well as ensuring that taxpayers don't have to foot the bill for banks' mistakes. The resolution framework will be there to ensure that there is a mechanism in place at EU level to deal with future bank failures should they arise, but reinforced supervision and robust preventative measures are\u00a0key in\u00a0minimising the risk of this\u00a0happening and reducing any costs\u00a0likely to arise. <\/p><p>  On the issue of the timetable, it should be noted that the final agreement on the SRM reduces the transition period to a fully mutualised Single Resolution Fund from ten years down to eight years and I am supportive of this change. It also provides for accelerated mutualisation in the early years - 60% by the end of year 2. This is a very important feature and demonstrates the seriousness of Member States to break the link between the sovereign and the banking sector as quickly as possible.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800058#WRG01600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Availability","counter":408,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800058#WRG01650"},{"type":"question","counter":409,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[16634\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800058#WRG01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the steps he will take to ensure that businesses in County Meath can access credit from banks and other lending institutions; if he will provide figures on the amount of lending that has been given to small and medium enterprises in County Meath in each of the years 2011, 2012 and 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1076","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":410,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[16802\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800058#WRG01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which small and medium-sized enterprises seeking credit from their respective lending institutions have been accommodated by their banks in each of the past three years to date; the extent to which unsuccessful applications have succeeded on appeal; if in the case of refusal any assessment has been undertaken of the main reasons for refusal such as poor credit rating which can be attributed to other factors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":411,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 155 and 168 together.<\/p><p>As part of the 2011 recapitalisation exercise, the Government imposed SME lending targets on AIB and Bank of Ireland for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013.

This programme involves inter alia\u00a0a sector-by-sector approach, where the Government looked to build on\u00a0areas of strength\u00a0of the economy and repair those sectors which were damaged. I am pleased to report that this approach has proven successful, with some noticeable gains recorded in some of the economy s key sectors over the last year.<\/p><p>Looking first at the agri-food and fisheries sector, which is Ireland s largest indigenous industry and a significant contributor to employment, 2013 proved a very successful year for the sector with strong employment growth\u00a0over the year. Exports (in value terms) related to the agricultural sector increased by 7 per cent in 2013 and year-to-date outturn figures combined with the continued signs of recovery in key trading partners such as the UK augur well for further growth in 2014.<\/p><p>Another jobs-rich sector, which suffered greatly due to the global economic downturn, and one to which the Government has introduced a series of targeted policy initiatives, has been\u00a0tourism. Last year was particularly strong for the tourism\u00a0sector, with overseas trips to Ireland increasing by 7 per cent in annual terms. This was aided by the reduced VAT rate for products and services in place since July 2011, as well as by The Gathering, which contributed to a 14 per cent increase in tourism from North America in 2013. Encouragingly, the growth we have seen in the number of visitors to Ireland has also been reflected in the employment gains in the sector, with employment in accommodation and food services up by 13 per cent in the final quarter of 2013 when compared with the same period in 2011   after the VAT reduction was introduced. Another positive point is that the strong momentum gained in 2013 looks to have carried over into this year, with trips to Ireland up 11.3 per cent for the period December 2013 to February 2014 in year-on-year terms.<\/p><p>\u00a0Of course, no sector was hit harder in the recession than the construction sector and while nobody wishes to see a return to the construction-reliant economy that preceded the downturn, some recovery in the sector is vital to support wider economic growth. On this front recent developments have been positive, with signs of a recovery in the sector following nearly six years of continuous decline. Employment in the sector has now stabilised while national accounts data show building and construction investment increasing by 12 per cent in 2013. <\/p><p>National residential property prices have begun to recover, having fallen 51 per cent from peak to trough. While this has largely been driven by a recovery in\u00a0property\u00a0prices in Dublin,\u00a0prices outside of the capital now appear to have bottomed out and were up by 4.2 per cent over the year to February. As part of Budget 2014 I introduced measures to address the limitations of supply of suitable housing stock that seem to be impacting the Dublin market, including the extension of the Living City Initiative and the Home Renovation Initiative.\u00a0 The Government s Medium-Term Economic Strategy for the period 2014-2020 set out the intention to address remaining challenges in the construction sector. As part of this the Government will be publishing a strategy for a renewed construction sector in the near future.<\/p><p>In terms of overall price developments, the\u00a0Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP)   the comparative measurement of inflation across Europe  \u00a0increased by\u00a00.5 per cent in Ireland\u00a0for\u00a02013 as a\u00a0whole. The energy effect that was so pronounced in 2012 was not present in 2013, which was the predominant driver of the lower headline HICP over the year.<\/p><p>In February, annual HICP inflation was 0.1 per cent as energy and unprocessed food continued to act as a drag on inflation. Stripping out these two elements, core inflation measured 0.7 per cent\u00a0which compares\u00a0with a figure of 1.1 per cent for the euro area as a whole. <\/p><p>Irish core inflation has now been below, or on par with, euro area inflation for every month since February 2009. This has led to significant cost competitiveness gains over this period, while also serving to protect real incomes. Inflationary pressures are expected to remain relatively muted once again this year. Revised forecasts will be published in the Stability Programme Update to be published later this month.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800058#WRG03500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Charges","counter":436,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800058#WRG03550"},{"type":"question","counter":437,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[16800\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800058#WRG03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he and his Department continue to monitor the levels of bank charges being imposed by various banks; the basis for such charges, nationally and internationally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":438,"content":"<p>I, as Minister for Finance have no role in the regulation of bank charges in Ireland.

Employment levels have now returned to those last seen in Q4 2010.  \u00a0<\/p><p>These positive trends demonstrate the effectiveness of recent labour market initiatives taken by the Government.  The 2012 Action Plan for Jobs initiated over 270 measures to promote job creation across all sectors of the Irish economy.  Initiatives included launching a new development capital scheme aimed at addressing a funding gap for mid-sized, high-growth indigenous companies; extending the corporation tax exemption for start-up companies; and the creation of a micro finance fund and a targeted temporary partial credit guarantee for SMEs.  \u00a0<\/p><p>The 2013 Action Plan for Jobs built on the success of these measures by initiating a range of new reforms such as the creation of a single licensing application for the retail sector in order to reduce the compliance burden of the industry; increasing computing programme places, reskilling workshops and conversion courses; investing heavily in new research facilities for big data; introducing an online trading voucher to the value of &euro;2,500 to help get more SMEs trading online; and the introduction of the JobsPlus incentive scheme to encourage businesses to recruit the long-term unemployed.  \u00a0<\/p><p>Budget 2013 introduced the Ten-Point Tax Reform Plan to support SMEs to improve cash flow, access to funding and to lower costs and administrative burdens facing SMEs.  Provision of NPRF-backed equity investment, credit provision and restructuring\/recovery investment funds for SMEs also contributed to boosting employment in the sector.  Most recently, in Budget 2014, a &euro;500 million pro-jobs package was introduced, with targeted measures for the different sectors of the economy<b>. <\/b>Under the 2011 Jobs initiative the VAT rate was reduced for the hospitality sector, and the Government continued this measure in Budget 2014.  The Home Renovation Incentive was introduced providing homeowners with tax relief on repair, renovation or improvement work.  To support entrepreneurs the Start Your Own Business initiative was introduced which provides an income tax exemption of &euro;40,000 on the profits of a new business started by an unemployed individual.  To support the labour-intensive tourism industry, the air travel tax was removed.  \u00a0<\/p><p>Building on the measures introduced in previous Budgets and action plans, the Government's recent Action Plan for Jobs 2014 sets out sectoral priorities and quantifiable actions to support sectors with employment growth potential (Agri-Food, ICT, international financial services), sectors of emerging opportunity (Green economy, creative industries, aviation and health care services) and mature sectors (tourism, retail, construction).<\/p><p>The job creation measures initiated by this Government over the last three years have helped promote the recent employment recovery and -\u00a0along with new reform initiatives - will help ensure the Government's medium-term goal of ensuring a return to full employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800059#WRH00200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":449,"content":"<p>Question No. 171 answered with Question No. 169.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Costs","counter":450,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800059#WRH00350"},{"type":"question","counter":451,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[16822\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800059#WRH00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which insurance costs here are comparable with those in other European and adjoining jurisdictions, with particular reference to the need to competitiveness; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In this regard, it should be noted that the new prudential regime for insurers across the EU known as Solvency II, which will come into force from the start of 2016, will place a greater emphasis on the need to price risk appropriately than the existing regime, and will in turn require insurance companies to be more conscious of their pricing policy.

Where a school chooses not to extend their services for July, eligible children in the school will be granted home based July Provision, on application.

It is appropriate therefore that the qualification standard in the Home Based July Provision generally reflects that required in a school environment.<\/p><p>  Home tutors should be fully qualified teachers who are registered with the Teaching Council of Ireland.  When it is not possible to recruit a fully qualified teacher then consideration will be given to the engagement of a tutor who is registered with the Teaching Council and has a primary degree (minimum level 7 FETAC) in a relevant area including e.g. psychology.  If an SNA meets these standards they can also be considered in this context. <\/p><p>  Under the terms of the home based scheme, allocations to siblings are reflective of the school grouping principle.  The pupil teacher ratio in school settings can result in one teacher being allocated to a class of six pupils with children of mixed age and ability at the appropriate educational level, primary or post primary.  Accordingly, it is considered appropriate, as in a school situation, that a tutor can provide tuition at the appropriate educational level to more than one sibling at that level simultaneously in the home.  However, in recognition of the differing needs of some siblings, separate allocations can be considered on a case by case basis.  Applications in this regard will require supporting documentation including professional reports from a psychologist or a letter from the principal of the school detailing the existing arrangements currently in place for the respective children and providing sound reasons why they cannot be tutored together in the home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800059#WRH03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Applications","counter":501,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800059#WRH03850"},{"type":"question","counter":502,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[16197\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800059#WRH03900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his Department has received an application from a school (details supplied) in County Kildare for a devolved building project; if he will expedite its approval in view of the urgency of the application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The strands have been designed to ensure that children experience a broadly balanced history programme.  They reflect major historical periods, important genres of historical enquiry and particular methodological approaches.  The arrangement of material within the strands respects the professional autonomy of teachers and school principals, and has been designed to provide maximum flexibility to them in the planning of the history curriculum that they offer to children.  The number of strands, and hence the scope of historical enquiry, increases as the child gets older.  However, it is an important principle of the curriculum that at each level children should experience material from a range of historical periods and from local, national and international contexts.  It is to be expected, therefore, that many common elements of national and international history will be taught in schools, but that schools will also respond in various ways to meet the diverse needs of pupils and to ensure that the history curriculum reflects the local environment and experiences of the local community in the past. <\/p><p>The Teacher Guidelines that accompany the Primary History curriculum (pages 33-39) outline a broad range of sources and materials that may be used to support the teaching of history.  These guidelines make clear that &quot;carefully chosen, well-produced textbooks may be an important source for the teaching of history&quot; but also advise that &quot;textbooks, of their very nature, cannot adequately cover local history studies and should therefore be regarded as only one source among many for the teaching of history&quot; and that &quot;the exclusive use of one textbook per class could have a constricting influence on the selection of strand units&quot; by the teacher.  This guidance is in line with best international practice in the teaching of history.  The deputy should note that primary school pupils are not required to take any examinations in history.

The\u00a0State Pension\u00a0changes have no impact on\u00a0such persons where they are in the\u00a0modified social insurance category.\u00a0 Where alternatively they are in the\u00a0full social insurance category their\u00a0public service\u00a0pensions (and contributions) are, as with\u00a0many occupational\u00a0schemes, integrated (or co-ordinated) with social welfare benefits. This means the occupational pension paid is based on the assumption that the pensioner also receives the State Pension.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  However the State Pension is, since 1 Janaury 2014, only payable from age 66 years.\u00a0 In the case of retirements of fully insured public servants at age 65, a discretionary supplementary pension may be payable under the rules of the public service scheme\u00a0to bridge the gap until State Pension commencement at age 66 years.\u00a0This supplementary pension is only payable where the individual, through no fault of his own or her own, does not qualify for social welfare benefit or qualifies at less than the maximum personal rate. It is therefore necessary to claim any available social welfare benefits in order to receive a supplementary pension.

Significant protections for highly sensitive and secret information will be maintained.<\/p><p>  - Where a commercial state body provides a service under a contract to a public body subject to FOI, the records relating to that service will now be subject to FOI.<\/p><p>  - The Bill extends FOI to all public bodies as a default   a reversal of the current position that a public body is included only if it is explicitly scheduled under the Bill.\u00a0 This will result in a number of long-established high profile exclusions from FOI being brought under the scope of the legislation.<\/p><p>  - A key new initiative included in the Bill requires public bodies to prepare and furnish publication schemes consistent with international best practice\u00a0in this area to promote the proactive publication of information outside of FOI.<\/p><p>  - These publication schemes will set out the nature of the information an organisation publishes on its website, which will include extensive information on its nature, role, responsibilities and activities.<\/p><p>  - Publication schemes are intended to lead to a proactive disclosure of significantly more information and in a more accessible form than was previously provided under the so-called section 15 and section 16 manuals.<\/p><p>  - The publication schemes will also provide for publication of FOI Disclosure logs which will provide information in relation to non-personal FOI requests received by the body. The idea is that as much information as possible will be made available outside of FOI.<\/p><p>  - The Bill also allows FOI to apply to non-public bodies that are in receipt of significant funding by the Exchequer by way of Ministerial Order.\u00a0 This is expected to result in a sea-change in the potential enhanced accountability of such bodies.<\/p><p>  - The Bill includes\u00a0a number of key principles to guide public bodies in the performance of their functions under the Act\u00a0including the need to achieve greater openness, strengthen accountability and decision making and facilitate more effective participation by the public in consultations relating to the role, responsibilities and performance of FOI bodies.<\/p><p>  - It contains important extensions of the functions\/powers of the Information Commissioner.<\/p><p>  - It also\u00a0introduces a new penalty for a person convicted of the deliberate altering or destruction of records which are the subject of an FOI request.<\/p><p>  - There are new provisions to ensure that FOI requests relating to information held electronically are dealt with effectively.<\/p><p>  - A very significant measure included in the Bill confirms that there is a general right of access to records held by public bodies and in applying exemptions, the right of access should only be set aside where the exemptions very clearly support a refusal of access.<\/p><p>  The FOI Bill will, therefore, once it is enacted by the Oireachtas very significantly strengthen the legal framework for FOI in Ireland.\u00a0<\/p><p>  In tandem with the development of the FOI Bill, a review of the implementation of the FOI Acts was assisted and informed by the assessment of two expert groups; one of which comprised FOI users, academics and transparency advocates and the other comprising representatives of public bodies.\u00a0 The purpose of the review was to consider the current implementation of the Act with a view to developing a Code of Practice to address existing challenges in implementing FOI; to strengthen the framework and organisational arrangements for FOI in public bodies;\u00a0 to better support the implementation of FOI; to achieve greater consistency and uniformity of approach by public bodies in their processing FOI requests than is currently evidenced; to minimise the administrative burden as well as to better co-ordinate, deepen and widen the expertise and capacity of public bodies in FOI. <\/p><p>  The deliberations of the review groups have been completed and a draft Code has been prepared.\u00a0 It is my intention to bring the draft Code to Government for approval shortly following which the draft Code will be published for consultation prior to finalisation on enactment of the FOI Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800062#WRL02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pensions","counter":676,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800062#WRL02650"},{"type":"question","counter":677,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[16547\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800062#WRL02700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if public sector workers will be permitted to opt out of pension contributions to pursue their own pension plans; the reason such workers are compelled to make pension contributions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In this context, the major elements of the Government&rsquo;s response are set out in the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s strategy, <i>&ldquo;Pathways to Work&rdquo;<\/i>, which is aimed at ensuring that as many as possible of the job vacancies that are created as the economy recovers, are filled by people from the Live Register - with a particular focus on those who are long-term unemployed or at risk of long-term unemployment. <\/p><p>The 2014 Action Plan for Jobs builds on the 2012 and 2013 Action Plans. This year&rsquo;s Plan includes targets for Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and the new Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) to support a total of 30,500 direct new jobs during 2014. <\/p><p>In this context, South Dublin County Enterprise Board (CEB) offers a suite of supports, comprising business information and advice, financial supports, networking, mentoring and training to start-up and existing micro-enterprises in the County.  In addition, South Dublin CEB works to promote an enterprise culture through one of the largest schools enterprise programmes in the country, covering Primary, Second Level and Third Level education.  These supports are aimed at facilitating job creation at the micro-enterprise level throughout the South Dublin County area.  Since its inception in 1993, South Dublin CEB has paid out over &euro;10m in financial support to its clients, helping to create a total of 2,830 net additional full time equivalent jobs.  In 2012 alone, 2,091 jobs were created in companies supported by the four CEBs operating in Dublin.  168 of these were created in companies based in South Dublin &ndash; including Tallaght &ndash; and supported by South Dublin CEB.  South Dublin CEB operates a number of regional enterprise support programmes in partnership with the other three CEBs in the Dublin region, details of which are available on the CEBs&rsquo; website .<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the system for delivery of State supports to micro and small enterprises is being reformed and that the 35 existing County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) will be dissolved and new Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) will be created. This reform will bring about a new level of engagement and interaction at both national and local level in relation to enterprise support and economic recovery and growth.  The CEBs will be legally dissolved and the LEOs will come into being from 15 April 2014.  When established, the LEOs will become the first-stop-shop through which information on national and local supports for business can be accessed, where new start-up and micro-enterprises can be grant-aided, where small businesses can receive training and mentoring, and where businesses with clear high growth potential can be fast-tracked to the next level of support from Enterprise Ireland.<\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland activity in Tallaght and South Dublin is focussed on job creation and export growth and offers a broad range of supports to industry to support growth in jobs and exports including funding for Business Development Managers for Bolbrook, Killinarden and Bawnogue Enterprise Centres, under the CEC Funding Scheme.  In 2012, 4,097 jobs were created in Enterprise Ireland client companies based in Dublin.

In 2012, 6,389 jobs were created in IDA-supported companies in Dublin.  In 2013, of the total number of announcements of investments made by the Agency, approximately 50% of them were for Dublin.  In 2014 to date, there have already been six company announcements for Dublin.  Typical examples of these include the announcement in January 2014 by Aspen, a global pharmaceutical company, in City West expanding its Irish operation by adding 42 new high quality jobs.<\/p><p>In addition, on 3 April 2014, Alexion announced plans to expand its operations in Ireland following the acquisition of a new site in West Dublin.  The company expects that this expansion will create approximately 200 new jobs as part of an investment of approximately &euro;75m over the next number of years.  There have also been announcements by four high growth start-ups for Dublin with a combined total of 102 jobs requiring a variety of skillsets. <\/p><p>I am confident that these announcements, together with the delivery of the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 and the other initiatives outlined will have a positive impact on job creation in Tallaght and the greater Dublin area. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800063#WRM01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Parliamentary Questions Costs","counter":716,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800063#WRM01100"},{"type":"question","counter":717,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[16594\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800063#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the costs to his Department to process and respond to a priority, an oral and a written parliamentary question.

R,D&amp;amp;I remains significantly important to Ireland&rsquo;s FDI landscape embedding existing employment and putting in place the framework for future employment creation.  There are now over 166,000 people directly employed in IDA Ireland client companies nationwide, the highest number in the history of the agency.<\/p><p>  There are 13 IDA Ireland-supported companies in Donegal employing 2,381 people in full and part time employment in Software Development, Systems Development and the Medical Technology industry.  In 2013, 177 new jobs were created in Donegal. Companies such as Pramerica and United Health (PacifiCare) which have located in County Donegal are continuously growing and recruiting.  IDA Ireland actively engages with its existing base of companies in Donegal, highlighting the ongoing importance of upskilling\/reskilling and the need to add high value activities in order to ensure sustainability and ongoing development. <\/p><p>  I am informed by IDA Ireland that in the first three months of 2014 there were 2 IDA Ireland sponsored site visits by potential investors to Co. Donegal.  Donegal&rsquo;s industry base is transforming from the clothing and textile industry into high tech, high skill activity and IDA Ireland actively promotes Donegal as a successful location for high-end manufacturing mainly to companies in the medical technologies sector.  In addition to boost regional development in the area and win new business IDA Ireland has announced its intention to erect a new office facility in  Letterkenny.<\/p><p>  Another focus for IDA Ireland in Donegal is the designated linked Gateway of Letterkenny\/Derry.  This focus involves developing stronger economic links with Invest Northern Ireland, which includes initiatives like the North West Business &amp;amp; Technology Zone (NWBTZ).  The NWBTZ is aimed at promoting the linked Gateway of Letterkenny\/Derry in line with the NI Regional Development Strategy 2025.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800063#WRM02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Action Plan for Jobs","counter":734,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800063#WRM02900"},{"type":"question","counter":735,"qnumday":273,"qnumall":"[16819\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800063#WRM03000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the specific measures included in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 to target unemployment in County Donegal in view of the fact that 2014 is designated the year for jobs and in view of the fact that County Donegal has one of the highest rates of unemployment in the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":736,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity through the Action Plan for Jobs 2014, which recognises the need for measures to support the unemployed and keep jobseekers close to the labour market. In this context, the major elements of the Government&rsquo;s response are set out in the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s strategy <i>&ldquo;Pathways to Work&rdquo;<\/i>, which is aimed at ensuring that as many as possible of the job vacancies that are created as the economy recovers, are filled by people from the Live Register - with a particular focus on those who are long-term unemployed or at risk of long-term unemployment. <\/p><p>The 2014 Action Plan for Jobs builds on the 2012 and 2013 Action Plans.

In 2013, the Board approved grant aid for 29 projects, with a value of &euro;577,000 and an associated potential of 126 jobs.  The CEB also ran a range of training and management development programmes with over 870 participants, and approved access to mentoring services for over 90 businesses.  The latest figures available indicate that there are 2,434 people employed on a full-time and part-time basis in companies supported by the CEB in Co. Donegal.  Already in 2014, the Board has run the Annual Donegal Business Week with over 780 participants attending the 19 events held during the week.  The week was organised by the CEB in conjunction with Udar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Donegal Local Development Company, WestBic, Letterkenny IT\/CoLab and Enterprise Ireland.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the CEB will shortly be dissolved and established as a Local Enterprise Office (LEO) within Donegal County Council, as part of the reform of the model of supports for the micro-enterprise sector.  The LEO will integrate the business support and enterprise development functions of the Council with an enhanced range of existing CEB functions, such as making it easier to obtain the full support of agencies including Revenue, Social Protection, Microfinance Ireland, the Credit Review Office, Skillnets and the Education and Training Boards.  This reform will result in the provision of the best possible service to people who have a business idea. <\/p><p>There are 165 Enterprise Ireland client companies in Donegal employing 3,342 people on a full-time and part-time basis. Enterprise Ireland runs many initiatives to help sustain existing jobs and to create new jobs in the region and provides funding to the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny to build the research capabilities in the region. In addition, the Community Enterprise Centres, funded through Enterprise Ireland, are providing enterprise space to cater for micro and small enterprises throughout Donegal. Enterprise Ireland approved over &euro;3.2m in 2013 for companies, entrepreneurs and Third Level institutes in Donegal and to date in 2014, the Agency has made payments of over &euro;281,000 to companies in Donegal.  <\/p><p>  There are 13 IDA Ireland-supported companies in Donegal employing 2,381 people in full and part time employment in Software Development, Systems Development and the Medical Technology industry.

There are currently approximately 78,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. <\/p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant. Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs. The tenant&rsquo;s engagement with the Department usually takes place after the tenant has reached an agreement with the landlord. There is no contractual relationship established between the landlord and the Department. The fact that approximately 78,000 people are currently in receipt of rent supplement proves that a significant number of landlords are accommodating applicants of the scheme and that rent supplement recipients are able to access accommodation.<\/p><p>  Discrimination on the basis of an individual&rsquo;s personal characteristics is prohibited in respect of nine specified grounds in the access to and supply of goods and services, including housing, by the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2012.  These grounds are gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Travelling community. The prohibition applies to direct discrimination, whereby a person is treated less favourably than another is, has been or would be treated in a comparable situation on any of the grounds specified. <\/p><p>  However, also prohibited is indirect discrimination, where an apparently neutral provision puts a person of a specified gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Travelling community at a particular disadvantage compared with other persons, unless the provision is objectively justified by a legitimate aim and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary. <\/p><p>  It is therefore open to a person, including a person in receipt of rent supplement, who has been refused a private tenancy and who feels that this refusal is directly linked to his or her gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Travelling community to refer a discrimination complaint to the Equality Tribunal under the Equal Status Acts. Information and advice in this regard is available from the Equality Authority. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800063#WRM03800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":744,"content":"<p>Question No. 276 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":745,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800063#WRM04000"},{"type":"question","counter":746,"qnumday":277,"qnumall":"[15959\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800063#WRM04100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a carer's allowance appeal will be finalised in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Tipperary; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1087","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":747,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that an Appeals Officer, having fully considered all of the available evidence, decided to disallow the appeal of the person concerned by way of a summary decision on 23<sup>rd<\/sup>January 2014.

","asker":"1032","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":768,"content":"<p>The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  It does this by disregarding years spent outside the workforce on such duties when calculating the average contributions per year on the pensioner&rsquo;s record.<\/p><p>  To be eligible for the homemakers scheme, a person must:<\/p><p>  - Permanently live in the State (exception may be made where EU regulations apply),<\/p><p>  - Be aged under 66,<\/p><p>  - Have started insurable employment or self-employment before the age of 56,<\/p><p>  - Not work full-time, although for the purposes of this scheme, a person can work and earn less than &euro;38 gross per week,<\/p><p>  - Care for a child (under 12) or an incapacitated person on a full-time basis.<\/p><p>  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, and\/or an incapacitated person, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  <\/p><p>  However, it is important to note that the scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.  For those who do not satisfy these conditions, and have an income need, a means-tested State pension may be available. <\/p><p>  The introduction of homemaker credits would be an alternative approach.  Instead of disregarding years outside the labour market, reducing the duration of the insurance record, and thereby increasing the average number of contributions paid per year, a homemakers credits scheme would involve the award of credits for the period(s) spent outside the labour market in a caring capacity.  A homemaker credit would improve the likelihood of qualifying and of receiving a higher rate of pension for those affected. <\/p><p>  However, the introduction of homemaker credits raises a number of issues, most notably cost.      If they were awarded from a current date, the cost initially would likely be low, at less than &euro;100,000 per annum, based on 2010 estimates.  Costs in relation to current homemaker&rsquo;s disregard scheme are expected to increase in the coming years due to the 20% increase in female employment rates between 1994 and 2008.  <\/p><p>  A further factor impacting on possible costs would be the date from when such credits were effective.  The 2007 Green Paper on Pensions indicated that to back-date the current homemaker&rsquo;s disregard scheme to 1953, the year when the unified system of social insurance was introduced, would cost the Exchequer some &euro;160 million per annum.  <\/p><p>  Another factor is the number of possible eligible people previously employed in Ireland, who are now resident in other countries such as the UK and for which no estimates are available but which could add significantly to costs, given the general increase in female employment.   <\/p><p>  It is planned that a total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory).  The proposed date for the introduction of this change is 2020, but this may be subject to change. <\/p><p>  The total contributions approach (whereby the pension payment will be based on the number of contributions paid and credited) will remove the current anomaly whereby people can achieve a higher average contribution rate, and thus a higher level of pension, even where they have a lower total number of contributions paid.   This move will bring transparency and fairness to the eligibility for pension.  Issues such as the introduction of homemaker&rsquo;s credits will be considered in the context of this reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800063#WRM06300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Applications","counter":770,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800064#WRN00150"},{"type":"question","counter":771,"qnumday":285,"qnumall":"[16114\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800064#WRN00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when an application for domiciliary care allowance will be finalised in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Tipperary; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1087","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":772,"content":"<p>An application for domiciliary care allowance (DCA) was received from the person concerned on the 19th March 2014.

In this regard the Department has set up dedicated enquiry telephone lines and specific email addresses for each section in the Department specifically for the purpose of dealing with queries from members of the Oireachtas in relation to individual social welfare cases\/claims. This also helps reduce the costs of answering pqs.  <\/p><p>DSP receives the highest number of Parliamentary Questions (PQs) of all Government departments.  In 2013, approximately 10,500<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>PQs were tabled to the department.  Over 1900 pqs were transferred to other Government Departments leaving approximately 8,550<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>actually finally tabled to DSP.  Of these approximately 4,460<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>were withdrawn and 4,089 were answered.  Of the pqs answered, approximately 3,700 were written and 350 were Priority\/Oral PQs.<\/p><p>The vast majority of PQs, some 70% of those tabled to the Department refer to the status of claims by individuals in relation to the variety of schemes administered by the Department.<\/p><p>A practice of withdrawing PQs has been in place for over 20 years and has assisted the Department to cope with the large volume of PQs it receives annually.  This practice is in place, generally, in relation to PQs on individual social welfare claims and not policy matters.  The Department provides the Deputy with the relevant information in relation to the individual query and in a majority of cases subsequently confirms this information in writing.  In general, Deputies find this service helpful as they are still receiving a written response to the query.<\/p><p>There are approximately 600 staff members of varying grades involved at some level in distributing, answering and submitting PQs for approval across the Department.  The length of time spent on dealing with PQs can vary from a few minutes to a number of hours per week. As the processing of answering PQs is undertaken as part of the normal day to day work of the individual sections within the Department it is not possible to readily isolate the costs of processing PQs from the overall administrative costs of the Department.<\/p><p>In 2008, a Government Department estimated that the cost of answering a PQ was approximately &euro;200 per PQ. However, there is still an amount of work involved in withdrawing a PQ i.e. contact with the Deputy and Oireachtas Questions&rsquo; Office, provision of a written response etc.  This can be quite time-consuming on both the part of the DSP staff member and the TD&rsquo;s office if telephone contact cannot be made easily either with the TD or the Oireachtas Questions Office.  Thus it is assumed that the cost of answering a written PQ is marginally more expensive than the cost of withdrawing a written PQ.  Based on the &euro;200 estimate the cost to DSP of handling the approximate 3,700 written<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>PQs tabled in 2013 would be approximately &euro;740,000.  The cost of priority\/oral PQs would exceed the cost of written PQs as the level of information required for the response far exceeds the information required for a written PQ but even at a cost of &euro;200 per PQ this would equate to some &euro;70,000 for 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800065#WRO00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Appeals","counter":833,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800065#WRO00550"},{"type":"question","counter":834,"qnumday":310,"qnumall":"[16626\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800065#WRO00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an invalidity pension appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork.","asker":"993","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":835,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 28 February 2014, who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.  <\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800065#WRO00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":836,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 311 and 312 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Correspondence","counter":837,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800065#WRO00850"},{"type":"question","counter":838,"qnumday":313,"qnumall":"[16643\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800065#WRO00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a reply will issue to a representation (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":839,"content":"<p><b><\/b>The representation made by the Deputy was received in the  Department on 6 February, 2014 and acknowledged.

As part of this process and to support the Department&rsquo;s activation commitments under the Pathways to Work Programme and the development of Intreo services nationally, it has been necessary to review the administration of all its services across its remit including the CWS. <\/p><p>  The Pathways to Work Programme represents a significant reform in the social welfare system and highlighted the need for the Department to focus its resources on the provision of opportunities, supports and assistance to people on the live register by intensifying the Department&rsquo;s level of engagement with people who are unemployed and in particular those who are, or become, long term unemployed. The new Intreo service offers practical, tailored employment services and supports for jobseekers, a model which is currently being rolled out across the country. <\/p><p>  Overall, this is resulting in a rebalancing of resources across the Department&rsquo;s range of activities including the relocation of some staff to main centres, primarily Intreo offices, which will provide a full range of services, including the CWS and these will, in general, be available in one location. Where the community welfare service has been re-structured, I am satisfied that alternative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that customers are provided with on-going access to the supports provided by the service.

The market has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County including County Meath can be found on a number of websites, including the websites of individual commercial operators.  The State can only become involved in the provision of services in instances of clear market failure, such as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).  5 Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) are providing services to licenced telecommunications operators in the towns of Dunboyne, Clonee, Dunshauglin, Kells, Trim and Navan on an open-access basis.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses.  This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and <\/p><p>- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  In the fixed line segment of the market, eircom has announced plans to pass 1.4m addresses with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100Mbps, while UPC has increased its entry level and maximum speeds to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively.  Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings.  In addition, the recent enactment of legislation to facilitate the ESB's entry into the telecommunications market, either alone or in partnership with another operator, will also help the roll-out of high speed broadband as well as facilitating greater competition in the Irish market.  I am aware of at least one service provider announcing that it will be providing advanced broadband services in a total of 36 locations in County Meath before July 2016 and my Department will be happy to discuss these further with the Deputy.<\/p><p>  Many of these developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators.  In tandem with these developments, intensive work, including a comprehensive mapping exercise, continues in my Department in relation to the State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.<\/p><p>  Under the national mapping exercise, information has been sought from all undertakings authorised by ComReg in relation to current and planned broadband services, both basic and next generation access (NGA).  Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing.  The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines.  When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country.  I expect that this process will be completed later this year, after which it is my intention to publish a map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage, along with the Government&rsquo;s proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country.  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched later in 2014.<\/p><p>  Implementation of the National Broadband Plan will be complemented by measures in the National Digital Strategy which I launched in July last.  The first phase of the National Digital Strategy targets specific segments of society, aiming to improve digital engagement of citizens and businesses to realise the economic and social benefits that digital technologies can bring.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800066#WRP01700","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Tax Exemptions","counter":906,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800066#WRP01750"},{"type":"question","counter":907,"qnumday":339,"qnumall":"[16024\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800066#WRP01800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the number of motor vehicles in the possession of his Department or agencies of his Department that are not required to hold motor tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":908,"qnumday":340,"qnumall":"[16040\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800066#WRP01900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the number of motor vehicles in the possession of his Department or agencies of his Department that do not hold an insurance policy; the manner in which insurance claims arising in respect of vehicles in the possession of his Department or its agencies are handled; the amount of insurance claims paid on behalf of his Department in each of the past five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":909,"content":"<p>I propose to take Question Nos. 339 and 340 together.<\/p><p>  The Geological Survey of Ireland (GSI) is the only part of my Department which has a pool of motor vehicles.

The market has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County including County Kerry can be found on a number of websites, including the websites of individual commercial operators.I am aware of at least one service provider announcing that it will be providing advanced broadband services in 33 locations in County Kerry, including Beaufort before July 2016 and my Department will be happy to discuss this further with the Deputy.  I would point out that the Local Authority has a strong role to play in facilitating the roll-out of the necessary infrastructure to help enable service availability throughout the Country. In the case of County Kerry, I note that the County Development Plan recommends against siting a mast within 1km of dwellings. I understand that this is contributing to difficulties in providing good quality broadband and telecommunications services generally in the county.<\/p><p>During the preparation of the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce report, which concluded its deliberations in 2012, service providers noted the importance of planning and consent processes in facilitating the rollout of infrastructure to support the provision of telecommunications services.  The Government's National Broadband Plan which I subsequently published, commits to addressing barriers to deployment in order to maximise investment by the commercial sector and assist in enhancing the quality of services. Local Authorities have an important role to play in this regard, particularly in facilitating the provision of infrastructure that supports wireless and fixed line services.<\/p><p>The National Broadband Plan aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses.  This will be achieved by providing:<blockquote>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and<br \/><br \/>- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/blockquote>In tandem with these developments, intensive work, including a comprehensive mapping exercise, continues in my Department in relation to the State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.  In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.<\/p><p>Under the national mapping exercise, information has been sought from all undertakings authorised by ComReg in relation to current and planned broadband services, both basic and next generation access (NGA).  Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing.  The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines.  When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country.  I expect that this process will be completed later this year, after which it is my intention to publish a map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage, along with the Government&rsquo;s proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country, this map will outline exactly the type of broadband is available in County Kerry.<\/p><p>The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched later in 2014.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800066#WRP02600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":919,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800066#WRP02650"},{"type":"question","counter":920,"qnumday":344,"qnumall":"[16332\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800066#WRP02700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the position regarding funding (details supplied) that has been allocated; if some of this allocation could be spent on developing a tourist walkway at the mines; the contract details for the project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1184","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":921,"content":"<p>I am aware of and appreciate the tourism and amenity potential of the former Avoca mine site.

This year t he estab lishment of Irish Water presents local government with significant organisa tional and financial challenges.  Service provision responsibilities are moving from the local authorities to Irish Water, infrastructure is being transferred, financing arrangements have altered and local authorities are operating on behalf of Irish Water under Service Level Agreements.  These changes must be managed.  In this context, it was necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the Local Property Tax to be retained in each local authority for 2014.  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and, therefore, a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates.  A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.<\/p><p>Under section 20 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, a local authority may, as a reserved function, and subject to any Regulations made under the section, resolve to vary the rate of the Local Property Tax (LPT) within its functional area by a maximum of +\/- 15%.  This power will be available to local authorities effective from 2015, as the relevant sections of the Act will come into operation on 1 July 2014 .

To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.  The financial parameters within which we continue to operate will not facilitate a return to large-scale capital funded construction programmes.  Earlier this year, I signalled a return to modest levels of new social housing construction with an announcement of 1,000 new housing starts over the 2014-2015 period.  Notwithstanding this, the Government acknowledges the need to respond more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms.  To maximise the social gain from constrained resources, the social housing leasing initiative and the Rental Accommodation Scheme each play their part and I am fully committed to capturing social gain from private developments.  Alongside expanding the role of the Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) in terms of acquisition and construction, other mechanisms will include options to purchase within the leasing model and build to lease.  In 2014, funding for housing, at over &euro;587 million, is effectively maintained at 2013 levels.  This includes a &euro;50 million capital stimulus to support construction and related programmes, primarily in the housing area, including &euro;30 million to recommence a State house building programme; &euro;10 million for an unfinished housing estate resolution project; and &euro;10 million for housing adaptation grants. I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2014 to be in the region of 5,000 new housing units.<\/p><p>  Last month I announced the approval of some 56 social housing construction projects with an overall value of some &euro;68 million under the Local Authority housing construction programme for 2014-2015.  This new construction programme will deliver 449 new units of accommodation for people on the housing waiting list.  Projects were selected for approval on the basis of the proposals submitted to my Department by the local authorities, the relative priority afforded to each of these projects and the overall level of housing need locally.  On Budget Day 2014, I announced details of a new measure with funding of &euro;15 million which will be invested in bringing some 400 vacant and boarded-up local authority houses back into productive use.  My Department is currently assessing the proposals recently received from local authorities under this programme and I will announce details of the funding allocations as soon as possible.  I also intend to announce details shortly of the allocations to local authorities under my Department's Capital Assistance Scheme for the construction and acquisition of housing for persons with specific categories of need over the 2014-2015 period.  Some &euro;35 million is being set aside for this programme which is intended to deliver in the region of 230 new homes.<\/p><p>  My Department, the Housing Agency and NAMA continue to work together with housing authorities and AHBs towards bringing suitable NAMA units into social use and to ensure continued delivery of housing units for social purposes.  AHBs will also play a key role in the delivery of social housing, particularly having regard to their capacity to attract external financial investment.  It continues to be my objective to maximise the delivery of social housing using all of the resources available, including potentially social housing bonds and social impact bonds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800067#WRQ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Quality Issues","counter":961,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800067#WRQ01250"},{"type":"question","counter":962,"qnumday":360,"qnumall":"[16873\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800067#WRQ01300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his position regarding the ongoing difficulties caused by the presence of hard-water that are being experienced by residents of Clonmel North County Tipperary; if he will provide assurances that such residents who are affected will have necessary exemptions from any water tax costs which they would ordinarily incur; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

These regulations come into force on 1 September 2014.   <\/p><p>Under the new regulations, provision is made for the installation of carbon monoxide detectors in - <\/p><p>-  new dwellings where open flue or flueless combustion appliances are being installed, <\/p><p>-  existing dwellings where replacement open flue or flueless combustion appliances are being installed, <\/p><p>-  habitable rooms where a system chimney attached to a heat producing appliance passes within or over such rooms.   <\/p><p>While the new regulations will give added protection to new dwelling owners, and to the owners of existing dwellings when heat producing appliances are being replaced, it is important to note that the key actions required to prevent carbon monoxide incidences are and continue to be: -<\/p><p>(1) the proper installation and commissioning of heat producing appliances and flues\/chimneys, <\/p><p>(2) ensuring proper air supply is maintained to combustion devices, and <\/p><p>(3) the proper maintenance and inspection of combustion appliances on a regular basis.   <\/p><p>Notwithstanding the new regulations, the regular and continued provision of information to raise awareness of the potential dangers of carbon monoxide in homes will need to be maintained by the relevant authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800068#WRR00700","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreshore Licence Applications","counter":1020,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800068#WRR00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1021,"qnumday":380,"qnumall":"[16363\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800068#WRR00800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide an update on granting an offshore licence for refurbishment works on Dun Laoghaire baths; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1022,"content":"<p>An application from D&uacute;n Laoghaire - Rathdown County Council for a consent under the Foreshore Act 1933 to undertake refurbishment works to D&uacute;n Laoghaire Baths is currently being assessed by my Department.

The CER has already undertaken public consultations on the development of the economic regulatory framework for water services and will be undertaking further consultations during 2014.

Housing authorities provide additional funding from their own resources. <\/p><p>The total Section 10 funding provided by my Department to housing authorities on a regional basis for the years 2009 to 2013 , the component of that funding which was for domestic violence refuges, are set out in the tables below. The regional approach is considered more appropriate as it helps to bring a more strategic perspective to bear on action to address homelessness, including avoidance of over-concentration of homelessness services in certain centres and promoting appropriate regional availability of services, consistent with need.<\/p><p>Under the funding arrangements, responsibility for rigorous assessment, appraisal and decision making in relation to proposals for funding of particular services within the current budgetary allocation rests with the homelessness statutory Management Group of the respective region. My Department has no function in regard to decisions on operational matters which, in the case of the Dundalk women&rsquo;s Refuge, are a matter for the North East Homelessness Management Group, with Louth County Council as the lead authority.<\/p><p>I recently notified housing authorities of provisional regional homelessness allocations for 2014 and these will be formalised when the protocol for the delegation of Section 10 homeless funding has been agreed between my Department and the lead housing authority in each of the 9 regions. In notifying housing authorities, I sought to encourage them to target their homelessness spending on certain categories of expenditure and indicative national targets were identified to guide authorities in framing their homeless budgets. A national expenditure target of 4.4% (or &euro;2.2 million) was identified for domestic violence refuges in 2014.<\/p><p>The Homelessness Oversight Group, which I established in 2013 for the purposes of reviewing the progress of the approach being advocated in the <i>Homelessness Policy Statement<\/i>, identifying obstacles and proposing solutions has submitted its first report to me. The report, a copy of which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <font color=\"#1F497D\">, <\/font>recommended that existing funding arrangements for the provision of domestic violence refuge accommodation and services should be transferred to the new Child and Family Agency; this will be considered in the context of my Departments wider engagement with the Agency in relation to the report&rsquo;s recommendations. A Homelessness Policy Implementation Team is tasked with implementing the Homelessness Oversight Group's First Report and it will report on this plan to the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy later this month and quarterly thereafter.   <\/p><p><b>Funding p<\/b><b>rovided under Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988<\/b><table><tr><th>Region <\/th><th><div>2009 <\/div><\/th><th><div>2010 <\/div><\/th><th><div>2011 <\/div><\/th><th><div>2012 <\/div><\/th><th><div>2013 <\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin <\/td><td><div>&euro;38,967,542 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;40,521,375 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;35,732,525 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;32,398,290 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;31,322,223 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South East <\/td><td><div>&euro;1,945,792 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,742,886 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;2,110,476 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,848,877 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,787,469 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>North East <\/td><td><div>&euro;1,197,451 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,037,617 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;912,250 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;910,194 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;879,963 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Midlands <\/td><td><div>&euro;872,375 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;666,344 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;624,897 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;672,027 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;649,707 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South West <\/td><td><div>&euro;5,458,211 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;4,270,143 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;3,505,749 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;4,418,967 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;4,272,197 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mid-West <\/td><td><div>&euro;4,110,166 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;3,435,607 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;2,905,457 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;3,516,119 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;3,399,336 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>West <\/td><td><div>&euro;2,175,312 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,699,288 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,227,696 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,581,478 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,528,951 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mid East <\/td><td><div>&euro;885,801 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;906,842 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;697,665 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;839,146 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;811,275 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>North West <\/td><td><div>&euro;444,206 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;423,355 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;406,335 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;360,865 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;348,879 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total <\/td><td><div>&euro;56,056,856 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;54,703,457 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;48,123,050 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;46,545,963 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;45,000,000 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><br \/><b>Funding provided under Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 in respect of domestic violence refuges<\/b><table><tr><th><div>Region <\/div><\/th><th><div>2009 <br \/><br \/>&euro;

If the person was under 18 at that time, then in accordance with the provisions of section 258 of the Children Act 2001, such offences would not be disclosed once a period of three years has elapsed since the date of the offence, provided that the person has complied with any order of the Court.<\/p><p>  Separately, elements of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 relating to the disclosure of convictions of persons over 18 are under review at present having regard to a recent judgment of the UK Court of Appeal in (On the Application of) T and others v Chief Constable of Greater Manchester [2013]. The UK Court considered the circumstances in which it is appropriate to disclose convictions for old, minor offences with particular regard to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Having considered the judgement in that case, I intend bringing proposals before the Oireachtas to provide that certain old minor convictions will not be disclosed under the provisions of the 2012 Act. Given the close relationship between this Act and the Spent Convictions Bill, which is before the Oireachtas at the moment, any changes to the Vetting Act will have to be reflected in the Spent Convictions Bill. The amendment of the Vetting Act will also be done via the Spent Convictions Bill.  I expect to be in a position to commence the provisions of the 2012 Act in the autumn of 2014.<\/p><p>  The National Vetting Bureau (Children &amp;amp; Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 sets out procedures to allow the disclosure of criminal records and specified information for vetting purposes. &ldquo;Specified information&rdquo; is information other than a court determined criminal record. For example, &ldquo;specified information&rdquo; would include cases where, in accordance with the provisions of the Probation Act 1907 the Courts find that a case against an adult person has been proved, but the person is given probation instead of a criminal conviction.  The procedures set out in the Act are designed to ensure that the human rights of the person being vetted are adequately protected. It is important to note that before specified information can be disclosed, the person who is the subject of the information must be given a copy of that information and must be given the opportunity to challenge the proposed disclosure. The Act also provides that a disclosure of such information will only occur where there is a bona fide concern that the person poses a threat to children or vulnerable persons, and the information has been assessed for its reliability and relevance, and the disclosure is in accordance with principles of natural justice.   In the meantime, the vetting of persons working with children and vulnerable persons continues to be done on a non-statutory basis. <\/p><p>  Pending commencement of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 the revisions in approach outlined above will, in the interim be applied on an administrative basis by the Garda Central Vetting Unit.   Until now all records of all criminal convictions have been disclosed by the Garda&iacute; when vetting people for various employments. However, in future certain minor offences that are more than seven years old, where the person has not subsequently reoffended, will not be disclosed. In addition, cases of minor offences where charges are struck out will not be disclosed. Minor motoring or public order offences which are more than seven years old will not be disclosed in any case. Instances where the District Court has applied the Probation Act will not be disclosed unless the offence in question is a sexual offence or an offence against the person. <\/p><p>  More serious offences, such as all sexual offences, offences against the person, serious motoring offences, firearms offences, robbery, or any offence for which the person is convicted on indictment will continue to be disclosed in all cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800070#WRT02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Peace Commissioners Appointments","counter":1155,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800070#WRT02450"},{"type":"question","counter":1156,"qnumday":433,"qnumall":"[16320\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800070#WRT02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will support the concept of automatically appointing Commissioners for Oaths as Peace Commissioners; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1067","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1157,"content":"<p>Peace Commissioners are appointed by me under Section 88 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.

One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel. The EAG&rsquo;s report was accepted by Government in 1995. In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA). In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces. This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct. Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers. <\/p><p>In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January, 1994. A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.  The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.<\/p><p>The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:- - Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service. - Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years.-   Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.<\/p><p>With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks. A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter. In accordance with normal procedures the Association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. As discussions under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matter at this time, including the specifics of cost benefit analysis, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration.<\/p><p>It is intended to finalise negotiations with the Representative Association within the next few weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800072#WRV01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Costais Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in","counter":1265,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800072#WRV01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1266,"qnumday":475,"qnumall":"[16133\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800072#WRV01200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"c&eacute;n m&eacute;id airgid a caitheadh in 2013 ar aistri&uacute; doicim&eacute;ad &oacute; Bh&eacute;arla go Gaeilge n&oacute; &oacute; Ghaeilge go B&eacute;arla, agus &oacute; theangacha eile go B&eacute;arla agus &oacute; Bh&eacute;arla go teangacha eile, faoi seach; cad ba chaiteachas ioml&aacute;n riarach&aacute;in na Roinne sa bhliain 2013; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1044","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1267,"content":"<p>Chaith mo Roinn &euro;8,873 i 2013 ar ch&aacute;ip&eacute;is&iacute; a aistri&uacute; &oacute; Bh&eacute;arla go Gaeilge agus &oacute; Ghaeilge go B&eacute;arla.

When the parade was ready for the March Past and the families and VIPs had been ushered to their viewing position, I was invited to take my position on the reviewing stand where I remained until all personnel of the 43rd Infantry Group had marched past and the parade was dismissed.

The licensing process must take full account of the outcome of that assessment in reaching a determination on any particular licence application.  It is anticipated that the Appropriate Assessment for Kenmare Bay will be completed this year.  The completion of the Appropriate Assessment will enable my Department to move immediately on the licensing aspects.The Seafood Development Programme 2007-2013 is the framework programme for EU co-funded aid to the seafood sector in Ireland and covers aid up to 2015.  The Programme is based on Council Regulation 1198\/2006 concerning the European Fisheries Fund (EFF).  That Regulation specifies the measures that may attract EFF co-funding and provides the state aid basis for those measures.  Member States select certain of the measures included in the Regulation for inclusion in their National Operational Programmes based on national priorities.  This means that not all measures potentially eligible under the Regulation can be funded.  Ireland&rsquo;s Programme does not include measures for compensating aquaculture operators for any additional costs relating to operations in Natura 2000 areas.  However, licensed sites in Kenmare Bay are not subject to any particular additional costs at this time, as they are operating in line with their existing licences pending any renewal of their licence.   Ireland&rsquo;s Programme does include measures to support the development and growth of aquaculture sites and grant aid of up to 40% of eligible costs is available to eligible sites.  The EFF Regulation requires that the Commission and Member States ensure that assistance from the EFF is consistent with the policies, priorities and activities of the Union and that operations financed by the EFF comply with the provisions of the Treaties and the Acts adopted under the Treaties.  This includes the Habitats and Birds Directives.  To give practical effect to this legal obligation, the stakeholder Monitoring Committee approved selection criteria for the Commercial Aquaculture Development Scheme excluding sites located in Natura 2000 areas from aid under the Scheme until such time as an appropriate assessment has been completed and the site concerned has been licensed taking full account of the conclusions of the appropriate assessment.   Once aquaculture operations in Kenmare Bay have been subject to appropriate assessment, sites licensed within the Bay may become eligible for grant aid under the Scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800072#WRV02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Tax Exemptions","counter":1283,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800072#WRV02350"},{"type":"question","counter":1284,"qnumday":481,"qnumall":"[16021\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800072#WRV02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of motor vehicles in the possession of his Department or agencies of his Department that are not required to hold motor tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":1285,"qnumday":482,"qnumall":"[16037\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800072#WRV02500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of motor vehicles in the possession of his Department or agencies of his Department that do not hold an insurance policy; the manner in which insurance claims arising in respect of vehicles in the possession of his Department or its agencies are handled; the amount of insurance claims paid on behalf of his Department in each of the past five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1286,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 481 and 482 together.<\/p><p>There is no requirement to pay for motor tax or insurance for Department vehicles, but all vehicles should display a tax disc and hold a letter on Department headed paper stating exemption from displaying an insurance disc under section 4.2 (a) of the Road Traffic Act 1961.<\/p><p>All vehicle Insurance claims made for or against this Department are handled by the State Claims Agency.

In general sheep farmers hold low value entitlements under the current Single Payment Scheme and will benefit significantly from the model of convergence that is to be applied in Ireland where those with a low Initial Unit Value will see the value of their entitlements increase over the period of the scheme. <\/p><p>  The Grassland Sheep Scheme is based on Article 68 of the current EU Regulation 73\/2009 which governs direct payments in the form of the Single Payment Scheme. As of the 1 January 2015 that Regulation is superseded by EU Regulation 1307\/2013 and consequently there is no longer any legal basis for the continuation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme in its present form. <\/p><p>  When determining the Initial Unit Value of a farmer&rsquo;s entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015, Regulation 1307\/2009 gives Member States the option to take into account any payment the farmer received in 2014 under Article 68 schemes such as the Grassland Sheep Scheme. This option is only available where the Member State is not applying voluntary coupled support to the sector concerned under the new CAP.  <\/p><p>  I have decided to apply this provision in Ireland as a means of safeguarding the value of the payments received under the Grassland Sheep Scheme for those farmers concerned. The Grassland Sheep Scheme is the only Article 68 scheme that is being incorporated into the calculation of entitlements under the new Basic Payment Scheme. If such incorporation does not take place the value of such payments would simply remain in the national fund and would be redistributed generally among all farmers who establish entitlements. <\/p><p>  The incorporation of the Grassland Sheep Scheme payment into the calculation of a farmer&rsquo;s Initial Unit Value in 2015 will obviously result in a higher entitlement value for the farmers concerned from the start of the Scheme rather than relying solely on the gradual process of convergence to increase the unit value over the five year period up to 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800072#WRV03000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Milk Quota Applications","counter":1293,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800072#WRV03050"},{"type":"question","counter":1294,"qnumday":485,"qnumall":"[16105\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800072#WRV03100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if his Department is in receipt of an application for milk quota reserve in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Wexford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1295,"content":"<p>Allocations of milk quota from the National Reserve are granted on the basis of recommendations made by an independent Milk Quota Appeals Tribunal.

It is opportune, however, to take the opportunity to outline the position regarding the ongoing review of the data contained on my Department&rsquo;s Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) database.  Under the Terms &amp;amp; Conditions of the Direct Aid Schemes, which includes the Single Payment scheme, farmers are obliged to declare only eligible land when making their applications and  are to exclude ineligible features such as roads, buildings, farmyards, dense scrub, etc. These claims are then recorded on the Department&rsquo;s Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS). Given the importance of the LPIS database in underpinning direct aid payments worth in excess of &euro;1.5 billion annually, my Department is obliged under EU Regulations to ensure its accuracy.<\/p><p>Following consultation with the EU Commission, as part of the normal Accounting process, my Department was requested to undertake a complete review of the LPIS database. This has resulted in the necessity to adjust parcels of a significant number of applicants, where it was established that some ineligible features had been included. In certain circumstances these adjustments are giving rise to penalties.<\/p><p>The LPIS Review process initiated by my Department consisted on a review of all of the eligible land parcels in the LPIS database, which was declared by farmers under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and other Direct Payment Schemes. In total, the Review covered in excess of 132,000 applicants and the land parcels declared by them as eligible for payment under one of more of the above-mentioned Schemes<\/p><p>A comprehensive review and appeals process has been implemented to ensure that the cases of individual farmers are fully scrutinised. In the first instance, a farmer, who finds himself or herself in this position, can seek a review of the original decision by Department officials. If they are not happy with the outcome of the review, they can submit an appeal to the <i>Independent LPIS Appeals Committee<\/i>, chaired by Mr P&aacute;draig Gibbons. To date, 90 cases have been forwarded to the Agriculture Appeals Committee on receipt of appeals from the applicants concerned. The committee has not as yet adjudicated on these appeals.<\/p><p>It is important to note that there are some positive outcomes of the current Review from a farmer&rsquo;s point of view. In the first instance, I announced recently that the number of payment entitlements, which farmers will be granted under the Basic Payment Scheme in 2015 will be based on the 2013 eligible land or in 2015 if it is lower. This means that farmers, who have ineligible land deducted in 2013 as part of this Review, will be protected under the new Regime as their entitlements will be based on the actual eligible land in 2013. In addition, it also means that farmers, who are contributing to the convergence process by having reductions applied to their entitlements, will not see part of the funds used to make payments on ineligible lands.<\/p><p>A deliberate decision was taken late last year not to delay payments to those farmers whose payments were due to be subject to reduction following the outcome of the Review; rather, the payments issued with the sums in question deducted, the farmers concerned being then advised of the reductions and the appeals process. This course of action was specifically designed to ensure that there was no undue delay in issuing payments, while also ensuring that farmers were aware of the appeals process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800073#WRW00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Severe Weather Events","counter":1325,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800073#WRW00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1326,"qnumday":496,"qnumall":"[16359\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800073#WRW01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if financial support will be provided to a person (details supplied) in Country Kerry whose forestry was completely destroyed in the recent storms; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1327,"content":"<p>The storm earlier in the year has indeed been damaging to Irish forests particularly in the south of the country.

The United States which receives by far the largest number of adoptions has seen a reduction of almost 60 per cent over this period. <\/p><p>  These trends reflect the significant decline in recent years in the number of children, particularly infants, available for adoption, as child protection safeguards have improved in developing countries which previously placed large numbers of children for adoption.

The Convention requires members to strengthen protections for children, birth parents and prospective adoptive parents in the adoption process and to prioritise the improvement of systems for the care and adoption of children domestically.  This requirement is in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, in particular Article 21.

The review&rsquo;s recommendations will further inform the development of a new Youth Strategy which will aim to improve coordination between Government Departments and youth sector organisations with a view  to maximising the effectiveness of State funding in achieving youth policy objectives.

I acknowledge that the existing procedures in the area of information and tracing, both legislative and administrative, are not ideal and I have been anxious to see improvement in this regard.<\/p><p>  As I have stated on a number of occasions it is important to note that complex legal and constitutional issues have arisen in the drafting of the Bill. A particular challenge has arisen in the attempt to reconcile an adopted person&rsquo;s request for information about his or her identity with the right to privacy of his or her birth parent where consent has not been provided. The right to privacy has been firmly established as a constitutional right through a series of legal cases which began in 1974 with McGee v. Attorney General, which concerned marital privacy, and culminated in the Kennedy v. Ireland case in 1987 where a general Constitutional right to privacy was recognised. The right to privacy was also recognised in the IO'T v .B case, a supreme court case from 1998.  The case concerned two people who were the subject of so-called &quot; informal&quot; adoptions. The majority of the Court held that a natural child had an implied constitutional right to know the identity of his or her mother though this had to be balanced against the right of the natural mother to privacy.<\/p><p>  My Department is continuing to consult with the Office of the Attorney General on this and on a number of related issues. One reason for the discussions with the Attorney General is to continue to tease out precisely how this can be done in the context of what I must state is extremely strong legal advice about the constitutional protection of the rights of the natural mother to privacy. I continue to explore how far the Government can go in building into legislation that right of the adopted person to get access to information without breaching the Constitution. This is the reason it is taking this length of time to draft the Heads of Bill. <\/p><p>  I intend to submit the Heads of Bill for Government approval as soon as these issues have been addressed. Once approved by Government, the Heads of Bill will be sent to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for its detailed consideration. The process of sending the Heads of Bill to that Committee will ensure that the provisions of the proposed legislation will be subject to public scrutiny and it is of course open to that Committee to invite and encourage submissions from all interested  parties.<\/p><p>  I have been anxious to see improvements to existing procedures for the provision of adoption information and tracing services, which are provided nationally by the Child and Family Agency. A number of religious orders have transferred records from their Mother and Baby Homes and Adoption Societies to the Child and Family Agency.  Work by the Agency on the organising and storage of these records is underway and the advice of the National Archives has been sought in relation to the proper storage of these records that are of great significance. <\/p><p>  I have raised the importance of arrangements for the management of these records directly with the Child and Family Agency and I have also asked my officials to examine the work that could be undertaken with the Child and Family Agency, the Adoption Authority and other stakeholders to improve arrangements for managing and accessing the records that are available. <\/p><p>  I would urge birth mothers to enrol on the National Adoption Contact Preference Register which was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences.  Applicants decide, through a range of information and contact options, how they wish to proceed.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland has responsibility for the operation of the Contact Preference Register.  I believe there is an opportunity in the context of the considerable public attention this area is receiving to promote awareness amongst women whose children were adopted of the importance of registering their consent for contact to be re-established.<\/p><p>  I can assure you that I am anxious to provide access to as much adoption information as possible taking account of relevant legal and constitutional considerations.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800075#WRY02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":1482,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800075#WRY02600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":1481,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800075#WRY02550"},{"type":"question","counter":1482,"qnumday":553,"qnumall":"[16274\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800075#WRY02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding speech and language assistance in respect of a child (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1483,"content":"<p>As the particular issue raised by the Deputy relates to an individual case, this is a service matter for the Health Service Executive.

I received the interim report of the Group which dealt primarily with training issues in December. The Group is now focusing on career structures and pathways following training and is due to report very shortly on these issues. The final report of the Group is to be submitted to me by the end of June 2014. I am confident that the implementation of the findings of this strategic review will, in future years, support the retention of sufficient numbers of doctors trained in Ireland within the system. <\/p><p>  It should be noted that there are some specialties, at consultant and NCHD level in which there are international shortages and which have been traditionally difficult to fill. Filling these posts represents a significant challenge given that there is a competitive market for consultants and NCHDs with these specialties. There are also some hospitals to which it has historically been difficult to attract applicants, in particular smaller hospitals that have onerous rosters. The planned establishment of hospital groups should help to address this issue, as this will allow doctors to be appointed as group resources - instead of to just one hospital. Where posts are vacant and suitable candidates cannot be sourced, locums are retained or alternative arrangements are made to ensure the continued delivery of the service. <\/p><p>  In relation to the specific query regarding Letterkenny Hospital, I have forwarded the question to the Health Service Executive who will respond directly to the Deputy in this regard. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800077#WRAA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":1594,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800077#WRAA01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1595,"qnumday":593,"qnumall":"[16213\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800077#WRAA02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the services of chiropodists and podiatrists are covered under the medical card system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1596,"content":"<p>While there is no statutory obligation to provide a chiropody\/podiatry service, such services are provided by the HSE to medical card patients with the greatest needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800077#WRAA02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Appeals","counter":1597,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800077#WRAA02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1598,"qnumday":594,"qnumall":"[16232\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800077#WRAA02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a medical card renewal is refused, if a person may retain their medical card while the appeal is being processed (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1010","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1599,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

Both of these are record numbers.  <\/p><p>  The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2014 provides an additional &euro;2.92m for organ donation and transplantation services. The &euro;2.92m will facilitate the appointment of 19 wholetime equivalent staff dedicated to organ donation and transplantation - including consultants, network link nurses, organ procurement officers and quality officers.  These staff will comprise a key element of the organ donation effort in each of the hospital groups around the country. They will work to foster a strong culture of organ donation, optimise conversion rates and champion educational strategies and training programmes that promote organ donation to health care professionals across each hospital group.  <\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to increasing organ donation and transplantation rates is further underlined by the re-commissioning of a theatre in Beaumont Hospital for transplantation use at a cost of &euro;1.2m.  Beaumont Hospital has completed the recruitment of nurses for this facility and these nurses are now being trained to take on the specialised work involved.  The theatre will be in use for kidney transplants from May 2014 and I expect the rate of transplants will increase incrementally over subsequent months.<\/p><p>  The National Renal Transplant Programme at Beaumont progresses the &lsquo;work-up&rsquo; (clinical assessment and a range of diagnostic procedures) of donors and recipients on the live donor programme in an organised way to facilitate the smooth running of the overall service.  Preparing patients and their donors too far in advance would render some of the clinical assessments and diagnostics invalid, thus requiring some repeat procedures. The management of this process involves the holding back of some donors and recipients so that they will not be worked up too far in advance of their procedure.<\/p><p>  Already 10 living donor transplants have been completed in 2014 and I am confident, with the new theatre coming on stream in May, that the 2013 record will be exceeded this year.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800078#WRBB02400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electronic Cigarettes","counter":1669,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800078#WRBB02450"},{"type":"question","counter":1670,"qnumday":619,"qnumall":"[16362\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800078#WRBB02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if electronic cigarettes will be banned from all educational campuses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1671,"content":"<p>In order to harmonise regulation of e-cigarettes across EU Member States, the new Tobacco Products Directive, not as yet in force will, inter alia, provide for the regulation of e-cigarettes.

Under UHI, everyone will have a choice of health insurer and access to a standard package of health services.  In addition, a system of financial protection will ensure affordability by paying or subsidising UHI premiums for those who qualify.<\/p><p>The<i>White Paper on Universal Health Insurance<\/i>was published on 2nd April and is available on my Department's website at www.health.gov.ie.  It provides substantial detail on the UHI model for Ireland, the process for determining the future health basket, including the standard package of services covered under UHI, funding mechanisms and the key stages of the journey to UHI.  A wide-ranging public consultation on the overall policy set out in the White Paper also commenced on 2nd April.  The process remains open for submissions from the public and other stakeholders until 28th May.  A separate consultation on the contents of the future health basket will also be undertaken.<\/p><p>The White Paper makes reference to a number of background technical documents, notably the <i>Policy Paper on Raising Resources for Universal Health Insurance <\/i>and <i>The Policy Paper on Designing the Future Health Basket,<\/i>that were produced by my Department in order to inform the development of the policy set out in the White Paper.  These key documents will be published on the Department's website soon.  I would also like to draw attention to the preliminary paper on UHI, <i>The Path to Universal Health Insurance, <\/i>published in February, 2013 on my Department's website which outlines an update of work on UHI to Feb 2012 as well as providing further detail on the path ahead.<\/p><p>As noted in the White Paper, my Department reviewed multi-payer models across a number of countries, having regard to the policy set out in the Programme for Government, including the Netherlands and Germany. Part of this work included organising a seminar in Dublin in 2011 on universal health insurance which was attended by experts from the World Health Organisation, the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies and the Dutch Health Ministry.  My officials also undertook  study visits to the Netherlands in June 2011 to examine the Dutch health insurance model and to Germany in 2012 to advance our thinking on the introduction of a prospective case-based Money Follows the Patient system for funding hospitals, which is one of the key building blocks for the introduction of UHI.  In November 2013, my Department organised a one day policy dialogue with international experts in the field of national health basket design, facilitated by the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, in order to inform the development of <i>The Policy Paper on Designing the Future Health Basket<\/i>.<\/p><p>I should, however, make it clear that while important to learn from other countries' experiences of multi-payer health insurance systems, it was never our intention to merely adopt a system from another country.  In designing a UHI model for Ireland, our aim has been to ensure that it meets the needs of those living in Ireland and that it achieves the best outcomes for patients.  This requires that we carefully plan and sequence the reform programme and that we give detailed consideration to the most appropriate structures for delivery of different services.  Ultimately, this Government aim is to introduce an Irish model of universal health insurance that best fits the Irish system.  My intention is to have  all the necessary groundwork in place in early 2016 to enable us to phase in implementation of UHI between 2016 and 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800079#WRCC03800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":1752,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800079#WRCC03850"},{"type":"question","counter":1753,"qnumday":646,"qnumall":"[16530\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800079#WRCC03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is satisfied with the current level of podiatry services being offered at Grattan Street Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1754,"qnumday":647,"qnumall":"[16531\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800079#WRCC04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the ratio of podiatrists to patients at Grattan Street Cork; his views on whether this is an acceptable situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1755,"qnumday":648,"qnumall":"[16532\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040800079#WRCC04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of cancellations of appointments on a monthly basis for the past 18 months to attend the podiatrist at Grattan Street Cork; the reason for the cancellations; if he will ask the Health Service Executive to review the services at Grattan Street Cork to ensure that the necessary resources are available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1756,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 646 to 648, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>While there is no statutory obligation to provide a chiropody\/podiatry service, such services are provided by the HSE to medical card patients with the greatest needs.

It also reflects a very robust and detailed approach to the preparation of the design tender documents in order to ensure that they build in value engineering, look at ways of delivering the project as quickly as possible, provide for a more collaborative approach and contain the required flexibility.  Following appointment of the design team, design development will begin with the aim being to make a planning submission in February 2015.

However, I am determined to address these issues and to promote a sustainable private health insurance market as we move towards Universal Health Insurance.<\/p><p>  I have consistently emphasised the need for much greater cost control in the private health insurance industry so that premiums are affordable for as many people as possible.  I appointed an independent chair to work with health insurers, the HIA and my own Department to identify effective strategies for costs management.  Mr. Pat McLoughlin's first report, published at the end of December, made a number of important recommendations now being pursued by insurers, the HSE and my Department.  These recommendations include measures to control costs, greatly improve clinical audit, streamline claims processing and address fraud, waste and abuse in the industry.  Work on  Phase II of Mr. McLoughlin's report, which will deal further with the factors driving costs in health insurance,  is progressing well and will be completed as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  In addition, the Deputy may wish to note that many consumers can make large savings on their health insurance premiums by shopping around for the health insurance plan that best suits their needs.  For those who have been insured on the same plan for a number of years, it is important to review the level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured.  Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs.
