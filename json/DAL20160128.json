We have, however, achieved the following key actions in our response to dealing with child poverty.  There is an additional &euro;100 million in social protection measures for families with children, and we maintained the social security safety net by honouring an established commitment to maintain the value of child-related welfare payments at 33% to 35% of the minimum adult welfare rate.  Our Pathways to Work strategy is helping to ensure that a high proportion of jobs are being taken up by people who were unemployed, including young people.  As the Deputy knows, Ireland&rsquo;s unemployment rate has fallen from 15.1% to 8.8%.  In recognition of the higher risks and lifelong consequences of child poverty, the Government set a child-specific poverty target in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures<i><\/i>to reduce consistent child poverty by at least two thirds on the 2011 level.  This figure currently represents 100,000 children.<\/p><p>Having an ambitious target and actively monitoring this will provide a roadmap from which we can develop and implement a strong multidimensional policy response.  The Department of Social Protection has the lead role in co-ordinating Government strategies on child poverty and is the sponsor of outcome four of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, which is economic security and opportunity.  It also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion and has identified child poverty as a key cross-sectoral priority to be addressed in 2015 and 2016.  There are also a number of areas of focus that support our response to child poverty within my Department.  These include &euro;345 million invested annually on early childhood care and education and after-school support programmes that provide care to 100,000 children; the area-based childhood programme of 2013 to 2017, which is co-funded by my Department and Atlantic Philanthropies, amounting to &euro;29.7 million; and &euro;51 million allocated to support the provision of youth services by the voluntary youth sector for 2016.  In addition, Tusla delivers a range of services focusing on the welfare, protection and support for children, young people and their families that are key to supporting outcomes that will assist in reducing the impact of child poverty.<\/p><p>Finally, my Department, in collaboration with the Department of Social Protection, will also hold an EU peer review in the next month to explore innovative responses in prevention and early intervention policy and provision to improve outcomes for children, particularly those experiencing  child poverty and disadvantage.  This event will involve ten member states and the European Commission and a number of key Irish stakeholders.

There are 138,000 children living in poverty, and the rate of consistent poverty has increased from 6.8% to 11.7%.  Those are not my figures but those of the Ombudsman for Children.  Even if the outcomes of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures are realised, there will still be approximately 37,000 children living in poverty in 2020.  There are 1,054 children who are part of homeless families, which means they live in very bad conditions.  We have seen how they live with bed bugs, mice and cockroaches, which is unacceptable in Ireland in 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800005#C00300","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1453974600,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I will underscore the actions that have been taken.

The Pathways to Work strategy is working and helping to ensure that a high proportion of jobs are taken up - we can show this - by unemployed people, including young people.  Since the Government launched its plan in early 2012, we have added 135,000 jobs to the economy.  There was a 33% increase in the child care budget, enabling every child in Ireland to avail of free preschool, including children with disabilities.  Both I and the Deputies across the floor should be very pleased about that.  There is additional funding to extend free GP care to all children aged 11 years and under; those under six already have cover.  There is additional funding for speech and language therapy services for children with disabilities, and we have increased the number of resource teachers and special needs assistants in the Irish school system by 29% and 13%, respectively, since 2011, despite the terrible recession we had to endure.  There is also improved funding for mental health services for children and young people, as well as a range of additional capital and revenue funding in respect of housing and an effort to specifically address homelessness among families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800005#C00400","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1453974600,"counter":38,"content":"<p>The Minister is not listening.

The Deputy mentioned the link between jobs and poverty, and I reiterate my previous comments.  A household is seven times more likely to experience poverty if the householders are jobless.  The Deputy has rightly pointed out that there are additional supports for people on low pay.

Homelessness can have such a negative impact on children's education and welfare as they move from one accommodation to another while still trying to attend the same school and maintain relationships with their friends.  It impacts not just on their welfare and education, but also on their sense of security.  For the children and their families who find themselves in emergency accommodation, the primary need is for a family home, and responsibility for this lies with local authorities and my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly.<\/p>  <p>  Children in emergency homeless accommodation are in the care of their parent or parents, and a key role of the primary carer is that of protection.  If there is a specific child protection concern, it should be reported immediately to Tusla for appropriate response.  Tusla provides family support and works with relevant services to maximise the supports available to children and families who are homeless.  Where underlying problems are identified, for example mental health issues, it can refer the family to the appropriate services.<\/p>  <p>  Homelessness as part of a family group is not of itself a basis for seeking to receive a child into care.  However, where there is a specific child protection concern, Tusla can investigate and take the child into care if necessary and only if it is in the best interests of the child.  The primary purpose of the Child and Family Agency is to support families, and the best place for a child is in a home with a family.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla is very much aware of general welfare issues for families and has engaged in multi-agency working on this issue.  A homelessness liaison officer has recently been appointed to lead Tusla's engagement with the homeless services, particularly regarding the overall welfare and protection of children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800006#D00500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1453975200,"counter":44,"content":"<p>The Minister is right in one thing: the best place for a child is in his or her home, but it is a damning indictment on his Government that 1,600 children are not residing in their homes; they are residing in emergency accommodation, and that is because of policies that this Government has pursued.  I was truly shocked by the Minister's reply to a parliamentary question I submitted where he clearly abdicated his responsibility for what his Department was doing to support people and children who are living in emergency accommodation.  It is not right to say that Tusla is just about taking children into care.  Tusla is a new agency that was set up to support families, and we need to support these families who are living in emergency accommodation.  I am not the only one to say this: we know that the Government's response to the homelessness crisis has been questioned by two international UN committees, most recently the one on the rights of the child, which the Minister himself attended.  We talked about the rights of the child and on voting to enshrine the rights of our children in our Constitution three years ago.

Tusla intends to recruit 201 staff in 2016 in this regard, 168 of whom relate to social work staffing.

The majority of these children are in stable placements, with over 92% of children in care in a foster family setting.  Residential settings represent most of the remaining placements, usually between 5% and 8% of all children in care.  At the end of October 2015, there were 343 children in a general residential care placement.<\/p>  <p>  As the majority of children in care are in foster care family settings in the community, indicators of stability of the placement and participation in education are useful in monitoring the performance of Tusla in overall welfare.  I am happy to say that Tusla has reported that the results for these indicators are positive and show that placement stability is very high and participation in education is on a par with the national participation rates.

It is a reflection on the quality of that care that many of the children leave school and go to third level, and that many stay on with their foster parents after their commitment at reaching age 18 has finished.

We all are aware of the terrible tragedies that occurred in more recent years where children, having left care, seemed to fall off a cliff with no supports and with tragic consequences for some.

It is now a statutory right that any child who has been in care for longer than a year, from the age of 13 upwards, including if he or she has been in a section 5 accommodation, will be entitled to an after-care plan.  Indeed, even if they had left care and did not want one, and changed their mind at age 18 or 19, we will accede to that.  One should bear in mind that while the statutory obligation and the qualifications for that are clearly set out, Tusla will always be open to putting in place an after-care plan for a child, who may not meet that criteria but about whom the agency is concerned.

This funding represents an increase of 33% in the annual investment in child care supports and provides for the significant enhancement of a number of programmes implemented by my Department.  The funding is in addition to the &euro;260 million annual funding already committed to the sector.<\/p>  <p>  The &euro;85 million package of additional investment for child care includes funding for an extension to the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme from September 2016 so children can enrol in the programme at age three and continue in it until they make the transition to primary school.  This will reduce child care costs by an additional &euro;1,500 per child and will increase the current 38 weeks of free preschool provision by an average of 23 weeks, and up to 61 weeks depending on the child's date of birth and the age at which he or she subsequently starts primary school.<\/p>  <p>  The investment will fund a suite of supports to help children with a disability to participate fully in the ECCE programme.

The amendments to Standing Orders for which we are seeking D&aacute;il approval today will have a major impact on the future operation of the D&aacute;il and of Oireachtas committees.  The new Standing Orders provide for the election of the Ceann Comhairle by secret ballot, the selection of Oireachtas committee Chairs using the d'Hondt system and the requirement for the Taoiseach to appear before the Working Group of Committee Chairmen twice a year to discuss matters of public policy.  These reforms complement the D&aacute;il and Oireachtas reform packages that were introduced by this Government in July 2011 and September 2013.  I believe their combined impact will strengthen the Oireachtas in holding the Government to account and in its role as a Legislature.<\/p><p>The office of the Ceann Comhairle is vitally important to the effective working of the D&aacute;il.  Over the years, a number of exceptional Deputies have taken on this thankless task.  While being a good and fair Ceann Comhairle is of immense benefit to the D&aacute;il, it can be a lonely post.  It is not easy to be the speaker of any parliament.  Our Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett, has many thanks and much respect for the work he has done over the last five years.  Under the new Standing Orders, for the first time Deputies will elect one of their colleagues to the Office of Ceann Comhairle - the Chairperson of the D&aacute;il - by secret ballot.  The office will be more independent than ever.  The holder of the office will be directly linked to his or her fellow Members of the D&aacute;il like never before.  The authority of the Ceann Comhairle will come directly from Government and Opposition Deputies, who will have an opportunity to elect someone to that office by secret ballot.<\/p><p>When the D&aacute;il returns after the forthcoming general election, one of the first items of business will be the election of a Ceann Comhairle.  The House must have a Speaker before it can proceed to nominate a Taoiseach.  Under the new system, anyone wishing to be a candidate will have to be nominated by seven other Deputies by 6 p.m. the day before the D&aacute;il meets.  The Clerk will publish a list of candidates as soon as possible following the close of nominations.  If no candidate is nominated, the current system for the election of the Ceann Comhairle will remain in place.  If more than one candidate is nominated then, after the Clerk has presented the election report to the Members, the names of the candidates will be announced and each candidate will be given five minutes to address his or her fellow Deputies.  The election will then proceed by secret ballot in the division lobbies.  Each Deputy will be given a ballot paper with the names of the validly nominated candidates for which he or she can vote in order of preference.  When the ballot has been closed, the D&aacute;il will be suspended and the ballots will be counted using the proportional representation, single transferable vote system.  When a candidate is deemed to be successful, the D&aacute;il sitting will resume.  The Clerk will announce to the D&aacute;il the name of the successful candidate and put the question to the House.<\/p><p>Provision will also be made in Standing Orders for the proportionate allocation of committee Chairs using the d&rsquo;Hondt system.  The Government of the day will no longer hold a monopoly of Oireachtas committee Chairs.  This Government has taken a number of steps to increase the power of Oireachtas committees over the lifetime of this D&aacute;il.  The selection of Oireachtas committee Chairs using the d&rsquo;Hondt system will enhance this.  This reform will distribute Chairs on the basis of D&aacute;il support.  Such a change will give Opposition Deputies more powerful roles in the next D&aacute;il.  Under the d&rsquo;Hondt system, each party or group will choose a Chair post from the available posts.  The only restriction is that no Government group may choose the Chair of the Committee of Public Accounts.<\/p><p>Standing Orders will also be amended to introduce a system whereby the Taoiseach will appear before the Working Group of Committee Chairmen twice a year, in the spring and autumn D&aacute;il sessions.  This will allow the members of the working group, which under the d&rsquo;Hondt system will be reflective of the D&aacute;il, to raise matters of public policy with the Taoiseach.  This will further enhance the accountability of the Taoiseach's office to the Oireachtas, thereby reinforcing this Parliament&rsquo;s power to hold the Government to account.<\/p><p>This is the third package of D&aacute;il reform to be introduced since 2011.  The Government can be proud of its record in this area.  For decades under previous Governments, the reform of the D&aacute;il and of Oireachtas committees was ignored.  Since taking office, this Government has supported D&aacute;il and committee reform by implementing a range of important measures.  It increased the number of D&aacute;il sitting days from 93 days a year under the previous Government to 123 days a year under this Government.  It introduced additional Leaders&rsquo; Questions on Thursdays.  It opened up the law-making process by introducing a pre-legislative stage for Bills, conducted by the relevant Oireachtas committee.  This provides for an unprecedented and extensive engagement by the public, experts and civil society groups in the law-making process.  Of key importance is the fact that this takes place before the Bill is published.<\/p><p>The Government reformed ministerial Question Time by extending each slot to 75 minutes, requiring the Member asking the question to be present in the Chamber and enabling a Member who is dissatisfied with an answer to a parliamentary question to submit an appeal to the Ceann Comhairle.  It replaced the outdated Adjournment debates with Topical Issue debates taken by a Minister from the relevant Department.  Deputies are allowed to postpone the debate if a Minister from that Department is not available.  Each year, the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste address the D&aacute;il setting out the Government&rsquo;s annual priorities.  The proposer of a Private Members' Bill now has five minutes on First Stage to outline the purpose of the Bill to the D&aacute;il.  He or she can then seek to have the Bill debated during a Friday sitting.  The number of Private Members' Bills introduced by Deputies increased from 14 in 2010 to 53 in 2014.<\/p><p>The process of parliamentary reform is and must always be an ongoing one.  The steps we are taking today, and have taken over the last five years, are positive but they are by no means the end of the process.  The next D&aacute;il and the next Government should follow the example we have set over the last five years by continuing to introduce reforms that improve the way our Parliament works.  I want to take this opportunity to highlight the positive engagement on the issue of D&aacute;il reform over the last five years on the part of the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett, and members of the D&aacute;il reform committee.  Genuine and workable reforms will be embraced by the Members of this House.  I ask them to support these proposals as genuine and workable reforms.  I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800011#J00400","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"speech","time":1453978200,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Troy, who has five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800011#J00500","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speech","time":1453978200,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I thought the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality was to be called next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800011#J00600","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1453978200,"counter":162,"content":"<p>He will reply at the end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800011#J00700","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speech","time":1453978200,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this motion.  It was funny to hear the Chief Whip finishing his contribution by encouraging \"the next D&aacute;il and the next Government [to] follow the example we have set over the last five years by continuing to introduce reforms that improve the way our Parliament works\".  I certainly hope the next Government, regardless of its composition, does not follow the example this Government has set.  When the Government parties took office, they said they had been the benefactors of a \"democratic revolution\".  Nothing could be further from the truth.  There has been no substantial political reform over the past five years.  We have seen a box-ticking exercise that has resulted in some cosmetic changes.  I have to say that from a political reform perspective, this Government has wasted the substantial goodwill and the trust placed by the electorate in Fine Gael and the Labour Party five years ago.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to remind the Government of some of the promises it made on political reform.  It has systematically broken the promise or pledge included in the programme for Government not to guillotine legislation.  Up to the end of 2014, it had guillotined 63% of legislation.  We know that the guillotining of key legislation, such as the Bills introducing water charges and cutting social welfare payments, deprived all Members of the House - Government backbenchers and Opposition Members - of the opportunity to tease out and debate critical legislative issues that would have a direct effect on the citizens of this country.  That is a clear broken promise of this Government.  The Minister of State mentioned the reform of Adjournment debates, which are now known as Topical Issue debates.  While I acknowledge the time difference, it is still the case that the relevant Minister turns up just 40% of the time.  The change from the Adjournment debates to the Topical Issue debates was made to allow the relevant Minister to come in.<\/p><p>Last week I took part in a Topical Issue debate on the extension of the compensation scheme for flood victims in Athlone and the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Joe McHugh, came in.  He is an honourable man but he did not have a clue what I was talking about.  I do not blame him because it was not his area of responsibility.  He came in with a pre-prepared script and he was not able to answer the questions I asked.<\/p> <p> The issue of Friday sittings is a farce.  The Minister of State indicated that the D&aacute;il was sitting more as a result of Friday sittings and there probably are more days when we are physically present but how much work is actually being done?  On a Friday sitting there are no Leaders' Questions, no Topical Issue debate and no Order of Business.  There is a requirement for a minimum number of Oireachtas Members to be present but they are not always present.  The legislation which is debated gets ventilation but ends up on a shelf gathering dust.  There is an opportunity for back bench and Opposition Deputies to put forward legislation, but the Government never adopts it.  Only one back bench Deputy had his legislation enacted in five years out of many hundreds that were submitted.  Where is the reform in that case?<\/p> <p> We have spoken about cronyism in appointments to State boards and we saw the true will of the Government on this issue most recently when the T&aacute;naiste appointed Mr. Begg without going through the process which Government established.  There was the debacle of the McNulty affair when someone was appointed to a State board just so that it could manipulate the Seanad election to get the right person in to a position the Government wanted to abolish a few months earlier.  On 31 May 2011, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, said the programme for Government contained the most ambitious and far-reaching agenda for political reform ever put before the House.  How inaccurate is that statement today?  It rings hollow.<\/p> <p> I welcome the amendments to Standing Orders being put before the House, albeit belatedly, and our party will support them.  I do not hope the next Government follows on the path of the current Government in the area of political reform, because if it does so, it will not do the citizens a service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800011#J00800","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453978800,"counter":165,"content":"<p>It is an awful pity the Deputy did not speak to the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800012#K00200","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"speech","time":1453978800,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I was speaking the truth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800012#K00300","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1453978800,"counter":167,"content":"<p>He was speaking rubbish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800012#K00400","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"speech","time":1453978800,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Facts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800012#K00500","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1453978800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>Can we have order, please?

It is utterly absurd, at the end of this Government's tenure, to introduce gestures towards reform of the D&aacute;il which it could have introduced at the beginning of its term.  They are obviously easy to introduce and they can be introduced and passed in a few minutes, but they were not done before now because the heart of the Government was never in D&aacute;il reform.  It never had any interest in D&aacute;il reform but it had an interest in gestures.<\/p>  <p>  I am certainly not convinced of the merits of the first amendment, which is to elect the Ceann Comhairle in secret.  Why do we need a secret ballot to elect the most important post in this House?  What will happen will be that another insider will be elected, secret deals will be done behind closed doors and no member of the public will know for whom their Deputy voted in this important vote.  They will be protected from that and the result will be that the post of Ceann Comhairle will be traded as part of the spoils of Government in the next D&aacute;il.  Do not tell me that people will break ranks with the instructions from their party.  Let us look at some of the evidence for that.  There is another election in which Deputies, and councillors, vote in secrecy, namely, the Seanad election.  That is the most highly disciplined election of all, carried out under secret ballot where the seepage of votes from party loyalty is virtually zero.  The instruction will go down from the parties to vote for whoever is the favoured person for Ceann Comhairle.  It will be part of the usual trading that goes on for Cabinet Ministers and it will be a Government nominee, a Government favourite and member who is elected by secret ballot.  There is no tradition in this House of the parties showing the sort of independence which is expected in this change.<\/p>  <p>  The Government would have done far better to have opened up the very secretive Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which orders the business of the House and which is a complete and utter mystery to the public, in order that everybody could see what goes on in there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800012#K00700","speaker":"953"},{"type":"speech","time":1453978800,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I was part of the Constitutional Convention which discussed D&aacute;il reform.  It was all about making the D&aacute;il more accountable, more democratic and more efficient, so I have to ask if this proposal will do that.  Is it going to be positive and progressive in the spirit in which it was discussed?  Is what is being proposed really any different from the system we have?  If a party or parties have a significant majority, they will have the votes for their selected candidates and it does not matter whether that vote is secret or open.  If it is a secret ballot and their choice is not elected, I can imagine the investigations that would ensue.  There is an interesting part to the British system where they have 12 MEPs who have to propose but three of them cannot be from the same party as the candidate.  That would allow somebody to be elected as Ceann Comhairle with wider support.<\/p>  <p>  The work of the Ceann Comhairle involves presiding over proceedings as the sole judge of order in the D&aacute;il and a major issue is a lack of respect for the role of Ceann Comhairle, which is most unfortunate.  Some of the exchanges and the disregard for the role of the Chair have not enhanced the public perception of the D&aacute;il and D&aacute;il proceedings.  It certainly does not improve public confidence in the D&aacute;il.  There is a bigger issue here to ensure status, stature and respect for office and I wonder if there is a space for a non-political person in an open competition to be Ceann Comhairle.  The most important thing is to get the best person, regardless of gender, age or whether they are in a party or not, in order that the person in question will command respect and will, as Chair, challenge speakers, either the Taoiseach or Ministers, if they do not answer questions or members of the Opposition.  Could there be a role as Leas-Cheann Comhairle for other people who are nominated?  Could they automatically become Leas-Cheann Comhairle?<\/p>  <p>  I support the principle of what is being proposed here this morning but I am not sure the practice will bring the positivity and progressiveness we would hope for.  The election of Ceann Comhairle cannot just be an academic exercise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800012#K00800","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1453978800,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I compliment the previous speaker on her positive, well-researched and well-presented contribution.  It was constructive, as always.  I have been a Member for almost 19 years and was involved for quite a while in the D&aacute;il reform committee.  For 14 years under Fianna F&aacute;il there was no D&aacute;il reform, except for Leaders' Questions.  When I came in, Michael Noonan was leader of Fine Gael and he brought forward a motion, which was accepted because it was happening anyway.  There was nothing else in 14 years.  We brought forward many packages and then decided we would do it incrementally, with no engagement, and nothing happened.  Fair play to the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Paul Kehoe.  On the first day in here he brought in major changes.  Once they are embedded, people do not realise what they mean and people who were not here previously have no experience of how shambolic the situation was before that.<\/p>  <p>  I could spend the day talking about this but the biggest change was pre-legislative scrutiny.  In the past five years, 7,386 people have come before committees of the Houses, given evidence and engaged with their Parliament.  That is a huge change.  They have impacted on legislation before it was drafted and published and we have the evidence to show that.  In the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality which I chair, more than 500 citizens of this State have been given the opportunity to engage with their Parliament and to impact on legislation before it is published.<\/p><p>Once the legislation is drafted and published, one cannot make any major changes.  It is a massive change, but nobody is talking about it.  It is the biggest change I have seen in my 19 years in the House but because it does not involve fireworks in the Chamber, grandstanding, sitting-in and that type of nonsense it does not get headlines.  Massive amounts of time, work, effort and energy go into this and that is making a major change, but nobody is writing about in the newspapers or talking about it on television or in the media.  We have spent hours, days and weeks at committee meetings listening to ordinary citizens, representatives of non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and academics who have come to the meetings to have their say.  It is the biggest change I have ever seen.<\/p> <p> The election of the Ceann Comhairle by secret ballot is important.  I note the Deputy who was so critical during his two minutes and could not say anything constructive has now left the Chamber.  He could not even bother to hear the contribution of anybody else.  It is appalling.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan spoke about respect for the Ceann Comhairle.  That is crucial.  There should be no occasion when a Member questions the Ceann Comhairle in the Chamber.  If one has an issue one should meet the Ceann Comhairle outside, not have a row in the Chamber.  That is unseemly and should not be done.  The next time the Ceann Comhairle is elected I hope everybody will respect that and speak through the Chair, not at each other across the Chamber.<\/p> <p> Members should also stop using scripts and reading speeches which somebody else has written for them.  Get rid of the scripts.  They should be outlawed.  Members should come to the Chamber and make the contributions their own by speaking to headlines and notes.<\/p> <p> Regarding the D'Hondt system, chairing a committee is a huge responsibility.  This has been the D&aacute;il of committees; the committees of the Oireachtas have come into their own.  Unfortunately, the referendum to allow committees to have a proper investigative role was not passed by the people.  That hampers the work of committees, and I believe people are understanding that now.  Another big change is the Taoiseach appearing before the working group of chairpersons.  We must continue making changes.  The new Members after the election must continue pushing the limits, exploring and looking for ways to do things.<\/p> <p> Attendance in the Chamber and in committees is a big problem.  Members do not attend committee meetings because many of them are tied up doing constituency work.  The time somebody spends in a committee room should be logged and noted, from the time they arrive to the time they leave, by the minute.  Somebody who arrives to a meeting, makes one contribution and leaves gets the same credit as somebody who spends hours debating at the meeting.  People should be members of only one committee, and there should be only 15 members of each committee.  It should be a privilege to be a member of a committee, not a right.  Perhaps not everybody should be a member of a committee.  That would avoid situations where people are expected to attend two meetings at the same time.  It would also give members a chance to give more detailed attention to the business of a committee.  There should also be convenors at committees.  Many committees have had problems getting a quorum.  As there is no coverage of committee work, for the most part, members do not feel compelled to turn up.  That is not good enough.<\/p> <p> We should be doing a great deal more in the House.  Second Stage speeches are a disaster.  One Member comes into the House and reads a speech, quite often to himself or herself.  Often Members of the Opposition do not even bother to show up.  When we were in opposition we had a rule there there always had to be at least one person on the benches.  I agree with Deputy Troy that even today the attendance is dire.

Deputy O'Brien spoke about engagement.  Recently, we were part of the engagement process with CIT and IT Tralee when Dr. Brendan Murphy held a meeting for public representatives and candidates.  Deputy Creed and I met the TUI on Monday night and I met it previously.  I am concerned by the large number of academic staff members who voted against the Bill.  They numbered in excess of 80%.  In my dealings with CIT's staff, they have been professional and committed.  Notwithstanding the level or quality of the engagement between CIT and the TUI, Deputy O'Brien is correct, in that there must be a continuum of engagement at various levels.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we get this right and that the foundation be put in place now so as to ensure that the edifice that will be the technological university is of benefit to students and the cohort of people in the wider catchment area that it serves.  Fundamental to this is the level of staff buy-in.<\/p>  <p>  The representation that I received on governance and engagement centred on disillusionment in CIT and the appointment of academic staff and student representatives to the governing body.  I was told that there should be a broad diversity of views among stakeholders.  A concern has been expressed in the Chamber and elsewhere in this regard.  To be fair to the Minister, she has been open to discussion and we have had conversations about this issue.  She met TUI members in Cork on Monday night.  In the education and training board, ETB, mergers, we brought people with us.  It is important that we be open about the future appointment of staff, including academic staff, to the governing body, as the concern in that regard has been rightly expressed.<\/p>  <p>  Another concern expressed to me during the dialogue centred on the six-month period at the beginning when there could potentially be no staff members or students on the governing body.  That is not the right move.  This relates to the question of engagement.  Who better than the staff to be on a representative body?  They are committed and interested and their remit does not end at the classroom or research door.  Their role is much greater than that.  As a director of adult education, I engaged with CIT and, in particular, Mr. Paul O'Mahony.  The regional provision of outreach services for continuing education, back to education and upskilling was in its infancy and helped many people.  The then Regional Technical College, Cork was good at doing this.  It afforded people the opportunity to become part of higher level education in various shapes and forms.  The Bill allows for this.<\/p>  <p>  In this critical period of the merger, though, we must focus on ensuring access for students who might not otherwise get to college and on maintaining the core ethos along with business development, which is something that we have all accepted.  What the Rubicon Centre and Dr. Murphy and others in CIT have done with the business case model, for example, the research and development of new thinking, new ideas and innovation, is to be applauded and commended.  In keeping with this, there is an obligation to ensure that the ethos of upskilling and further education is preserved, but I am concerned that it will be lost during the opening six months.  I say this conscious that we have high calibre people on the governing body, for example, Mr. Bob Savage of EMC, who do Trojan work and have no vested interest beyond the further advancement of the college and its students and staff.<\/p><p> When staff vote in such high numbers, it raises a flag and demands that an issue be examined.  Undoubtedly, this Bill is about a future vision.  The amendment referred to by Deputy Jonathan O'Brien is about stakeholder engagement.  The governing body is best served by having a wide diversity of opinion and membership.  If we had done nothing in this Oireachtas other than pre-legislative scrutiny, it would have shown that true engagement and participation, beyond the normal shuffling of paper involved the compilation of Bills, works.  In this case, it is important that we see further engagement.<\/p> <p> The Minister is aware that those of us who are interested in education and have been involved in it for a long time recognise that a Bill is about winning people on the journey towards a particular point of view.  It is about arriving at a consensus, if possible.  It is important that we have a Bill that reflects the views of all of us.  The Minister has gone some way towards this with the many amendments she has accepted since the consideration of the Bill began.  The members of the academic council should be elected by the academic staff to ensure a diversity of views, as a TUI member said to me on Monday, and also to ensure a constructive challenge to management and the maintenance of academic quality.  We must always ensure this.<\/p> <p> I am very much cognisant that there is an excellent management council in CIT.  It comprises people of the highest calibre who have done considerable, transformative work in bringing the institute to where it is today.  In the fullness of time, this Bill will prove to have been the correct approach for both the students and staff.  However, concerns have been expressed and views have been articulated that we must listen to and take on board.<\/p> <p> I note how we have changed.  Yesterday, the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, commended a new skills strategy, on which I congratulate him.  He is correct that we need to challenge one another in this area and reach out to young people to invite them to become part of the new skills era of our country.  With a view to making this legislation better and having and a meeting of minds, I hope the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, will listen to and reflect upon some of the views expressed to us at our meetings on Monday and during the week, and in the emails we received.<\/p> <p> This is good legislation.  It represents the right thing to do for CIT and IT Tralee.  As I stated, we must now proceed in a calm, measured way.  If we can do so, we will have a better Bill that will serve the needs of the staff and students, which is what we are about here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800015#N00300","speaker":"989","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453980900,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I wish to make only a couple of points because we have discussed this on Committee Stage and yesterday with the Minister.  If mergers, the technological universities principle and what is being proposed here are to work, the process will require the support of all the stakeholders.  The staff are vital in this regard.  Staff are extremely critical of the proposal, and there is a lot of opposition from them.  When the Minister of State says there was engagement with staff, I say it could not have been meaningful and real.  If it had been, the issues of the staff would have been taken on board and we would not be noting the extent of the opposition to what is being proposed.  Staff are not being included.  Unless they are included and listened to, this merger will not work and we will see a further escalation of industrial unrest.<\/p>  <p>  As it stands, the merger is being imposed.  When mergers and such arrangements are imposed on people, they are just starting off on the wrong footing.

Later stages will be futile and very difficult.<\/p>  <p>  We know about the opposition and criticism, and we note their extent in the content of the amendments before us.  There is a disconnect in that, although we have engaged, the stakeholders are saying they have not been engaged with and that they have just received briefings at which they were given information.

Colleagues are correct that some of them were dealt with already by the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, yesterday and probably on Tuesday and on Committee Stage.  Deputy Buttimer might not have been present for the full debate so I will clarify the position for him.  The TUI has consistently sought a full process of consultation in regard to the process and legislation.  This has been followed through by the Minister and the Department with the respective institutes involved in the processes.  We are disappointed that the TUI has chosen to withdraw from all the WRC engagement processes in respect of technological universities because I believe that all the TUI concerns can be addressed through discussion and negotiation via the normal industrial relations processes, including that of the WRC.  The processes were employed in the recent successful ETB mergers in the education sector, to which the TUI was a party.  They were not rushed.  All of us wanted the reform of the full education and training system in respect of the ETBs but the process was not rushed.  There was ample time for the issues to be worked through and negotiated at the desired level.  That is what happened.  In the case of the technological university proposal, the position is similar.  There has been ongoing engagement and discussion.  Everyone might not have got his way but there have been ongoing discussions and engagements for the past three or four years.  There are new procedures in place allowing everybody a chance to have his or her voice heard.  There is ample opportunity for all the concerns to be dealt with.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan is correct that most people seem to agree with the principle of what we are trying to achieve here.  However, many of the problems she is raising can be sorted out.  It is not necessarily a matter for this legislation.  It is to be dealt with under the WRC; that is what it is for.  The processes are in place.  Looking back at what has occurred in all the institutions of the past three or four years, I note there were many meetings and much engagement and consultation.  New procedures were put in place to allow for that and to allow a safe space or forum for conversation.<\/p>  <p>  I have visited the CIT on probably seven or eight occasions in the past 18 months.  It is a fabulous place and is doing unbelievable work, including through the Rubicon Centre, the innovation centre.  Unbelievable work is being done with local enterprises and people are being given a start-up opportunity.  The students are being turned into entrepreneurs and business people who are creating jobs.  The institute is an exemplar and I cannot commend it enough.  This legislation will only enhance the good work and give further opportunities.  There is ample time to sort out all the concerns.<\/p>  <p>  Let me refer to the specific amendments, namely, amendment No. 19 and the rest of the amendments in the group.  Sections 17, 44 and 52 all relate to the making of a decision by the Minister on an application made by a higher education institute or institutes.

He indicated that the 30-day process could not be opened up to all stakeholders.  We are discussing a key stakeholder, namely, academic staff.  The Minister of State's position is that the House should pass the legislation and the various issues can be dealt with subsequently.  Once passed, the Bill becomes law.  Section 17(2) states: \"A notice under subsection (1) shall state that the applicant colleges may make representations to the Minister in relation to the proposed decision not later than 30 days after service of the notice.\"  Nowhere in the legislation is it stated that representatives of staff may make such representations.  As such, passing the legislation would effectively silence the voices of the very people who have been asked to deliver a new, high-quality educational service.<\/p>  <p>  Staff in the institutes of technology must work under extreme conditions.  As I indicated yesterday, the budget for the institutes of technology sector has been reduced by &euro;190 million, while the number of lecturers has fallen by 10% and student numbers have increased by 35%.  In addition, the Bill provides that technological universities will have budget overruns deducted from their budget for the following year.  While an option to apply to the Higher Education Authority for a supplementary budget is provided, the legislation prescribes that each institute must not exceed its annual budget.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also provides that technological universities may set their own registration fees for students, which gives rise to a potential scenario in which different technological universities would apply different registration fees, albeit subject to the approval of the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  Once the Bill has been passed, it will not be possible to address many of the issues Deputies have raised.

Stakeholders must be comfortable with the reform's objectives.

There was significant engagement and discussion with all stakeholders in recent years on junior certificate reform.  The majority of them agreed with the reform, although some did not.  At some stage, a decision must be made to move on.  Consultation does not mean that every problem is resolved.  One does one's best to hear everyone out and have a fair process.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the Bill is to provide the legal framework for consortiums of institutes of technology to be granted technological university status.  Many issues remain to be discussed, and there are appropriate forums for doing so, but not all of these issues should be addressed in legislation.  We will tease them out in this debate, on which we will not impose a guillotine.  Deputies are giving the impression that the Bill is being rammed through when that is not the case.  Further debate is scheduled on three days next week, if it becomes necessary and the D&aacute;il is still sitting.  There will be time to tease out the amendments. <\/p>  <p>  We do not deem the amendments in this group to be appropriate.  They are not the way to do business in these matters.  We have gone to great lengths to engage in consultation in recent years and the consultation process continues.  It is not the case that it is game over, as it were, because this is a long process.  The purpose of the legislation is to advance the process to the next stage, and in some cases there is a strong demand that we do so.  Most people are in favour of the idea or concept behind the Bill.  If we do not enact this legislation, people will conclude that technological universities will never be established and there will not be any consultation or progress.  These proposals will benefit most, if not all, of the stakeholders concerned.  While I accept that issues arise, the purpose of consultation is to address outstanding issues.  Ample mechanisms are in place to do so at the appropriate time and place.

It is unclear how the outstanding issues will be addressed once the legislation has been passed because the section states clearly that only applicant colleges can make representations to the Minister on the proposed decision and they must do so not later than 30 days after the proposed decision has been made.  It does not state that members of staff can make representations, nor can I find any other reference in the Bill to allowing recognised trade unions representing staff members to make representations to the Minister.  Despite this, the Minister of State argues that Deputies should pass the legislation and the outstanding issues can be dealt with subsequently.<\/p>  <p>  I am seriously concerned about the manner in which the Bill is being proposed.  I do not have a problem with the introduction of technological universities, as I believe they will transform the quality of education in the regions.  However, this will only come about if all the stakeholders buy into the process.  We are trying to deal with a process that was flawed from the outset, while pursuing the common goal of achieving technological university status for institutes of technology.  <\/p>  <p>  Under this proposal, institutes of technology will be forced to merge without any guarantee of securing technological university status.  Furthermore, the Bill does not provide any guarantees on course provision before technological university status is granted, nor is there a guarantee in place that the process will be adequately funded.  There is no guarantee that agreement will be obtained from all the stakeholders before technological university status is granted.  Notwithstanding all of these flaws, the institutes of technology must agree to merge before technological university status can be secured.  The Government is putting the horse before the cart.  Agreement should be found among all the stakeholders, and if that is not possible, the Government should at least enable stakeholders to make representations to the Minister.  The failure do so wrong is wrong because it disenfranchises a key stakeholder in the process, namely, the staff who will be asked to operate the terms of the legislation and, to use the words of the Minister, give technological universities the capacity to compete at an international level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800017#P00500","speaker":"984"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1453981500,"counter":196,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1453982100,"counter":197,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800018#Q00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1453982100,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 27A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Robert Troy - the sanctioning of the drug Soliris for the treatment of Degos disease; (2) Deputies Charlie McConalogue and Pearse Doherty - the provision of capital funding for the community hospitals in Lifford, Ramelton and Stranorlar in County Donegal to meet Health Information and Quality Authority standards; (3) Deputy Joanna Tuffy - the appointment of a liquidator to Xtra-vision and the rights of employees, including the right to redundancy payments; (4) Deputy Mick Wallace - the review of the penalty points system; and (5) Deputy Bernard J.

We have learned through the media and through leaks in the past 48 hours that the insurance industry has come back, but it has been largely a negative response on these two key issues, in other words, on the issues of taking into account the effectiveness of demountables and the need to ensure all home owners and businesses in areas where OPW schemes have been completed can get flood insurance cover.<\/p>  <p>  It gives me no pleasure to say it but, in effect, the Government has been snubbed by the insurance industry.  The outcome means that thousands of home owners and businesses throughout the country continue to be denied flood insurance.  There seems to be no strategy at Government level to deal with this.<\/p>  <p>  The insurance industry will say that a high percentage of home owners and businesses in areas where schemes have been completed can get flood cover.  However, a survey was released in recent days by a flood alleviation group from Ballinasloe.  This is a community project under the auspices of the national flood forum.  The group undertook a survey in Derrymullan, Galway.  They found that despite the fact an OPW scheme with permanent flood defences - not demountables - was completed five years ago at a cost of &euro;1.5 million, some 60% of those surveyed cannot get flood insurance.  The message we are hearing from the insurance companies is not matched with the reality.  The figures they are providing to the Government simply cannot be validated.<\/p>  <p>  As the T&aacute;naiste is aware, we brought forward a flood insurance Bill which would compel the insurance industry to provide cover where the OPW has completed schemes to the required EU standard, as set out in the 2007 directive, that is to say, to the one in 100 year standard.  The bottom line is that where these schemes have been completed, they have worked, for example, in Fermoy, Mallow and Clonmel.  It is not sustainable for the insurance industry to continue to deny the effectiveness of demountables.  In some towns the defences have to be of a mobile demountable nature, otherwise the towns simply cannot function.  The Government needs to take account of the serious impact this is having.  Businesses may not be able to get credit from their banks because the banks will, understandably, seek to ensure there is adequate flood cover.  It is going to have an impact on the rates base of local authorities further down the line if this issue is not dealt with.<\/p>  <p>  Did the follow-up meeting which was to have taken place by Tuesday of this week actually take place?  Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm that the insurance industry came back to the Government?  Will the Government publish the response, whatever it was?  Will the T&aacute;naiste outline for Members in the House today the nature of that response?  How is the Government going to react to the fact that, unfortunately, the issues raised are not being addressed or dealt with?  Ultimately, the people suffering are home owners and business owners who cannot get flood cover in areas where relief schemes have been completed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800018#Q00400","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1453982100,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I agree with much of what the Deputy has said in respect of the difficulties caused to families and businesses where they are unable to get flood insurance.  This discussion with the insurance industry is ongoing.  A great deal of detailed work is being done, including an international comparison of what other countries faced with the same issues are doing.  Many countries in Europe, including our neighbours in the United Kingdom, are faced with repeat episodes of flooding.  Different models of seeking to have the matter addressed through general insurance have been tried in these countries.  Some have worked more effectively than others but in all of the countries this is an issue for the insurance industry.<\/p>  <p>  I agree that where significant sums of public money have been spent on either permanent flood defences or on removable or demountable flood defences, the statistics show in a significant number of cases that a proportion of people continue to be denied insurance by the insurance industry.  Obviously it is a priority that this should be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The conversation with the insurance industry is ongoing.  On Tuesday, for example, the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, my colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin, presented to Cabinet a detailed proposal in respect of the oversight of the development of the flood risk management programme for the Shannon basin.  This has been discussed in the House and it is now going ahead and progressing.  I assure Deputy McGrath that as part of the process there was a discussion of the statistical evidence, which shows that notwithstanding the significant sums of public money being spent, some people are being refused insurance even where there are permanent flood defences.<\/p><p>The rate of refusal is significantly higher where flood defences are of the demountable kind.  It is an ongoing issue with the insurance industry.  The reason a meeting with the insurance industry did not take place as recently as last week was because the Taoiseach had commitments in the UK and the annual conference on the economy in Switzerland.  He was involved in heavily promoting Ireland at a very large international business conference.  I do not think that people would have wished him to do anything other than go and defend Ireland.  I anticipate that the follow-on meeting with the insurance industry will happen quite soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800018#Q00500","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453982700,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I ask the T&aacute;naiste not to treat us like fools.  The suggestion that the Taoiseach's commitment to attend the conference in Davos and to meet Prime Minister David Cameron in London were arranged in the past two weeks is not credible.

That did not happen and the T&aacute;naiste has not been able to tell the House that a date has been set for a further meeting between the Government and the insurance industry.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, the issues raised by the T&aacute;naiste, Taoiseach and a cadre of Ministers with the insurance industry - there was great fanfare when the meeting was organised - have simply not been addressed.  The reality is that they have come back and rebuffed what the Government has suggested.  What is the Government going to do about it?  The Government has been snubbed.  The reality is that this issue cannot go unaddressed.  Home owners and business owners in communities around the country are living with the daily fear of being flooded again and not having flood insurance.<\/p>  <p>  As the T&aacute;naiste well knows, the particular issue we have raised relates to areas and communities where OPW flood relief schemes have been completed to the required standard, at the expense of taxpayers and in line with the EU directive, and where they have proved to be effective.  The Government has unvalidated figures from the insurance industry.  A survey from the national flood forum was carried out in Ballinasloe.  One example is Derrymullan, where &euro;1.5 million was spent on permanent flood defences five years ago which have proven to be effective.  Some 60% of those who responded to the survey cannot get flood insurance.

Today I want to discuss yet another which I believe merits scrutiny.  This is the awarding of the call centre work for Irish Water to the Cork-based company Abtran.  The T&aacute;naiste will recall that Abtran got the contract for the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant system, and came under serious criticism, and rightly so, for its failings.  It cost an additional almost &euro;6 million.  Despite this, it went on to be awarded the property tax contract and Revenue had to step in because initially it failed to cope.  After both of these high-profile failings it was awarded the call centre work for Irish Water.  We know that Abtran has at least ten other Government and public contracts.  One of the criteria for the tendering process for the Irish Water contract was the company had to have a turnover of &euro;20 million for the preceding three years.  Given that Abtran had a number of lucrative State contracts prior to the Irish Water contract, the State certainly improved Abtran's ability to meet the criteria laid down in the process.  What is interesting is how the contract was awarded and the obvious questions it raises about probity and the awarding of the contract.<\/p>  <p>  Through freedom of information I have established that on 15 February 2012 the private secretary of the then Minister, Phil Hogan, received a fairly informal e-mail seeking a meeting with \"Phil\" to lobby on behalf of Abtran.  On the same day at 5 p.m. an e-mail was sent stating the Minister had agreed to meet the company.  On 27 February of the same year we know from Gavin Sheridan's publication of the Minister's diary that the Minister met the person who sent the original lobbying e-mail, Mr. O'Byrnes, and the co-owner of Abtran.  In March 2013 the company was awarded the contract.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Water call centre contract is lucrative.  It is worth approximately &euro;50 million over four years.  We know through freedom of information that one of the key criteria for the firm to which the contract would be awarded was to have a proven track record.  I presume this means a good proven track record.  Given the criteria, is the T&aacute;naiste satisfied that despite the very public failings of Abtran on SUSI and the property tax that it was still awarded an extremely lucrative contract by the State?  Is she aware that in late 2015, a State investment vehicle invested an undisclosed sum of money in Abtran?  Does she know what the money was for and how much it was?  Is she concerned about what appears to be the favouring of Abtran for Government funds?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800021#T02900","speaker":"1202"},{"type":"speech","time":1453983900,"counter":341,"content":"<p>My understanding of the SUSI development, which is the online system for students to get college grants, is the contract was actually awarded to the City of Dublin VEC, which subsequently became the City of Dublin Education and Training Board.  It made the arrangements on how what was a new and very ambitious computer-based application system would be delivered.  As the Deputy knows, contracts in Ireland are governed by Irish and European contract law.  SUSI was a very new system established for a large number of students applying for student grants.  Approximately 50% of students who go to college in Ireland get full or partial student grants, so we are talking about a lot of people.  For years, until my colleague, the former Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, set about mandating that a new system be established, the complaint had been that many students did not get their grants until months into their college courses.  There was general agreement that this should be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  There were definitely teething problems, which we read about, but the City of Dublin VEC, subsequently the ETB, was available to Oireachtas committees on a repeat basis to go through everything on SUSI.  I am happy to say the SUSI system of college grant applications is now deemed to be one of the best new systems installed by any Irish Government.  The Deputy probably knows from the university in her constituency that the feedback from students' unions, parents and individual students is that college grants are now paid on time.  The overall SUSI project has worked extremely well despite teething problems.<\/p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for the administration of the property tax, and I can only go on their reports that there is a very high level of compliance with the property tax, and that it has worked in a very efficient and very effective way.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy asked for information on sub-elements of the contract.  The Government has introduced legislation on lobbying and a register of lobbyists.  We have expanded very significantly on the Freedom of Information Act, which was partially dismantled by the previous Government which brought in restrictions.  All I can say is that, rightly in terms of accountability, all the information on contracts relating to all elements of public service is now available in a much speedier and more timely way as a consequence of the legislation the Government has introduced, particularly the broadening of freedom of information and the introduction of legislation on lobbyists.<\/p><p>These are both tremendous developments in terms of our democracy and the reporting and accountability that the Deputy rightly seeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800021#T03000","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453984500,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that both of those Bills are very important, but \"speedy\" is not a word I would use in respect of some entities that are covered under freedom of information.  It is not all of them; some Departments are good, but others are not.  For example, the Irish Water call centre contract falls just outside the timeframe for freedom of information requests by a number of weeks.  I can understand that there would be a confidentiality issue when a contract is being decided before it is awarded, but afterwards there is no reason that should not be fully transparent.<\/p>  <p>  Getting certain information from Irish Water is like pulling hen's teeth.  I looked for information on this very point last September and I got a reply containing information I could have picked off its website in December.  I have had to seek a review on it, looking for the very information that would give me what the T&aacute;naiste is telling me I can have.  That is not a criticism of the legislation, but some entities are not using it as she described and it is very frustrating.  Confidentiality and commercial sensitivity are routinely rolled out as a reason not to give information.  In some cases that is reversed under review.  Could the T&aacute;naiste answer me that question in respect of the investment?  Does she know what the investment into that company was?  It happened in December 2015.  What was it for and how much was it?  If she does not know, could she come back to me with that information, if it is possible to get it?<\/p>  <p>  In terms of freedom of information, even the company I raised is not served by the lack of transparency.

These were directly caused by four key failures - in banking, regulatory, Government and Europe.  The theory of a soft landing or gradual slowdown for the Irish economy was never substantially tested or challenged, and the idea of a guarantee was not conceived on a single Monday night in September 2008.  Among the report&rsquo;s key findings are the following.  The almost universal adoption of the soft landing theory, without any substantial test or challenge, must be regarded as a key failing for the Government, Central Bank and the Department of Finance.  The night of the guarantee has become something of a myth.  In reality the idea of a guarantee was considered as part of a range of options as early as January 2008.  No independent in-depth deep-dive investigation of the banks had been commissioned by the authorities before September 2008, and the guarantee was decided upon in the absence of accurate information about the underlying health of financial institutions.<\/p>  <p>  By October of 2010 Ireland&rsquo;s entry into a bailout programme was inevitable.  However, the timing of the entry into the programme was determined by factors outside the Government&rsquo;s control.  The ECB put the Government under undue pressure to enter a programme but also insisted that there would be no burden sharing with bondholders.<\/p>  <p>  The crisis in the banks was directly caused by decisions of bank boards, managers and advisers to pursue risky business practices, either to protect their market share or to grow their business and profits.  Banks moved far away from prudent lending principles in their dealings with the property development sector in favour of a riskier asset value-based lending model.  The introduction of new mortgage products masked the accumulating difficulty of the year-on-year increases in house prices, while facilitating a situation whereby affordability could be met in purchasing the mortgage product.  No single event or decision led to the failure of the banks in the lead-in period to the crisis, but rather it was a cumulative result of a series of events and decisions over a number of years.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, the end result was that exposures resulting from poor lending to the property sector not only threatened the viability of individual financial institutions but also the financial system itself.  The Financial Regulator adopted a light touch and non-intrusive approach to regulation.  The Central Bank underestimated the risks to the Irish financial system.  The committee found that both institutions had the powers to intervene, but neither did so decisively.  The Central Bank and Financial Regulator were aware as early as 2003 that the Irish banking sector was placing increasing reliance on lending to the property sector and that different lending practices were being adopted.  Neither the Central Bank, at a macroprudential level, nor the Financial Regulator, at a microprudential level, intervened decisively at the time or in the years prior to the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Government taxation policy reduced direct taxes and transferred reliance on pro-cyclical taxes leading to a structural deficit.  Government fiscal policy resulted in significant, long-term expenditure commitments funded by unsustainable transaction-based revenue streams.  Fiscal policy after 2001 was not focused on mitigating and managing property price increases.  If steps had been taken, for example, through reducing or abolishing property tax incentives, as originally planned from 2002 to 2004, the severe overheating from 2003 to 2007 could have been mitigated, at least to some degree.  In this regard tax incentives were introduced and extended without sufficient analysis of the costs, benefits and impacts.  They fuelled an already strong construction industry during most years from the mid-1990s up to and including 2006.  Government, including individual Ministers, made policy decisions based on a range of considerations, including having regard to, but not always accepting, the advice of the Department of Finance, Central Bank and international organisations, and during the public hearings ultimately accepted overall responsibility for decisions made.<\/p>  <p>  The committee has recommended changes for banks, external auditors, State institutions and Government policy and the Oireachtas to minimise risk in the future.  Among the recommendations are the following.  All members of bank boards should have requisite financial skill sets and experience to include banking, risk and governance.  The risk of a mismatch between liabilities and assets in terms of composition, stability, currency and tenure should be reviewed regularly at board level.  The capacity for direct reporting of critical business risk to the regulatory authority by an external auditor should be strengthened.  A detailed and comprehensive commercial property price register should be introduced.  Membership of the board of the Central Bank, appointed by Government, must include sufficient expertise and relevant direct experience in financial stability and prudential regulation.  In situations where there are conflicts between the advice provided by the Department of Finance on matters where exceptional risks are involved and the decision proposed by the Minister, a formal process with clear procedures should be established through legislation.  Bands should be set with regard to the proportion of the total State tax revenue accounted for by defined cyclical transaction taxes, which should also include triggers for action when breached.  Oireachtas committees should be reviewed and resources provided to increase their effectiveness.  An independent budget office should be established to provide independent costings of budgetary and pre-election proposals made by political parties and Members of the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  Each crisis has at its origin a belief that this could never happen again or that this time it is different.  One description of this recent crisis was that it was a systemic misjudgment of risk, that those in significant roles in Ireland, whether public or private, in their own way got it wrong, and that it was a misjudgment of risk on such a scale that it led to the greatest financial failure and ultimate crash in the history of the State.  This is one part of the story.  The failure to identify the potential risk posed to the overall financial stability of the State by the banking system is another key lesson which must be learned.  Recognition must also be given to the lack of an overall framework, at a European level, for dealing with the financial crisis.<\/p>  <p>  This report&rsquo;s findings and recommendations show that lessons must be learned and applied.  There is no certain formula to avoid another crisis, but constant vigilance and early preventative action are critical.  The final report laid before the House contains three volumes.  Volume one is the main report, volume two explains how the inquiry operated and deals with recommendations for the running of future inquiries, and volume three involves the publication of all the documentary evidence considered in preparing the main report.  The inquiry was asked to examine the reasons Ireland experienced a systemic banking crisis.  In reality, however, there were two crises - a banking crisis and a fiscal crisis which combined to bring about the crash.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the members of the joint committee for their hard work and commitment throughout the inquiry, which commenced 18 months ago.  The determination of all the members of the inquiry to complete the task put before the committee is, I believe, unique in Irish political life.  Despite varying party political affiliations, all members participated fully and worked together to deliver the best report possible within the framework of the Act and on time.  However, it must be acknowledged that Deputies Pearse Doherty and Joe Higgins, while they continued to remain as members of the joint committee, were in the end unable to support the final report.  Committee members are the visible side of the inquiry, but there is another.  Enormous credit is due to the staff of the inquiry and to members&rsquo; staff, to the investigation team, the legal team, the secretariat and all those who worked behind the scenes, working long days and long hours in the evenings and through weekends.  The dedication, determination and commitment they gave to supporting the committee make them exemplars of good public service in this country.<\/p>  <p>  I also acknowledge and welcome the co-operation we received from institutional participants and individual witnesses through their attendance at public hearings, preparation of written statements and provision of documents to the inquiry.  However, co-operation was not evident across the board and the joint committee is critical of the failure of the ECB in particular to co-operate with the inquiry.  While acknowledging that there was no legal obligation on it to do so, the stance of the ECB stands in stark contrast to the full co-operation and engagement offered by both the European Commission and the IMF.<\/p>  <p>  It was a privilege to serve on this committee.  It was an opportunity to shine a light on a dark and difficult time in our recent past, an opportunity to piece together the events of that time, an opportunity to learn from the mistakes that were made and an opportunity to ensure those mistakes are never repeated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800026#Y00100","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1453987500,"counter":487,"content":"<p>It was a privilege to have been involved in this cross-party banking inquiry along with my ten colleagues.  It must be recognised that this inquiry had two strands - public hearings and the publication of the report.  Each was equally important.  The inquiry was held in public.  For the first time the public could see, in real time, all the stakeholders appearing before the committee to be questioned.  That should not be lost in the review of the banking inquiry.<\/p>  <p>  I will discuss a number of areas in the time I have to speak.  First, I acknowledge the work of the chair, the secretariat and everybody involved with the inquiry.  What was new about this report, given that there has been a myriad of reports on this area?  We made some key findings.  The first finding is that this was a commercial real estate crisis for the banks, not a residential crisis.  It was a residential crisis for ordinary people whose homes fell in value through no fault of theirs and who effectively, as a result of the crash, could not afford to pay their mortgages.  However, for the banks it was a commercial real estate crisis.  We know that because when NAMA took over the loans from the banks it paid &euro;32 billion for loans of &euro;74 billion, which is a write-down of over &euro;42 billion.  Over 80% of those loans were commercial loans.  The write-down on the remainder of the commercial loans in the banks was of the order of 58%.  It was about a third of that figure for residential properties.  If the commercial real estate crisis had not happened, in all likelihood the Irish citizen would have ended up putting significantly less money into the banks, if any at all.  We must lay to rest the myth that everybody partied.  They did not.  The ordinary citizen struggled.  A few partied - the big boys - and they caused a situation whereby there is &euro;30 billion of taxpayers' money in a black hole deep in IBRC, formerly Anglo Irish Bank.<\/p>  <p>  A second key finding relates to the issue surrounding the guarantee.  There were many options on the night of the guarantee, and they had been examined over the previous year.  The only written document we got sight of was where the Central Bank had provided a press statement with the outline of a guarantee on that night, which just guaranteed deposits and inter-bank lending.  There was no guarantee of any bondholders.  A couple of hours later, however, everything was guaranteed, including bondholders across the board.  Clearly, it is not the case that the blanket guarantee was the only decision that could be made.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue was the many warning signs that arose beforehand.  The National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, is charged with managing taxpayers' money and borrowing on behalf of the State.  As far back as August 2007 it refused to put money into Anglo Irish Bank and, successively, the other banks because it believed it was putting taxpayers' money at risk.  The Minister at the time used legislation to force the NTMA to put money into the banks, to the point that &euro;790 million of taxpayers' money from the NTMA was in the banks at the time of the guarantee.  We have recommended in this report that the powers of the Minister over the National Treasury Management Agency be reviewed.  There must be more independence, and those warning signs must be available.<\/p>  <p>  There are key findings in the overall summary.  There was a lack of judgment of risk by the banks, particularly regarding commercial lending, and excessive remuneration was paid to top executives in the banks.  The remuneration was completely out of line with what the ordinary citizen was earning or, in many cases, what people were earning in top jobs elsewhere.  The Financial Regulator and the Central Bank did not use the powers available to them.  They did not need new powers as the powers were available already.  One of them was that they could have insisted on the banks providing for extra capital to deal with possible losses, particularly in the commercial area.  Policies were pursued at Government and fiscal level, in terms of tax incentives, which continued to fuel the cycle.  There was talk that they would cease in 2002 but they did not cease until 2008.  They all contributed to a whirlwind where the property sector went out of control.  A total of 25% of our GDP was coming from the property sector.  It was madness.<\/p>  <p>  I will refer to the primary recommendations which seek to ensure this never happens again.  First, in the commercial area, we recommend that there should be a comprehensive commercial property price register.  If that had existed at the time it would have highlighted the fact that the price of commercial property was going out of control and also the risk the banks took on commercial property.  The banks basically deemed that diversifying their portfolios was including property in Ireland, England, France, Europe and the US.  That was diversification.  However, all commercial property fell in value at the same time, so that was a complete misjudgment of risk.<\/p>  <p>  Second, the European Central Bank, ECB, must appear before Oireachtas inquiries and must be held more accountable.  The ECB blocked burden sharing for the Irish State on two occasions - in the bailout in November 2010, when there was &euro;20 billion of unguaranteed bonds available, and in 2011 when there was approximately &euro;9.2 billion available, based on the studies we received from the NTMA.  Remuneration in the banks must be linked to medium-term results for the institutions.  Boards of banks must be held accountable for the risk appetite and the judgment of risks within the banks.  Boards abdicated their responsibility in that area and they must be held to account.<\/p>  <p>  We also refer to the auditing area.  The European Commission produced a Green Paper in which it stated that auditors must be replaced after six years.  It was agreed to be ten years.  In the nine years prior to the crash, three auditors dominated all institutions.  There must be proper rotation.  The second issue that emerged from the Green Paper is that as part of their auditing duties auditors should be required to audit the banks' concentration of commercial loans and residential loan books and report to the Financial Regulator, as a distinct requirement.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of NAMA's work and the appraisal of its work, we were curtailed by the timescale as we could not look beyond 31 December 2013.  We recommend that once NAMA has concluded its work a comprehensive review should be carried out of its work, value for money for the taxpayer and so forth.<\/p>  <p>  Was the banking inquiry worthwhile?  I believe it was.  One reason is the public hearings.  We went through matters forensically with 131 witnesses.  I would have liked it to happen earlier but we held a referendum and the people gave their view on the new type of banking inquiry.  They turned it down.  However, we now have a body of work.  It is a cross-party work, which is very important, where the citizen can get clarification of why and how it happened, the people involved and the recommendations to ensure it does not happen again.<\/p>  <p>  I will conclude with one point.  As a country, we do people very well.<\/p><p>If one has a good person in a position, one will find that the role is carried out to perfection.  If a person is weak, however, our system does not compensate for that personal weakness.  It is something we need to look at because situations will arise where a person is not particularly great in a role and a system will need to be in place to protect the interests of the taxpayer and the citizen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800027#Z00100","speaker":"1060","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453988100,"counter":489,"content":"<p>I am glad to have an opportunity to say a few words on the banking inquiry report.  As a group, we embarked on a journey in June 2014 when our first meeting took place.  In November 2014, the Oireachtas concluded the terms of reference which were given to the inquiry team.  The initial deadline for the conclusion of the report was November 2015, one year later, but we ended up getting an extension of time.  As such, it has been an 18 months process and journey for us.  At the outset, I acknowledge the work of the Chairman, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch, to whom I pay tribute for the manner in which he chaired the private and public meetings.  He had to invest a great deal of additional time as Chairman to deal with various issues and to ensure that the inquiry ran as smoothly as possible.  It is a personal achievement for Deputy Lynch to have chaired the inquiry so well.  I also acknowledge the work of all of my colleagues on the committee, many of whom took on significant additional duties in the last couple of months, including drafting and redrafting sections and working to bring the report to a conclusion.  I thank and acknowledge my parliamentary assistant, Morgan Shelley, without whom I could not have given as much time as I did to the inquiry along with everybody else.  I acknowledge the work of the investigators and, of course, the legal advisors and all of those who supported the work of the inquiry in the background.<\/p>  <p>  It is an achievement to have completed a report.  There were certainly times in recent months when I was not sure we would get this over the line.  Having concluded the work and looking at the finished product, it was an achievement to conclude our work and have a finished report.  The constraints in the 2013 legislation have been articulated and are dealt with comprehensively in Volume 2.  Whoever forms part of the next Government and has the privilege of being in the next Oireachtas will, I hope, examine the recommendations in the report with a view to implementing them to improve the legislation which is in place.  I remain true to the view I expressed at the very beginning of the process over a year and a half ago that a non-political inquiry would have been preferable.  I am not going to change my mind on that at this stage.  That is why my colleagues and I in Fianna F&aacute;il advocated a Leveson style inquiry.  Whether we like it or not, politicians were being inquired into in effect and the inquiry was, by its very nature, inherently political.  As such, it would have been better if it had been conducted by a truly impartial person with adequate resources.  We need to revisit the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005 which is still sitting on the Order Paper and has not been concluded.  It needs to be enacted as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Kieran O'Donnell said, all of our work in terms of receiving testimony took place in public.  Getting people before the inquiry who had not said a single word in public as regards their roles in the different organisations was in itself a public service.  Certainly, it has added to the body of knowledge we all have about the banking crisis.  People will make up their own minds having read the report.  The truth is that many people had already made up their own minds as to what led to Ireland's banking crisis and how it was responded to.  The important point is that we have enhanced the overall understanding of the banking crisis and brought many pertinent new pieces of information into the public domain, which is very important.  It must be acknowledged that we have not told the complete story because we have been unable to.  The reality is that we were only able to scratch at the surface of the story of Anglo Irish Bank, a bank which will ultimately cost the State in the region of &euro;30 billion.  Any inquiry into Ireland's banking collapse which did not hear testimony from people like David Drumm and Sean FitzPatrick is clearly not a complete body of work.  We all acknowledge that as members of the inquiry.  However, significant new information came into the public domain and is now on the public record.  There is a great deal of information and documentation which has now been made available on the Internet in Volume 3 and which will provide fertile ground for journalists, academics, researchers and future policy makers who can go through it all to tease out further points we were not able to cover in the detail we would have liked.  The time we had was limited.  I acknowledge that having a series of crisis meetings towards the end was not ideal and undoubtedly sapped some public confidence in the inquiry.  All of that will be forgotten in the fullness of time, however, and the inquiry report will stand the test of time.  It is there as a permanent record of the work we have done.<\/p>  <p>  It is a great pity that somebody who could have contributed so much to the work of the banking inquiry, the late Brian Lenihan, was not able to do so.  He would have had much to say and the inquiry would have been far richer had we been able to hear from Brian Lenihan in the course of our work.  We got some sense of the immense pressure he must have been under.  It is something I thought about personally in the course of the inquiry when the full extent of what was going on the background in the lead up to September 2008, the nationalisation of Anglo and, ultimately, the bailout programme in November 2010.  He must have been under the most extraordinary pressure as a human being.  None of us will ever know whether the pressure and stress he was under contributed to the illness to which he eventually succumbed, but it would not surprise me if that was the case.  From the point of view of the inquiry, it was all the poorer that Brian Lenihan was not there to tell his story and to answer many of the questions.  One of the key questions was whether Anglo should have been nationalised.  I question at times whether it would have made any great difference if that was done at the end of September 2008.  Ultimately, money would only have been saved if someone was not repaid.  Who would that have been?  No one is suggesting it should have been depositors.  People suggest senior bondholders, but would that have been permitted?  What would the consequences have been?  No one, had they known then that rescuing Anglo was going to cost in the region of &euro;30 billion, would have embarked on that course of action.  I do not believe that anyone would have ultimately made that decision.<\/p>  <p>  On the banks themselves, a great deal has been covered.  The fact that they simply did not know the full exposure of individual borrowers to whom they were giving loans is remarkable.  There was clearly a major failure at board level across a number of the institutions.  There was a failure at so many levels across different organisations.  The role of the financial regulator - the Central Bank - is comprehensively dealt with.  There was a serious shortcoming in terms of the preparation for the crisis that struck us in September 2008 despite serious warning signs and alarm bells ringing.  As the Chairman has said, there was no deep dive into the financial institutions in the course of 2008 which was a very clear failing.  There is no evidence that such a deep dive would have provided information that would have led to a different course of action, but having the information would certainly have been very helpful.  There was also, of course, the failure at the level of the Department of Finance, at Government level, which has been well documented in terms of pro-cyclical fiscal policy and the underlying deficit which was subsequently exposed when the property and construction industries collapsed entirely.  The ECB and its role is also covered.  I have no doubt, having sat through all of the hearings, that the actions of the ECB added billions of euro to the ultimate cost of rescuing the Irish banking system.  I have no doubt whatsoever that was the case.  All of the evidence is on the record to back that up.<\/p><p> It was clear from our work that there was an intolerance of dissenting voices.  If we are to learn anything as a country and an Oireachtas, it is to be more tolerant of those who hold contrary views.  We could all improve in this regard.  There were some dissenting voices during the so-called boom years.  While they were certainly in a small minority, they were strong and much of what they said has been proven true.  We should learn from that.<\/p> <p> If the work of our inquiry is taken seriously and carried forward into the next Oireachtas, it should be taken to the next step.  Implementing our recommendations would reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of a future crisis afflicting this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800028#AA00200","speaker":"993","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453988700,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I do not know whether I can sum up 18 months of participation in a banking inquiry in ten minutes, but I will try to add to what its other members have stated.  I thank Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch for the major effort that he put into the inquiry.  When the public hearings began, we as members had to take a step back from the process on the investigative team's side to focus on the public sessions, but the Chairman had to focus on those sessions while running the back room.  It was a significant task, one that involved extra background work on those days when the inquiry did not sit, of which people who tuned in on television or read about the inquiry in newspapers may not have been aware.  Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch carried that burden on his shoulders admirably.<\/p><p>I thank the secretariat's staff and the legal investigators.  I got to know some of the latter well in the course of the report's final preparation when I was based in the inquiry's offices for a brief time.  They were a great team with which to work.  I thank my parliamentary assistant for the banking inquiry, Mr. Darragh McGreal, and my office, which also helped.  Much work was done by everyone.  I thank my colleagues on the inquiry for everything that they did, including putting up with me.  I might have been a bit schizophrenic at some of the private meetings depending on my mood and where I believed we were going.  It was great to work with everyone all the way to the end.  I have some nice memories of those moments when we were not in public session and worked together as colleagues on a big project.  I am glad to have them.<\/p><p>I also thank my constituents for their patience for the past 18 months in allowing me to do this work and be a parliamentarian.  I appreciate it.  I wanted to be on the inquiry.  What happened was part of the reason that I came home and got involved in politics.  I sought to be on the inquiry while I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Deputy O'Donnell and I prepared the report on how one might conduct an inquiry.  I was privileged to be appointed to it by the Taoiseach, for which I thank him.  I was appointed to the inquiry at a time when I was having questions about the effectiveness of the Oireachtas.  People have such questions, but the inquiry restored my faith in the Chamber, the people elected to it and the work that we do.  I underwent a great deal of professional development.<\/p><p>My view on a Leveson-style inquiry was similar to Deputy Michael McGrath's until we started our work.  The elected representatives of the Oireachtas had to do this.  If we did not, it would have been an abdication of our responsibilities and a loss.  It was political at times, but that was minimised.  We were not there to land a blow for the media.  As members of the media would always tell us privately after a meeting, we did not lay a hand on a witness, but that was not why we were there.  As some members of the public might say, no one is going to jail.  We were not there to replace the courts either.  We were there as a group of parliamentarians to do a serious piece of work and get on the record the testimony and evidence of the key people involved during the crisis period.  Let others judge.  We did this away from the <i>faux<\/i>theatrics that we sometimes see in the Chamber.  I had no doubt about the ability of each inquiry member to leave the party jersey at the door during the public sessions and do the work professionally.  Good work was done, good questions were asked and good evidence is there for those who want to take the time to read the transcripts.<\/p><p>I will make a recommendation on the future of inquiries.  We should focus our efforts on the public sessions, compelling the right witnesses, collecting documentation, examining and cross-examining.  Of course there must be reports, but they should be approached as additions to the work, not as attempts at summations.  If we are being honest with ourselves, this is where we started encountering difficulties.  We finished the public sessions and went off to try to summarise everything, but it was too much.  We had taken in more witnesses than we had intended, we had hundreds of hours of evidence and there were 500,000 pages of documentation.  Never could one do all of that justice in 400 pages.  A future inquiry should view a report as an addition rather than a summation, in particular given the constitutional constraints that we face.  There is no lack of will on the Parliament's part to give more powers to an inquiry or make it more effective.  Rather, the Constitution determines what we do.  We must be cognisant of that.<\/p><p>I acknowledge Senator O'Keeffe's work in getting the report published.  It would not have happened otherwise.  Everyone played a role in the final weeks and a heroic effort was made, but the Senator got this over the line.  I congratulate and thank her.  A fine report, it has been published across three volumes.  As Senator Barrett stated at a press conference yesterday, future PhDs will come from our work.  I hope so.  It will not be academic for its own sake.  Rather, this will be an opportunity for people to drill down outside the constraints of a D&aacute;il term or anything else and draw up further lessons and recommendations as well as more truths that we must face openly and honestly.<\/p><p>The failing of the banks was massive.  After all our work, I wonder whether they have learned their lesson, in particular when I see some of the current advertisements.  This is a worrying development.  As the Chairman mentioned, there is a belief that things are different this time.  One of the greatest failings of human nature is that we always think that this time it will be different and special, only to make the same mistakes.  It is a failure of imagination, as a playwright put it.  The problem during the crisis was the failure to comprehend what might be happening.  When dissenting voices were raised, they were ushered away because people did not want to hear them.  We could not imagine the kind of catastrophe that was coming.  This trend continued during the crisis and the attempts to assess the real damage to banks' portfolios, whether they needed bailouts, the requisite fiscal adjustment, the necessary interest rates, whether there should be burden sharing, etc.  When we view banking behaviour today, perhaps we can see this continuing.  That is a concern.<\/p><p>As Deputy Michael McGrath mentioned, there are not as many recommendations as we would have liked because of the constraints on the report, but it cannot sit on a shelf.  Too much time, money and resources have been invested and good recommendations made.  They may not be all of the recommendations that we need, but they should be implemented.  That will fall to the next Government, whoever that may be.  If I am re-elected to the House and have the opportunity to serve again, finding out what has been done with the recommendations and findings of the banking inquiry will be a bugbear of mine and a regular question to all officials and authorities.  There are key recommendations.  For example, the Central Bank's enforcement division has to appear before the Oireachtas committee.  Let us make the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council directly responsible to the Oireachtas.  Let us get independent oversight of the banking function in the Department of Finance.  Let us have a review of NAMA when its work is done.  Let us examine how the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, operates and what powers the Minister should or should not have over it.  All of these recommendations should be examined.  The inquiry gives us the impetus to do so, which I hope will carry through to the next Administration and every future Deputy.  As we start to plan for the future following the economy's recovery, the duty will fall to the 158 people elected to the House to scrutinise and pay attention to detail to a degree that was not the case previously.<\/p><p>A large part of what I wanted to do on the inquiry was examine the role of the Oireachtas and how the structure of its system might have failed to act as an adequate brake or check on Government behaviour.  This has formed a great deal of the work that I have done in the House to date.  We need to give space and motivation to parliamentarians to examine legislation, ask difficult questions, stay at committee meetings for long hours, chase up leads and go into detail.  Currently, the system does not give us this opportunity.  Many recommendations have been made across the parties as to how we can improve the Parliament and ensure that future finance committees, independent budget oversight offices, budget scrutiny committees and so forth can hold future Governments to the fire on key details.  The previous Government had a disregard for the Parliament, which was part of the reason I joined the D&aacute;il, but I do not want to move into the political space in this debate.  These lessons must be taken on board for the next D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>We were not able to tie together parts of the inquiry in the report as we might have liked.<\/p><p>Others may be able to do that.  As a committee, we were bound by very specific rules.  It was always curious to note the distance placed between officialdom and the NTMA at key moments in the crisis.  The NTMA was not placing deposits in Anglo Irish Bank but was made do so.  The NTMA was not represented on the domestic standing group in the initial stages.  It seems the NTMA was fully aware of the intended approach of the Government when it emerged there was a systemic crisis.  The NTMA was not involved in the negotiations on burden sharing at the 11th hour.  The NTMA was making calculations as to what might be achieved on burden sharing that seemed to be at odds with what the Department of Finance was pursuing at the end of 2010 and the beginning of 2011.  That stood out for me as a point of interest.  The NTMA, as an institution, is important; it is the nation's banker.  It acquitted itself excellently during the crisis through getting us back into the bond markets and back on our feet.  We cannot let any kind of institutional bias that may exist or have existed continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800029#BB00200","speaker":"1034","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453989300,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I thank my colleagues on the inquiry for their work and support over nearly two years.  I am aware of their incredible dedication and the work they all put into the process, at a significant cost to themselves in terms of time and commitment.  I thank the Chairman, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch, in particular not only for his work chairing the sessions, but also for the work he had to put in behind the scenes.  It was very interesting observing him for the past 18 months.  At times during the inquiry when tensions grew the odd time, he sometimes allowed them to explode and then picked just the right moment to intervene and point to the right direction.  There may be a lesson there for the Ceann Comhairle in the dying days of this D&aacute;il.  I commend the Chairman on his work.  Without his stewardship, we would not be in the position we are in today.<\/p><p>I wish to show my appreciation for the inquiry support team, the investigators, the administrative staff in Agriculture House and the legal team for the work they did.  Their work was tremendous and very much went unrecognised.  Some of them went through a very difficult time during the inquiry.  I thank, in particular, my own assistant, Mr. Conor McCabe, without whose support I would not have been able to be as inquisitive, put the right questions to those who appeared before the inquiry or strengthen a report I ultimately felt I could not support.<\/p><p>Seven years on from the night of the guarantee, it is important that we recognise when talking about the report that people are still paying for the decision.  The last of the treasury bonds set up to replace the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes are not due to expire until 2053.  People continue to suffer as a direct result of the causes of the crisis and the policy responses.  People wanted those at the helm to be held accountable for their actions.  That is what we attempted in the public hearings of the inquiry, which I believe were successful.<\/p><p>The report itself finally lays to rest the myth that &quot;We all partied&quot;, as was mentioned already.  The critical fault line in the loan books of the banking sector was in commercial property.  From 2000 to 2008, banks increased their lending from over &euro;100 billion to &euro;400 billion, with a heavy concentration on commercial real estate.  This was a very select business that was concentrated in the hands of a small number of individuals.  By September 2008, the top 25 customers in Irish Nationwide represented 51% of the its entire commercial loan book.<sup><\/sup>In Anglo Irish Bank, 20 customers accounted for 50% of the Irish loan book.  Just 190 people had debts of &euro;62 billion in the covered institutions.  This was not by accident.  It was core to the growth strategies of the banks, funded through credit sourced from the international wholesale markets.<\/p><p>Anglo Irish Bank was a monoline bank focusing almost exclusively on commercial property lending.  Irish Nationwide followed this strategy, with almost 85% of its loan portfolio centred on commercial property activity.  Soon both AIB and Bank of Ireland jumped in.  By 2008 in the Irish banking system, there were just 29 property developers with borrowings equivalent to 18% of Irish GDP.  That was of a direct result of bank lending policy, Government tax and planning policy, and Government regulation policy, which was light touch in the extreme.<\/p><p>The American academic Professor Ed Kane, who gave evidence to the inquiry, once said that the resolution of a crisis is often informed by a political and economic struggle over who pays for the losses, and that a crisis is defined by the battle over loss allocation.  The struggle over who should pay for the crisis is the defining event of our time.  It is felt in every town and village across the State.  It is also felt abroad in places where hundreds of thousands of our young people now reside, having been forced to emigrate as a result of the policies of the establishment parties.<\/p><p>The Irish people were told by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government that they had to carry the can for the banks and developers because, somehow, it was their fault for wanting to provide homes for their families.  The reality, however, is that the crisis was caused not by the masses but by the few.  It was caused by the lending and speculative activities of a tiny group of bankers and developers, spurred on by a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.  When the crisis revealed itself, that Government gave the banks and developers a blanket guarantee that led directly to Ireland's seeking of a bailout programme.  Will we hear an apology for the lie that we all partied?  I will not hold my breath.<\/p><p>While the report touches upon this cosy relationship between bankers, developers and politicians, it fails to examine those relationships in any critical way.  These relationships were raised by Professor Morgan Kelly in an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>in January 2009.  He criticised the Government&rsquo;s assertion that Anglo Irish Bank was worthy of a bailout.  He said the reality is that Anglo existed &quot;as a vehicle for a few politically connected individuals to place reckless bets on the commercial property market&quot;.  He stated:<\/p><blockquote>The proposed Anglo nationalisation marks a decisive watershed in Irish democracy.  With it, an Irish government has coolly looked its citizens in the eye and said: &ldquo;Sorry, but your priorities are not ours.&rdquo;<\/blockquote><p>This goes to the heart of how Ireland really works and whose interests the State serves when push comes to shove.  Addressing this was the whole purpose of the nexus phase of our inquiry.  Our terms of reference, set by this House, required that we critically analyse the links between banks, property and politics.  Unfortunately, it is a key aspect of this whole crisis that is all but missing in the report, which lists events and policy responses but does not analyse them in any meaningful way.  It has been explained why some of that analysis is missing, making reference to time constraints we were under.  The report merely presents a rationale for the key players' position and presents their viewpoint as the defining narrative of the crisis.  This is unacceptable and a fundamental failing in the report.<\/p><p>The report also fails to consider in any real way the operation of NAMA and whether its policies were appropriate.  NAMA was forced by the current Minister for Finance to reclaim a certain proportion of its bonds by a certain date and this led it to hold a fire sale of its commercial properties, yet we have seen an increase each year in the value of commercial property.  Last year alone, there was an increase in the value of commercial property of 21.7%.  However, that uplift is now in the hands of private speculators, not NAMA.  The real question we need to be asking ourselves is how many billions the State has lost by this fire-sale policy.  We do not know.  NAMA has now become a debt collection agency.  It has ceased to be an asset management agency.  This policy, initiated by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, was not analysed in the report.  There is absolutely no reflection in the report on the business strategy of NAMA and whether any lessons can or should be learned  from it.  Instead, we get the impression that NAMA is working away in the best interest of the State and that we can reflect on its policies only after it has finished its operations, or after the horses have bolted.  What is the point in that?  I refer again to our terms of reference. <\/p><p>The report does not deal in any substantive way with the liquidation of IBRC.  We all remember the famous &quot;prom night&quot; in this House.  Are we seriously to believe that there is no room for reflection on the actions presented at that time by the Minister for Finance?  The liquidation of IBRC fell within the terms of reference of the inquiry, but on that event the report is mostly silent.  With regard to burden sharing, the failure to pursue effectively this option imposed an immense cost on the Irish people in terms of crisis resolution.<\/p><p>In the run-up to the 2011 election, the current Minister for Finance told the Irish people that &quot;once Anglo ceases to have a bank licence, burden-sharing by its senior bondholders would become a reality as it would no longer be considered capable of having a contagion effect&quot;.  On 9 February 2011, weeks before the people went to the polls, the current Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, said the &quot;the junior, and senior, and non-guaranteed bondholders are going to have to pay the price&quot;.<\/p><p>However, within three weeks of its formation, the new Government ditched those election promises and adopted a policy that no senior bondholder would be left behind.  This was despite the fact that the banking inquiry uncovered that the National Treasury Management Agency had informed the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government at the time that the markets not only expected burden sharing but had priced it in.  We also know from the banking inquiry that the Minister for Finance made two telephone calls to Jean-Claude Trichet as part of the negotiations on the issue, on which he spent half of one day.  Despite the finding in the report, the Government ultimately had the power to impose or not to impose burden sharing on bondholders and it took the decision not to do so.  That the Minister spent one paltry afternoon on this issue and made only two telephone calls in connection with it shows the level of seriousness that he accorded the matter.<\/p> <p> The question we must ask ourselves is whether lessons have been learned.  One of the clear lessons for anyone reading the report is that the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government reduced sustainable tax levels and placed its hopes in unsustainable tax levels.  While affordable at the time, this approach was not affordable for the country in the long term.  The Government is promising exactly the same approach, with Fine Gael planning to cut taxes by &euro;22 billion and the Labour Party promising a version of the same thing.<\/p> <p> The Government has applauded the banking inquiry report and why not given that the boom and bust approach of cutting taxes to win votes pursued by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party is now Government policy.  On this issue, unfortunately, it has learned nothing from the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800030#CC00200","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453989900,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I thank my fellow members of the banking inquiry, the inquiry Chairman and its staff, including the external staff who were brought in to participate in the investigation.  The past 19 or 20 months have been interesting to say the least.  At times, it appeared a report would not be produced and the inquiry would not complete its work.  Thankfully, the report was published yesterday and I salute everyone involved in that endeavour.  The experience was among the most interesting periods in my 14 years in the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  One of the questions members of the banking inquiry were asked yesterday was whether a follow-up report would be necessary.  I do not know if that is the case but if I am in a position to do so, I will not immediately volunteer to take part.<\/p>  <p>  Having been involved in many Oireachtas committees, I was struck by the remarkable absence of party politics from the proceedings of the banking inquiry.  While there was much in the way of politics because virtually everything in life is political at some level, party politics were largely absent from the public hearings of the inquiry.  In that respect, I regret that my colleagues, Deputies Joe Higgins and Pearse Doherty, were not in a position to sign the inquiry's report.  Nevertheless, I understand most of their reasoning for not doing so.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty raised a point regarding evidence that was given by certain witnesses.  One of the binding and extremely frustrating circumstances in which members of the committee found themselves was that where four or five people gave an opinion of a particular event and one of them differed from the others, the inquiry did not have the power to adjudicate on who was right or wrong.  Members may have had personal views on the matter.  For this reason, I do not understand the argument made by Deputy Doherty as he will have known from the outset, as all members did, that the inquiry did not have the power to adjudicate in such circumstances.  I regret the more political tone in the Deputy's contribution.  It was a shame because he contributed as much, if not more, than many of the other 11 members, particularly in the inquiry's private meetings.  I suspect there were other political matters at play in his decision not to sign the report.<\/p>  <p>  Previous speakers addressed the major causes of the economic crash.  The Chairman of the banking inquiry, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch, spoke about the fiscal and banking crashes and noted that the two were interlinked.  The fiscal aspect of the crash is often overlooked and, as Deputy Lynch noted, the State became completely dependent on transient, temporary construction taxes for funding.  This was the fundamental reason for the large increase in the national debt and the burden imposed on people for the past seven or eight years.<\/p>  <p>  Many people, particularly in institutions that provided witnesses to the inquiry, promoted the theory of a soft landing for the economy.  However, none of the witnesses was able to present to the inquiry an example of a soft landing occurring anywhere else in the world.  Despite this, many people believed Ireland would be an exception and experience a soft landing.  Sadly, the opposite was the case.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear from the hearings of the banking committee that the boards and senior management of the financial institutions bore fundamental responsibility for the bank collapse.  They failed miserably in their primary responsibility to their shareholders who have been largely ignored in public comment.  Many people who had shares in banks were not well off but individuals who had put away a few bob for their retirement.  In many cases, their investment was completely wiped out.  We all meet people whose future was thrown into turmoil as a result of the collapse in bank share prices.  The boards and senior management of the banks bear full responsibility for this.<\/p>  <p>  On the external audit function, all of representatives of the external audit companies that appeared before the inquiry flagged the fact that their companies reported in accordance with the audit rules in place at the time.  They argued that the rules needed to be changed.  It remains the case, however, that all of the external audits, with the exception of one or two minor notes issued in the years immediately before the crisis, failed to flag any potential bubble, particularly in the commercial lending sector.<\/p>  <p>  On the matter of regulation, we managed to create a unique Irish solution to regulation, whereby we removed responsibility for regulation from the Central Bank and vested it in the Financial Regulator.  From the evidence provided by witnesses from both organisations, they appear to have been somewhat confused at times as to what their specific respective roles were with regard to regulation.  It became clear - in fairness to Deputy Pearse Doherty, his questions to the former Governor of the Central Bank elucidated this issue - that responsibility for maintaining overall financial stability came within the remit of the Central Bank, which failed to use its powers in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  It also became clear from the evidence of Mr. Bertie Ahern and Mr. Brian Cowen that they placed complete and absolute trust in the Financial Regulator in terms of how the process of regulation worked.  To find out that three people were responsible for the regulation of two of the biggest financial institutions in the country beggars belief.  In their evidence to the inquiry, Mr. Ahern and Mr. Cowen seemed to be as surprised by developments as everyone else, yet they were in charge of the Office of the Taoiseach and Department of Finance, respectively, when the so-called regulation was in place. <\/p>  <p>  Light touch regulation is the term often used to describe the system of regulation that operated in Ireland at the time.  Regulation seemed to be non-existent rather than light touch at times.  There was also an inherent contradiction in the legislation that established the Financial Regulator in that as well as having the responsibility to regulate, the Regulator was also given a designated responsibility to promote financial services in Ireland throughout the rest of the world.  While the legislation has been amended in this regard, this was an inherent contradiction.  The then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, referred in his evidence to an address he gave to a conference at which he was promoting Ireland as a country with light touch regulation and a location in which financial institutions should invest.<\/p>  <p>  Previous speakers referred to the role of the European Central Bank, ECB.  Representatives of the ECB should have appeared as witnesses before the banking inquiry and the bank did not proffer any proper reason for not doing so.  The failure of witnesses from the ECB to appear definitely curtailed the inquiry's ability to carry out its task fully because the ECB was a key player in the events surrounding the banking collapse in Ireland and further afield.<\/p>  <p>  I will briefly address four or five new issues that were uncovered by the banking inquiry.<\/p><p>The first is the Big Bang myth of the guarantee, in other words, the view that somehow the guarantee appeared out of nowhere in September 2008 and that there was no other option.  That was said many times in debates in this House and the other House.  I remember getting my half-hour slot at 5.30 a.m. in the Seanad to speak on the legislation following the guarantee.  I said that it made me sick to my stomach but that on the basis of the evidence given by the Minister and the officials I had to support it, although I opposed it personally.<\/p> <p> I was struck afterwards by one thing and I was reminded of it yesterday at the press conference.  I was very good friends with the late Brian Lenihan, a man who I admired very much.  He came up to me after the debate finished at 8 a.m. and said that he completely agreed with everything I said.  That was partly his manner, in the sense that he was a barrister and he could see every side of each argument.  However, it left me wondering something at the back of my head when Professor Honohan said during one of his first visits to the inquiry that he believed Brian Cowen had over-ruled Brian Lenihan.  I wondered whether that had been Brian Lenihan trying to tell me that he was in fact on my side of the argument and that he had doubts.  I wondered whether that was it or whether that was simply the way he conversed with people.  He was a man who probably had not slept for days at that stage and I can remember him being very tired.  Obviously, he was ill as well.  It is a pity for us that he was not before the inquiry, but more is the pity for his family and friends that he is not around anymore.  The guarantee was first talked about up to ten months before the guarantee night.  That was news.<\/p> <p> The fact that representatives from the National Treasury Management Agency were physically present in the building and yet not present in the room where a decision was made to put a potential liability of &euro;400 million on the backs of Irish taxpayers beggars belief.  None of the people in the room gave us any clear reason why that was the case.<\/p> <p> Some of the representatives of the banks present on the night obviously had worries about the future sustainability of the institutions.  The Bank of Ireland minutes that followed the inquiry show that they were talking about a possible taxpayer injection only weeks after the guarantee.<\/p> <p> The fact that the International Monetary Fund went as far as to bring Lee Buchheit, the international expert on debt restructuring, to Ireland to consider the option of burning senior bondholders was not known before the inquiry began its hearings.  On the whole, the inquiry, while flawed in its process and limited in what its members could do, has elucidated many new matters that Irish people did not know before the hearings took place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800031#DD00200","speaker":"966","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453990500,"counter":497,"content":"<p>There is one issue and only one issue on which I am in agreement with the majority of members of the banking inquiry committee.  This was that an extraordinary amount of work, research, personal stress and communal stress went into the workings of the committee, including the work by the personal staff of the members of the committee.  I wish to acknowledge warmly and appreciate the work of my colleague, Diana O'Dwyer, in that regard as well as the teams of public sector workers who did a vast amount of background work.  There is absolutely no issue with the amount of time and effort that went in.  However, there are serious issues with the conclusions of the committee majority.<\/p><p>Witness after witness came before the banking inquiry, including bankers, developers and others.  They spoke of the cutthroat competition that developed among themselves.  This, in turn, drove the reckless lending practices that inflated the property banking bubble and led to the economic crash.<\/p><p>One of the grandees of bubble banking who gave testimony, a former chairman of Allied Irish Banks, had evidence to the effect that his vast institution was aping Anglo Irish Bank because it was driving faster than AIB in lending to developers and increasing profits.  A former director of EBS, Eithne Tinney, herself a stern critic of many of the practices that went on, spoke about how there was a feeling within EBS that the Irish Nationwide Building Society was wiping their eye as it expanded its lending and began to post profits five times the size of the profits of EBS.  Those were her words.<\/p><p>What was the result of all of this?  Encapsulated in the figures given to the inquiry is the result.  The six banks that were eventually covered by the guarantee increased lending exponentially from &euro;120 billion in 2000 to almost &euro;400 billion by 2007.  They raked in &euro;25 billion in profits from 2002 to 2008.  They paid the six chief executives of those institutions an astounding &euro;71 million in salaries.  This was mirrored shortly afterwards in the disastrous &euro;65 billion that the bankers and banks lost in the crash.<\/p><p>A fundamental question remains and it is the source of my fundamental disagreement with the majority on the committee.  The question is not answered - it is not even asked.  How could a small cohort of bankers, bondholders and developers be allowed to wield such enormous economic power in pursuit of private corporate profit and in the process inflict incalculable economic and social destruction on society?  The second question is why the political establishment not only deferred to this cohort but in fact served their interests as they chased the maximisation of profit.  The political establishment of the day positively pushed the deregulation of the financial industries to allow the banks and the developers to do what they did.<\/p><p>In their speeches to banking federations and others, the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, and former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy and Mr. Cowen, laid it out clearly.  In March 2007 the then Taoiseach, Mr. Ahern, said to the financial services industry in New York: &quot;Our commitment to supporting foreign direct investment is absolute&quot; and &quot;Ireland is very lightly regulated compared with most of our European colleagues&quot;.  The then Minister for Finance, Mr. Cowen, lauded the type of derivative products that were being driven by the bankers in these terms: &quot;Increasingly sophisticated derivative products seem to be arriving daily as a sector seeks to become ever more professional in the way it manages and hedges its risks and chases after that elusive higher yield.&quot;  He was speaking to the Institute of Banking.  These were derivative products that the billionaire Warren Buffett described as time bombs and weapons of mass destruction.  The Minister, Mr. Cowen, went on to say:<\/p><blockquote>Of course, that&rsquo;s easy for me to say because you are players on the field and I&rsquo;m just an ardent supporter on the sidelines. I will continue to wear your colours.<\/blockquote><p>Mr. Cowen should be advised to watch the recently released movie &quot;The Big Short&quot;.  He would learn very quickly about the nature of the products for which he was praising the bankers.<\/p><p>My finding is this: extreme profiteering, driven by corporate greed, drove the property bubble and caused the crash.  The bubble Governments of the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, the then T&aacute;naiste, Ms Harney, and the then Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, served the interests of bankers and developers and not those of ordinary people.  Deputy Enda Kenny, who at the time had been the Fine Gael leader for five years, was a silent non-opposition figure in the field.<\/p><p>It is true the regulators failed disastrously, but they were merely following the political leadership of the State to which they were responsible.  Free reign was given to developers to speculate outrageously with the price of building land.  They ensured the price of a home for ordinary people increased fourfold in the space of ten years, shackling them to the horror of unsustainable mortgages and negative equity, a situation that many of these people are still in.  They were represented politically by the major parties of the day.<\/p><p>Seriously, the one finding of the majority of the committee in the area of property and all of this was that there should be a property register.  That is embarrassing.  What about controlling the price of building land and directing that its use should be subject to the needs of society rather than private profit?<\/p><p>Many people have asked me again and again why no one went to jail as a result the massive destruction caused to society by the cabal of bankers, bondholders and developers.<\/p><p>It is very simple.  The vast majority of what they did was legal because it was legislated for in this Chamber by a majority of the political parties.  They legislated to allow them to profiteer in the way that they did, which put the whole of our society at risk.  That is why they are not in jail.  The media is not asking any questions about its role and was let off the hook by the committee.  Significant sections of the media glamourised developers, bankers and their profiteering.  They called them the men with the Midas touch and said they turned everything they had into gold.<br\/><br\/>The 2007 property awards, sponsored by the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, embarrassingly gave the property deal of the year award to the Irish Glass Bottle Company, which cost the people hundreds of millions of euro.  Some five out of the seven award-winning developers at a glittering gala dinner sponsored by the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>were among the top ten debtors in NAMA.  The media did not just glamorise the sector; it was a player in the market and earned tens of millions of euro from developers, advertisements, etc.<br\/><br\/>If any lessons comes out of this disaster, surely it is that the provision of homes, the most basic human need of our people, and banking should not be the playthings and subject of profiteering by a small cabal of developers and bankers, but should be public services.  Therefore, let us put billions of euro into the creation of new, decent and modest homes for our people that workers on middle and lower incomes can afford to buy.  Social housing should be built for those who desperately need it.<br\/><br\/>The Minister, Deputy Noonan, should come to the House and explain why in March 2011 he did not come to the House, where we sat and waited for him, to announce that he would burn bondholders, something he intended to do.  He was interrupted on his way over here by a phone call from Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, who threatened him with a bomb in Dublin if the bondholders were burned.  The Minister came to the House, changed his speech and said nothing to the assembled ranks of the democratically elected people.  He was speaking on behalf of a supposedly sovereign Government which had been blackmailed in that way.  He should apologise for the fact he did not explain to us and the Irish people there and then that he was threatened in this way by a virtual economic and financial dictatorship.  They are some of my views on what we have done over the past year and a half.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800032#EE00200","speaker":"954","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453991100,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I want to thank the Chairman of the inquiry, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch, and the members of the committee for their hard work and dedication over the past year.  The work they have done has given a very good service to parliamentary democracy in Ireland.  I would like to single out my Labour Party colleague, Senator Susan O'Keeffe, as the only woman involved in the inquiry.  People said of Lehman Brothers that it only ever had brothers; there were no Lehman sisters.  It seems that in the case of the inquiry only the Labour Party, which also opposed the bank guarantee, was ready, willing and able to put forward a woman to serve alongside men on the inquiry on its behalf.<\/p>  <p>  A very important element of the inquiry, unlike previous ones, was that witnesses were met in public.  The people responsible for the destruction of the economy and the near-ruin of our State were brought into the glare of public scrutiny to answer questions that people wanted asked.  The IMF described the Irish banking crisis as the costliest crisis in advanced economies since at least the Great Depression.  It resulted in a &euro;64 billion bill for the taxpayer to recapitalise the banks.  It saw the economy collapse, with more than 300,000 people losing their jobs and unemployment soaring above 15%.  It bought the public finances to the point of bankruptcy.  The deficit reached an incredible level of over 30% of GDP in 2010 and public debt increased fourfold to over 120% of national income.  The result was the troika arriving into town on Fianna F&aacute;il's watch.  All of this was a far cry from the cheapest guarantee in the world so far, as described by the then Minister for Finance in 2008.  In fairness to the late Brian Lenihan, he was left grappling with a situation that his colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il had stoked for several years.  Nonetheless, the reality was catastrophic.  That is what the Labour Party and Fine Gael Government was elected to tackle.  The report describes in great detail the role of the many actors in this tragedy.  The banks, which abandoned any semblance of prudence, lent recklessly to the property sector, feeding a property bubble of historic proportions overseen by external auditors which adopted a \"See no evil, speak no evil\" approach.<\/p>  <p>  The regulator and Central Bank had sufficient powers to intervene, but chose a light-touch approach to regulation which, in effect, amounted, as we heard over the months and weeks of the evidence, to no regulation at all.  Overseeing all of this was the Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Government, which ignored all of the advice available to it and pursued policies that made the crisis many times worse.<\/p>  <p>  Property tax incentives fed and nurtured the bubble - the kind of tax breaks that I spoke out against time and again in this House.  The report notes the lost opportunity to mitigate or reduce the property bubble from 2003, when the Government failed to reduce or abolish property tax incentives as originally planned, although the then Minister for Finance established a review of these schemes in 2004.  By 2006, most were still in place and deadlines were still being extended.  Against the clear advice of officials, successive Fianna-F&aacute;il-led Governments doubled up on pro-cyclical policies and hollowed out the tax base, masking an enormous structural deficit in the public finances.  Over the ten budgets between 1999 and 2008, the contrast between the proposals in the June fiscal framework and the size of the tax and spending measures in the subsequent budget reveals the recklessness of their policies.  In only one year, 2003, was the size of the subsequent budget day measures less than recommended.  In that case the difference was marginal.  In 2001 and 2007, on the eve of the disaster, the gap was particularly shocking, with the size of budget measures almost double what was recommended.  I note that in 2011, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin apologised for the many disastrous mistakes Fianna F&aacute;il made in government.  The publication of this report and the debate today would be a timely occasion for Deputy Martin and his colleagues to repeat that apology, rather than conveniently develop amnesia about it.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il will say that it was chiefly a global crisis that caused our collapse, but what is particularly striking in the report is the dominance of domestic actors in propagating the crisis.  International events and actors played a role, and the weakness of external surveillance from international organisations such as the OECD and the IMF is notable.  However, in cases where clear warnings were given, such as the European Commission ruling on fiscal policy in 2001, they were ignored.<\/p>  <p>  The report is a survey and story of what happened.  The purpose of the report is to tell the story of what happened so that future historians, and possibly PhD students, will mine it for commentary on what brought our island down.  We now need to focus on what is helping Ireland to recover.  The schedule of loans and anticipated interest rates provided for when the troika came into town show that, for instance, last year we were expected to pay &euro;11 billion in interest on our borrowings.  In fact, the current Government reduced that suggested interest to less than &euro;7 million.<\/p><p>In opposition and during the run up to the last general election I advocated that probably the worst feature of the deal struck by Fianna F&aacute;il was the promissory note.  I was very happy in government that we were in a position to renegotiate that, put it out into very long-term loans, and provide for significantly reduced rates of interest.  The consequence of that has been billions of euro in savings for Ireland and for Irish people.<\/p> <p> The key issue is that of the 330,000 people who lost their jobs.  We now have 135,000 people back at work and modest stimulus into the domestic economy.  The result of that has been to see families and people on very low incomes such as the minimum wage getting small increases from 1 January this year.  For public servants, particularly lower paid public servants who bore significant wage cuts and tax increases imposed by Fianna F&aacute;il in 2009 and 2010, we have seen the beginning of a modest restoration as well as a reduction of the universal social charge, USC, the emergency additional income tax introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il at the height of the crisis.  Not only have people on low and middle incomes, up to &euro;70,000, seen their USC reduced in the last budget and again in this budget, we have also been able to remove 700,000 low paid workers from the USC net.<\/p> <p> We are now experiencing a recovery.  The principal aim of Government policy is to learn from the facts and figures set out in this report.  When Regling and Watson did their initial report into what went wrong in our banks, they said that while there were international elements to the crisis, it was very much a home-made crisis, and that happened on Fianna F&aacute;il's watch.  We now have a much reformed and improved system of regulation and it behoves us all to ensure that this regulation continues to operate as toughly as possible so that if difficulties arise in the future, the public institutions that regulate will be in a position to respond as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p> I compliment all the people who took part in the inquiry.  I know there have been many differences among the committee members in reaching a desired outcome.  I know that the work of the committee was restricted to some degree by very narrow legal guidelines but it is important to have this report, the documents and the information on the public record.  Many documents we never saw previously were brought out into the public domain.  In historical terms, that will be very important to future students and guardians of the regulation of banking and finance in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800033#FF00200","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453991700,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I begin by concurring with the T&aacute;naiste on just one aspect of what she had to say, that is, to extend all our thanks to those members of the committee of all parties and none who spent very considerable time holding the public hearings and sifting through the mountains of documents to produce this report.  I do not know if it will benefit them electorally but I believe it was a job well done and that it will benefit future generations of politicians, bankers, regulators and the public alike.<\/p>  <p>  The inquiry report provides a balanced account of the complex facts of the financial collapse.  It might not suit the T&aacute;naiste's agenda or the agenda of the Government generally to suggest that there were complex facts which led to the collapse, and subsequent recovery.  The report identified failures in banks, regulators, Government, politicians, and at a European level.  That was across all political parties, whether in government or in opposition.  I know the burden of responsibility must rest on the shoulders of those who were in power at the time, and that has been accepted by all concerned, but where the general thrust of debate and financial thinking was shared across the floor it would be of benefit to everybody if the T&aacute;naiste had the good grace to issue an apology, on behalf of her party, for the approach her party took and the kind of policies she and her party wanted pursued rather than demanding a repeat of an apology made in a heartfelt and clear way by the leader of my party.<\/p>  <p>  People have been able to watch the hearings and they will make up their own minds about what happened during the period, and who is to blame.  That was not something the committee had the powers to do, but the members of the public are well able to make their own decisions on that.  The boards and senior executives of banks must bear primary responsibility for the banking crisis, but the regulators should also have intervened, notwithstanding that the T&aacute;naiste used emotive language similar to \"on the watch of the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government.\"  Had the Government sought to interfere in the independence of the regulatory regime, she would have had something else to say about that, but she chooses to ignore the fundamental principles of the separation between independent regulators in government when it best fits a political agenda on the eve of an election.<\/p>  <p>  The inquiry found that the Government ensured that the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank both had sufficient powers to intervene in the banking sector to protect the financial stability of the State, but neither intervened decisively when required.  I am taken by the comments of my colleague on the inquiry, Deputy Michael McGrath, when he said that in many cases issues had been identified and paperwork generated but, very quickly, the trail ran cold.  There was no execution of appropriate penalties or implementation of sanctions.<\/p>  <p>  The Financial Regulator put in place sectoral lending limits to stop any bank becoming too exposed to the property sector, but when these rules were breached, the regulator did nothing.  In some cases, the response to a bank breaking its property sectoral lending  limit was for the regulator to just increase the limit.  That speaks volumes in terms of the light touch approach taken to regulation.<\/p>  <p>  The inquiry was reminded that ten out of 11 budgets before the crisis period were in surplus, but all politicians failed to look behind those fiscal surpluses to the underlying structure of the budget.  With the benefit of hindsight we can now see that permanent spending commitments were being made on the back of taxes from the property sector that proved to be unsustainable.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste fails to recognise that as an Opposition politician and, if my recollection serves me right, the Labour Party spokesperson on finance for a period at the time, she does not believe that her approach and that put forward by the Labour Party played any role in the crisis that developed.  That is fine, but I remind her again before she seeks a repetition of an apology that was made to consider apologising on the eve of the election for the mistruths that were proffered in advance of the last election where commitments were made by the Labour Party - I would have thought on her behalf as spokesperson on finance - by the then Labour leader when he said that it would be Labour's way, not Frankfurt's way when it came to dealing with such important matters as the burning of bondholders.  It is very clear that this Government, of which the T&aacute;naiste plays an integral role, failed absolutely in burning any bondholders, particularly within the senior ranks, over and above what had already been set out prior to her coming to office.  The indication was that if Labour was part of the Government, an entirely different approach would have been taken to dealing with Frankfurt or the ECB.  The truth is that there was no difference in the approach, and perhaps an apology for that would be appropriate at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  While she is considering an apology for that particular commitment, it might also be worthwhile apologising for the commitments that were made to the Irish people.<\/p><p>She said no water charges would be introduced by a Government of which the Labour Party would be part, and that no cuts would be made to social welfare, child benefit or maternity benefit, but very quickly these emerged.  Despite the commitments she made prior to entering Government, many of the cuts were delivered by her at the Department of Social Protection.  Before demanding the repeat of an apology I stated was given in a clear, concise and heartfelt way, the T&aacute;naiste would be very wise to consider her confession, even this late stage, before she faces the electorate.  I will await, I am sure with bated breath, her position on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800034#GG00200","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453992300,"counter":503,"content":"<p>You could do yourself harm.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800035#HH00200","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1453992300,"counter":504,"content":"<p>You suffered a bit of harm when you crossed swords with her.<\/p>  <p>  The recovery has been hard won, and credit should be given to Brian Lenihan for his achievements.  Ultimately, the national recovery plan brought the State finances back on track and set out the structure we needed for economic recovery.  It was interesting to hear Ajai Chopra of the IMF giving evidence at the banking inquiry that the current Government made no fundamental changes to the troika programme or Brian Lenihan's national recovery plan when it came to office, notwithstanding the commitments and some rewriting of history.  It had the benefit of coming into office in 2011, after the expiry of the guarantee and the negotiation of the troika programme, and with the benefit of the national recovery plan being in place.  The economic recovery over the past few years has taken place against this backdrop.<\/p>  <p>  As we face the electorate, it is now clear real benefits accrued to the State by the plan put in place, which was largely followed by the current Administration with some minor changes.  Lest we over-congratulate ourselves on the work we do here as we face into the election, a bit of common sense needs to come to the fore.  Absolute recognition must be given for the way in which the Irish people have accepted the difficult circumstances placed before them and for the way in which they have rolled up their sleeves and tried to get the economy back on track after the enormous collapse in the coffers of the State.  They have worked to the greatest extent possible to try to put Ireland back on track.  It would be wrong of any political colour, or any Member who is not in a political grouping, to try to take credit for it.  Without the support of the Irish people for the very difficult measures which had to be taken to put the economy back on track there would be no recovery.  Even at this, we have a considerable way to go.<\/p>  <p>  While a recovery is taking hold largely on the east coast and in the greater Dublin area, many communities outside of these areas are struggling to see any level of an increase in economic activity.  They are certainly burdened with some of the ravages thrown out as a result of the crisis.  I hope that whatever the colour or creed of the next administration, it will be in a position to put in place the fundamental building blocks of an economic recovery throughout the rest of the country in a fair and equitable way rather than to the benefit of those who are best off and who could see a recovery in their own finances based on the size of their income.  We must look to the people in the lower economic groupings, the people on middle to lower incomes, in an effort to support them for the support they have shown to the recovery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800035#HH00300","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1453992300,"counter":505,"content":"<p>D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann gave the members of the banking inquiry an almost impossible mission, given the constitutional and legal restrictions in which they had to operate.  We owe the Chairman, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch, and each member of the too large inquiry team a considerable debt for the remarkable effort, patience and diligence with which they discharged a very difficult responsibility.  They have done the State some service for which future economic historians will be grateful.  The DIRT inquiry remains the model for inquiry by parliamentary committee.  Only Deputy Durkan and myself are left standing from that experience, and we would be the first to say that the inquiry conducted by Deputy Lynch and his team was more complex, more extensive, more contentious and more problematic for several reasons.  For the Chairman to have navigated a completed report to dry land is a very considerable achievement.<\/p>  <p>  First out to criticise the report were those who dodged the hard work involved in the inquiry.  Bankers considered ideal a few years ago for the post of Central Bank Governor are now considered pariahs whom the inquiry let off too lightly.  I heard Deputy Donnelly on radio today starting a hare to run about the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  Sometimes when I hear Deputy Donnelly I think that perhaps all young Deputies in the House should get a few months in McKinsey and Company.  It does wonders for one's self-confidence, if not for one's economics or one's attendance at committee meetings.  In the 14 months during which I have been a member of the finance committee I recall seeing Deputy Donnelly twice.<\/p>  <p>  It is my impression that the legal advice available to the inquiry erred consistently on the side of caution, but if the inquiry members had spurned that advice the report would never have seen the light of day.  Indeed, it is very probable that the immensely valuable public hearings would have collapsed if some of the more simplistic criticisms had prevailed.  I will return to this critical issue of inquiry by parliamentary committee.<\/p>  <p>  Let us take as read the failure of the Central Bank, the incompetence of the Financial Regulator and the dereliction of duty and negligence of the Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Government.  The rot started in the banks.  The wild recklessness of Anglo Irish Bank was breathtaking, but how did two conservative banks which, in one guise or another, preceded the founding of the State itself go bust, losing money mainly in their core business of making loans in Ireland?  Every bank, Irish or foreign owned, got into serious trouble and had to be rescued by the Irish State or by foreign parent banks.  Anglo and Nationwide lost a mind-boggling eight to ten times their capital.  There is a wide variation in the scale of the losses.  In terms of loan losses, AIB seems to have been three or four times worse than the similar sized Bank of Ireland.  The business model of the two banks was and is similar.  One building society, Irish Nationwide, was much worse than another, EBS.<\/p>  <p>  I do not yet know if the voluminous back-up papers explain these discrepancies or if there is a bank by bank scrutiny into the sources of these wide variations.  Whereas all of the banks were mismanaged, some were recklessly mismanaged to a degree that defies understanding.  It must be the case that individual banks did their own investigations of the sources of the disaster.  Were these analyses furnished to the inquiry?  If not, it is a failure of accountability on the part of the banks and I presume the modern Central Bank has the authority to demand production of these reports.<\/p>  <p>  D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann cannot signal approval for the cavalier treatment of the inquiry by the ECB.  Given the flaws exposed in the ECB's own architecture, is it acceptable that an occasional appearance in the European Parliament is the only gesture to accountability?<\/p>  <p>  The Government of which I was a member was resolved that there should be burden sharing and we had quantified the value of it.  The NTMA estimated, as contained in the memo of 28 March 2011 in the appendices to the report, the financial benefit to the Irish Exchequer at &euro;14.9 billion.  The savings made in respect of subordinated bondholders means that the net cost of the ECB veto to the Irish Exchequer was in excess of &euro;9 billion.  This was the second occasion on which the ECB stopped a sovereign Irish Government from imposing haircuts on holders of unsecured and unguaranteed bonds issued by banks which necessitated recapitalisation at public expense.<\/p><p>The inquiry is clear that the ECB threatened on both occasions to withdraw approval for emergency liquidity assistance to the Irish banks unless the bondholders were paid in full, which would have shut down our entire banking system.  Ajai Chopra of the IMF rejected in his testimony the proposition advanced by the ECB president that haircuts to senior bondholders in Ireland would cause contagion to eurozone markets in senior bank bonds.  Subsequent experience in Cyprus, Italy and Portugal would seem to bear out Mr. Chopra's view and, of course, in the bank resolution and recovery directive, burden-sharing is now expressly contemplated.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Trichet's diktat was punitive for Ireland, but the question of whether the ECB had the legal authority to impose arbitrary costs on the Irish Exchequer in pursuit of broader eurozone objectives remains.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>reported in December that the inquiry team wished to recommend that the Government sue the ECB for damages over its actions in 2010 and 2011 but were prevented from so recommending by the inquiry's own lawyers.  If that is so, it seems to be an unnecessary intrusion into the domain of politics.  Whether an Irish Government should use its statutory entitlement to seek judicial review at the European Court of the actions of an EU institution is a political matter and one that I hope the next Government will consider.<br\/><br\/>This may be the last working day of the 31st D&aacute;il.  It is the last time I will address D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  It has been a unique privilege to have been elected to this House by the people of Dublin South-West in six successive general elections, and I would like to thank those who worked with me here and outside.  I did not envisage that my final remarks would concern a banking and fiscal collapse that constituted an existential crisis for the State itself.  Thanks to the work of Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch and his colleagues, economic historians and others will be able to study the lessons to be learned.<br\/><br\/>I remain convinced that any parliament that does not have the right of inquiry by parliamentary committee into legitimate matters of public interest is a diminished parliament.  Properly organised and conducted, it is a natural extension of parliamentary oversight and would improve the performance of Government.  Following the failure of the referendum, repeated experience of the costly and slow public inquiry system under the 1921 Act and the difficulties latterly encountered under the Commission of Investigations Act, we have now reached an impasse.  What is so unique about our jurisprudence that makes impossible here a form of hearing that is routine in so many other settled parliamentary democracies?  Unless we frame another amendment and return to the people, we can never have an inquiry in which there is an adjudicatory finding upon the conduct of a person who was not a Minister, a holder of other constitutional office or a Member of the Oireachtas.  The difficulty, therefore, as shown by today's report, is that there is no clear demarcation between an inquiry into policy and an inquiry into culpability.  By &quot;adjudication&quot; I mean a simple finding of fact, without any legal effect, whose impact is solely on the reputation of an individual.  I draw to the attention of the House the remarks of the retiring President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Nicky Kearns, when he said in December that &quot;judges and courts should not be excessively overactive or interventionist in areas where the boundaries of the judicial and executive function intersect&quot;.  Mr. Justice Kearns acknowledged that many commentators now seemed to feel successive court interventions had &quot;virtually paralysed&quot;  the investigatory process &quot;where accountability for matters of serious public concern is required&quot;.  The courts, he said, &quot;should never put themselves in the position of realising, all too late, that a particular decision has opened a Pandora's box of unintended consequences&quot;.<br\/><br\/>In his dissenting judgement in the Abbeylara case, then Chief Justice Keane delivered his understanding of Irish law:<\/p><blockquote>The power of the Oireachtas to conduct investigations is inherent in the legislative process. That power is broad. It encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws [and] defects in our social, economic or political system for the purpose of enabling the Oireachtas to remedy them.<\/blockquote><p>That was the view of the then Chief Justice and I believe, notwithstanding what happened in the referendum, that the next Government should take its courage in its hands, reframe an amendment and go back to the people.  It would strengthen the functioning of this Parliament.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800035#HH00400","speaker":"947","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453992900,"counter":507,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800036#JJ00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1453992900,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I never got applause like that before when I was in a different position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800036#JJ00300","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1453992900,"counter":509,"content":"<p>Gu&iacute;m gach rath ar an Teachta Rabbitte.

This is where I feel the report has its drawbacks. One of the key findings of the report was that &ldquo;[b]ank failure, which required the intervention and support of the sovereign, was the responsibility of senior executive management and the boards of directors&rdquo;.  This is true; the bank boards had ultimate responsibility for their lending practices, yet they have spent the past seven years blaming everyone and everything around them, while at the same time getting the Irish people to pay for their mistakes.  With this finding in mind, what does the report suggest as a possible solution?  What we get is this: &ldquo;All members of bank boards should have the requisite financial skills set and experience and should undergo ongoing compulsory Continuing Professional Development (CPD) appropriate to banking, to include risk and governance.&rdquo;  Are the authors of this report seriously suggesting that the solution to the structural problems in Irish banking at a board level are to be tackled with a training course?  Is the report telling us the fundamental problems with Irish bank boards can be solved with a weekend in the country and a PowerPoint presentation?  There is a serious paucity of vision here.<\/p>  <p>  Let us be clear: this crisis was caused by a vicious circle of reckless property speculation by developers.  This was facilitated by unsustainable lending by banks that were poorly policed by a financial regulator that was intentionally created with insufficient powers and resources by a political class that was itself beholden to those developers.  The abandonment of prudential lending practices by banks&rsquo; senior executives was reinforced by board-level groupthink.  This, in turn, fuelled a race-to-the-bottom mentality, which put pressure on others to match the unsustainable terms offered by competitors.  The pursuit of reckless lending was justified by the requirement to maximise shareholder value, even though this was not in the long-term interest of the business.  There was a change in culture of banking away from service to customers and towards meeting arbitrary sales targets.  This culture change was reinforced by a shift from basic pay to performance-related pay and bonuses within salary structures.  On what planet can these issues be resolved with a PowerPoint presentation and a certificate?  Serious and practical measures need to be implemented.  For example, boards need to act in the long-term interest of the bank rather than pursuing the short-term maximisation of shareholder interest.  The regulator should consider governance structures.  There is a need to expand representation on bank boards to people such as community representatives and employee representatives.  This would reflect and recognise the broader and social role of financial institutions, not just the commercial role they are involved with at the moment.<\/p><p>The regulator should lead a major review into the culture of banking which would include consideration of how the structure of remuneration within the financial services sector affects its actions, especially the services delivered to customers.  This review should involve employers and unions.  They should recommend appropriate balance between basic pay and incentives.  If the Government were serious about reforming the banking sector, it would legislate for banks to act in their own interests for the long-term objectives and also in the interests of the communities they are supposed to serve.<\/p> <p> The report concludes that it was commercial property speculation that ultimately led to the failure of the Irish banking system.  This activity, of course, was not only assigned to Ireland - Irish banks were funding British projects as well as ones here - and yet the sole recommendation in this report is that \"A detailed and comprehensive commercial property price register should be introduced.\"  Obviously, I welcome this, but how would such a register deal with the issue of Irish banks funding Irish developers for projects abroad?  Approximately 40% of the value of the loans transferred to NAMA related to properties outside of the Twenty-six Counties.  How would the register deal with any of that?  Furthermore, a price register is not regulation.  There is a fundamental need for clear and direct oversight of the property sector.  It is incredible that an inquiry can find the commercial property sector directly responsible for the crisis and yet offer no recommendations whatsoever with regard to reform or regulation of that sector.  Neither does it offer any ideas for reform or regulation of the oversight of lending in that sector.  The authors of the report cannot blame the terms of reference for this.  It is a true and sad reflection that in this world it is still seen to be necessary to tug the forelock to the bank.<\/p> <p> Between 2008 and 2013, real political power in Irish society revealed itself in a way that had not been seen for decades.  The scale and depth of the crisis made it impossible for the nature of the influence that existed in that nexus to remain below the radar.  The crisis brought clarity to the focus of the State's economic and political system.  What we saw in that period were the consequences of the empowerment of financial dealers and commercial property developers aided and abetted by mainstream political parties which were unable or unwilling to see an alternative to that process.  The unprecedented use of credit sourced from global financial markets from the mid-1990s formed a fuel for that nexus of power and influence and that had a devastating consequence for everybody living in this State.  At the same time, all the social and economic myths that were built up during that period that Ireland was a prosperous land and a classless society simply vanished before our eyes.  Instead, business interests, concentrated mainly on financial administration and property speculation, used the full power of the State to protect themselves from their own decisions and strategies.  Those individuals, who had sat for decades and reaped and creamed the profits of Irish society, literally looked around the room at each other and said, \"Who is going to pay for this?  It will not be us.  It will be Irish society who will pay for it.\"  The manifestation of that is that we pay &euro;7.1 billion in interest on the debt of the State.  The education budget amounts to &euro;8 billion.  That is a phenomenal amount of money.  Considering the existing infrastructural deficits, the health deficits and the education and housing deficits in the State, the hangover of the decisions made by that nexus of power will affect this generation and the generations to come.  It will mean a reduction in opportunity for these individuals as they go about their lives.  In some cases, it will mean people losing their lives.  In some cases, it will mean people not having proper housing in which to live.  It will mean that people will not attain the academic or educational opportunities that would help them fulfil their potential in society.  The nexus element of the report is a major weakness.<\/p> <p> If one looks at the State today and sees what has happened with NAMA and the fact there are investigations in NAMA, the FBI is involved in an investigation in Britain and we have the fraud squad but, unfortunately, no investigation here - if any Member has any information, he or she can give it to the Committee of Public Accounts, PAC - and one sees IBRC, where there have been billions of euro of write-down landing in the pockets of individuals who have been major benefactors of Fine Gael, it is clear therefore that nexus power has not yet finished.  Obviously, the democratic deficit within the State did not begin in 2008, but the crisis brought it into sharp focus.  It is up to our generation to learn from that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800036#JJ00400","speaker":"1080","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453993500,"counter":511,"content":"<p>With the permission of the House, I wish to share time with Deputy Donnelly.<\/p>  <p>  This debate marks the departure, and possibly the last speeches and contributions, of two of the most eloquent Members of this House that I can remember.  Deputy Higgins's contribution to the banking inquiry was unmatched.  His contributions to the workings of this House over the years - many of which, of course, many of us have disagreed with but which have been utterly honourable and well thought-out - have been elegant, and his dedication to his constituents and his own ideals has been uncompromising and utterly admirable in the history of this House and very unusual.  The speech made by Deputy Rabbitte, which was also his farewell speech, was consistent with his long history of, as Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n stated, raising debate here onto a higher plane.  Indeed, some of his successors might take that into account.  He has done the State a great deal of service and his final contribution was also a great credit to him.  It is right that I would say that.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, I disagree with almost everything Deputy Rabbitte said in his speech but that does not in any way detract from what I said earlier.  When he said that any parliament that does not have the right of proper inquiry - as this one was not - is a diminished parliament, he was correct.  D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is a diminished House.  However, the Deputy ought to ask why it is a diminished House.  The people decided that the Members of this House in their wisdom were not fit to carry out an inquiry of the sort that perhaps they would have wished.  That is an honourable decision.  It is a decision we should respect.  It is a reflection on who is sovereign and on the low esteem into which this House has sunk as a result of its failure to reform.  We should take cognisance of that and not merely state that we should go back to the people and have another referendum.<\/p>  <p>  As a result, the inquiry chaired by Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch - I share the tributes to their hard work, not to their findings - was utterly hamstrung in what it could produce.  As I said yesterday, the result of this was that the happiest people in Ireland yesterday and today are those who were being or were meant to be asked the hard questions.  When I look at this report, at the reaction and at the leaks, I realise that, far from putting in the dark or on the defensive those who were asked the questions, the report is a get-out-of-jail card for the bankers.  The bankers are the ones rejoicing because this report could not find any fault with them.  They could come in, answer the questions and, in effect, get a clean bill of health because no finding of fact could be made against them.  The same is true of the developers, the auditors, the consultants and, indeed, individually, the regulators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016012800037#KK00200","speaker":"953"}]
