In addition, it is the primary funding authority for Irish universities, institutes of technology, teacher training colleges and a number of other designated education bodies.  Approximately 90% of the HEA's income in 2016 came directly from Vote 26, Education and Skills, with the balance, largely consisting of research funding, from Vote 32, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The HEA had gross expenditure of &euro;1.15 billion in 2016.  The bulk of this comprised grants to higher education bodies for specified purposes, including current spending, research, and capital project funding.  I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the HEA's 2016 financial statements.<\/p> <p>  In 2015 and 2016, UCC recognised total income of &euro;346 million.  The university reported a modest surplus for the year of &euro;562,000.  As in prior years, my audit opinion in respect of the UCC financial statements was qualified in respect of the recognition of a portion of the future pension funding receivable from the State.  The root of the issue is that UCC awards professional added years for pension purposes to certain academic staff members on a different basis to that approved by the Ministers for Education and Skills and Finance under relevant legislation enacted in 2009.  As at 30 September 2016, the university was in disagreement with the Department of Education and Skills as to where responsibility lies for pension liabilities relating to transferred-in service.  The university estimated the total future cost of the disputed pension benefits at &euro;15.7 million and included this amount in its deferred pension funding asset.  I concluded that the recognition of the &euro;15.7 million asset as at the end of September 2016 was not in accordance with applicable accounting standards because of the disagreement with the Department at that date.<\/p><p>An agreement was subsequently reached between the university and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, on shared funding of the disputed future liabilities.  This will be reflected in future financial statements.<\/p><p> The audit certificate draws attention to the non-consolidation of the results of Cork University Foundation DAC on the basis that the foundation is not controlled by the university.  On 30 September 2016 the foundation had accumulated reserves of &euro;4.1 million.  Note 31 to the consolidated financial statements provides information on transactions between the university and the foundation.  Members will recall that the university has recently informed the committee of its intention to provide a full set of the foundation's financial statements, with the consolidated financial statements in future years.<\/p><p> The audit certificate also draws attention to disclosures in the university's statement of governance and internal control of instances of non-compliance with national procurement guidelines.  Reported non-compliant procurement to the value of &euro;4.4 million comprised &euro;3.9 million of spending identified by the university as being non-compliant and a further &euro;500,000 identified through audit testing.<\/p><p> The financial statements for Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, for the year ending 31 August 2016 indicate that consolidated income for the year amounted to nearly &euro;100 million.  State grant funding accounted for over &euro;38 million of this figure.  The other major sources of income were tuition fees and research grants.  Expenditure in the year was just over &euro;99 million, nearly 70% of which was accounted for by staff costs.  The net result for the year was a surplus of &euro;721,000.  Members will recall that there are two public private partnership, PPP, arrangements in place for buildings used by Cork Institute of Technology, namely, the Cork School of Music and the National Maritime College of Ireland.  The annual payments made to the two PPP companies are a direct charge on Vote 26.  They do not pass through the accounts of CIT.<\/p><p> My audit opinion for 2015-16 was unqualified.  However, the audit certificate draws attention to the fact that the institute did not provide for accrued pension liabilities under either the single public service pension scheme or the education sector superannuation scheme 2015.  The same was true of all other institutes of technology for 2015-16.  The audit certificate also notes that the Department of Education and Skills sought legal advice on the matter.  In October 2017 my office wrote to the presidents of all of the institutes of technology recommending that they commence accounting for pension liabilities in their financial statements for 2016-17.  I understand the Technological Higher Education Association, the representative body for institutes of technology, has procured the services of an actuary to carry out the necessary calculations.  It is expected that all 2016-17 financial statements will account in full for pension liabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018052400002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527148800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General.

I am accompanied by my colleagues, Mr. Tim Conlon, interim head of system development and performance management; Ms Sheena Duffy, interim head of system funding and governance; and Mr. Stewart Roche, management accountant.<\/p> <p>  Every year the Higher Education Authority, HEA, allocates and distributes over &euro;1 billion in funding across a range of funding streams to the higher education sector.  As this is a major responsibility for an agency likes ours, I am happy to note that the HEA's financial statements for 2016 were signed by the Comptroller and Auditor General in June 2017 with no issues arising.  Our draft 2017 statements have also recently been audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and we are addressing follow-up queries.  Today the committee will also discuss CIT's and UCC's financial statements.  Our briefing paper addresses several issues related to these two institutions.  I will be happy to provide further details of the HEA's engagement on these matters.  The briefing paper also sets out other developments related to the higher education sector that are of interest to the committee.<\/p> <p>  The HEA continues to monitor University of Limerick's implementation of the recommendations arising from the Thorn report.  It also engages with the university on how it is demonstrating to its staff, students, stakeholders and wider community its commitment to learning from the report and its findings.  The HEA continues to fulfil its governance role through its rolling governance reviews.  The first such review dealt with procurement and resulted in positive engagement with the sector, as well as key stakeholders such as the Office of Government Procurement and the Education Procurement Service.  It has culminated in annual higher education procurement summits, most recently last month, and the introduction of a corporate procurement plan pack for institutions to adapt.<\/p> <p>  The second review dealt with intellectual property policies and arose directly from the engagement of the Committee of Public Accounts with the HEA and the higher education sector.  This has been a valuable exercise, with important recommendations being implemented.  This year's rolling reviews will focus on staff remuneration and benefits, as well as student non-progression.<\/p> <p>  In 2017 the committee had a productive engagement with the higher education sector on the timeliness of financial reporting.  A clear message was sent to the HEA and the institutions we fund on the importance of preparing and submitting financial statements promptly.  Previous delays inevitably had a knock-on effect.  However, the HEA notes the improvements made, as reflected in the Comptroller and Auditor General's most recent report on public sector financial reporting.  I again acknowledge the constructive engagement we have had with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General on these matters.<\/p> <p>  Since the HEA last appeared before the committee there have been several important developments in the higher education sector.  On an operational level, the review of the funding model for higher education institutions was published.  It will introduce important changes to the way in which the HEA allocates funding and seeks to incentivise institutions to target growth areas such as STEM subjects, lifelong, part-time and flexible learning.  It also proposes the introduction of a financial penalty for serious breaches of governance by institutions.<\/p> <p>  On a wider strategic level, earlier this year the system performance framework for the period 2018 to 2020 was launched, with its focus on six key system objectives, ranging from meeting Ireland's skills requirements, improving equality of opportunity and improvements in governance.  A key element is the next cycle of strategic dialogue with higher education institutions, whereby institutions' performance will be measured against these key objectives for the higher education system.<\/p> <p>  This year has seen the passing into law of the technological universities legalisation.  This is an exciting step in the future of higher education which builds on the strengths and original missions of institutes of technology and also enhances their regional, national and international impact.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the role of the Committee of Public Accounts in its scrutiny of higher education matters.  Last year's meetings with the HEA and institutions were robust and frank but also useful in bringing matters to the fore.  The HEA sees the committee not only, rightly, as a watchdog but also a partner in improving governance and accountability in the higher education sector.  This is a relationship that I, as chief executive of the HEA, believe it is important to continue to develop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018052400002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Graham Love"},{"type":"speech","time":1527148800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>We will take the opening statements of Professor Patrick O'Shea and Dr. Barry O'Connor as read.

Back in 2010, the university, for these staff, had the liability and the asset.  We had both the liability to pay lump sums and pensions and we had the asset.  In 2010, the five universities that had that scheme transferred their pension asset of &euro;1.2 billion to the State and with that came a commitment that when those people retired, the liability going with that asset would be underpinned by a State asset - if the university gave away the money, the State would pay for that.<\/p> <p>  When the people retired, there was a dispute subsequently about elements of added years.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has pointed out in his opening statement how added years were assessed by the State differed from how the pension scheme, which was underpinned by statute, had operated in UCC and the commitment was given that people's entitlements would be honoured in return for the transfer of the asset.  We had an assessment, and a view, that it was the State's liability to fund those people given that it took the fund.  The State disputed that but, as we have said in the answer to the first part of the question, we have reached agreement on that.

To the students and the public that might seem strange, but I think I have set it in the right context.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make a comment to UCC.  We received its letter on the Opera House, and I know the Chairman has a similar opinion to me.  The decision to do a deal with the Opera House was part of our findings with regard to the committee's interim report into the issue of non-taxpayer revenue being isolated as if it were a revenue in itself.  The Committee of Public Accounts has stated quite clearly we do not buy that line.  This is for all colleges, universities and third level institutes.<\/p> <p>  We have gone back and forward with UCC on number of occasions.  The cost of &euro;500,000 was stated as non-taxpayer revenue and this is reaffirmed in the letter, which states an own source of university income is supporting the partnership.  It is not.  Let us kill this right now for once and for all.  It is not a distinguishable income.  It all goes into the pot and the taxpayer is proportionately paying for signage over the Opera House.  Our question is whether we feel this is a good use of public money.  Personally, I do not think so.  An alliance with Cork Opera House yes, but not paying for signage over it.  Please do not ever write back again and state what was said here and repeat it in the press because we do not accept it.  We cannot be any clearer.  The college can argue it and that is fine, but with regard to what we have decided here, this is a use of taxpayers' money.  If the college did not have the taxpayers' money in the first place it would not be in a position to do it and that is obvious.  Let us nail that.  That goes for all third level institutions, and UCC is not unique to be fair to it.  This is just a comment and I do not want an answer.<\/p> <p>  I want to get onto the purchase of Grand Parade in Cork by CIT.  When we were here before discussing this we were told it paid &euro;1.25 million.  On 17 June we were not told how much it would cost to upgrade the building, yet a few weeks later the scaffolding went up.  I have pictures of it.  Why at that committee meeting did CIT not tell us about the extra costs that would be part of doing up the building and bringing it up to a certain standard?  The overall costs for this building are way in excess of what CIT paid and presumably it will come in at &euro;2.5 million rather than &euro;1 million.  Why did it not reveal this information to us, considering the many companies that were on site down there in a matter of weeks?  The contracts for those companies must have been signed before CIT appeared before the committee.  Why was that information not given to us at that meeting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018052400002#M03000","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527148800,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I was not in my position at that point in time but I-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018052400002#M03100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Barry O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1527148800,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Mr. Gallagher was there at the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018052400002#M03200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527148800,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I do believe the information has subsequently been supplied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018052400002#M03300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Barry O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1527148800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Why did the college not tell the committee that information, of which it was aware?

The governing body was established under the Act.  External bodies make nominations to the governing body.  The only member of the executive on the governing body is the president.  There are two staff members from the academic community, one non-academic staff member and two student members.  Everyone else on the governing body is external.  Once the governing body is established - it was last done in March 2015 - committees are established of members of the governing body.  A finance committee was established, but there was nobody on the governing body with an accounting qualification.  Following a self-evaluation review, it was decided that the membership should be strengthened.

We are speaking specifically about CIT which has a turnover of &euro;100 million per annum, but my comment applies to the third level sector generally.  In the context of corporate governance, it is shocking that we have boards and governing bodies in place in the sector that do not have financial competence.  That might be the fault of the legislation, but it is shocking.  I am looking at the accounts of CIT which were signed by the then chairman and president.  The accounts refer to their responsibility to select the accounting policies.  This is an issue that deserves further scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General too.  It is extraordinary that we have chairmen and presidents of governing bodies which, by and large, do not have members with any financial competence who are putting their names to statements to the effect that they have selected suitable accounting policies; made judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; prepared financial statements on a going concern basis, unless the principle is inappropriate; and disclosed and explained all material departures from acceptable accounting standards.  I safely say, based on what the witnesses have said, that the people who signed such statements have no understanding whatsoever of what they have signed.  In effect, they have signed a blank cheque, although I accept that the accounts are audited.  I am not talking about the accuracy of the accounts because the Comptroller and Auditor General audits them.  Yesterday we were discussing the issue of corporate governance, the submission of accounts and the fact that accounts were being submitted late.  Now we are discussing the fact that we have governing bodies and boards of directors of State bodies, some of which have accounts running into the hundreds of millions of euro, which lack financial competence.  I know that such competence can be hired in, but it should be part of the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018052400002#O02200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527148800,"counter":208,"content":"<p>We also have an audit and risk committee.

It is amazing on what the money is spent and the amount spent.  That raises questions about what the hell the HEA is doing and what its role is in all of this.  For example, there was a feasibility study of experimental sheep research for a project, at a cost of &euro;131,000, for the academic year 2012-13.  Other spending included a sum of &euro;65,000 on PR for CIT.

It is critical to see it in the context of the spend across the institutions over that seven or eight year period - not as a justification in itself, but if the Deputy remembers, the expenditure across the institutions over that period was probably somewhere between &euro;12 billion and &euro;15 billion.<\/p> <p>  At times they will need additional skill sets that are not available in their institution; we have just heard of an example.

It made an interesting point that insufficient feedback from the governing body and a lack of awareness within the institute of the purpose of the risk register could result in a lack of buy-in.

It is black and white.  If there is an allegation against me, I need to be 100 miles away from the investigation other than when the independent investigator comes to me to ask me questions about it.  Why did KPMG consult the executive only?  Why did it not conduct wholesale interviews across a random selection of staff to see if any of these things stands up?  It did not do so.  According to a letter on this issue that was sent by Bob Savage after the draft report, KPMG undertook further review work and consulted the executive for a number of weeks.  The executive is telling us it was the subject of numerous allegations.  This entire process is flawed.  I suggest to the HEA and the Department that they should tear up the flawed guidance they have because it asks the fox to investigate the incident that resulted in the chickens being eaten.  That is not real, appropriate, authentic or credible.  In fact, it makes clowns out of everybody associated with this process, including those of us who are trying to ask questions.  This is not personal and it is without prejudice.  Maybe all of these allegations were totally vexatious.  The credible and professional names that are associated with the report which has been carried out - I refer to KPMG, legal firms and so on - are selling themselves short by being associated with a process that was such as shambles.  I suggest to the HEA and the Department that their guidance is laughable and wide open to accusations of containment and of enabling the process to be internally managed to ensure the truth is suppressed in the interests of protecting an individual, a group of individuals or an institution.  Frankly, it plays completely into the credible accusation, which this committee has seen more than most, that those who want to be whistleblowers need to be prepared to be portrayed as villains and crooks and to be thrown under the bus.

As we know, a lot of this has been outsourced to other organisations and we asked what the procedure was and whether everybody goes and does their own outsourcing.  The Office of Government Procurement says it has a procurement framework which came into effect on 11 April this year, only the other day.  That is now being sent to all Government bodies in respect of outsourcing of these issues.<\/p> <p>  There are three framework agreements that can be put in place.  If the witnesses have not read the guidelines yet, they are on their way to them now.  They should have read them last week.  One framework agreement says that for the provision of third-party confidential recipient services pursuant to section 6 of the Protected Disclosures Act, an organisation that might not be big enough to have somebody independent internally can designate a third-party confidential recipient and there is a framework in place in respect of the procurement of that particular service.<\/p> <p>  There is a separate service that is provided for under this framework to say that an organisation can have a procurement service in respect of the full investigative services into an alleged wrongdoing purported to be disclosed under the Protected Disclosures Act including a review of such services.  That allows an organisation to have a person not just act as a confidential recipient but also investigate the alleged wrongdoing independent of the organisation.<\/p> <p>  The third framework procurement contract that is now in place is for full investigative services of allegations of penalisation or adverse treatment as a result of having made a disclosure of wrongdoing, or where such a disclosure is purported to have been made, pursuant to the Act, and for review of such investigations.  In the event that somebody feels they have been penalised as a result of making a disclosure or a purported disclosure - I stress that there is a presumption in the Act that a disclosure is a protected disclosure - this allows for a framework to be put in place and independently procured in line with Government procurement.<\/p> <p>  There are three separate contracts now available and that is part of the issue we have been processing here.  We felt the thing was not working and were putting the onus on DPER.  It is up to the Department at national level to get this protected disclosures legislation working across the board.  We found on several occasions - I have two or three more examples on my desk - that the current arrangements have not been working.  This framework is an acknowledgement that the system was not fully functional up to now.  This letter was dated 11 May.  It came to the committee within the last week and is due to be raised in correspondence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018052400002#Z01700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1527148800,"counter":841,"content":"<p>We did not get to raise it before today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018052400002#Z01800","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1527148800,"counter":842,"content":"<p>This morning we decided to go straight into this session and deal with correspondence later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018052400002#Z01900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1527148800,"counter":843,"content":"<p>From what you read of it, it is totally inadequate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018052400002#Z02000","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1527148800,"counter":844,"content":"<p>Fine.

I note what the Chairman has read out.  I note that it included words like \"guidelines\" and \"internal, independent\".  If that is not an oxymoron I do not know what is.  How can we have an internal independent person, without prejudice?  It is an impossibility.  Nobody internal can investigate or be part of the investigation of allegations against that institution - work colleagues, golf buddies, drinking buddies, friends.  That is not there.  Guidelines are optional, as we all know and have learned at our expense at different times.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make a proposal which will need a seconder.  That will have to be the Chairman unless Deputy Alan Kelly wants to second it.  I propose, whether it is a matter for the Department of Education and Skills in this instance or DPER in general, that we need a whole new set of guidelines.  It is never acceptable to have an internal independent party because that is a conflict of interest in itself.  Even if what the Chairman read out is now the gold standard that can prevent and give absolute confidence to whistleblowers, the public and everyone that everything is independent and there is going to be a full and complete investigation and consideration, it is not retrospective.  In that context, there should be a re-investigation independently overseen by the Department of the anonymous disclosure that has been referred to, any letters that are judged to be disclosures or not pre-2017, and the ones currently before them.<\/p> <p>  I do not believe it is appropriate - without prejudice - for their own protection at a very minimum that executives, staff or certain people within the institution that is the subject of a protected disclosure are in any way associated with the management, oversight, facilitation or otherwise of a protected disclosure.  I ask that we write to the Secretaries General or the Ministers at DPER and the Department of Education and Skills because it is in this context that there would be a re-investigation of this.  I think I have proven beyond doubt this was not independent - again without prejudice - because of the involvement of people who were named in allegations, however false they may have been or vexatious.  That is not transparent.  It is not good governance and it is a clear conflict of interest.  I formally propose that.  I ask the Chairman to second it.  I know the clerk is talking to him there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018052400002#Z02800","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1527148800,"counter":852,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy.

However, the fact there is a procedure in place does not mean it is a good one or the right one; nor does it mean that it is going to lead to learning.  If a truly independent, external body is involved in setting terms of reference and managing matters at arm's length, like the Department or the HEA, the results of that process can act as the learning catalyst in improving governance in an organisation, whether that be CIT, Sligo IT or any other State entity.<\/p><p> I have a concern about this letter and the issue of parties and entertainment.

There are the six requests we made to the State Claims Agency after its appearance before the committee on 10 May.  We requested &quot;A note with the details of the interaction with CervicalCheck and the [State Claims Agency] regarding how the communication process to the women affected would operate&quot; and four other items.  They were in the minutes of the meeting and the State Claims Agency formally got a letter asking that it reply to those five items.  The response to one of the items concerns me.  The bulk of the document concerns dealing with period payment orders and so on.  The agency is waiting for that section of the Act to commence.  The part I want to highlight is on page 2, the addendum to the letter signed by Ciar&aacute;n Breen, the director of the State Claims Agency.  It concerns the communication between the HSE and the State Claims Agency and the communication process to the women affected by the case.  He says in his letter:<\/p><blockquote>We have noted that John Gleeson of HSE CervicalCheck, during his evidence to the PAC on Thursday 17<sup>th<\/sup>May last, indicated that nobody in HSE CervicalCheck informed the State Claims Agency, in or about the time of Vicky Phelan's trial, that all of the women, the subject matter of the audit, had been informed.<br \/><br \/>Mr. Gleeson's assertion does not accord with the facts.<\/blockquote> <p>I will read that statement again.  The HSE was here last week giving evidence, and the director of the State Claims Agency flatly contradicts it and says, &quot;Mr. Gleeson's assertion does not accord with the facts.&quot;  We have an absolute conflict.  I want to read the rest of the addendum.<\/p><blockquote>The Agency re-iterates its advices to the Committee that its legal team, comprising Senior and junior Counsel, a solicitor and paralegal, held a teleconference, on 20<sup>th<\/sup>April 2018, with a senior person in CervicalCheck.  Senior Counsel specifically asked if that person, the employee of CervicalCheck, was aware whether or not the affected women had been informed.  The reply was that all women whose smear [test] was part of the audit had now been informed or assumed they had been informed by their treating clinicians and this reply was carefully noted and attached to the [State Claims Agency's] legal file.<br \/><br \/>In giving his evidence to the Committee, Mr. Breen had ascertained the above specifically for the purposes of giving evidence to the Committee on the particular point.<\/blockquote><p>Since that arrived this morning, I have sent a message back to the State Claims Agency asking it to provide us with the name of the person from the HSE who was part of the teleconference and, if possible, a copy of the final note.  On the face of it, there are two State agencies involved, two of the most important in the State.  One is saying that what was said by one in public session at a meeting of this committee does not accord with the facts.  The Committee of Public Accounts has nothing to do with CervicalCheck, but when witnesses appear here, we expect them to speak openly and with candour.  This man is disagreeing that that has happened.  This is an issue that the committee cannot let run.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018052400002#CC01700","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527148800,"counter":968,"content":"<p>There are two issues.

What is more serious is the substance because if the State Claims Agency was of the view, formed on the basis of information it states it got from CervicalCheck, verified by its legal counsel, that all the women had been informed of the misdiagnosis, or that their treating clinicians had informed them, so maybe it was not the women directly-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018052400002#DD00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1527148800,"counter":969,"content":"<p>Smear tests, not misdiagnosis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018052400002#DD00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1527148800,"counter":970,"content":"<p>The smear tests, yes.

With those two provisos, I must state there is a point at which we, as a committee, must recognise it is not customary for committees to duplicate each other's business, which is what is happening.  There are three involved.  The matter is to be subject to an inquiry that the Oireachtas will establish in due course.  Therefore, it is appropriate that the correspondence provided by Mr. Breen, which alludes to an issue that merits further discussion at this committee, should be provided to the health committee.
