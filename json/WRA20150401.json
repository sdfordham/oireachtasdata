Action against offshore accounts specifically had yielded more than &euro;1 billion by the end of 2014.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of HSBC Bank, Geneva, the Revenue Commissioners became aware in 2010 of newspaper reports that the French authorities had come into possession of information in relation to accounts held with that Bank. Revenue wrote to the French authorities enquiring as to whether the data obtained by them contained information relating to Irish residents, and whether the French authorities would consider disclosing any such information to Revenue. The French authorities responded positively and made a disclosure to Revenue on 23 June 2010.<\/p>  <p>  The information received was evaluated carefully by Revenue and it was found, for a variety of reasons, that there was no basis for pursuing an investigation in many cases.\u00a0 The reasons included the absence of Irish addresses on certain accounts, persons associated with the accounts not being resident or domiciled in the State and Revenue establishing that, by reason of prior disclosure, that there was no tax liability. In the case of corporate entities, many were found to have been Irish-registered but non-resident for tax purposes. The vast majority of the funds linked to Ireland in the HSBC data were related to the Funds industry: more than 98 of the total related to the Global Funds sector.<\/p>  <p>  Following the evaluation of the information, Revenue initiated thirty three investigations. In eight of these, it was determined that there were no additional tax liabilities. Nineteen investigations resulted in settlement payments of over &euro;4.5 million, and a further amount of over &euro;172,000 has been received, as payment on account in relation to two appeals against tax assessments that were entered following investigations into the account holders. Six investigations are ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to pursuing taxes owed, Revenue have also sought to have criminal proceedings brought in any cases where the information provided by the French authorities, and their own subsequent investigations, suggested that there was sufficient evidence to prosecute in respect of identified tax offences. Three convictions have been secured, resulting in the imposition of fines ranging from &euro;4,000 to &euro;25,000, and a further case remains under investigation.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the Annual Report of the Revenue Commissioners for 2010 mentions the mutual assistance request made to, and the subsequent receipt of information from, a Treaty partner, which provided details of accounts held in Switzerland held by Irish residents. I understand also that the matter was raised when the then Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners appeared before the Public Accounts Committee in 2011. A comprehensive report on the matter was submitted to the PAC in February 2015, and the\u00a0Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners appeared before the PAC on 12 March 2015. <\/p>  <p>  Officials of my Department are in close contact with their counterparts in Revenue on \u00a0relevant tax matters on an ongoing basis. The Deputy will be aware, however, that there is a longstanding convention that the Minister for Finance does not intervene in matters involving Revenue and individual taxpayers. I would draw his attention to the terms of section 101 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011, which provides for the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the performance of their functions.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to commend Revenue for the pro-active role it has taken in tackling tax evasion through the use of offshore accounts. I am confident that they will continue to undertake this important work efficiently and effectively, and that they will use all the analytical and investigative\u00a0 tools and methods at their disposal to extract as much information as possible from both current and any further data that become available to them. I am aware that they intend to carry out a further evaluation of the HSBC Bank data using new analytical technology, to ascertain whether it brings to light any further cases that may warrant investigation. They will also play an active role in developing cooperation between countries to ensure that the scope for the use offshore accounts to escape tax responsibilities is curtailed to the greatest extent possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100057#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Growth Rate","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100057#WRA00850"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[13069\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100057#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which the economic fundamentals remain positive and on target; if he expects economic growth to continue; the anticipated economic benefit that is likely to accrue therefrom in the next five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>First estimates of economic activity for 2014 show that real GDP rose 4.8 per cent in 2014 compared with 2013.\u00a0 GNP rose by 5.2 per cent.

Sections 4 and 5 of the Act provide that it will be an offence to offer betting services without a licence and provides for the relevant authorities to bring proceedings in these cases. <\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Sullivan refers specifically to the extension of opening hours for bookmakers premises included in the Finance Act 2014. These provisions formed part of the above mentioned Betting (Amendment) Act 2015 but were brought forward to the Finance Act 2014 to protect jobs in the industry. The extension of opening hours was provided for to allow the bricks and mortar bookmakers compete with the online sector. This recognised the fact that individuals can bet on line through the medium of mobile phones, PCs and other electronic devices 24 hours a day 7 days a week.

I can confirm that at this meeting, it was put to senior management of IBRC that officials in my Department had concerns with a number of decisions taken by IBRC in relation to the sale of SiteServ including the decision to allow the sale process to be led by advisors of SiteServ, the bidding process, entering into exclusivity with one of the bidders and the decision to exclude trade buyers. It was at this meeting that senior management of IBRC confirmed to me that the transaction involving the sale of SiteServ was thoroughly assessed by the Board of IBRC prior to them approving it and that the transaction was managed in the best manner possible to achieve the best result for the State. A further meeting between the former Secretary General of the Department of Finance, John Moran, and the then CEO of IBRC took place in August 2012 at which this matter was also\u00a0further discussed.\u00a0At that point, the transaction had been concluded and no further action could\u00a0have been\u00a0taken. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the fact that a new Relationship Framework had been put in place, it was decided (following the meeting with John Moran and the then CEO of IBRC in August 2012) that a senior Department of Finance official would be seconded to IBRC to explore opportunities for deleveraging with a view to maximising the recovery for the taxpayer. This had the additional benefit of providing greater oversight while supporting the management team. The secondment of Neil Ryan to IBRC commenced shortly thereafter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100057#WRA04000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Knowledge Development Box","counter":60,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100057#WRA04050"},{"type":"question","counter":61,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[13071\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100057#WRA04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will report on the status of the knowledge development box initiative, as announced in budget 2015; the work to date on the initiative; and when it is envisaged that it will be launched.","asker":"1110","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":62,"content":"<p>In Budget 2015 I announced my intention to introduce the Knowledge Development Box (KDB) in Finance Bill 2015.<\/p><p>The purpose behind the introduction of the KDB in Ireland is to enhance the competitiveness of the Irish tax offering for intellectual property and thereby to ensure Ireland continues to be the location of choice for foreign direct investment.<\/p><p>A public consultation to gather views on how the KDB should operate was launched on 14 January and will remain open until 8 April.\u00a0 The consultation paper invites submissions from interested parties on their views of how the KDB should be designed to ensure that it meets the key objective of being the most competitive in class, within the agreed international parameters for fair tax competition in this area.<\/p><p>Officials from my Department have been actively engaging with industry and other related parties in relation to this consultation, and are participating in related discussions at EU and OECD level.<\/p><p>It is envisaged that the KDB will be introduced as planned in Finance Bill 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100057#WRA04200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":63,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100057#WRA04250"},{"type":"question","counter":64,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[8343\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100057#WRA04300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if Ireland is making progress in efforts to combat illicit financial flows from low and middle-income countries; the steps he will take to place equitable tax policies at the heart of Irish Government policy and at the heart of the global post-2015 agenda; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":65,"content":"<p>In\u00a02013, my Department set out an International Tax\u00a0Strategy outlining principles and strategic objectives; it guides our approach to international corporate tax issues and it contains, inter alia,\u00a0a commitment to engage constructively and respectfully with developing countries in relation to tax matters.

I have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change or\u00a0to the mortgage interest rates charged.\u00a0 It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.\u00a0 It is not appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to comment on or become involved in the detailed mortgage position of mortgage holders.<\/p>  <p>  That said, the issue of regulation of interest rates remains a policy area under active review and\u00a0this has been the subject of recent correspondence between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank. The current position is that the Central Bank does not have new proposals for the additional regulation of interest rates. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations. The Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. <\/p>  <p>  As I stated in previous Parliamentary Questions, a previous Deputy Governor indicated that, within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that the Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, in his opening statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last November stated that, as in most advanced economies, including Ireland, it has long been understood that tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counterproductive in ensuring a sufficient flow of properly priced credit on a lasting basis. Such control would strongly discourage new entrants. In this regard, ongoing competition in the banking sector will be crucial in ensuring that the economy is provided with efficient and cost effective banking services. In this regard, there has been some movements on mortgage interest rates of late by a number of institutions which suggest that the market may well be entering a new and more competitive phase. <\/p>  <p>  The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned. This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding.  However, as part of the Central Bank's work on mortgage arrears, lenders were asked to consider all avenues to help customers in arrears, including interest rate reductions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100058#WRB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Portfolio Value","counter":91,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100058#WRB01750"},{"type":"question","counter":92,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[13116\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100058#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the value of the National Asset Management Agency cash reserves; his plans for expenditure; the role he has in deciding how cash reserves are spent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":93,"content":"<p>I am advised by NAMA that as at 20 March 2015 its current cash position was &euro;199 million and that in addition it had liquid asset holdings of &euro;768 million.\u00a0 It is entirely a matter for NAMA, by reference to its statutory commercial mandate, to determine how its cash reserves are applied.\u00a0 As Minister for Finance, I have no role in the matter.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the cash that is generated from asset disposals and other income is applied by NAMA for a range of purposes, including the redemption of its senior debt, interest payments on its senior and subordinated debt, payments arising from its interest rate and current hedging activities, new lending to projects under the control of its debtors and receivers, and to meet its operating costs.<\/p>  <p>  NAMA's ultimate objective is to repay its senior debt and to do so expeditiously.\u00a0 NAMA's senior debt is a contingent liability of Irish taxpayers and reducing and ultimately eliminating it has to be a major priority at a time when Ireland's sovereign indebtedness is still at very high levels. The Deputy will be aware of the significant progress which NAMA has made in this respect: up to end-March 2015, it had redeemed &euro;17.6 billion of senior bonds, 58% of the amount originally issued. Its target is to redeem at least &euro;24 billion (80%) by end-2016.\u00a0 NAMA's progress in this regard has been recognised in Ireland's credit ratings upgrades and is a very important contributory factor to the current very favourable positioning of Ireland in the international bond markets.\u00a0 NAMA has stated that, on the assumption that conditions in the economy and in the property market continue to remain favourable, it expects to be in a position to repay all of its senior debt by 2017\/2018 and to repay \u00a0all of its subordinated debt.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware also that, in order to maximise taxpayers' return on its acquired loan portfolio, NAMA advances funding for the development and completion of projects.\u00a0\u00a0NAMA has advanced over &euro;1 billion across a range of commercial, retail, leisure and residential development projects in Ireland to date and has indicated that it expects to advance substantial further funding on a commercial basis to help address current and impending residential and office supply shortages particularly in the Dublin area.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware in this respect that NAMA has committed to funding the delivery of 4,500 new homes in the Dublin area in the three years to end-2016 and facilitating the timely delivery of key Grade A office, retail and residential space in the Dublin Docklands Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) and the wider central business district.

Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 requires that credit institutions, prescribed credit institutions and bureaux de change must make a submission to the Central Bank if they wish to introduce any new customer charges or increase any existing customer charges in respect of certain services. Section 149 does not cover interest rates rather it applies to fees and commissions only. The Central Bank may direct the institution not to impose the new or increased charge or it may approve the charge, or approve it at a lower level than requested by the institution. Once approved, the bank is entitled to impose the charge.<\/p><p>My Department published a report on the review of the regulation of bank fees and charges in December 2013. This contains a detailed description of the process by which the Central Bank makes decisions on whether or not to approve proposed charges. It is available on my Department's website at .\u00a0Among the key findings of the review was that while\u00a0fee and commission income has become a more important source of income to the banks in recent years,\u00a0net fee and commission income in Irish banks was well below the average of their\u00a0European peers. <\/p><p>The European Communities (Payment Services) Regulations 2009 (the Payment Services Regulations) include requirements for banks and other payment institutions to provide information to the consumer about charges, interest and exchange rates on the accounts and these are reflected in the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code 2012, which\u00a0contains requirements in relation to the provision of information on charges to consumers.

Loans have been available since 9 March 2015 at branches of both banks throughout the entire country. SBCI's funding must be passed to SMEs and the SMEs must receive the full benefit of any discounted rate offered to the partner lenders. SBCI has committed &euro;200m to each of the initial bank lending partners and has a further &euro;400m available to other future lenders. Talks are continuing with circa ten other potential funding partners from both the banking and non-banking sectors. The SBCI will offer working capital facilities which are of at least 2 years duration.

Statistical information in relation to above-EU threshold tendering activity by the Irish public sector is collected and provided to the European Commission for each year.

Such an agreement has, in my view, the potential to enhance growth and increase jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. In the agriculture sector, Ireland has substantial offensive interests. We are keen to increase our access to the American market for dairy products, pig-meat, beverages and food ingredients. Now that we have gained access to the US beef market, we want to grow that trade by securing higher quotas and lower tariffs. <\/p>  <p>  Of course we have defensive interests as well. One of these is our beef sector where we are mindful of the potential of increased imports of US beef to have a negative effect on the economics of EU and Irish beef production, particularly beef from suckler cows. We must ensure that the EU market is not undermined by over-supply and our proposals to mitigate the impact of quotas and tariff cuts are well known to the Commission. These defensive interests should be seen in the light of the current high US beef prices which at least temporarily reduce the US competitive advantage, and the recent opening of the US market to Irish beef, with the favourable prospects for capitalising on this through TTIP by further reductions in beef tariffs and the opening of a quota for\u00a0the EU.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  On the dairy side, the focus of our expanded production post-quota is on emerging markets in Asia, and indeed the United States, and we do not see increased imports from the US to the EU as a significant threat. There are also significant market opportunities for Irish pig-meat in the United States and it is important that we balance our defensive interests in this sector against the prospects for increasing our exports. <\/p>  <p>  Finally in relation to food standards, it is a prerequisite in these negotiations and a red line for me that imports from the United States must comply with equivalent standards of animal health, welfare and food safety to those observed by EU producers and processors. <\/p>  <p>  We are at a relatively early stage in these negotiations but I am confident that there is sufficient determination and good will to secure an agreement that will be beneficial on both sides of the Atlantic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100060#WRD03000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Payments","counter":206,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100060#WRD03050"},{"type":"question","counter":207,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[13564\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100060#WRD03100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when payments will issue under the single payment scheme and the agri-environment options scheme for 2012, 2013 and 2014 in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Tipperary; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":208,"content":"<p>The person named first submitted a Single Payment application form in 2011.

In that regard I remain fully committed to delivering on the Government's regulatory reforms programme in this area which I announced in September 2014 in conjunction with my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills. These reforms provide the necessary regulatory framework through which abuses of the student immigration system can be curtailed to the benefit of bona fide students and colleges alike.  The Government is committed to maintaining Ireland's reputation as a high quality destination for international students and will continue to implement all necessary reforms to protect that reputation.<\/p><p>Work is at an advanced stage in implementing these reforms taking into account a high court judgement in respect of that part of the reform programme relating to English language courses, and I expect that full details will be available shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100061#WRE01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Registration of Title","counter":245,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100061#WRE01550"},{"type":"question","counter":246,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[13573\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100061#WRE01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will support a matter (details supplied) regarding a land registry query; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":247,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that under the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006, the Property Registration Authority (PRA) was established as and from 4 November 2006.

Under community rating, the level of risk that a particular consumer poses to an insurer does not directly affect the premium paid. Premiums for younger or healthier lives are typically higher than their expected claims would require, whereas for older or less healthy lives, premiums are typically lower than the expected claims would require. <\/p>  <p>  Community-rated markets depend on a continuing entry of younger people, to help keep premium prices down for everybody. Lifetime Community Rating is being introduced to encourage people to take out private health insurance at a younger age, thereby helping to spread the costs of older and less healthy people across the market, helping to support affordable premiums for all. There is a nine month grace period, which expires on 30 April 2015, during which time as many people as want to can take out health insurance without incurring loadings. From 1 May 2015, late entry loadings will be applied to those who join the private health insurance market at age 35 or over, set at 2% per year for each year over the age of 34, up to a a maximum loading of 70% at age 69 and over. There are exemptions available for people who previously had health insurance but cancelled it. A credited period can apply for any periods of inpatient cover when a full adult premium is paid in respect of anyone, including spouses and dependant students. In addition, a credited period (in total not exceeding 3 years) is also available for individuals who previously had health insurance but relinquished cover since 1 January 2008 due to unemployment. In such cases, the level of loading will then be reduced by the relevant credited period(s).  <\/p>  <p>  LCR relates solely to the current voluntary health insurance market and any loadings that apply after the 1 May 2015 will apply in subsequent years, until Universal Health Insurance is in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100062#WRF00900","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Support Services","counter":284,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100062#WRF00950"},{"type":"question","counter":285,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[13522\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100062#WRF01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the relationship between the Health Service Executive and St. Michael's House in Dublin 9, from the point of view that if somebody has a complaint in relation to the manner in which the House is run, to whom do they submit this complaint.","asker":"1192","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":286,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services, including disability services.

It provides further for the NI Executive to take appropriate steps to improve the way the legacy inquests function is conducted in Northern Ireland to comply with ECHR Article 2 requirements.  The Agreement sets out that processes dealing with the past should be victim-centred and emphasises the importance of providing services and support to victims and survivors. <\/p>  <p>  Primary legislation to establish the Historical Investigations Unit will be taken forward at Westminster and I understand that the intention is to bring forward legislation as soon as possible to enable the Unit to be established in 2016. Notwithstanding the complex work involved in establishing these mechanisms, I am confident that the British Government shares the Irish Government&rsquo;s resolve that the new framework to address the legacy of the past is put in place at the earliest opportunity. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has committed to putting all necessary arrangements in place to ensure full cooperation with the Historical Investigations Unit, including legislation if necessary.

Human rights issues therefore continue to constitute an important part of our engagement and dialogue with Iran.<\/p>  <p>  During my address to the Human Rights Council on 4 March, I expressed my concern that &ldquo;Freedom of Religion and Belief is in peril in many places worldwide, with members of minority religious communities, including those of Christian, Muslim and Baha&rsquo;i faith, disproportionately affected by violence, discrimination, and harassment.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  Ireland continues to call strongly for the release of the seven Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; leaders and the end to the persecution of members of this faith in Iran, including through bilateral contacts, with our EU partners and at the UN.

Moreover, in January 2015, during political consultations with Iran, which took place in Dublin, my Department again directly communicated our concerns regarding the treatment of the Baha&rsquo;i community to the visiting Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Majid Takht Ravanchi.<\/p>  <p>  During Iran&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review at the UN Human Rights Council in April 2014, Ireland voiced concerns in its intervention regarding the situation of religious minorities, including recommending that Iran review its policies discriminating against students on account of their faith, ensure that the trials of members of religious minorities are conducted in a fair and transparent manner, and accord them the full rights of citizens of Iran.<\/p>  <p>  At the 27th Session of the Human Rights Council in September 2014, under Agenda Item Four, on human rights situations that require the Council&rsquo;s attention, Ireland raised concerns that some groups, including those of the Baha&rsquo;i faith and some Christian groups, are subject to significant persecution.<\/p>  <p>  We also raised the issue at the 28th Session of the Human Rights Council in March 2015 during the interactive dialogues with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, and the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief. <\/p>  <p>  My Department maintains regular contact with the Irish Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; community. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland, along with the EU, will continue to encourage progress in relation to religious minorities in Iran and to make clear our concerns to the Iranian authorities at every appropriate opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100063#WRG00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":332,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100063#WRG00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Applications","counter":331,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100063#WRG00550"},{"type":"question","counter":332,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[13481\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100063#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding a school bus ticket in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":333,"content":"<p>Bus &Eacute;ireann, which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department, has advised that the pupil referred to by the Deputy in the details supplied, has been issued with a school transport ticket.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100063#WRG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1078"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Emergency Works Scheme Applications","counter":334,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100063#WRG00750"},{"type":"question","counter":335,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[13438\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100063#WRG00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding grant aid assistance in respect of a school (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":336,"content":"<p>The management authorities of the school referred to by the Deputy submitted an application in January 2015 for funding under my Department's Emergency Works Scheme to replace underfloor heating at their school with standard radiators.<\/p>  <p>  As the scope of works for which funding is sought is outside the terms of the scheme they cannot be considered for funding.

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that the National Council Special Education (NCSE) is currently at an advanced stage in the preparation of policy advice on the education of children with autism which includes a review of early intervention provision.<\/p>  <p>  I expect that the NCSE final report will reflect the broadest possible range of views, both National and International and will provide recommendations which will assist the development of policy for future years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100063#WRG02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Literacy Levels","counter":361,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100063#WRG02550"},{"type":"question","counter":362,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[13451\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100063#WRG02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the steps her Department is taking to improve the standard of numeracy and literacy here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":363,"content":"<p>At both primary and post primary, literacy and numeracy have been prioritised as key skills for all students in line with the Literacy and Numeracy Strategy (2011).<\/p>  <p>  A new mathematics curriculum has been rolled out in post-primary schools. This reform was accompanied by an intensive programme of continuous professional development for teachers, provided by the Project Maths Development Team.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a two year part-time Professional Diploma in Mathematics for Teaching (Level 8) is being run by the NCE-MSTL consortium. Almost 800 teachers, over the last three years,  have enrolled in this programme. These two major commitments were prioritised so as to enhance the quality of teaching and learning in post-primary mathematics. <\/p>  <p>  At Junior Cycle, literacy and numeracy are being embedded as key skills, not only in English and Mathematics, but also in all of the new subject specifications as they are being developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).<\/p>  <p>  In line with a commitment in the national literacy and numeracy strategy, the NCCA has initiated a review of the primary maths curriculum.  The revision of the curriculum will be on a phased basis, with the initial focus being on the development of a revised mathematics curriculum for children in the first four years of primary school, from junior infants to second class inclusive.<\/p>  <p>  Significant progress has already been made in relation to integrated languages curriculum.  The development of a new integrated languages Curriculum for the first four years of primary schools (Junior Infants to Second Class) is nearing completion.  It will be implemented to schools from September 2016 but will be available to teachers to engage with from September 2015.<\/p>  <p>  All schools are required (Circulars 0039\/2012 primary and 0040\/2012 post-primary) to engage in planning for improvement in the areas of literacy and numeracy as part of the school self-evaluation process. This planning requires schools to gather information about current outcomes and to use this evidence to set targets for improvement. This is done on a whole-school basis with a focus on changing teaching and learning in all classrooms. While the improvement plan is developed at whole-school level, it should be implemented in every class and across all subjects at post-primary level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100063#WRG02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Site Acquisitions","counter":364,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100063#WRG02750"},{"type":"question","counter":365,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[13473\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100063#WRG02800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will provide an update on efforts to secure a permanent site in respect of a school (details supplied) in County Cork; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":366,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that officials in my Department have been working with officials from Cork County Council in relation to the identification and acquisition of a suitable permanent site for new school accommodation for the school to which he refers.

together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy may be aware issues regarding financial, accounting and governance matters in the National College of Art and Design (NCAD) were identified by the Comptroller &amp;amp; Auditor General (C&amp;amp;AG) in a Special Report which was submitted to my Department last September. I would like to assure the Deputy that the matters raised are of serious concern to my Department and my officials have been working with the Higher Education Authority (HEA) in order to have the concerns dealt with. I understand that NCAD is currently working on implementing a number of changes and improvements in its systems and processes in order to address the issues identified in the C&amp;amp;AG report.<\/p><p>Details of the recurrent funding, including grant in lieu of tuition fees funding, provided to NCAD is set out in the table.<\/p><p>Higher education institutions such as NCAD are autonomous bodies and have responsibility for their own day to day affairs. Many students in the higher education sector are required to pay additional charges, over and above the Student Contribution, relating to the cost of their course including costs associated with Garda vetting, health screening, fieldtrips etc. Similar charges for materials commonly occur in art and design programmes in other institutions. A referendum of registered students usually only occurs where a levy is to be introduced to contribute to the cost of specific facilities for student services purposes, e.g. student centre, sports facilities.<\/p><p>In relation to the fee payable for the Masters course in NCAD, again, institutions are autonomous bodies and therefore the criteria governing the level of tuition fees to be charged in relation to postgraduate study is determined by the institutions and I have no role in relation to the matter. However, it should be noted that the average postgraduate tuition fee in other higher education institutions can range from &euro;5,000 to &euro;6,000.<\/p><p>The three-year term of office of the board of the NCAD expired on 1 March 2015. A new board will be appointed for a three year period up to 1 March 2018. Members of the board are appointed in accordance with Sections 6 and 7 of the NCAD Act, 1971. My Department has recently sought expressions of interest from suitably qualified candidates for consideration for appointment as Chairs and ordinary members to boards and governing bodies of institutions and other bodies in the higher education sector including NCAD. Expressions of interest were sought by way of a public advertisement on www.education.ie and www.stateboards.ie.

Therefore any person is free to set up a private college of education or an English language school without having to come under the oversight of the Department or any of its agencies.  The majority of English language schools in Ireland are privately run and there is a diverse range of English language courses on offer which vary considerably in duration and intensity.<\/p><p>The information sought by the Deputy in relation to the number of English language schools is only available to my Department in respect of those that have gone through a recognised quality assurance process.  Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) operates ACELS (Accreditation and Co-ordination of English Language Services), which is a voluntary scheme that grants recognition to English language teaching organisations annually.<\/p><p>Currently there are 98 English language organisations nationwide holding ACELS recognition.  The breakdown of these organisations by county is easily accessible on an interactive map available at: .  It should be noted that many of these 98 organisations are not sole English language training providers.  Some also operate additional seasonal centres for juniors, typically in the summer.  Others operate only as seasonal providers during the summer with junior programmes.  Some other providers offer a mixed provision of programmes including further and\/or higher education programmes in addition to English language courses.<\/p><p>With regard to student numbers, the majority of English language training organisations operate a system of 'rolling enrolment' i.e. students may enrol at regular intervals onto courses, typically every Monday of a new week or per fortnight.  Language school enrolments are very often short-term, and because of this, ACELS does not require providers to supply student enrolment numbers.  As a result, it is not possible to provide the Deputy with the current number of students in each of these organisations.<\/p><p>The number of recognised English language training organisations which have voluntarily submitted and gained recognition through the ACELS scheme fluctuates annually.  However over the last 10 years, QQI estimates that this number has been within a range of 95-120 organisations, comprising approximately 130-160 centres either permanent or temporary nationwide.<\/p><p>There are currently 24 non-ACELS English language training providers listed on the internationalisation register for immigration purposes offering other English language training awards, mainly UK aligned.  There may also be other non-ACELS English language training organisations operating domestically which are not on the internationalisation register. Typically, these are regional seasonal operators offering junior courses, who have relationships with other EU schools\/agents and don't see a need to gain ACELS recognition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100064#WRH02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"question","counter":425,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[13571\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100064#WRH02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the arrangements in place to ensure the bona fides of English language colleges.","asker":"1178","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":426,"content":"<p>Ireland has a strong reputation for delivery of high-quality English language tuition.  Many thousands of students from the EU and around the world come to Ireland for full-time or short-term programmes.  The vast majority of providers of English language training in the State operate to a high standard and are motivated by the desire to enable learners to reach their potential.  However, it is evident that a minority of providers do not operate to the same standards, with serious implications for students and the reputation of the wider international education sector.<\/p>  <p>  For this reason, I announced robust regulatory reforms to the international education sector together with the Minister for Justice and Equality on 2nd September 2014. These reforms include specific measures to ensure the bona fides of English language colleges.<\/p>  <p>  A key pillar of these reforms is a strengthened and more integrated inspection regime of providers of international education including English language colleges, which entails an enhanced inspection function for the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) and the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) which will be linked to Revenue, the Department of Social Protection and the National Employment Rights Authority.<\/p>  <p>  A new quality assurance process to control entry by English language providers to the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP) - the list of eligible programmes for immigration purposes - is being finalised by officials from my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality and will be submitted to Government shortly for approval.<\/p>  <p>  Another key pillar of the regulatory reforms is the International Education Mark (IEM) and related Code of Practice.  The IEM was proposed in Ireland's International Education Strategy 2010 - 2015 as a means of enhancing the quality and promotion of international education in Ireland.  The IEM confirms that a provider has demonstrated their capacity and commitment to provide a high-quality educational experience to international students.  The Code of Practice includes requirements relating to the protection of enrolled learners, treatment of fees and tax compliance, and will also address other 'non-academic' issues such as recruitment, marketing and accommodation. Providers of English language training will have to demonstrate compliance with the Code before being authorised to use the Mark.<\/p>  <p>  The Mark will be used both as a driver of quality assurance within institutions, including English language colleges, and as a marketing tool to underpin the promotional activities of Enterprise Ireland in seeking to attract international learners to Ireland. In addition, the Mark will be used for immigration purposes.  From 2016 it will become a requirement that providers wishing to recruit English language students from outside the EEA have authorisation to use the Mark.  English language providers authorised to use the Mark will also be subject to ongoing monitoring and review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100064#WRH02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Enrolments","counter":427,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100064#WRH02550"},{"type":"question","counter":428,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[13602\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100064#WRH02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding school places (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":429,"content":"<p>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.

The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department. <\/p>  <p>  My Department undertook to consider new approaches to the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2014 and arising from this, it was decided that the scheme be managed by Pobal, given that organisation&rsquo;s significant experience delivering programmes on behalf of Government. <\/p>  <p>  Pobal&rsquo;s management and administrative services for the Scheme included an invitation to tender for the supply and installation of personal monitored alarms, which was publicly advertised on eTenders on 20 October 2014.  The tender process, which is being led by Pobal, is almost complete.  Following on from this, a panel of regional suppliers will be contracted to provide the equipment within specific regional areas.  The tender was broken down into 10 regional lots to ensure that SMEs were not disadvantaged due to excessively large lot sizes. <\/p>  <p>  As the market for the equipment is well established, it was neither necessary nor appropriate to engage in consultations with the market on the matter prior to the tender process. It should be noted that there are no legal mandatory standards required for the manufacture of personal alarms.  Many of the existing units comply with the EU standard; newer manufacturers of equipment or the newer more innovative technologies may meet other quality standards e.g. ISO standard. Under the tender competition, those suppliers that meet the minimum requirement would score the minimum amount of marks available and suppliers that propose products over and above the minimum requirements would be awarded a higher score. <\/p>  <p>  The operational handover between my Department and Pobal is proceeding and should be completed mid-year. In the meantime community and voluntary groups wishing to draw down grant support under the Seniors Alert Scheme should continue to apply to my Department in the usual way. <\/p>  <p>  While I have taken note of the concerns expressed, it should be noted that Pobal will only manage the Scheme on behalf of my Department; the strategic policy direction of the Scheme will remain my Department&rsquo;s responsibility.  My Department will also have an oversight role in relation to Pobal&rsquo;s delivery of the Scheme, and will ensure that the valuable community support for elderly persons provided by the many hundreds of community and voluntary groups across the country will be maintained.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100065#WRJ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"964"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":465,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100065#WRJ01450"},{"type":"question","counter":466,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[13466\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100065#WRJ01500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his views on the funding to the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1193","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":467,"content":"<p>Since 2007, my Department has provided annual funding for the ongoing operational costs of the 17 member organisations of the community &amp;amp; voluntary pillar to allow for input into the policy making process within the community and voluntary sector as part of the social dialogue process.
