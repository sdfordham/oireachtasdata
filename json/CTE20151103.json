I thank the committee for the invitation and this opportunity to speak today.  I will read my three page presentation and then will be delighted to answer any questions members may have.<\/p> <p>  Innopharma Labs is an award-winning Irish technology and training company.  I set up the company in 2009 after having worked in the pharmaceutical sector for ten years and then the food sector for four years.  In terms of the technology side of the business, we operate a research and development budget in excess of &euro;8 million in collaboration with multiple international academic institutions and industries.  We sell these analytical technologies globally to the pharmaceutical, medical technology, food and fine chemical sectors.  One of the things we do is to develop sensors and cameras that control how one binds powders together before proceeding to make tablets.  We are now in more than 20 countries around the world.  Earlier this year we launched our business in India and that is where we hope there will be major growth in the market for the technological side of the business over the next five years.<\/p> <p>  Education is another side of the business.  We are one of this country's leading providers of innovative training programmes in the pharma, food technology and medical devices industries.  We employ 27 full-time staff and more than 40 associate lecturers and industry professionals.  Our courses are run nationwide in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and along the east coast.<\/p> <p>  Through the Springboard and MOMENTUM initiatives, in excess of 2,000 people have completed our upskilling and training programmes since 2010 which have focused on providing in-demand industry skills.  Over 70% of participants have returned to employment within six months of completing their programme and many people have returned to employment before the six-month mark.  This proves that the Innopharma Labs' specifically recruited team and jobs-centred approach works.<\/p> <p>  I will outline the opportunity for Ireland.<\/p><p> The economy is recovering with the private sector creating jobs.  The pharmaceutical and medtech sectors never stopped creating jobs as they have been doing well even during the past five years.  A gap has emerged, however, in providing the necessary qualified personnel in Ireland&rsquo;s science, technology and engineering sectors, particularly the pharmaceutical, food technology and medical devices industries.  Positions are, and will be, available but major companies in Ireland struggle to fill them with Irish graduates and workers at present.  Attracting appropriately skilled labour into Ireland can be expensive.  There is a global shortage of personnel with such STEM skill sets, and this is not confined to Ireland.  I have been to India twice this year.  Even India is struggling although it is producing 2.5 million science and engineering graduates every year.  This is an international challenge.  It is also leading to the outsourcing of some of the services that we could provide in Ireland when we are building a new pharmaceutical company or supporting an existing company in engineering facility design and start up activities.  This skills deficit is a risk to the accelerated growth currently being experienced by these industries and will have an impact on future foreign direct investment decisions in the life science sector. <\/p><p> What I am saying is no longer news.  The expert skills groups from 2013 to 2015, inclusive, have been discussing the skills gaps and have invested in upskilling programmes, such as Springboard and Momentum, in these sectors.  There is also a consensus that Ireland needs to increase its output of STEM graduates over the next five years.  A further education and training strategy document dealing with that was published by SOLAS last year.  We want to anchor our current graduates in Ireland in order to meet the needs of technology and science driven companies.  We want to ensure that our third level institutions are continuing to increase the number of science, technology and engineering graduates.  We need to increase the number of secondary school students who study these subjects.  We need to ensure that we can attract people with those skills to return home.  We need to hold on to our STEM graduates.  We cannot let them go abroad unless they want to but we must ensure we have the right industries to keep them interested in staying in Ireland.  Even after doing all that, we must ask how we can fill the gap that results from insufficient STEM graduates.<\/p><p> We must take the opportunity to upskill people from other sectors and using cross-skilling initiatives prepare them for the pharmaceutical sector.  There are various ways to try to fill that skills gap.  I am aware of the need to introduce an early warning system that would highlight at risk jobs, where redundancies may occur, and take the opportunity to transfer people from companies or industries that are at risk to higher value roles and-or roles where there are great opportunities for career development.  We are interested in supporting such initiatives.  There is a requirement to implement a nationwide approach to ensure there is a nationwide economic recovery. <\/p><p> Innopharma Labs proposes the expansion of an agile third level education fund that can rapidly react to industry skills needs and upskilling for the unemployed and at risk employed in Ireland through evaluating certain outcomes to ensure they meet current and future industry needs.  I will outline some of the roles of this agile third level education fund.  These projects should focus on enabling the long-term unemployed, particularly those under 25 years and recently unemployed, to return to work through upskilling; enabling those in at risk or in low-paid sectors to cross-skill to more stable and value-adding sectors; increasing the number of STEM based graduates and helping to meet national STEM targets through cross-skilling these at risk participants and people who are unemployed with STEM skills; enabling emigrants to return to Ireland through providing upskilling and bridging services; providing a rich supply of skill sets and human capital necessary to maintain the up-turn in high-tech manufacturing in Ireland over the next five years and beyond; and reacting to specific industry skill set needs in a rapid and flexible manner.  Some components of this agile and nationwide third level upskilling are currently funded through Springboard and other similar upskilling initiatives.  This could potentially continue to be the vehicle for funding such initiatives.<\/p><p> The jobs secured by Innopharma Labs trainees are located throughout Ireland, supporting balanced regional development.  In the past year alone, more than 600 people trained by Innopharma Labs found jobs in high-end manufacturing who otherwise would have remained unemployed.<\/p><p>It is not just Dublin-based.  As can be seen from the table, in Galway, there are well over 80 jobs, predominantly in the medtech sector.  In Limerick, it was mostly medtech as well, involving mostly long-term unemployed individuals in a project we focused on there, which I will talk about later.  There are 380 along the east coast from Waterford to Louth, including Dublin, in pharma, medtech, food and chemicals and, for example, Intel, which wanted to hire graduates with a good manufacturing qualification.  They hire our graduates.  There are food and pharma jobs in Cork.  Westmeath and Roscommon, through a programme delivered in Athlone, are doing well in the medtech and pharma sectors predominantly, as are Kerry, Sligo and Mayo.  Many of these 600 jobs went to jobseekers who were long-term unemployed.  They would not have been filled through conventional approaches, as they were attained through a great deal of networking by our team and our graduates and support from the Innopharma Labs industry liaison team.  That sounds fancy, but it involves people being on the road every day talking to companies in the pharma, medtech and food technology sectors and asking them questions such as what jobs they are hiring for, what skill gaps they have now and what skill gaps they will have next year, and whether they will consider hiring graduates from our programmes.  We try to use a matchmaking process in which we engage with the industry and the graduates.<\/p><p> I refer to Exchequer savings to provide context and to validate the logic of the proposal.  We are happy to provide detailed figures.  Assuming an annual number of 10,000 students participating in upskilling, an average saving to the Exchequer per unemployed participant of &euro;15,000 - currently the Government uses &euro;20,000 as the calculated saving to the Exchequer when someone moves from unemployment to employment - an average annual starting salary of &euro;30,000, or &euro;18 per hour, which would be typical for graduates of our programmes based on these sectors, and an average worse-case cost per student to the programme of &euro;6,000, there will be a direct net saving to the Exchequer of &euro;120 million over five years.  These are first-time graduates who do not have a third level qualification.  To get people on the third level ladder and start thinking about higher-value roles is an intangible but it is important in terms of manoeuvring people who are unemployed or people who are at risk of employment in lower-value roles into higher-value roles with good career opportunities.<\/p><p> With student coaches supporting the participants, industry experts delivering the training, and industry liaison specialists engaging with companies on a daily basis, we have developed a tailor-made team for successful upskilling.  Innopharma Labs' training programmes are designed in conjunction with industry - pharma, medtech and food companies - as well as representative bodies.  This is one of the reasons behind the huge success rate for graduates in finding employment.  With 70% of graduates finding employment within six months of programme completion, we are not only delivering for industry but helping to create jobs, because some of these jobs would not have been filled had our graduates and staff not been out networking and looking for opportunities.  We picked an example in Limerick because it is ongoing and it is fresh in our minds.  A recent upskilling programme with a focus on long-term unemployment has realised a back-to-work result of more than 70%, with graduates who were previously unemployed between 18 months and six years, some as far back as the Dell closures in 2009, now working in high-value roles within the local medtech sector in companies such as Teleflex Medical, Vistakon, Beckman Coulter and Reagecon.<\/p><p> Our programmes range from level 6, certificate level, all the way up to level 9, and our accreditation partners for the programmes are the Institute of Technology Tallaght, with which we have worked strongly for the past five years, and Griffith College for some of our pharma business programmes.  We do a survey of industry every year and the feedback two years ago was that more graduates who were savvy in the pharma business, rather than pure technical graduates, were needed.  They wanted good supervisors and managers who understood the bigger picture and could run meetings and so on.<\/p><p>Therefore, we developed several pharma business-type programmes in collaboration with Griffith College.  From the initial programme design, student recruitment and intensive training, all the way through to taking up employment, the programmes are designed to support participants' job readiness.  Work preparation, student coaching and industry engagement are integral components of the programmes.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to make this presentation.  We at Innopharma Labs are very proud of what we do.  Our team works really hard and it is very rewarding when we receive e-mails, as we do on a daily and weekly basis, from programme participants who were out of work for two years, for example, and have just got their first pay cheque.  We have been involved in this initiative for the past five years and felt it was time to make the committee aware of our successes and explain what members are supporting on behalf of the taxpayer.

This all goes back to 2010 and it relates to the Deputy's first question about which aspect of our activities came first.  I did a programme in Harvard in 2008 in the course of which I engaged with Massachusetts Institute of Technology on a number of projects.  I was very interested in what I saw there, which was a really strong emphasis on education coupled with research and development activity and technology commercialisation.  Nobody else in Ireland is doing what we do in the area of technology development.  In fact, there are only a few companies in the world that do what we do in terms of the centres and technologies we develop.  In 2009, when we were trying to figure out the risks that were presenting for our company, one of the issues we identified was that there were not many people who could service and sell our technologies and understand pharmaceutical processes in the way we needed them to do.  In other words, we identified a need to develop our own skilled people.  At that time there was a labour market activation fund call for education, and we worked with ITT Dublin to put in a call around that.<\/p> <p>  The typical graduate participating on that programme was an unemployed person who had perhaps worked formerly in the construction sector, had a civil engineering or architecture qualification and was good at managing people and projects.  Together with ITT Dublin, we developed a level 8 special purpose award with a pharmaceutical focus which formed a subset of participants' final year degree in science.  That programme was delivered over a six-month period, the objective being to bring people who were working in the construction sector through a successful transition to the pharmaceutical and medical devices sectors.  That is an example of one of our programmes.  In subsequent years, we listened to industry in order to understand where the unemployment challenges were.  As a result, we went down the education ladder to level 6, to provide a pharma, medtech or food entry-type qualification for people with a leaving certificate.  We also went up the ladder to provide a master's programmes for graduates who want to work in an analytical laboratory.  Those graduates might come from an environmental science or forensics background but do not understand the tablet manufacturing side of things.  The master's programme allowed them to transition into laboratory analyst roles in the pharma sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015110300002#G01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ian Jones"},{"type":"speech","time":1446557400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>How many separate courses is Innopharma Labs currently running?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015110300002#G01100","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446557400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Between eight and ten.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015110300002#G01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ian Jones"},{"type":"speech","time":1446557400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Do they involve a traditional college year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015110300002#G01300","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1446557400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>We have no fixed semester structure.

There is a third group - I suppose it is now a trichotomy - of people who are currently unemployed or unsure where they want to go, and who perhaps need to be supported more.

We meet everyone who comes into our programme and do not take anybody unless we meet first to determine the level of motivation and suitability.  That is not a bad thing, as we want to ensure people are comfortable signing up for a minimum six-month programme, especially if they have a mortgage - for example, if they are nine months behind on it and they have three kids.  We do not want to waste such people's time.  We want to ensure people will have a great chance of getting a role in the pharmaceutical, medical technology or food sectors.<br\/><br\/>When individuals come on our programme, we have life coaches who engage with everybody on a one-to-one basis to help them understand the position - this is their three-year plan or five-year plan - and help to manage the self-esteem issues or challenges that go side-by-side with being unemployed.  We are engaged in the industry liaison side, helping people understand roles, providing introductions and facilitating matchmaking.  We have developed a tailor-made process, and it would have been very hard for an institute of technology to do all that.

It always strikes me as bizarre that although this country is still in an unemployment crisis we have a skills crisis in certain sectors, which is an international skills crisis as such.  According to analysis, what are the skills gaps?  Are there figures on the pharmaceutical and medical technology sectors in the State which show they are shy 5,000 or 2,000 staff?

The basic feedback we have from the industry shows that in the pharmaceutical and medical technology sectors in particular there are still skills gaps at operator level all the way through to specific technical roles, such as validation engineers, commissioning engineers and technology specialists.  From an analytical perspective in the laboratory, there are also many gaps.  We see opportunities to match these to unemployed people.  If people do not have a third level qualification, their first would be at operator level.  If people come to us with a degree in environmental science or another science qualification, they transition into laboratory roles.  The validation-engineer-type roles which are cited as being a gap are rarely entry-level positions.

My bank manager asked me many of those questions in terms of business growth.  How long have we been in business?  I founded the company in 2009, so we have been in business for six years.  Approximately 40% or 45% of the work is on the education side and the other half is on the technology side.  Do we charge?  No.  For State-funded projects, we do not charge anything on top of that - whether to the individual or the company.  There are no placement fees or anything of that nature.  We offer private programmes for people working in the pharmaceutical, medical device or food sectors.  Our master's degree programmes are popular but there are also many people with a leaving certificate who are working in the pharma sector and who might have been doing so for the past 20 years.  They are being encouraged by their employers to start thinking about third level.  We are starting to engage with operators and technicians to get their first ever qualifications.  That is part-funded by both industry and the employee.<\/p> <p>  Senator Mullins asked whether we charge on the non-Springboard side.  We engage with pharma companies and medical device technology companies to try to develop bespoke programmes for them.  However, that is a long process.  We try to engage with various pharma companies to improve things, particularly on the pharma business side.  Often these companies have supervisors who are good at operating a schedule and managing three or four people.  The companies want these supervisors to elevate to team leader or manager positions where they can manage ten people, communicate the plan for the coming three months and so on.  These pharma business programmes are proving to be very successful with industry.<\/p> <p>  There was a question about at-risk companies.  It is a tricky question.  What are the indicators which determine a company is at risk?  I can offer examples of how we engaged with the Lufthansa employees but that case was after the fact.  Some of those individuals were unemployed for six months before they came on one of our programmes.  We would like to intervene earlier and act as a partner with at-risk companies earlier in the process.  Given that I have name-checked Lufthansa, I am keen to point out that those involved have been brilliant employees in the transition to the pharma and medical devices technology sectors.

The timetable at national school level needs to be rotated to ensure, for example, that Irish is not the only subject taught between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.  Subjects need to be rotated and it is important for all our children that we become comfortable with change as opposed to the <i>status quo<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015110300002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ian Jones"},{"type":"speech","time":1446557400,"counter":79,"content":"<p>FIT, the fast track into technology programme, was referred to by an earlier speaker.

I must be honest and state that I do not know much about the programme to which the Chairman refers or the opportunities available to expand into the rest of Europe.  However, we would be interested in understanding more about this issue.  We know, for example, that the Spanish pharmaceutical market is similar in size to the market in Ireland, employing approximately 40,000 employees directly and indirectly.  The Irish and Spanish markets are, therefore, a good fit, as is the market in Italy.  There may be opportunities elsewhere, particularly in areas where unemployment levels are high, notably among those aged under 25 years.  With good science and engineering qualifications, there could be a good fit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2015110300002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ian Jones"},{"type":"speech","time":1446557400,"counter":81,"content":"<p>If it would be helpful, we will put Dr. Jones in touch with FIT to establish how it linked in with Europe to secure funding to roll out its programme in other countries.
