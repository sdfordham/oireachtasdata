It aims to enhance the employability and mobility of disadvantaged and unemployed persons by providing work experience and training opportunities for them within their communities. In addition, it helps long-term unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine.  CE schemes are typically sponsored by groups wishing to benefit the local community, namely voluntary and community organisations and, to a lesser extent, public bodies involved in not-for-profit activities. Such projects provide a valuable service to local communities while, at the same time, providing training and educational opportunities to job-seekers.<\/p><p>  In 2013, the Department provided an additional 2,000 places bringing the number of CE places to 25,300 for 2014. There are approximately 1,000 CE schemes throughout the country at any one time providing services which range from childcare and social care to community support and drug rehabilitation.  The budget for 2015 is &euro;357m which is an increase of circa &euro;22m on this year to reflect the full year implementation costs of the additional 2,000 places next year. The Department is fully committed to the future of this programme and will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the participants and the valuable contribution it makes to local communities.<\/p><p>  With regard to a CE pension scheme, in July 2008, the Labour Court recommended that an agreed pension scheme should be introduced for CE supervisors and assistant supervisors and that such a scheme should be adequately funded by F&Aacute;S, the agency responsible for CE at that time.  The Department of Social Protection is now responsible for CE.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the position of this Department in rejecting that liability for these costs should be met from public funds, this matter has been the subject of discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (D\/PER) and the unions representing CE supervisors.  The D\/PER&rsquo;s position, as outlined to the unions, is that companies contracted by the State to provide a service, including in the community sector, will have to manage their expenditure pressures, including labour and pension costs, from within existing funding levels. <\/p><p>  Given the level of funding that would be required from the Department, the implementation of the claim is not considered sustainable in light of the current and on-going fiscal environment and the requirement to contain public expenditure.  The costs of the introduction of any scheme are likely to be of the order of &euro;3m per annum. <\/p><p>  It should also be noted that this Department is not the employer of CE supervisors and such employees are not public servants but are employees of the sponsoring organisations.  The responsibilities of the sponsoring organisations as employers and the individuals concerned as employees must also be considered. <\/p><p>  Employers (including CE Sponsoring Organisations) are legally obliged to offer access to at least one Standard Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) under the Pension (Amendment) Act 2002.

The Department is committed to delivering a high quality customer service to all its customers. Each week the Department delivers social welfare payments to in excess of 1.5 million customers.  In 2013, it answered 8.3 million telephone calls, processed 2.1 million applications and carried out 1.1 million control reviews.<br\/><br\/>The Department&rsquo;s Customer Charter and Action Plan 2013 - 2015 sets out the level of service customers can expect when dealing with the Department and its commitment to provide a professional, efficient, courteous and timely service to all customers.  The Customer Charter is prominently displayed in all public offices and is also available on the Department&rsquo;s website at .<br\/><br\/>I wish to assure the Deputy that the Department is committed to ensuring that a customer service ethos is embedded in everything it does and is embraced by everyone in the organisation.  Accordingly, since 2011, almost 3,000 staff throughout the Department have been supported with learning and development in the area of customer service, as part of a comprehensive suite of training.<br\/><br\/>In the event a customer is dissatisfied with the standard of service they receive, they should contact the staff member or section involved to have the matter resolved.  If this does not resolve the issue to their satisfaction, they can make a formal complaint to the Quality<font color=\"#C20000\"> <\/font>Customer Service Team in person, by telephone, in writing or on line at .  Their complaint will be dealt with promptly, fairly and impartially.  Receipt of the complaint will be acknowledged, and it will be referred to a complaints officer for investigation.  A response to the customer normally issues within 15 working days of the date of receipt of the complaint.  If the complaint remains unresolved, the customer has the right of further appeal to the Office of the Ombudsman.

This redesign included the roll out of a new integrated Intreo model of service delivery nationwide.  To date, some 44 of the Departments social welfare local offices have been re-launched as Intreo centres, with work continuing the remaining 16 offices.  The Intreo model provides for the seamless integration of services to jobseekers from the first day of their unemployment until their return to work.  It involves the traditional claims process allied with the Department's activation supports and recourse to the Department's Community Welfare Service where required.<br\/><br\/>I wish to advise the Deputy that the Department is fully committed to ensuring that claims are processed as expeditiously as possible and that backlogs of claims are kept to a minimum.  Each scheme area is continuously monitored and reviewed to ensure customers are responded to as quickly as possible.  Where difficulties arise, the Department moves to address these as speedily as possible, within the operating constraints in place.  In this regard, the Department has had major success in clearing backlogs, notably in the disability and caring schemes.  It must also be remembered that processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.  Schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness-related schemes, can take longer to process.  Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process. <br\/><br\/>As part of the Department&rsquo;s programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.  <br\/><br\/>In addition, the staffing needs of the Department are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000061#WRA03700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Private Rented Accommodation Costs and Controls","counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000061#WRA03800"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[47000\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000061#WRA03900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"in view of the welcomed partial return of the Christmas bonus for social welfare recipients if she will acknowledge the need for a similar gesture by legislating to stop the discriminating practice of allowing the no rent allowance advertisement accompanying rental properties as it is contributing to making it impossible for persons on rent allowance to find a place to live; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":41,"content":"<p>The reintroduction of the Christmas bonus, albeit on a partial basis, along with the other welfare measures announced in the Budget are real indicators of the economic recovery and the Government&rsquo;s ambition to ensure it will be a recovery felt by all.

CA must be reviewed once a care recipient reaches 16 years in order to ensure that the care requirement of the child meets the statutory conditions for receipt of CA.<\/p><p>  There has been a long-standing process to notify DCA recipients at least 6 months in advance that DCA will stop when the child reaches 16 and that continued entitlement to CA would be reviewed.  The purpose of that communication is to ensure that parents are aware of what is going to happen, their future options and to give them time to gather the necessary information. That communication also draws the attention of the parent to the potential eligibility of the child for DA.<\/p><p>  The Department is reviewing its communications with parents who are in receipt of both domiciliary care allowance (DCA) and carer's allowance (CA) for children who are reaching 16 years, to  further emphasise to the parent the importance of supplying sufficiently detailed information from the child's doctor(s) and other healthcare professionals, schools etc to the Department at the outset.  The notification will also state the conditions which need to be met in relation to CA (which are not the same as those for receipt of DCA).  It is hoped that this will reduce the number of CA cases that are stopped at first instance but subsequently reinstated upon review of additional information supplied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000061#WRA06100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Payments","counter":66,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000061#WRA06200"},{"type":"question","counter":67,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[47094\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000061#WRA06300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reasons she has ruled out the raising of the caps on rent assistance when they are well below the market rents for houses and contributing to the ongoing housing crisis; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":68,"content":"<p>There are currently approximately 71,800 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.<\/p><p>  I am keeping the matter regarding rent limits under consideration and the review being undertaken by the Department will be finalised shortly.<\/p><p>  The Department is in a position of both significant influence in the private rented market and responsibility.

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. This strategy is working. Employment has risen by about 85,000 since the recovery began in 2012. The unemployment rate, according to the most recent Live Register figures for November, is falling and is currently at 10.7%, the lowest rate in over 5 years &ndash; and is down from a peak of 15.1% in 2012. <br\/><br\/>The most recent QNHS figures for long term unemployment show that since the peak in Q1 2012 of 204,000, the numbers had fallen by 65,100 as of Q3 2014, a reduction of 31.9% (see Figure 1 below). The percentage of the labour force who are long-term unemployed (the long-term unemployment rate) rose from 8.2% in 2011 Q1 to 9.5% in Q1 2012 before falling over the last two years to a recent low of 6.4% in Q3 2014. <br\/><br\/>The most recent figures also show youth unemployment down by 11,400 year-on year to 48,400 in Q3 2014, equating to an unemployment rate of 23.2%.<br\/><br\/>Nevertheless, despite the progress that has been made, the Government recognises that both long-term unemployment and youth unemployment remain unacceptably high. People who are long-term unemployed account for 58% of total unemployment and within the overall number who are more than 12 months unemployed the number that are two and three years unemployed is particularly worrying.  It is clear that some people who became unemployed at the height of the jobs crisis in 2009 have found it particularly difficult to find employment. Hence, the Government recognises the need for additional activation measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created as the economy recovers are taken up by long-term and young Live Registrants. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee, both of which are being led by the Department of Social Protection.  <br\/><br\/>In Pathways to Work 2012, a target was set for the Department of Social Protection of moving 75,000 of those who were long-term live registrants at the end of 2011 into employment by the end of 2015. Up to the end of the third quarter of 2014, over 65,000 of this group had moved into, and remain in, employment. Given progress to date, the Department is on course to reach its 2015 target. <br\/><br\/>The latest iteration of the Pathways to Work Strategy - Pathways to Work 2015 - includes a wide range of programmes and services to help long term unemployed jobseekers back to employment. These include programmes such as JobBridge, JobsPlus and Momentum introduced by this Government and schemes such as Community Employment and T&uacute;s, where the Department has significantly increased the number of places available. JobsPlus is targeted specifically at encouraging employers to recruit people who are long-term unemployed.  Almost 3,000 long-term unemployed people have been placed in employment as a result of JobsPlus and over 60% of these have been unemployed for 2 years or more.<br\/><br\/>Pathways to Work 2015 also includes arrangements to increase the level of systematic engagement of the employment services with those who are out of work for long periods. There is also a specific focus on employer engagement to encourage employers to recruit from the Live Register.<br\/><br\/>The most recent figures for participation on the main activation programmes are set out in the table below: <br\/><br\/><b>Activation Programmes (October 2013 and October 2014) <\/b><br\/><br\/><b>Live Register Activation Programmes (Number) by Type of Activation<\/b><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><b>Programme and Month<\/b><div><\/div><table><tr><th><b><\/b><\/th><th><b>Oct 2013<\/b><\/th><th><b>Oct 2014<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b>Back to Work payments<\/b><\/td><td><b><\/b><\/td><td><b><\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Back to work allowance scheme - employee strand<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Back to work enterprise allowance scheme - self employed strand<\/td><td>10269<\/td><td>10897<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Short-term enterprise allowance<\/td><td>708<\/td><td>516<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Total back to work payments<\/b><\/td><td><b>10989<\/b><\/td><td><b>11418<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b><\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Other activation programmes<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DSP part-time job incentive<\/td><td>243<\/td><td>384<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TUS - community work placement initiative<\/td><td>6849<\/td><td>7683<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>JobBridge<\/td><td>6174<\/td><td>6599<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Total other activation programmes<\/b><\/td><td><b>13266<\/b><\/td><td><b>14666<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b><\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Community employment schemes (excluding supervisors)<\/b><\/td><td>21806<\/td><td>22815<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>FAS full time training for unemployed people<\/b><\/td><td>9145<\/td><td>8434<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b><\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Back to education courses<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Vocational training opportunities scheme (VTOS)<\/td><td>5000<\/td><td>5000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Back to education allowance (BTEA)<\/td><td>24432<\/td><td>21201<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Total back to education courses<\/b><\/td><td><b>29432<\/b><\/td><td><b>26201<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b><\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Total activation programmes<\/b><\/td><td><b>84638<\/b><\/td><td><b>83534<\/b><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/>Back to Work allowance scheme - Employee strand: This scheme was closed to new applications from 1st May 2009.<br\/><br\/>Short-term Enterprise Allowance: This scheme was introduced from 1st May 2009.

The implementation of the Guarantee is a medium-term policy of the Irish Government. The guarantee of an offer of training, education or work experience for those aged less than 25 years after a four month period is currently being implemented on a phased basis. Processes and programmes are being progressively rolled out to ensure that all of those young unemployed people who need most support (i.e. are assessed as having a low probability of securing employment in the absence of support from the Public Employment Services) will receive a Youth Guarantee offer within four months. During 2014&ndash;2015 all long-term unemployed young people under 25 will be engaged by the Public Employment Service and will receive a Youth Guarantee offer if still unemployed after four months of this engagement process commencing. <br\/><br\/>With respect to evaluation of the impact of Pathways to Work and the Youth Guarantee, it cannot be precisely separated from the impact of other factors affecting the decline in long-term unemployment (such as the general improvement in the economy and the labour market resulting from the government&rsquo;s overall economic and employment policies).  A full evaluation of the Pathways to Work programme will be commissioned next year which will seek to quantify what aspects of Pathways to Work are most effective and the reasons for their effectiveness.<br\/><br\/>With respect to age profiling those on the live register, the Department of Social Protection keeps a detailed breakdown of the profiles of jobseekers. Data on each client&rsquo;s age, past occupation, and his\/her education, is collected at the point of registration for job-seekers&rsquo; payment; these and other relevant data are processed and the probability of exiting the live register is calculated (PEX). This is essentially a predictor of whether or not someone will become long-term unemployed.  The roll-out of the profiling system at the Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; Intreo offices implicitly involves age profiling of the long-term unemployed, as age is one of the main determining variables in predicting if someone will become long-term unemployed. In other words, if someone is in an age category that is more likely to experience long-term unemployment, s\/he will, all other things being equal, receive more targeted assistance.  <br\/><br\/>Summary statistical information on the clients&rsquo; age (under\/over 25), duration of unemployment (under\/over one year), and last held occupation together with other demographic and regional information is published on the Central Statistics Office website. <br\/><br\/><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000062#WRB03900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Anti-Poverty Strategy","counter":108,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000062#WRB04000"},{"type":"question","counter":109,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[47331\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000062#WRB04100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which measures to alleviate poverty arising budget 2015 continue to make positive impact; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":110,"content":"<p>One of the key objectives of Budget 2015 was to assist unemployed families to return to work.<\/p><p> Through the new Back to Work Family Dividend scheme, long-term unemployed jobseekers with children who leave welfare to return to work can retain the child-related portion of their social welfare payment on a tapered basis over two years.  This includes those who move to self-employment, such as the construction sector.  It will also apply to One Parent Family Payment recipients who similarly go back into the workforce.  The scheme will be worth &euro;1,550 per child in the first year of employment or self-employment and half that amount again in the second year. <\/p><p>  The Dividend will help increase the pace of the progress we are making in helping people back to work, thereby reducing poverty.  It will help boost the recovery, reduce welfare expenditure in the long-run, and, most importantly, help the families in question to build a better financial future for themselves. <\/p><p>  The Budget also provided for the expansion of JobsPlus to provide subsidies to employers to recruit and employ an additional 3,000 long-term unemployed jobseekers.  This scheme has proven to be particularly successful with the longer-term unemployed (i.e. unemployed for more than two years.)<\/p><p>  I was also pleased to be in the position to increase Child Benefit from &euro;130 to &euro;135 per month, which will benefit over 611,000 households with children. This will help all families with children but also has the additional benefit for unemployed families in that it is work neutral as it is retained in full when they return to the workforce.<\/p><p>  I also announced, on Budget Day, a number of welfare initiatives which will benefit pensioners, carers and people with disabilities who are in receipt of a welfare payment. These initiatives included the re-introduction of a Christmas Bonus and an increase in the Living Alone Allowance.<\/p><p>  The Christmas Bonus was abolished by the previous Government in 2009. I am pleased to say that I am in a position to partially restore the Bonus this year. A bonus of 25% was paid last week to long-term welfare recipients including all pensioners, people with disabilities, carers and long-term jobseekers. This will cost over &euro;65 million and is in recognition of the position of vulnerable households.<\/p><p>  There will be an increase in the living alone allowance of &euro;1.30 per week from January, bringing the rate up from &euro;7.70 to &euro;9 for pensioners and people with disabilities.  The living alone allowance is a payment made to pensioners and people with disabilities who live alone and was last increased in 1996. <\/p><p>  As well as the measures mentioned above, all existing welfare payments and supports for pensioners will be maintained in 2015 &ndash; there will be no reductions. <\/p><p>  Throughout the crisis, this Government protected core weekly welfare rates and maintained a massively strong social welfare safety net. That was a political choice which this Government made very deliberately; it is not one that was followed in other bailout countries. This is acknowledged by the ESRI, among others, which has pointed out that, unlike in other countries, income inequality has fallen in Ireland in recent years, largely because of the overall maintenance of the welfare system. <\/p><p>  This is the first Budget where we have had the scope to make real positive improvement for welfare recipients. This is evidenced by the &euro;65 million we are spending on the Bonus as well as &euro;198 million of new welfare developments which I announced in the Budget and which will come into effect next year.  It is hoped that with the continuing betterment of economic conditions, further resources will be freed up for future Budgets.  <\/p><p>  Social transfers play a crucial role in redistributing resources to those most in need. In 2012, social transfers (excluding pensions) reduced the at-risk-of poverty rate from 39 per cent to 16.5 per cent, thereby lifting one fifth of the Irish population out of income poverty.<\/p><p>  Ireland is amongst the best performing EU countries in reducing poverty through social transfers (excluding pensions). Using comparable data from Eurostat from 2012, Ireland&rsquo;s performance in reducing poverty at 60 per cent was far in excess of the EU-28 norm of 35 per cent.<\/p><p>  Social impact assessment is an evidence-based methodology to estimate the likely distributive effects of policy proposals on poverty and social inequality, including the impact on family types, lifecycle groups and gender. <\/p><p>  The Department published an integrated social impact assessments of Budgets 2013 and 2014 (using the ESRI SWITCH model) which included the main welfare and tax measures. <\/p><p>  The Department is currently preparing a social impact assessment of the main welfare, tax and related measures for 2015.  This will be finalised to take account of government decisions relating to water charges and affordability. It is intended to publish the analysis as soon as is feasible (when available).  Furthermore, the Government has committed to carrying out a social impact assessment of the main taxation and welfare measures before the publishing of budgets by a cross-Department body led by the Departments of Finance, Social Protection and Public Expenditure and Reform. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000062#WRB04200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Waiting Times","counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000062#WRB04300"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[47332\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000062#WRB04400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which she may continue to improve the time taken to process appeals in respect of various social protection payments; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":113,"content":"<p>The average appeal processing time for 2012, 2013 and 2014 broken down by all social welfare scheme types is outlined in the tables below. <br\/><br\/>Appeal processing times peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 the average processing time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks and the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  Further improvements were achieved in 2013, when the average appeal processing time reduced to 33.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.8 weeks for a summary decision, and also in 2014.  As at 30 November 2014, the average time taken to process an appeal requiring an oral hearing was 28.7 weeks and for a summary decision was 21.4 weeks.  <br\/><br\/>Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system. By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.<br\/><br\/>There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office.  Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the number of appeals received peaked at 35,484, reducing to 32,777 appeals in 2013. In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the improvement in processing times, these measures have also led to a significant increase in the annual number of appeals finalised in the appeals office from 17,787 in 2009 to 38,421 in 2013.  An additional 5,863 appeals were finalised in 2013 compared to 2012.  Good progress has also been made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 9,769  at 1 December 2014.<br\/><br\/>In addition the Department has undertaken a process of reform in many of its scheme areas aimed at reducing the time taken to respond to requests for submissions in relation to appeals. It is anticipated that with these improvements, the processing times for appeals will continue to improve.  Appeal processing times are kept under continual review in the Social Welfare Appeals Office.<br\/><br\/>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<br\/><br\/><b>2012 - Appeals Processing times by scheme 1\/1\/2012 - 31\/12\/2012<\/b><table><tr><th><\/th><th>Average processing times (weeks)<br \/><br \/>Summary Decisions<\/th><th>Average processing times (weeks)<br \/><br \/>Oral Hearings<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Adoptive Benefit<\/td><td>27.7<\/td><td>40.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Blind Pension<\/td><td>24.4<\/td><td>34.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carers Allowance<\/td><td>33.5<\/td><td>42.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carers Benefit<\/td><td>27.3<\/td><td>35.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Child Benefit<\/td><td>47.1<\/td><td>53.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance<\/td><td>34.2<\/td><td>40.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit<\/td><td>41.9<\/td><td>50.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Domiciliary Care<\/td><td>32.5<\/td><td>41.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Deserted Wives Benefit<\/td><td>27.6<\/td><td>45.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Deserted Wives Allowance<\/td><td>24.5<\/td><td>39.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Farm Assist<\/td><td>23.4<\/td><td>44.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Bereavement Grant<\/td><td>29.0<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Family Income Supplement<\/td><td>22.8<\/td><td>31.2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension<\/td><td>38.8<\/td><td>48.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Liable Relatives<\/td><td>33.9<\/td><td>69.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>One Parent Family Payment<\/td><td>29.4<\/td><td>44.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit<\/td><td>30.8<\/td><td>41.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)<\/td><td>33.2<\/td><td>59.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension (Non-Cont)<\/td><td>27.7<\/td><td>51.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension (Transition)<\/td><td>25.1<\/td><td>49.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit<\/td><td>19.5<\/td><td>66.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit (Medical)<\/td><td>78.7<\/td><td>87.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Disablement Pension<\/td><td>35.7<\/td><td>46.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Incapacity Supplement<\/td><td>14.2<\/td><td>48.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Con)<\/td><td>25.8<\/td><td>49.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Non-con)<\/td><td>32.0<\/td><td>58.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Pre-Retirement Allowance<\/td><td>54.6<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Means)<\/td><td>22.8<\/td><td>38.2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance<\/td><td>24.4<\/td><td>34.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Benefit<\/td><td>20.9<\/td><td>30.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Respite Care Grant<\/td><td>28.5<\/td><td>37.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Insurability of Employment<\/td><td>45.6<\/td><td>83.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Supplementary Welfare  Allowance<\/td><td>17.6<\/td><td>22.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Treatment Benefits<\/td><td>19.0<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Con)<\/td><td>27.1<\/td><td>60.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Non-con)<\/td><td>30.9<\/td><td>39.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Widows Parent Grant<\/td><td>23.2<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>All Appeals<\/td><td>27.8<\/td><td>39.5<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000062#WRB04500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":114,"content":"<p>2013 - Appeals processing times by scheme 01\/01\/2013 &ndash;

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives and the reform measures introduced to date go somewhat toward that goal.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension all contributions paid over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age is taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. <\/p><p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Therefore, to qualify for a state pension a person must:<\/p><p>  - have at least 520 paid contributions and <\/p><p>  - satisfy a yearly average (a yearly average of 48 is required for a full rate pension).<\/p><p>  There have been significant changes to the PRSI system over the years which have increased social insurance coverage to most classes of working people.  Accordingly, under the pension reform programme, it is planned to adopt a total contributions approach where the number of contributions paid over a work life will more closely reflect the rate of pension payment received.  For example, in a model where 30 years contributions (1560) would qualify a person for a maximum State pension (contributory), a person could accumulate 1\/30th of a pension for each year of contributions up to a maximum of 30\/30ths, inclusive of a certain number of credits. <\/p><p>  The proposed date for the introduction of a move to a total contributions approach is 2020, but this may be subject to change as it is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation.  <\/p><p>  It should be noted that the pension system has evolved over decades, largely to the benefit of pensioners, and that it has generally been the case that the system at retirement is the one used to calculate pension rates, rather than the rules that pertained when they commenced employment.  Accordingly, while it isn&rsquo;t possible to be definitive about the potential impact of changes on individuals, I can assure the Deputy that contributions paid and credited under existing rules will continue to be used as part of the calculations in a new approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000063#WRC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":142,"content":"<p>Question No. 55 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":143,"content":"<p>Question No. 56 answered with Question No. 40.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":144,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 57 and 58 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Eligibility","counter":145,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000063#WRC01500"},{"type":"question","counter":146,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[47458\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000063#WRC01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the fact that long term sick claimants of illness benefit supports are not permitted to avail of the Christmas bonus announced recently for unemployed recipients; her plans to widen the Christmas bonus qualifying criteria for persons claiming illness benefit for up to eight years and more; if she will widen the fuel allowance scheme to allow these claimants to avail of equal treatment than those availing of unemployment supports; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":147,"content":"<p>The Christmas bonus was paid last week to over 1.2 million long-term social welfare recipients at a cost of &euro;65 million.

individual or a company file their tax return late, a surcharge known as a late filing surcharge applies.\u00a0 The current rate of surcharge for late filing of Income Tax and Corporation Tax returns is:-<\/p><p>  - 5% of the tax due\u00a0 subject to a maximum of &euro;12,695 where the return of income is delivered\u00a0 before the expiry of 2 months from the specified return date for the chargeable period, or<\/p><p>  - 10% of the amount of tax due subject to a maximum of &euro;63,485, where the return of income is not delivered before the expiry of 2 months from the specified return date for the chargeable period.<\/p><p>  I am also advised that up until recently certain accounts details were an integral part of Income Tax and Corporation Tax returns and relevant accounts information was provided on the appropriate tax return.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  Since November 2012, taxpayers have had the option to file separate financial statements in iXBRL format using Revenue's Online Service (ROS).\u00a0 iXBRL (inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language) is a language which allows financial information to be communicated and presented in a format that may be recognised and read by both people and computers.\u00a0 A mandatory requirement to file iXBRL financial statements as part of a tax return now exists on a statutory basis and, in line with the approach that Revenue took with e-filing, this is being introduced on a phased basis.\u00a0 To date, the mandatory regime applies only to larger companies.\u00a0 During later phases, all companies, as well as individuals, will come within the mandatory regime.\u00a0 In the meantime, individuals, and companies not covered by the mandatory regime, continue to provide certain accounts details in their appropriate tax return form.\u00a0 To allow for the transition to the mandatory regime, I am informed that Revenue has made certain concessions for taxpayers on the filing deadline for the submission of the iXBRL financial statements.<\/p><p>  I am further advised that a late filing surcharge also applies to Local Property Tax (LPT) returns.\u00a0 Where a person who is liable for LPT files a return for income tax or corporation tax and, at the time of filing the income tax or corporation tax return they have failed to file their LPT return and make their LPT payment as due, a surcharge of 10% of the amount of income tax or corporation tax payable will be applied. \u00a0If the liable person becomes LPT compliant the surcharge will be capped at the amount of the LPT liability. <\/p><p>  Regarding penalties, I am advised, that where a person fraudulently or negligently delivers an incorrect return on time that return is deemed to have been delivered late and the surcharge for late filing is applied. \u00a0However, where, in the context of a Revenue compliance intervention, a tax geared penalty is applied by Revenue under section 1077E Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 on the additional tax arising due to the fraud or neglect it has been Revenue practice not to seek an additional late filing surcharge in these circumstances.\u00a0 In the current Finance Bill I have placed that Revenue practice on a legislative footing.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>  With reference to the charging of interest, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that interest is charged on late payments and is not related to timely filing.\u00a0 The current rates of interest on late payments are 8% per annum or 0.0219% per day, on overdue income, corporation, capital gains taxes or stamp duty, and 10% per annum or 0.0274% per day in respect of overdue VAT and Employers PAYE\/PRSI.\u00a0\u00a0 The rates were reviewed in the Finance Act 2009 and were reduced then from 10% and 11.7% per annum to the current rates of 8% and 10% as outlined above. \u00a0<\/p><p>  The self-assessment system provides for sanctions to address non-compliance relating to timely tax return filing and payment.\u00a0 These sanctions, as well as other factors, help to maximise the levels of voluntary compliance and their impact is borne out by the fact that the overwhelming majority of taxpayers file and pay their taxes on time.<\/p><p>  The late filing surcharge is designed as a deterrent and encourages timely filing and payment.\u00a0 I am pleased to see that compliance levels are increasing annually and any measure that might impact would need very careful deliberation. <\/p><p>  It is my view that the sanctions provided for in legislation are proportionate and reasonable and they are applied fairly by the Revenue Commissioners.\u00a0 On that basis I have no plans to review the late filing surcharge and other similar sanctions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000063#WRC03300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property

Where a liable person no longer satisfies the necessary conditions, amounts deferred prior to the date on which eligibility ceased may continue to be deferred. The deferred amount, including interest, will attach to the property and will have to be paid before the property is sold or transferred.

Mayo, and included in my reply to PQ No 45780\/14 on 2 December 2014 were in fact incorrect, and that the correct figures are shown in the above table.\u00a0 The Commissioners advise me that the error in the previous figures arose because of some duplicates in the Revenue database of complaints received, and because some complaints were attributed to the incorrect county. I am assured that these database errors have now been corrected and I am pleased to avail of this opportunity to amend the record.<br\/><br\/>Normally when 'fraudsters' attempt to stretch petrol, they add methanol, kerosene or other low excise duty agents. To-date 208 samples have been referred by Revenue to the State Laboratory for analysis. Despite extensive testing by the State Laboratory, no evidence of any prohibited stretching agent has been found in any of the samples, except two samples taken from one site.\u00a0 The conclusive results received in that particular case has resulted in the seizure of the product and closure of the facility and a file is being prepared for prosecution.<br\/><br\/>Following a series of further tests conducted by the State Laboratory, results have been received in the last two weeks which indicate the presence of traces of road diesel in several samples taken from a variety of locations. This could indicate that petrol was contaminated with road diesel at some point in time. There is no rational economic reason or fraudulent incentive for anyone to deliberately mix normal road diesel with petrol. This contamination could have taken place earlier in the summer, well ahead of the problems manifesting themselves in cars in Co. Mayo and elsewhere. <br\/><br\/>If the problems that have come to light were caused by an unintended contamination as a result of diesel being inadvertently mixed into petrol at some point along the supply chain, there would be no Revenue offence involved. However, the Deputies can be assured that the Revenue Commissioners are vigorously investigating the possibility of tax fraud being associated with the identified problems. In any instances where the analysis of petrol samples by the State Laboratory indicates the presence of illegal stretching agents, Revenue will take swift and robust action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible.<br\/><br\/>I am also advised by Revenue that they undertake, on an ongoing basis, an extensive programme of compliance and enforcement actions to ensure adherence to the legal requirements governing the supply and sale of mineral oil and to allow action to be taken against fraud. This involves, among other things, carrying out analysis of the monthly oil movement returns that oil traders are required to make, and of other supply chain data. In addition, Revenue officers conduct control or compliance visits to mineral oil traders, during which they examine transport and movement documentation and take samples of fuel for analysis.<br\/><br\/>The Revenue Commissioners are working closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and share information and intelligence on this issue. \u00a0Also, as part of Revenue's normal operating procedures, fuel delivery tankers are challenged when encountered by enforcement officers, particularly throughout the Border Midlands West Region.\u00a0 No cases of contaminated petrol have been identified as a result of these checks from June 2014 to date. <br\/><br\/>I wish to assure the Deputies that I am satisfied the Revenue Commissioners\u00a0 are allocating resources to this issue and taking\u00a0 all possible actions to identify the problem and challenge any instances of identified fuel fraud including, where possible, pursuing prosecutions against offenders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000063#WRC04000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Administration","counter":171,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000063#WRC04100"},{"type":"question","counter":172,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[47476\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000063#WRC04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding property tax name change in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Limerick; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1056","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":173,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the issues to which the Deputy refers occurred because the property was registered for Local Property Tax (LPT) using the PPS number of the deceased spouse of the person in question.

Furthermore, with Russia and China accounting for 27% of the traded world market in the dairy sector, the effect of surplus stocks in the Chinese market along with the displacement effect of the Russian ban can be seen as critical factors in setting the context for price evolution in the sector.   <\/p><p>  The anticipated decline in 2015 \u00a0largely reflects the impact of the aforementioned developments on global dairy markets. Teagasc expects that average Irish milk prices in 2015 will fall to 27 cent per litre, a reduction of over 10 cent per litre on the average for 2014. However it should be noted that this follows several years of very good incomes on dairy farms. Furthermore, Teagasc are clear that these negative effects are expected to be temporary in nature. <\/p><p>  Under the new Common Agriculture Policy there is a range of tools available to mitigate the worst impact of downward price volatility, including Aids to Private Storage, Intervention and Export Refunds and I have called on the EU Commission to deploy these tools as appropriate. The Single Farm Payment will also provide a measure of income stability during this difficult period. I have also asked the banking sector to tailor their financial products \u00a0to allow for the kind of price volatility that will be a feature of international dairy markets, and\u00a0 of course\u00a0 co-ops have a role to play in ensuring that their contractual arrangements with suppliers provide a measure of stability. \u00a0A focus on innovation and the production of added value products will also have a role to play in mitigating the impact of volatility, and a greater use of futures markets may also feature among the tools deployed by the sector.<\/p><p>  In terms of how this will evolve in the medium term, Teagasc, in common with a number of other commentators, anticipate that lower milk prices will lead to a slowdown in the expansion of milk production globally through 2015, with global dairy markets set to witness signs of recovery as the year progresses. In the medium to longer term population growth and increasing affluence in developing countries will continue to drive strong growth in demand for dairy products, and Irish producers will be well placed to take full advantage of this demand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000064#WRD03700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Relations","counter":214,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000064#WRD03800"},{"type":"question","counter":215,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[47470\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000064#WRD03900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he proposes to raise at the next EU Agriculture Council the need for the European Commission to introduce adequate market support measures following the negative effects of the ban imposed by Russia on products from the EU; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":216,"content":"<p>I can confirm that, at the next meeting of the Council of EU Agriculture Ministers, I will impress on the Commissioner the need for adequate market support measures to address the negative effects of the Russian ban on agri-food products from the EU.

The Act stipulates that the Ombudsman Commission is statutorial independent in the exercise of its functions and I have no role in the processing of individual complaints which are referred to it for investigation.<\/p><p>  Under the Act a complaint can be made direct to the Ombudsman Commission.  It can also be made to the Garda Commissioner, any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in a Garda station or a member at or above Chief Superintendent rank at a place other than a Garda station, who will forward it to the Garda Ombudsman.  Complaints to GSOC must be referred for investigation within six months of occurrence of the incident.  However, there is provision for GSOC to extend the time limit if it considers that there are good reasons for doing so. <\/p><p>  After receiving a complaint the GSOC will determine whether it is admissible. Where a complaint is inadmissible (e.g. the alleged behaviour would not constitute misbehaviour, or the complaint is not made within the required timeframe), the complainant is notified of the reason that it is inadmissible in writing.<\/p><p>  GSOC may refer less serious complaints for resolution through the Mediation or Informal Resolution process. GSOC directly investigates complaints involving allegations of criminality, and its investigative staff have full police powers to do this.  It may refer other complaints to the Garda Commissioner for investigation under the Garda disciplinary code, and it may maintain oversight of progress in those investigations.<\/p><p>  GSOC has the authority to make recommendations to the Garda Commissioner concerning disciplinary proceedings, and also to send a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions where it feels that the conduct under investigation may constitute an offence.<\/p><p>  Under s103 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 the Ombudsman Commission is required to provide the complainant with sufficient information to keep them informed of both the progress and the results of an investigation. I am informed by GSOC that, in cases where they are making a recommendation to the Garda Commissioner concerning disciplinary proceedings, they generally provide complainants with information regarding the nature of the recommendation.<\/p><p>  GSOC is not empowered to take disciplinary action against a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Under section 26 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 it is the Commissioner who has statutory responsibility for the direction and control of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The application of the Disciplinary Regulations is a Garda operational matter and is the sole responsibility of the Commissioner.<\/p><p>  The Garda Commissioner is not obliged to implement recommendations made by GSOC and there is no statutory time-period for the Garda Commissioner to deal with such recommendations. GSOC is entitled, however, to be notified of a decision made under the Disciplinary Regulations concerning a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who is the subject of a recommendation. <\/p><p>  The statistics requested by the Deputy are not readily available and would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort to prepare and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources. GSOC is, however, required under section 80 of the Act to submit an annual report of its activities in the preceding year to me as Minister, and these and other reports from the Ombudsman Commission are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Copies of the 2013 Annual Report are available in the Oireachtas Library and on GSOC's website, www.gardaombudsman.ie. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000065#WRE03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Liquor Licensing Laws","counter":270,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000065#WRE03600"},{"type":"question","counter":271,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[47417\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000065#WRE03700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of test purchases which have been carried out under section 14 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 in the years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and to date in 2014.","asker":"969","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":272,"content":"<p>I have requested a report from the Garda authorities in relation to the matter referred to by the Deputy.

In this regard I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that all reports of petrol stretching are being followed up as a matter of course and samples of fuel are sent to the State Laboratory for scientific analysis where there is reason to suspect excise duty fraud.<br\/><br\/>In addition to analysing samples referred to it, the State Laboratory is providing technical and scientific support for the ongoing investigations as the analysis of potentially stretched petrol is a complex one which, to date, has involved a significant level of time-consuming, non-routine testing bearing in mind the sufficient level of evidence required in order to pursue prosecutions in this area. I am also advised that the volume of samples sent for analysis has necessitated a reallocation of resources within the State Laboratory.<br\/><br\/>In this regard the Laboratory has prioritised the testing of all samples submitted in connection with the petrol stretching issue, and all staff who have the necessary experience and expertise in this area are currently being deployed to work on these samples. If the results of the analysis reveals the presence of any illegal stretching agents, I can assure the Deputy that the Revenue Commissioners take action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where feasible. <br\/><br\/>The practice of petrol stretching is a matter of serious concern to the Government as it results in losses to the Exchequer, threatens legitimate businesses and potentially can cause significant damage to the vehicles of unsuspecting purchasers of adulterated fuel.

I have been informed by the Courts Service that from February 2011 to date,  6,911 fines totalling &euro;1,259,288 have been imposed by the Courts in respect of detections relating to GoSafe safety camera vans. 1,184 fines, totalling &euro;286,060,  are overdue by more than 3 months as of 9 December 2014. <br\/><br\/><b>Details by County and Speed per Km\/H of the Number of Fixed Charge Notices as a result of detection by all speed camera vans November 2010 to February 2014 Speed Limit per Kilometre per Hour<\/b><table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>50 km\/h<\/th><th>60 km\/h<\/th><th>100 km\/h<\/th><th>120 km\/h<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow<\/td><td>3,129<\/td><td>1,226<\/td><td>237<\/td><td>28<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td>6,697<\/td><td>4,855<\/td><td>1,466<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td>16,087<\/td><td>8,380<\/td><td>7,207<\/td><td>32<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>37,066<\/td><td>15,872<\/td><td>16,280<\/td><td>51<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>8,291<\/td><td>7,865<\/td><td>1,928<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>143,344<\/td><td>172,309<\/td><td>5,272<\/td><td>790<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>17,633<\/td><td>11,722<\/td><td>2,756<\/td><td>9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td>3,253<\/td><td>11,293<\/td><td>1,159<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>34,449<\/td><td>11,324<\/td><td>781<\/td><td>267<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td>11,272<\/td><td>8,943<\/td><td>1,226<\/td><td>47<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois<\/td><td>12,601<\/td><td>1,497<\/td><td>1,758<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim<\/td><td>11,461<\/td><td>582<\/td><td>174<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>23,663<\/td><td>15,876<\/td><td>2,241<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td>3,495<\/td><td>610<\/td><td>3,044<\/td><td>872<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>17,456<\/td><td>1,480<\/td><td>2,795<\/td><td>7,077<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo<\/td><td>4,750<\/td><td>1,481<\/td><td>1,112<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td>15,783<\/td><td>3,787<\/td><td>10,597<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td>4,709<\/td><td>1,885<\/td><td>2,689<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly<\/td><td>2,362<\/td><td>2,443<\/td><td>603<\/td><td>5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon<\/td><td>12,831<\/td><td>8,381<\/td><td>2,161<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td>20,769<\/td><td>1,934<\/td><td>730<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary<\/td><td>17,114<\/td><td>888<\/td><td>1,930<\/td><td>261<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td>9,846<\/td><td>8,020<\/td><td>742<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td>5,519<\/td><td>518<\/td><td>2,399<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td>5,617<\/td><td>10,202<\/td><td>2,227<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>11,793<\/td><td>12,863<\/td><td>11,991<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/>Figures are provisional, operational and liable to change. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000065#WRE05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Prevention","counter":289,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000065#WRE05500"},{"type":"question","counter":290,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[47475\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000065#WRE05600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps being taken to deal with the issue of petrol stretching; if any convictions have yet been secured against those involved in the practice; the potential penalties that apply on conviction; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":291,"content":"<p>I am aware that an increasing number of complaints of petrol stretching have been reported to Revenue's Customs Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during 2014. This is a matter of serious concern as petrol stretching, like all forms of fuel fraud, results in losses to the Exchequer, threatens legitimate businesses and potentially can cause significant damage to the vehicles of unsuspecting purchasers of adulterated fuel.<br\/><br\/>Petrol stretching is an offence under section 102 of the Finance Act ,1999 and carries a penalty on summary conviction of &euro;5,000 or, at the discretion of the court, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both. If it is an indictable conviction, the fine is up to a maximum of &euro;126,970 and the prison term is up to a maximum of five years, or both. <br\/><br\/>It is Revenue's Customs Service which takes the enforcement lead nationally in relation to this issue and the Service is supported in this role by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as required. In this regard I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  that all reports of petrol stretching are followed up as a matter of course and samples of fuel are sent to the State Laboratory for scientific analysis where there is reason to suspect excise duty fraud. <br\/><br\/>In addition to analysing samples referred to it, the State Laboratory is providing technical and scientific support for ongoing investigations in this matter as the analysis of potentially stretched petrol is a complex one which, to date, has involved a significant level of time-consuming, non-routine testing bearing in mind the sufficient level of evidence required in order to pursue prosecutions in this area. I am also advised that the volume of samples sent for analysis has necessitated a reallocation of resources within the State Laboratory.<br\/><br\/>In this regard the Laboratory has prioritised the testing of all samples submitted in connection with the petrol stretching issue, and all staff who have the necessary experience and expertise in this area are currently being deployed to work on these samples. If the results of the analysis reveals the presence of any illegal stretching agents, I can assure the Deputy that the Revenue Commissioners take action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where feasible. <br\/><br\/>I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that as part of Revenue's normal operating procedures, fuel delivery tankers are regularly checked by Revenue's enforcement officers. No cases of contaminated petrol have been identified arising from such checks which were carried out during the period from June 2014 to mid - November. <br\/><br\/>With regard to details on the number of convictions secured for petrol stretching offences such information is not readily available to me. However, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency,and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. I have, therefore, requested the CSO to provide all available relevant statistics directly to the Deputy.  <b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000065#WRE05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":292,"content":"<p>Question No. 116 answered with Question No. 87.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":294,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000065#WRE06000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Inquiries","counter":293,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000065#WRE05900"},{"type":"question","counter":294,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[47377\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000065#WRE06000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his plans to include infant mortalities, adoption practices, vaccine trials and medical experimentation, forced labour and incarceration of unmarried girls and women who gave birth to babies or were seen to be at risk of becoming mothers, conditions in the institutions, including neglect, denial of adequate medical care and cruel punishment of unmarried mothers and their infants and children, burials of unmarried mothers and their children and other women who remained in recarceral institutions, from 1922, in the Commission of Investigation into matters relating to Mother and Baby Homes terms of reference.","asker":"1080","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":295,"content":"<p>The Government has undertaken to establish a statutory Commission of Investigation into matters relating to Mother and Baby Homes in accordance with the Motion passed by the D&aacute;il on 11 June.

On 26th November last, I endorsed and launched a further three National Clinical Guidelines. Two of the guidelines promote safety and higher standards in maternity hospitals through standardising an early warning system and clinical handover communication tools. These assist the early identification of deterioration and on-going monitoring of the woman&rsquo;s condition. The third guideline specifically aims to tackle sepsis for patients, both adults and children, in the emergency department and in hospital wards. The guidelines were quality assured by the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee and were subject to international peer review. I should also draw attention to the additional funding of &euro;2m which has been provided in the recently published national service plan to address current pressures in maternity services. The measures proposed include the appointment of additional obstetricians, midwives and other frontline staff. An additional consultant obstetrician post will be assigned to Sligo Regional Hospital.

The EPA has responsibility for the monitoring of air quality in Ireland, and monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants, based on data obtained from the 29 monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network. <br\/><br\/>The EPA publishes an annual report on air quality. The most recent report, <i>Air Quality in Ireland 2013 &ndash; Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality, <\/i>which is available on the EPA website at , was published in October 2014 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2013, compared to CAFE Directive standards as well as assessments in relation to more stringent World Health Organisation (WHO) air quality guidelines for the protection of human health.<br\/><br\/>Ireland currently meets all EU standards for air quality but exceeds WHO guidelines for particulate matter in some areas. Particulate matter levels are of concern, particularly during the winter heating season in areas where the use of solid fuel is prevalent and the sale of &lsquo;smoky&rsquo; coal is permitted. As a result, levels of particulate matter in smaller towns are often higher than those in cities, where &lsquo;smoky&rsquo; coal is banned. <br\/><br\/>The EPA also funds research monitoring and the air pollution levels recorded in Killarney by the Environmental Research Institute of University College Cork are part of this research and elaborate the findings of EPA air quality monitoring at local level. Elevated levels of particulate matter were found to occur in Killarney during the winter evenings and this has been attributed primarily to the burning of solid fuel. The research is endeavoring to attribute the level of air pollution to specific fuels, including coal, peat and wood. <br\/><br\/>The ban on the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of bituminous fuel (or &lsquo;smoky coal ban&rsquo; as it is commonly known) currently applies in 26 urban areas nationwide, including all towns with a population greater than 15,000 people bringing the ban areas broadly into line with national EPA air quality management zones. While the ban does not currently apply in Killarney as its population is below the threshold for compulsory inclusion, local authorities may at any time propose new towns for consideration for inclusion under the ban if it is considered necessary to protect local air quality.<br\/><br\/>While air quality monitoring by the EPA has shown that air quality is poorer in towns where the &lsquo;smoky&rsquo; coal ban does not apply, there is also evidence that smaller ban areas tend to be less effective. The further extension of the ban to smaller towns on an individual basis may not be the most effective solution to addressing the problem of emissions from residential solid fuel use in these areas. Similarly, the border with Northern Ireland would present enforcement challenges if a national ban on smoky coal were unilaterally introduced. However, it is recognised that having different regulations between urban and rural locations is not ideal, as it results in different levels of environmental protection and clean air benefits for citizens in different locations.<br\/><br\/>Under the auspices of the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC), and in conjunction with the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, my Department has commissioned a study to inform a discussion on policy options to further address emissions from residential solid fuel use on an all-island basis. A final report is due to be presented to the NSMC in May 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000067#WRG03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Management","counter":425,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000067#WRG04000"},{"type":"question","counter":426,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[47484\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000067#WRG04100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide the details of regulation and disposal of clinical nuclear waste in private hospitals here; the protocols surrounding disposal of radioactive waste after operations in private hospitals; the persons who monitor the disposal of such waste and the following of radioactive protocols; if these procedures are being followed for disposal of radioactive waste in all private hospitals here; the way this is monitored by his Department; if there have been failures to follow such procedures in private hospitals and if he will provide details of these; the level of radioactive procedures that are allowed for; the type of procedures that are included; if his attention has been drawn to private hospitals that have not registered certain operations; if hospitals have concealed that operations had taken place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":427,"content":"<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for licensing all radioactive material used in public and private hospitals throughout Ireland.

The driver will, of course, continue to have the option of going to court where 5 points will still apply on conviction.<\/p><p>  Enforcement of the relevant legislation is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.\u00a0If a person&rsquo;s NCT test date is imminent, it will be a matter for the Gardai to use their discretion. However, responsibility rests with owners and users of vehicles to ensure their vehicles are in compliance with the law.<\/p><p>  The Road Safety Authority (RSA) informs me that the NCTS is\u00a0in a favourable position to deal with current demand and the Authority has also run a campaign over the past few months, to get people to book early, as the test may\u00a0be\u00a0undertaken up to 90 days in advance of the due date without affecting the expiry date of the new certificate. This system, is to ensure that owners have ample time to have their vehicle tested before their current NCT certificate expires. <\/p><p>  The National Car Testing Service (NCTS) is currently experiencing\u00a0a strong\u00a0demand as car owners respond to the changes in the application of fixed charges to NCT certificates. This was anticipated and NCTS has recruited in excess of 60 more staff to deal with the additional demand\u00a0and will have\u00a0565 Vehicle Inspectors in place\u00a0in January, the highest in the history of NCT.<\/p><p>  The RSA also advised me that the majority of car owners, including those who require an early test, will receive an NCT appointment within 28 days and additional resources have been put in place to help deal with such requests.\u00a0\u00a0I understand from the RSA that the availability of appointments on the NCT website is not a reflection of the total number of slots available to customers. If the person referred to by the Deputy has relied solely on the website booking system, I would suggest that they follow the advice on the\u00a0NCTS website which clearly advises customers that if they cannot obtain a suitable slot online to contact the NCTS call centre directly on (01) 413 5992.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000067#WRG06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driving Test Regulations","counter":450,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000067#WRG06500"},{"type":"question","counter":451,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[47461\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000067#WRG06600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his views on a driving test exemption for farmers who hold a full car or jeep and trailer licence for more than ten years but did not hold it prior to the 1989 regulations coming into effect; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":452,"content":"<p>I presume that the Deputy is referring to a previous situation involving people - not only farmers - who had held a full licence before November 1989.\u00a0 The situation was that, before that time, there was no separate category of licence for drawing a trailer.\u00a0 Anyone who had a car licence was automatically licenced to drive with a trailer.\u00a0 In November of 1989 there was a change to categories which meant that people now needed a separate licence category to draw a trailer.\u00a0 Holders of a full licence before that date were entitled to apply for both new categories on renewal of the licence.   \u00a0<\/p><p>  It appears that some people did not realise this and applied only for the car category when renewing after 1989, and so, perhaps\u00a0unintentionally, gave up\u00a0their trailer entitlement.\u00a0 People in this position were able to reclaim the lost entitlement for up to ten years after it had lapsed.\u00a0 The last people in this position were those who received a full licence just before the change in late 1989.\u00a0 They would have lost their entitlement on renewal in late 1999 and lost the option to reclaim it in late 2009.<\/p><p>  In 2013, my predecessor responded to this situation by requesting the Road Safety Authority to allow those who had held a full licence before the change of 1989, and who had inadvertently surrendered it on renewal,\u00a0to regain the trailer entitlement without a test.\u00a0 It was made clear at the time that this was a once-off arrangement for people who had already been legally entitled to draw a trailer in the past, and it will not be repeated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000067#WRG06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Exemptions","counter":453,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000067#WRG06800"},{"type":"question","counter":454,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[47471\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121000067#WRG06900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the recent measure by the UK Government to provide mountain rescue teams with a rebate on VAT which is a way of alleviating the burden of VAT on the teams while still complying with the EU laws pertaining to VAT.","asker":"1110","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":455,"content":"<p>I am aware of the measure the Deputy is referring to which was announced in the UK Autumn Statement 2014.
