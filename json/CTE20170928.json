Before we proceed to our normal business we will hear from acting Garda Commissioner, Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, on a commitment given to the committee at a meeting in July to provide a copy of the interim report on the reopening of certain Garda stations.  The committee has still not received the report and is concerned that commitments made to it by any organisation are followed through.  While we have received a written explanation from the acting Garda Commissioner we consider this such an important matter that we have invited him at short notice to explain to members in person why he is not in a position to provide the report.  I acknowledge the acting Commissioner has new responsibility and we wish him well in his new role.  However long or short it will be is not for us to say.  We will not deal with the content of the report, but there will be a short period for clarifying issues on the commitment and its background.<\/p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Gallery that all mobile phones should be switched off or put on aeroplane mode.<\/p><p>I advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.

I asked the acting Commissioner about the sale of some Garda stations and whether there was proper evaluation because we may need some of the accommodation at some point in the future.  I looked for the reason some stations over others found their way onto the Office of Public Works, OPW, list.  There is a long list of stations.  Once it is decided a station will be sold, it goes to the OPW.  The OPW has a list of the stations sold and how much was received for them.  Stepaside Garda station never found its way onto that list and there are probably others that did not either.  At the time, the acting Garda Commissioner told me there was a difficulty with the increase in the number of personnel and that there would be accommodation issues.  The point I made was it does not make sense to sell something if we must buy it back at a point when it will be more expensive.  It was in this context we sought the criteria.<\/p><p>I know there were six stations because the reply to a parliamentary question I asked last November stated the Minister requested the Garda Commissioner, while fully cognisant of her statutory functions on the distribution of Garda resources in the State, to identify six stations for reopening on a pilot basis, in line with the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government.  The reply also states the pilot scheme was intended to feed into a wider review of the Policing Authority's work.  My understanding is the Garda decides what resources it needs in the context of the funding available.  It is valid for us to try to figure out the criteria, and this is what was being asked.  We could find ourselves in a situation where stations were sold that should not have been, and how will we know whether that is the case if we do not know the criteria?  It was valid to ask this question.<\/p><p>If we do not understand the criteria we can draw only one conclusion.  In August, an article written by Juno McEnroe appeared in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>.  The article, which is an interview with the Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan, states, &quot;The then-Taoiseach elect told Shane Ross he would help get Stepaside Garda Station reopened, a move which weeks later the alliance&rsquo;s putative leader announced with much publicity.&quot;  We just want to know whether the stations are being opened for very good policing reasons, such as crime.  It is reasonable for us to know the criteria, and the acting Commissioner must have known what the criteria were that day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017092800002#D00700","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1506585600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>We have agreed five minutes and the Deputy has been speaking for three minutes.

It was certainly one of the shortest opening statements we are likely to get in the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is hugely regrettable that the acting Garda Commissioner has taken the decision not to honour the commitment to release the report into the reopening of Garda stations.  The key point is the fact it will not be done is a blow to transparency, which was already damaged during the hearings we held with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during the first half of this year.  That has been played out well enough in the public domain up to this point.  Something we should dwell on for a moment is that this will cause huge anger in the rest of the country, particularly rural areas where those 139 stations were closed or scaled down to buzzer boxes, which is, in effect, the same thing.  At the same time, they see pictures in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>of the smiley head of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport holding up a poster with his local councillor saying he got Stepaside reopened.  This is the context to this.  The people in my county, be in it Athboy, Oldcastle, Castlepollard or Enfield, will find that very hard to swallow this morning.<\/p><p>The last time Garda management were before us in July with the former Commissioner, a meeting attended by the acting Garda Commissioner, I held up the front page of my local newspaper, the <i>Meath Chronicle<\/i>.  It contained the headline &quot;Out of control&quot; and concerned crime in Meath at the time.  Would the acting Garda Commissioner believe that this morning's edition of the <i>Meath Chronicle<\/i>contains a headline that screams &quot;Shock rise in Meath crime&quot; regarding crime statistics?  The figure is up 59%.  Huge parts of my county are under extreme pressure.  A huge part of my county and everyone else's county is bereft of the physical presence of the force.  I wrote to the acting Garda Commissioner this week because the chief superintendent in my county, Fergus Healy, is doing a fantastic job of trying to thwart the gangs coming from places in Dublin down the motorways and targeting rural areas, but he needs personnel.  The ten extra garda&iacute; that are coming in October are simply not enough.  The people living in towns and villages in Meath, Tipperary or Sligo where Garda stations are not reopening will feel angry at this morning's proceedings not knowing why their Garda stations remained closed while Stepaside and others are reopened.  What would the acting Garda Commissioner say to those people who will read the report or listen to this?  I believe the acting Garda Commissioner made that commitment in July in good faith.

Of course, very valuable input can be got, which the Deputy acknowledged, from local Garda management and the critical part it would play in respect of calling out what it sees as being the priorities for its areas.  That is the piece of work that Assistant Commissioner O'Driscoll set about.  Some aspects of that were very detailed and needed a lot of work to drill down into trends, especially in crime and population.

The first concerns a reply I received in November of last year to a parliamentary question and follows on from the point that has been made.  The reply states, \"As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is primarily responsible for the distribution of Garda resources in the State and, as Minister, I have no direct role in the matter.\"  It is very clear from what Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in has said that the Minister had a very direct role in the matter because there was a direct choice to be made and that direct choice was made about one station.  It was, therefore, not the Garda that selected Stepaside; it was either the Government or the Minister.  That seems to be very clear from what he has said.<\/p> <p>  The second point is that some stations have found their way onto a sales list.  Of the 159 stations closed, 42 have been sold.  That makes 117 that have not been sold, and they are well distributed.  There are 16 in Leinster and nine in Connacht, despite the fact that Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in said most of them were on the western seaboard and do on.  Stepaside does not appear to have been put on a list for sale.  Does the Garda have a role with the OPW in terms of future-proofing these needs?  Does it have a role with the OPW in saying, \"Do not sell that.  This is cropping up from the information we are gathering from our districts.  If we are future-proofing our needs, we will need to hold onto that.\"?  Is that part of the dialogue?  Does that happen between the Department of Justice and Equality and the OPW, or between whom does it happen?  We could very easily sell off stations and then have to buy or rent others in their place.  That is where I feel the Committee of Public Accounts has a very strong role.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017092800002#L00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506585600,"counter":373,"content":"<p>With regard to the sale of stations, as I said, once a station has been decommissioned or is no longer in use as a Garda station, it is very much up to the OPW to decide what to do with it.

Its primary function is to monitor and regulate health and social care services, to develop standards and to advise on the collection and sharing of information across health care services.  Much of its work is focused on inspections across the disability, older people's and children's sectors.  Designated residential centres must register with the authority and pay fees which include a registration fee and an annual fee.<\/p> <p>  The authority's financial statement records total income in 2016 of &euro;18.9 million.  Approximately one third of the authority's income, or &euro;6.8 million, came from fees paid by designated centres.  Recurrent grant funding received from the Department of Health, under Vote 38, amounted to &euro;11.5 million or just over 60% of the authority's total funding.  Most of the remaining income is in the form of employee pension contributions, which are retained by the authority, and replace an equivalent amount of recurrent grant funding.  <\/p> <p>  The authority's expenditure in 2016 was &euro;18.3 million.  As set out in the figure on screen, three quarters of the authority's expenditure relates to staff costs.  In 2016, the authority's average headcount was 192, with 73% of those staff employed in regulation functions.  Some 11% of the authority's total staff costs relate to agency staff.<\/p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the authority's financial statement for 2016, which was certified on 29 May 2017.  However, my report drew attention to two specific matters.  First, I drew attention to the authority's accounting treatment for pensions.  The Act establishing the authority gives the Minister for Health, in consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the authority to set the accounting framework for the authority.  In doing so, the Minister has directed that pensions should be accounted for as they are paid, rather than as liabilities accrued, which generally accepted accounting practice requires.  This directed accounting treatment for pensions is common to a number of health bodies, and the authority does not have discretion in the matter.  As I promised last week, we are compiling a list of the accounting frameworks for all the bodies we audit, setting out such exceptions to generally accepted accounting practice.<\/p> <p>  The audit report also draws attention to note 18(a), which discloses costs incurred by the authority in 2016, in relation to exiting a lease related to an office building in Sandyford.  The lease, which was not due to expire until 2028, was transferred from the former Irish Health Services Accreditation Board when the authority was established in 2007.  The building was surplus to the authority's requirements and had been occupied by another health sector body, until that body moved to new premises in 2015.  The authority incurred costs of &euro;146,000, equivalent to six months rent, to break the lease, and &euro;350,000 in relation to building restoration costs.  The disposal of the lease also resulted in the write-off of the residual value of capitalised leasehold improvement costs of &euro;491,771.  In the circumstances, the authority had little option but to incur the costs.  Nevertheless, the additional rent payment and the write-off of the residual value of the improvements represent expenditures for which the State did not receive value.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017092800002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1506585600,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General.

I am accompanied by my colleagues, Ms Mary Dunnion, director of regulation and chief inspector of social services, and Sean Angland, acting chief operating officer.  In the interest of being efficient with time and facilitating questions from members, I will address the key in my opening statement that has already been circulated to the committee.<\/p> <p>  HIQA is the independent body established ten years ago to improve health and social care services for the people of Ireland.  Our role is to develop standards, inspect and review health and social care services, and support informed decisions on how services are delivered.  Our mandate extends across a range of public, private and voluntary service sectors.<\/p> <p>  The Health Act 2007, which established HIQA, outlines our statutory functions and provides the basis for our work.  Our remit has grown substantially over the past decade but our core activities remain the same.  They are to monitor and regulate health and social care services; develop standards; carry out health technology assessments; and advise on the collection and sharing of information across health care services. <\/p> <p>  All these functions are focused on making services safer and better.  We provide assurance to the public as to the quality of services and endeavour to ensure that the findings of our work are reflected in decision-making at local and national level.  HIQA's primary aim is to safeguard vulnerable people.  Putting the needs and the voices of the people who use services to the fore is the essence of everything that we do. <\/p> <p>  HIQA plans and manages its resources prudently to make certain that they are used efficiently and effectively as we carry out our statutory functions and deliver our corporate objectives.  We are conscious of providing value for money and ensure that we are compliant with all relevant standards, regulations and legislation concerning our use of resources.  HIQA derives its revenue from a mixture of public and private sources.  In 2016, we were granted an allocation of just over &euro;11.5 million from the Department of Health and also received just under &euro;7 million in annual fees and registration fees from centres that are registered.  We also earned &euro;467,000 in other income such as pension contributions and grants.  In 2016, we came in under budget and returned &euro;519,000 to the Department of Health, primarily due to delays in the sanctioning of vacant and new posts.<\/p> <p>  Over two thirds of HIQA's expenditure goes on staff costs, which amounted to just over &euro;14 million last year.  Our headcount in December 2016 was 192 permanent staff and that now stands at 209 staff.  Subject to sanction from the Department of Health, we plan that this figure will grow to 227 based on current funding.  In addition, a number of staff are employed through agencies and on fixed-term contracts.  The majority of permanent staff, and that is 144 of our staff, work within the regulation directorate. <\/p> <p>  In our code of governance and code of business conduct, we have set out key roles and responsibilities within HIQA and the procedures and protocols that are core to our good governance.  As well as policies and procedures for governing the business of the board, we also set out guidelines for ensuring that the authority conducts its business ethically.  The code describes the obligations on staff, board members and individuals contracted by the authority in the performance of their duties, and includes requirements for making declarations of interest as set out in Ethics in Public Office Acts.<\/p><p>In recent years we have significantly strengthened internal controls and governance arrangements through an annual statement of assurance to the board.  We have also reviewed our compliance with the new code of practice for the governance of State bodies as part of our internal audit programme.  HIQA is currently being assessed for compliance with the National Standards Authority of Ireland&rsquo;s SWiFT 3000 code of practice for corporate governance assessment.  The process is near completion and we expect to be awarded certification shortly.  In HIQA, we recognise the importance of external and independent oversight and we are open to and welcome such oversight.<\/p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General in his audit of our financial statements in 2016 provided a clean audit report.  The C&amp;AG referenced two items: accounting for the costs of superannuation payments and the exit of a lease.  In accounting for superannuation payment, as directed by the Minister for Health, we account for pension costs as they arise rather than accruing for them.  The exit of a lease relates to a lease that was transferred to HIQA from the Irish Health Services Accreditation Board, a predecessor organisation, upon HIQA&rsquo;s establishment.  We are happy to answer any questions the committee has on these matters.  <\/p><p> Since the recruitment moratorium was imposed in 2009, as many other bodies, HIQA has had to seek specific approval for the filling of every post it wants to fill.  The situation in which every vacancy that arises and every new post sought requires external sanction creates significant operational challenges for an independent body such as HIQA.  While there has been an improvement in this process, delays in filling posts impact on our operational capacity, particularly in the area of the regulation of services.  It also has the potential to create additional operational costs where temporary staff are required to complete our work.  We are very conscious of the importance of strategic resource planning and have recently submitted to the Department a strategic workforce plan that details how current risks within the regulated environment and future functions should be addressed.<\/p><p> HIQA&rsquo;s organisational structure reflects our core functions and activities.  HIQA&rsquo;s regulation directorate is the biggest in the authority and is responsible for promoting improvement in specified health and social care services in Ireland by regulating the quality and safety of the services.  HIQA has statutory responsibility for registering and inspecting designated social care services.  So far this year, we have carried out 650 inspections of designated centres for people with disabilities and over 450 inspections of designated centres for older people.  Of the inspections of centres for older people, 90 were themed inspections focused on the care given to people with dementia.  The number of designated centres is continually increasing and diversifying, which in turn affects our workload.<\/p><p> HIQA has statutory responsibility for monitoring and inspecting children&rsquo;s social services, including children&rsquo;s statutory residential centres, special care units, child protection services and Oberstown child detention campus.  We also have a statutory responsibility for monitoring foster care services against the national standards for foster care.  So far this year we have conducted a total of 38 inspections of children&rsquo;s services.  We are also responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of health services and investigating, as necessary, serious concerns about the health and welfare of people who use these services.  As a result of the limitations in numbers of our health care team to date, our health care programmes have been thematic, focused on inspecting nutrition and hydration care in our acute hospital sector, reviewing how public acute hospitals are tackling antimicrobial stewardship and medicines management and monitoring acute hospitals&rsquo; compliance with the relevant national standards.  The total number of inspections carried out by HIQA across all of these sectors has increased from 920 in 2013 to 1,477 in 2016.  This represents an increase of over 60% in the number of inspections carried out in those three years.  Since our establishment we have also conducted eight statutory investigations, and we have recently commenced a new investigation into Tusla&rsquo;s management of allegations of child sexual abuse against adults of concern, as requested by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p><p> We are responsible for developing a consistent and standardised approach to health information, based on standards and international best practice.  Health and social care services are information dependent, generating huge volumes of data every day.  It is important that such information is managed in the most effective way possible in order to ensure high quality, safe health and social care delivery.  We also work with stakeholders to develop national standards for health and social care services and for people living in residential services.  Such standards include standards for children's residential centres and the draft national standards for the prevention and control of health care associated infections in primary and community care and also in acute hospital services.  <\/p><p> The national patient experience survey is a joint initiative led by HIQA with the HSE and the Department of Health.  It is the largest single survey of the health care system ever conducted in Ireland.  The first survey was conducted in May 2017 and will now run annually.  Almost 14,000 hospital patients responded to the 61-question survey which translates to a response rate of 51%.  We plan to publish the national report this December along with 39 acute hospital reports.  <\/p><p> HIQA is also responsible for providing advice that enables the best outcome for people who use our health service and the best use of resources by evaluating the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of drugs, equipment, diagnostic technologies and health promotion and protection activities.  Health Technology Assessments, HTAs, are undertaken at the request of the Minister and his Department or at the request of the HSE to inform major health policy or health service decisions.  We are currently undertaking a HTA on extending the national immunisation schedule to include providing the HPV vaccine to boys.  Another example of a HTA published earlier this year was an assessment of smoking cessation interventions.  <\/p><p> HIQA is a highly efficient and productive organisation that carries out a broad and ever growing range of activities.  We are working with the Government to ensure our resources and processes meet the range of new areas of responsibility to be included under HIQA&rsquo;s growing remit.  Areas where it is planned that HIQA&rsquo;s role will grow in the foreseeable future include the regulation of patient exposure to medical ionising radiation; the formal regulation of children&rsquo;s residential centres, which will include voluntary and private sector services; and the expansion of the national patient experience survey to include areas such as maternity services.  Furthermore, we will continue to participate and contribute to the preparatory work in developing a licensing model for public and private health care facilities, expanded functions under the health information and patient safety Bill and expansion into new areas of social care regulation such as home care services.  <\/p><p> Today I have provided a brief overview of HIQA&rsquo;s current and future work.  As an organisation, over the past ten years we have contributed positively and constructively to public confidence in Ireland&rsquo;s systems of health and social care regulation, standard setting and evidence based strategic advice.  At all times we have endeavoured to be an exemplar organisation in our internal governance systems and have endeavoured through our performance to provide value for money, efficiency and accountability.  I thank the committee for inviting us here this morning and am very happy to answer any questions it has.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017092800002#N00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phelim Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506585600,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Quinn.

In agreement with the Department of Health we developed a strategic workforce plan earlier this year.  That workforce plan clearly articulates some of the areas of risk we currently carry in regard to the discharge of our current functions as well as some of the resource requirements we have for planned future functions of the authority.  As an example, one of the critical issues for us in terms of risk is the significant increase that there has been in recent years in the number of designated centres for people with disability.  There is a policy within Ireland around the decongregation or resettlement of people who have been living in large congregated settings to move into more integrated community settings, and that has happened.  It has happened both as a result of the policy but I also believe it has happened as a result of the interventions HIQA has made regarding both the nature and culture of some of the services we have been in.  The outcome of some of that work has been an increase of somewhere in the region of 200 new designated centres that we are not necessarily staffed for.  On top of that, some of the well articulated risks we have identified within some of those services means that our inspection volumes have to increase, but we have not had the commensurate increase in staff.  That is reflected in that workforce plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017092800002#U01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phelim Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1506585600,"counter":760,"content":"<p>Deputy Alan Kelly has ten minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017092800002#U01600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1506585600,"counter":761,"content":"<p>I will be brief, which is unlike me, but in fairness most of the questions have been asked by my colleagues.

The real issue is that if HIQA ended up in charge of the whole parcel of issues in health care, this country probably would not have the budget to fund the changes it would recommend.  That is the reason there is a go-slow as regards the overall remit of pushing HIQA.  Somebody has to say it; that is reality.  That is the reason powers are limited in certain areas.

Ms Dunnion spoke earlier about the costs of registering.  In terms of what the public needs to know also, there are registration costs.  That is fine; that is the easy part.  It is when HIQA comes in and makes recommendations.  Organisations have two choices.  They either do nothing and they will close or else they find the money and, in many cases, run deficits and eventually sort it out.  In regard to the Health Service Executive budgets, for instance, and capital plans, the consequences of the decisions of HIQA have a knock-on effect on health budgets across the HSE.<\/p> <p>  That brings me on to some real issues.  The Chairman is probably not aware of this but there is a unique court case going on in Ennis, which I will not get into, between the HSE and HIQA.  That is why I am interested in this.  I presume the witnesses' legal fees will go up because this case is unique.  It is based around the registration of St. Joseph's Hospital.  I will not get into the details on this issue because that is for the health committee and also there are some aspects we probably should not get into.  I raise that issue because the HSE has taken a decision regarding a decision HIQA has made on the admittance of patients.  It has gone to court to stop this happening because in its judgment it is not warranted.  However, that is not the debate.  In terms of what I want to get into, with regard to HIQA's costs for inspections and how it carries out its functions, these are high costs.  For instance, in the case I am referring to, this hospital was visited four times in a short space of time; it was definitively three.  How does HIQA manage the costs associated with the type of inspections it has to carry out?  Will they grow?  How are individual costs managed?  Across the nursing home sector, there is a capital investment plan in place for the next number of years.

Despite of the fact that there is much support for the recommendations that HIQA made in this particular case, the circumstances it uncovered at the time now pertain again.  Ms Dunnion has outlined that HIQA's is a monitoring rather than a regulatory role.  It is very difficult, therefore, to see how it would be possible for HIQA to drive standards up in the absence of particular powers.  The consultant who wrote the email states that 350 patients die every year in the State and that, according to the Irish Association of Emergency Medicine, overcrowding is a factor at the time of death.  One aspect of our work, when the HSE is before us, involves looking at contingent liability in cases where there is a failure that can be demonstrated.  One of the points made by the consultant to whom I refer is made is that the fire certificate does not cover the relevant unit where some of the elderly patients have been, to use his word, \"boarders\" for fairly long periods.  There is only one access door and there is only one isolation room into which six patients who required isolation for infection control purposes were put.<\/p> <p>  Very serious failures have been identified by this consultant and these would have obtained pretty much around the time that HIQA conducted its investigation.  It screams that there needs to be regulation.  On the idea that this involves a cost, there is also a cost if action is not taken.

If it is all well, then that is fine and the centre is registered.  Thereafter, a monitoring process begins whereby the provider has to notify us of specific mandatory notifications.

It may be that we decide we continue the registration but with the condition that, until the situation improves, they cannot take any more residents into the nursing home.  We can give a formal, legal notice of proposal to cancel a registration and then the provider has 28 days to respond.  In many cases the response is adequate to address the non-compliance.

I have the greatest of respect for HIQA.  As I stated at the outset, it has an enormous task and I believe the range is too much for one body.  Then there is the bigger issue of how we have set about privatising everything.  There is a belief that the model being used is cheaper but the hidden costs of monitoring are extraordinary.  For example, if one looks at nursing homes, the split is now 80% private and 20% public.  In that context, and at the risk of being parochial, I will take the example of Galway.  I have read the reports.  If we look at the regional hospital, by any standards, with patients on trolleys, it deserves to be the subject of a HIQA inspection.  The paediatric unit was singled out in one of HIQA's reports in terms of the cleaning routine, the absence of privacy and lots of issues around that.  Will HIQA go back in and inspect that?  How does HIQA pick that as opposed to examining the fact that there is a ward closed or a leaky roof in Merlin Park University Hospital?  Does Mr. Quinn understand the point I am making?  It seems an extraordinary position for HIQA to be in.

Out of the &euro;15 billion or &euro;16 billion total expenditure in the health sector, is it possible that only 20% of the sector in terms of scale of activity is regulated?

This is the Committee of Public Accounts and such questions have to be asked here.  People know approximate figures.  It is possibly not something the witnesses have specifically thought about but can they give me an indication of what percentage of health services in Ireland is regulated by HIQA?

Looking back on it, there was a whole process where the councillors, looking back retrospectively, seemed to do their best and ask questions.  I was on the council so I put my hand up and we asked questions.  It is unclear whether the estate agent acted for both sides.

The next item is No. 759C, correspondence from Catherine Murphy enclosing correspondence sent to several members of the committee on an individual making a complaint against a commercial bank relating to overcharging.  Members of the committee will agree that overcharging by banks is a serious matter.  In this case the bank is not in public ownership and, therefore, it is not within the remit of the committee to make specific inquiries.  I propose that we advise the correspondent accordingly and suggest he contact the Financial Services Ombudsman because that is where one goes with an individual complaint.  I think that is the correct procedure to take in this situation.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 760C, correspondence dated 15 September from an individual regarding the management of resources in the carer's leave section of the Department of Social Protection.  Deputy Cullinane brought this matter to the committee.  I propose that we hold it over because he is not here.  We will defer this matter.<\/p> <p>  The matters raised strike me as extremely serious.  While I propose to refer the matter to the Department for response, before we do that we may need to liaise with the individual and, perhaps, get some legal advice on the matter in case it could be interpreted as a protected disclosure.  As the individual is an employee of the Department, he may need protection under the Protected Disclosures Act.  We must be mindful of that.  I suggest we return to this matter next week following consultation with the parliamentary legal adviser in case there is a protected disclosures issue part of this correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>We will come back to that when we get the advice.  <\/p><p> The next item is No. 761 (c) dated 20 September, relating to birth certificate fraud.  The purpose of the correspondence, which was sent to a number of Oireachtas email addresses, is not clear and does not relate specifically to any institutions or organisations in Ireland.  We will just note that as we have no further action to take.  Correspondence item No. 762, dated 14 September, from an individual who resigned from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2013 alleges bullying.  I propose that we write to the correspondent to advise that the matter is not within the remit of this committee and refer the individual to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  That is the first port of call.  This committee is not the first port of call on such matters.  The next item of correspondence, No. 767 (c), dated 21 September, relates to public parking in the Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council area by Garda vehicles.  I propose to request an information note from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Essentially, the correspondent has complained that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na often park in an area and do not put money into the parking meter.  We will await a response to that matter.  I will probably get into trouble for smiling while reading out that item.<\/p><p> Item No. 768, dated 25 September, is from an individual in response to correspondence that was forwarded to him regarding the Irish Prison Service following last week's meeting.  The individual is frustrated at the lack of action in relation to the external review until the WRC completes its work in November.  While this is understandable, we will have to await the outcome ourselves.  Essentially, the matter went to the external reviewer under a protected disclosure.  The individual is now in the WRC with the Prison Service.  We have written to the Prison Service asking for a progress report but the service has said that the matter is now with the WRC and until that body has completed its consideration, the Prison Service is not in a position to revert to this committee.  That is not unreasonable and we will just have to wait until November.

There is a reply from the Department of Justice and Equality.  Essentially, this is one of the first issues in terms of how to deal with a protected disclosure in the Prison Service.  The person involved was not happy and used the legislation to get an external reviewer to examine the case.  The external reviewer is a retired District Court judge who has issued a very comprehensive report to the Prison Service and to the individual concerned.  The individual has taken his case to the WRC and there are difficulties regarding the use of the aforementioned report at the WRC.  I think we have no option but to wait until the WRC is finished its work.  I have to say that the individual is a constituent of mine, I am familiar with the case and have actually met the gentleman.  As I said before, there is a lot of learning to be done by public bodies in terms of how to deal with protected disclosures.  They seem to be only beginning to become aware of the issues involved.  Does anyone else have a view on this?  I do not think we can do anything until the WRC deals with the individual in the Prison Service and that will be in November.  We will ask to be kept informed on that particular issue.  I am disappointed that we cannot do anything sooner but we cannot really interfere if the matter is with the WRC.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the statements and accounts received since our last meeting, there are only four on the list, all of which received a clear audit opinion.

My colleagues and I look forward to a constructive engagement with the committee, as we have enjoyed in our previous meetings.  I am joined today by my colleagues Stephen Groarke, chief risk officer; Shane O&rsquo;Sullivan, director of operations; and Ger Mitchell, HR director and accountable executive for the CBI tracker reviews.<\/p> <p>  I do not propose to spend too much time on these opening remarks.  However, I would like to emphasise the continued focus that we have in transforming PTSB into a vibrant Irish retail and SME bank while continuing to sort out legacy issues.  The good news is that we are now spending more time on the former and less on the latter.<\/p> <p>  In this regard, I have five key messages.  First, Permanent TSB is now well positioned as an operationally profitable, well-governed business which makes an important contribution to the Irish economy and which will, over time, complete the repayment of the generous financial support it received from the taxpayer at the time of the crisis.  The bank is now competing strongly and is providing financial support and backing to people across the country.  For example, we have substantially grown our share of the mortgage market in the past 12 months in particular and that strong growth has continued right up to the present; we are performing very well in respect of current accounts; we maintain a strong deposit base; and we are now beginning to see the fruits of the investment in our new SME business.  Indeed, last week we had a presence - for the first time in many years - at the National Ploughing Championships with many in the agriculture and associated sectors welcoming our return to the market.<\/p> <p>  We are performing well and that has been reflected in upgrades for the bank over the past year from each of the three rating agencies which cover us, Moody's, Standard &amp;amp; Poor's, and DBRS.  We are about half way through the transformation of the group and, on balance, we are on track versus the original vision set in 2012.<\/p> <p>  Second, a strong Permanent TSB is a goal worth fighting for.  Everybody wants more competition in the Irish banking market and that is what we are providing.  We are a relatively small institution taking on, and taking market share from, two pillar banks.  We are doing it through many channels - branches, phone, mobile, online and intermediaries.  We are working with more than 2,700 staff employed in communities across the country and underpinned by more than 100 years of history.  I believe that is something to be valued.<\/p> <p>  Third, having successfully navigated a range of seemingly insurmountable obstacles since the financial crisis, my colleagues and I are now focussed intensely on building out our customer franchise; dealing with the issue of non-performing loans; ensuring we have the right levels of capital for unexpected losses; and generating sufficient profitability to invest in the future.  There will be significant movement on these issues in the months and years ahead and I am sure we will discuss this in some detail this morning.<\/p> <p>  Fourth, we are always mindful that our decisions have very real consequences for our customers, many of whom may be dealing with other issues and pressures.  However, a failure to make the right, sometimes-tough decisions also has consequences.  Therefore our aim is to be responsible and fair in dealing with customers but not to avoid taking the hard decisions we need to take in order to be able to serve our full customer base and, of course, to grow a sustainably profitable business.<\/p> <p>  Let us take mortgage arrears as an example.  So far, we have offered long-term solutions to more than 30,000 mortgage customers thereby allowing those customers and their families to remain in their homes.  For those to whom we have so far been unable to provide a solution or who refuse to engage with us, we must, ten years after the financial crisis, use all the tools at our disposal in as fair a manner as possible to find resolutions.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I am very proud of what we have achieved at Permanent TSB and I am a passionate advocate of the bank and of my colleagues - perhaps sometimes too passionate.  However, I know nothing which we have achieved would have been possible without the steadfast support of the Government and the taxpayer since the financial crisis began, for which I and my colleagues are deeply grateful.<\/p> <p>  I believe that the best way of repaying that support is by building a profitable, well-governed business of which this country can be proud.  We have not completed that journey yet and there will, no doubt, be further challenges to overcome but we are well on the way to achieving that goal and we will not rest until we get there.<\/p> <p>  I thank the members for allowing me the time to make these opening remarks.  My colleagues and I now look forward to their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017092800002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Masding"},{"type":"speech","time":1506588300,"counter":1116,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an tUasal Masding.

The first 30 days for customers will elapse over the coming days.

We are conscious the scheme has been significantly overhauled.  We welcome this overhaul and we want to participate in a very material way.

Could I start by asking for their assessment of the overall financial health of Permanent TSB?  As the figures show, the numbers of mortgages in arrears in private dwelling homes and in buy-to-lets have come down substantially, based on reduced payment, arrears capitalisation and the various schemes to which the witnesses have referred.  The figures for non-performing loans are, however, still high.  I believe the bank set out a medium-term target of reducing it to high single digits.  The European average is around 5% or 6%.  How would the representatives characterise the overall financial health? If 2007-2008 was to happen again how would the bank fare in such circumstances?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017092800002#E00500","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506588300,"counter":1168,"content":"<p>Good morning Deputy.  On the financial health of the bank I will start with the balance sheet.  On the liability side of the balance sheet we are growing customer current accounts and our deposit base remains stable.  Our equity base, as members are aware, was strengthened through the initial public offering, IPO that we delivered in 2015 and we also have some other capital instruments.  In terms of funding, the balance sheet is much stronger than it was.  Perhaps the best example of that is when this team started the bank's funding gap - into which we had to borrow money from the European Central Bank - was more than 40% of the balance sheet.  It is now pretty much down to zero.  I believe this is an indicator of strength.<\/p> <p>  I shall now turn to the asset side of the balance sheet.  On new mortgages, we have picked ourselves up off the floor, dusted ourselves down and now our mortgage share is far into double digits.  When one considers that it was 2% a few years ago, I believe we are putting compelling propositions into the market.  As I said in my opening remarks, our desire is to continue to challenge the pillar banks and to provide choice for customers, which I believe we are doing.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the stock of assets, the Deputy is correct that our non-performing loan, NPL, ratio is elevated at 28%.  I will make two points in this regard.  Members will be aware the bank has a restructuring plan under which we were obliged to deleverage a significant amount of assets.  Many of the cohorts of those assets were actually performing assets.  If we do the maths on that the denominator has actually fallen but the numerators have stayed the same.  By definition the 28% has increased.  I do not think that is necessarily fair on the team because we had to deleverage some assets.  Members may recall that last year we had just completed the sale of our UK business, which essentially was a performing business.<\/p> <p>  Then we get to the NPL ratio, which therefore exists and the 28% is split into two halves.  Some 15% of the 28% is actually treated but because of the nature of the treatments they stay in NPLs.  It is our job to work those through over time.  On the 13%, I would argue that ten years after the crisis, as per my previous remarks - and certainly it is five years since we as a team attempted to solve the NPL crisis at the bank - the team needs to move to resolution.  Mr. O'Sullivan has given some examples whether it be buy-to-let deleveraging, assisted voluntary sale or mortgage-to-rent.  These are the schemes we need to get to.<\/p> <p> I will move on to the profit and loss account.  Our net interest margin, which is a key indicator, was 70 basis points when this team started.  It is now more than 180 basis points.  This gives us the cash to fund growth.  In respect of our operating expenditure our cost-to-income ratio is too high.  It is more than 70%.  That is why we must continue to grow the business in asset growth and in managing the costs.  The cost of risk is coming down but it is still high.  The bank still has a stock of assets from the crisis in which there still are some defaults.  We must manage that flow of defaults.<\/p> <p>  When everything is taken together, we are operationally profitable, which we have not been for a decade.  We are growing market share.  We know that the NPL challenge is probably the last big hurdle that we need to try to overcome before, I hope, we give something back to Ireland; a small, well-governed retail bank that competes against the pillar banks.  I am pretty clear on the vision.  I suggest to the committee that the financial health of the bank is much better but there is still more work to do.  I hope this answers the Deputy's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017092800002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Masding"},{"type":"speech","time":1506588300,"counter":1169,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Masding.

It will be explained as a systems failure, as everything is that happens in the banks.  People lose money and their house and people take their own lives arising from decisions taken by bankers and explained as a systems failure.  It is what really infuriates me.  The bank carried out an investigation and identified 1,372 customers.  It was going to leave it at that until the Central Bank intervened and said a further investigation had to be carried out.  After that, it identified another 579 customers and the witnesses have told us between five and ten of those lost their house or home.  I cannot imagine me or my family being put into that position.  Permanent TSB was going to close the book on this and the Central Bank only acted after a long period and when customers took the bank to the courts.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the outgoing senior figure in the Central Bank in that until there is personal accountability within the financial sector, this will continue to go on.  It might be something else in two or five years but it will happen until individuals are held to account.  I hope this Government or the courts take on board the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission published many years ago that would allow for class action suits.  The Chairman spoke about people on prevailing rates of 3.25% or people who lost their homes who do not have the resources or means to take bankers and well-resourced corporations to court individually but they could take class actions against bankers.  This is not acceptable.<\/p> <p>  How does the bank explain that it was closing the book on this matter?  It investigated the matter but closed the book.

During that investigation we identified a number of other issues.

As this is our first time appearing before the committee, I would like to introduce our delegation.  I am the CEO of KBC Bank Ireland and have been in this role since November 2013.  I have been an employee of KBC Group since 1992 and joined the bank in Ireland in July 2013.  I am accompanied by two senior members of the bank's management team: Ms Dara Deering, who joined the bank in 2012 as executive director retail banking; and Mr Des McCarthy, who took up the role of chief financial officer, CFO, in 2014.  Both are also members of the bank's executive committee and board of directors.<\/p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, KBC Bank Ireland is a subsidiary of KBC Groep NV and, accordingly, is subject to the normal disclosure constraints of a publicly-quoted company.  The committee will have received our written responses to the queries in its questionnaire.  There are a number of matters which we feel are commercially sensitive and which, as a private entity, we would not disclose publicly.  I would like to focus on the following key themes: the bank's history; the bank's strategy and business model; the bank's performance and customer offering; how the bank is helping customers experiencing financial difficulties; and the bank's progress in the tracker examination.<\/p> <p>  KBC Bank Ireland is part of the KBC Group, one of Europe's most recognisable financial institutions, which is headquartered in Brussels and listed on Euronext.  KBC Group is present with substantive operations in six countries in Europe and primarily offers banking and insurance products and services to retail customers and small and medium-sized enterprises.  KBC Group has been a majority shareholder of what was then called Irish Intercontinental Bank since 1978.  In 1999, KBC Group increased its shareholding to 100%.  Importantly, KBC Group has supported its Irish operation through the financial crisis, providing ongoing liquidity and funding, together with additional capital injections totalling &euro;1.8 billion.  The bank did not receive direct support from the Irish State, nor did it participate in the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme or National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  Since 2013, KBC has embarked on a journey to transform into a \"digital first\" challenger bank; launching a retail banking platform to consumers in the Irish market.  In February of this year, KBC Group reaffirmed its commitment to Ireland, making the bank part of its strategy to focus on its core markets.  This commitment implies enhanced competition in the Irish banking market and more choice for consumers.<\/p> <p>  As this is KBC's first time before this committee, I would like to use this opportunity to share our insights as to how we see banking evolve in Ireland.  KBC Group's commitment to Ireland was based on a number of key considerations: Ireland's demographics, it has the youngest population in Europe with 40% under the age of 25 and, therefore, at an early stage in their banking life cycle; the population of Ireland is \"digitally savvy\" and open to new ways of banking; Ireland has a strong educational profile; and finally Ireland's economic recovery and the positive outlook for the country.<\/p> <p>  What do consumers expect from a bank in the future?  Research that we have undertaken has very much influenced our strategic approach.  Consumers have told us that they want the best in digital experience but they also want to be able to obtain professional advice, whether that be over the phone or in person at one of our hubs.  So while we are digital first, we also believe in the value of an on-the-ground presence.  This insight into consumer preferences has helped shape the bank's distribution model which is quite different from that of other Irish banks, as we strive for seamless integration of physical and digital channels.<\/p> <p>  KBC is Ireland's newest retail bank, with a full suite of competitive products and a clear focus on digital in respect of which we are supported by our hubs and our contact centre.  Thus far we have gained significant traction and the response from consumers has been very positive.  Our relevance is increasing across all channels and products, from current accounts and deposits to investments, from consumer finance and mortgages to insurance.  Our network has grown to a total of 15 hubs throughout the country.  A 16th hub in Blanchardstown is due to open next quarter.  All of our hubs have later opening hours and are open through lunch and on Saturdays to meet consumers' needs.  In addition, our customers can avail of a dedicated 24-7 contact centre.  We currently employ over 1,100 staff, almost double the number we had in 2012, and we have been rated as the retail bank with the best reputation for the past six years.  Innovation in banking is at our core.  We were the first retail bank in Ireland to offer both Android Pay and Apple Pay.  More recently, we launched a new mobile app that allows customers open a current account on their phone in five simple steps in five minutes - a first in Europe.<\/p> <p>  We believe it important that the committee supports innovation and competition, and encourages new entrants such as KBC, so that consumers benefit overall through a better choice of offering.  We would encourage the committee to seek ways to improve the switching process for consumers, such as empowering the acquiring bank to manage the end-to-end process for consumers.  To encourage further competition, we ask the committee to review the basis for the allocation of the bank levy.  As it is currently constructed, it constitutes a strong disincentive to growing a retail deposit business or entering the retail banking market.  We have written to the Minister for Finance outlining our concerns. <\/p> <p>  Our strong performance was reflected in our results for the first half of this year, with an operating profit of &euro;61.3 million before tax and impairments.  We recently reached a milestone with over 250,000 customers having chosen KBC as their bank.  Overall, it is our objective to become the primary bank for our customers.<\/p><p>KBC has been a significant mortgage lender for many years, consistently holding about 10% of the outstanding stock of mortgage loans.  Throughout 2016 and 2017, the bank has continued to enhance its mortgage offering for new and existing customers.  Research indicates that long-term value through low monthly repayments is what matters most to customers.  KBC announced rate reductions across a range of fixed and variable rates in 2016 and more recently introduced a new ten-year fixed rate product to provide longer term certainty over mortgage repayments with interest rates as low as 2.95% for customers who also become a current account customer.  Our no gimmicks approach towards pricing is aligned with our strategy to provide lifetime value.<\/p><p> As announced during an investor visit held in Dublin on 21 June, KBC Group will invest &euro;1.5 billion in group-wide digital transformation between 2017 and the end of 2020.  This investment will also benefit customers in Ireland.  From its innovation hub in Dublin, the bank will continue to lead the way in delivering innovative firsts, providing 24-7 banking solutions for customers.<\/p><p> The bank also plans to launch a complete offering to the micro-SME segment over coming months with an initial focus on the professional sector based on customer demand, to include medical, legal, accountancy and technical professions.  Customers in that segment will gain access to a very compelling digital offering and a business relationship manager to assist them with their needs.<\/p><p> We have deep empathy for customers and in particular mortgage customers who have experienced mortgage difficulties during the recession and its aftermath.  The bank has engaged with customers in financial difficulty to implement a range of forbearance and restructuring options.  This work has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of customers in difficulty or awaiting a resolution.  These residual cases are complex and require further time.  From our experience customers who engage with us early have achieved better outcomes and we actively encourage any customer in financial distress who has not already engaged with us to contact our arrears support unit.<\/p><p> KBC has worked consistently with customers in financial difficulty to avoid the need for a loss of property ownership.  However, for genuinely unsustainable cases, such outcome may be unavoidable.  Many of these cases are settled on a voluntary basis.  Regrettably, the bank is sometimes forced to take legal action.  Repossessing a property is always a last resort after all other options have been explored.  <\/p><p>KBC employs a substantial number of staff to support customers experiencing financial difficulty.  We also provide financial support including rental income support, legal advice funding and relocation fees.  The bank continues to engage with customers through established independent third parties such as the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation and the StepChange Debt Charity Ireland. <\/p><p> On the tracker examination programme directed by the Central Bank, KBC is working closely with the regulator to conclude the current phase of activities, namely, the identification of affected customers.  Within the framework set by the Central Bank, this review process is taking longer than originally anticipated.  We acknowledge that this is very difficult for customers who have been negatively impacted.  KBC takes this review very seriously and is determined to conclude this process as soon as possible.<\/p><p> While we have not yet fully determined the final outcome, the examination programme has identified that customers were, in some circumstances, moved off their tracker rates.  All customers who we identified as being on an incorrect rate have since been put on the correct rate.  After the final determination of the Central Bank on the findings and our proposals, the bank will contact with the affected customers regarding redress and compensation.  We wish to clarify to the committee that as a result of a prior, narrower review, the bank addressed a specific cohort of customers in 2010.<\/p><p> As we work through this examination, we believe that it is imperative that the bank is guided by what is fair and right and that it does the right thing in the cases where customers have suffered harm.  As the bank is working through the process, and its board of directors still need to make its determination, we feel it is premature to be more specific about the current examination.  However, once concluded, the bank will provide details on the outcome of the review.<\/p><p> To conclude, I reiterate that KBC Bank Ireland's ambition is to be the customer-centric challenger bank for Irish consumers.  We are part of a well capitalised, resilient international financial group. We have access to support, innovations and learnings from within KBC Group.<\/p><p> My colleagues, Ms Deering and Mr. McCarthy, and I will now respond to any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017092800002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Wim Verbraeken","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506588300,"counter":1457,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Verbraeken and his colleagues.

Of all the banks, I have received more representations from customers of Mr. Verbraeken's bank and its handling of the tracker mortgage examination than I have about any other bank.

We started that process in 2016.  By the end of September 2016, we had come to an initial determination and an initial plan through the Central Bank.  Since then, we have undertaken further review which is very complex and is essentially an iterative process.  It is very comprehensive.  We are determined to capture all the customers who have been impacted.  We deployed considerable resources to that effort, which is still ongoing.  It is because that effort is still ongoing and the bank's board of directors has not yet come to a final determination that we believe it is premature to disclose any interim partial figures or amounts.  It is complex and comprehensive in that we are not only looking at customers with regard to contractual rights but also the context, transparency and disclosure which brings element of subjectivity to considerations.  That is what we are doing.<\/p><p>We are developing our determination around the identification of customers affected, plus a scheme for redress and compensation for those customers who will ultimately have been identified as being in scope and affected.  That will be submitted to our board of directors and then obviously transferred to the Central Bank.  I cannot give the committee a specific timeline with respect to the completion of that effort.  We are determined to do this as soon as possible.  We want to conclude the matter as soon as possible because we believe it is in the interests of the bank, consumers and the financial market in general, but our first priority is to be comprehensive and to be sure we do not leave any customers outside the scope.<\/p><p> To return to the specific question on the customers we have put back on the correct rate, the matter arose earlier in 2017.  It concerns a batch of customers we had identified in the course of the effort we expended in 2016.

KBC has great offers in terms of the reductions in interest rates for savers and those who have a current account with KBC.

No indication has been given beyond saying it will be done as soon as possible.  The witness says they will be prioritised yet there is no evidence of that being done thus far.  Based on the number of customers of other banks who have lost their homes, I imagine the number of individuals affected here might be a dozen or two dozen and not a huge number of accounts.  It should not be beyond the collective wisdom of those in KBC to prioritise them because although the bank has done serious damage to many of its customers, those who have lost their homes most need prioritisation.

These were not student loans, but loans of &euro;5 million, &euro;6 million and so forth to connected parties.

Ms Mary Hurley from my Department, who is sitting to my right, met members last week and I asked her to brief the committee on a range of housing matters but I am keen to engage directly with the committee myself as early as possible into this D&aacute;il term to discuss the many housing challenges we face and to personally update it on matters.  We have already had a number of opportunities in the D&aacute;il since we returned and I will be in the Seanad again this afternoon.  I thank the committee for the support it has given to me and my officials since I was appointed Minister and for working so well with the Department in putting forward innovative solutions and ideas designed to alleviate the current housing crisis and to drive delivery and supply measures.  I also extend thanks to local authority members and personnel for the work they are doing, as well as the voluntary sector for the work it is doing day in and day out.  I am joined today by the following colleagues.  They are Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General, whom members know; Ms Mary Hurley; and Mr. David Walsh, assistant secretary with responsibility for planning, land management and the housing market policy division.<\/p> <p>  I will first take the opportunity to update the committee on the review of Rebuilding Ireland, including some of the progress made recently in tackling homelessness and on the homelessness measures that are being advanced on foot of the housing summit with local authority chief executives.  Notwithstanding this wide-ranging platform of action, we all know significant challenges remain.  One year on from Rebuilding Ireland&rsquo;s publication, a focused review has been carried out to assess the impact of the new investments, policies and initiatives being advanced under the action plan and consider where to focus and redouble efforts to address the supply and affordability issues that persist.  The aim of the review is to identify additional measures, particularly new or additional supply side measures for social, private and rented accommodation, with an emphasis on affordability and those key workers who are currently under pressure in finding homes to buy or rent.  The review will also identify further measures to tackle homelessness and to help individuals and families to remain living in their own homes; a range of ambitious and realistic measures to address vacant housing and provide a disincentive to vacancy in future; ways of reducing construction costs and improving the efficiency and viability of apartment and house building; new measures to support and encourage the rental sector; and ways of delivering sustainable mixed tenure solutions on sites of scale, especially in our cities where the demand-supply imbalance and price inflation is greatest.<\/p> <p>  Already, a number of initiatives have been announced as part of the review.  With regard to social housing and homelessness, these include a change in social house building policy, which will see the housing budget being re-orientated more towards direct build programmes for local authorities and housing bodies.  As a result, the current target for 2018 of circa 3,000 newly built homes will increase by almost 30% to circa 3,800.<\/p><p>There will also be additional emergency accommodation and family hubs to meet the short-term needs of homeless households; the establishment of a new homeless inter-agency group chaired by Mr. John Murphy, former Secretary General, to facilitate the delivery of homeless services in a coherent and joined-up way between the relevant Departments and agencies; the development of a homeless prevention strategy for non-nationals without entitlements, i.e. habitual residence conditions, by the Departments of Housing, Justice, and Social Protection; facilitation of homeless families in Dublin wishing to move to locations outside the capital, where possible; and an urgent examination of the issue of refusals of reasonable offers of accommodation by those in emergency accommodation with a view to a consistent approach to such refusals being implemented nationally.<br\/><br\/>Further measures have been signalled in relation to the rental sector. These include a further extension of rent pressure zones to Drogheda and Greystones; an enhanced regulatory role for the Residential Tenancies Board to more directly drive compliance and best practice, which will be implemented over a two-year change management programme; a reinforced awareness campaign to ensure wider awareness by tenants of their rights, an important measure in terms of homelessness prevention; and additional legislative and other measures to strengthen the protections available to tenants and to address issues in relation to short-term lettings. <br\/><br\/>Additional measures flowing from the Rebuilding Ireland review will be announced in the coming weeks, including in the context of budget 2018. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>I have been asked to keep this statement short and that is what I intend to do.  I have outlined just a number of measures that are under way.  I know only too well that more is needed and more will be done.  I again thank the committee.  My officials and I are happy to respond to any questions that members may have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017092800002#D00300","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506585600,"counter":1692,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The last time we met I raised the need for independent inspections of emergency accommodation.  Since then the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, DRHE, has completed its work on the national quality standard framework and have presented that work to the Department along with a proposal for the establishment of a national equality standards office which would have an inspectorate related to it.  Can the Minister give us an update on that?  Can he tell us when that office is going to be established and what its staff and budget are going to be?  Can he also tell us if it will be independent of the Department, the local authorities and the regional homeless executive, and if it will cover all emergency accommodation, including private emergency accommodation?<\/p> <p>  On the land initiatives I have a very straightforward question.  There are four land initiative projects currently in negotiations with the local authorities, with three in Dublin city and one in south Dublin.  I understand that there is going to be a call from councillors in Dublin city for the Department to directly fund the land initiative regeneration project in St. Michael's estate rather than have it as a private sector-led development.  I have raised this issue with the Minister before and I would ask that he consider such a proposition, particularly in the light of the budget announcements in a couple of weeks.  <\/p> <p>  Can the Minister update us on the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF?  Can he tell us when the Department will be making decisions on whether to afford funding to the preferred list of projects?  Can he give us any update on the concerns many of us have around affordability?<\/p> <p>  Can the Minister tell us when the building reports from both the housing agency and the Department will be published, and can he give us a guarantee that there will be no watering down of those reports and that the Oireachtas members will be given those reports in full, as they are presented to him? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017092800002#E00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1506585600,"counter":1694,"content":"<p>I will answer the last question first.

I do not know whether that is one of the leaks that the Deputy referred to in his contribution yesterday evening.  Work on that report is continuing.  I had the chance to preview an early draft to see how it is progressing, but there is still a bit of work to be done, if I am being honest.  It is not an easy thing to do, and obviously  the Department has a number of pressures across a number of fronts.<\/p> <p>  I am not exactly sure when the other report will be available.  I did discuss it very recently in my most recent meeting with the housing agency.  We want to publish both reports together, and I do not want there to be delay on our side from having them both published.  I would hope to have them in the course of October.  <\/p> <p>  On the independent inspections, I am currently in a position where I am finalising budgets.  We want to see more inspectors, and we need to have a budget to provide for those inspections.  I am working on that.  It will include more inspections in the private sector, which is important as well.  We will have a protocol in place.  There should be a reporting mechanism which reports to me, but there should also be a separate reporting mechanism which reports to the committee so that it can understand exactly what is coming from those inspections and what is showing.  That is something that we are also progressing with the water services legislation, which is currently on Second Stage.  We are working on that protocol at the moment with the DRHE, and we will have something on that shortly.  The key thing is to get the money in place so that we can have the inspectors and the inspections.<\/p> <p>  On the land initiatives, I am meeting with Dublin City Council on Monday evening and it will no doubt raise this with me then.  I look forward to seeing more details on this.  If we can help in a meaningful way I would like us to help, but I will wait and see what the city council has to say to me directly.<\/p> <p>  On LIHAF, the local authorities met the 15 September deadline.  The different contracts are at various stages and I have a number of them on my desk at the moment.  I wanted to stress to the local authorities that they should not wait for me to sign off before proceeding to design stage.  In 80% of cases that has happened.  They are already at design stage, pending approval from me.  To give a brief update, one of the 34 projects listed has fallen out.  It was a smaller project and we were not able to proceed with that.  I will give more details on that when I can.  We are about to sign off on 20 of the contracts.  I will be able to sign them quite quickly because I am happy with them all.  In a few other cases we are having a second look to see if we are getting what we think we should be getting.  It is at the sensitive stage of signing contracts so there is not too much I can say, but what I can say for certain is that about 70% of the housing that will be delivered by LIHAF will be two or three bedroom units costing &euro;320,000 or less.  At the moment we are trying to ensure that we can secure an affordable provision on site.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017092800002#E00600","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1506585600,"counter":1697,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming in this morning.  I appreciate all of the work that has been done and the progress that has been made on the issue of homelessness but it is an escalating crisis month on month.  Do we have data on or do we hold interviews with the people who are becoming homeless to identify the reasons behind homelessness?  If we have that data can it be shared with the committee?<\/p> <p>  I have heard more and more evidence that many homeless families from Dublin have been shoved out into neighbouring counties and are being accommodated there.  Do we have any statistics on that?  <\/p> <p>  One of the more worrying statistics is that while the crisis is mainly in Dublin we are seeing a greater percentage increase in homelessness outside of Dublin.  Since March last year we have seen an 81% increase in families and a 55% increase in children becoming homeless, which is an escalation.  <\/p> <p>  On the social housing programme, I believe we are not really at the game when 75% of the projects are for 20 units or fewer.  We are not really tackling the problem.  We use sustainable development as the excuse for not being able to build larger estates, but if we were to use public housing and mixed tenure, such as social housing, affordable housing and affordable rent, we could provide that and build larger housing developments.  I understand that procurement and planning are the two aspects of the four stage process that are killing the process, or greatly slowing it down.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister has said that finance is not the problem.  If finance is not the problem surely it is fiscal space?  We do not have a bottomless pit of money when it comes to finance.  <\/p> <p>  I would appreciate a quick update on An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The Minister mentioned that some 5,000 homes are currently going through An Bord Plean&aacute;la's process.  There is no way of tracking the applications at the moment.  Is there any way that this committee can be given data on how that is progressing, specifically concerning the two pre-consultation processes, with the council and An Bord Plean&aacute;la's pre-planning process?<\/p><p>We are beginning to have a debate about vacant properties, local authorities and the accuracy of the CSO information on this area.  We need to get to the bottom of the issue of vacant properties.  The census will say the numbers do not include over-shop premises, and we all know that in every rural town and even in the cities there are a huge number of them.<\/p><p> Regarding approved housing bodies, what is the percentage of the market rent being paid?  Is it different or is it the same for everyone?  When will we have the review of the rental pressure zones which, I think, was promised in early summer?  Where are we regarding the skills shortage?

Later this afternoon I hope to publish the latest homelessness numbers.  I have not had a chance to look properly at them and I want to do that before I publish them so I can have confidence in them, but what they will show is an increase in homeless families nationally but a decrease in homeless families in Dublin.  I was in Limerick yesterday and met with the chief executive of the council there and they have a problem with homeless families in Limerick.  They have a large number of homeless families there but, because of the new money I announced at the housing summit for hubs, they will be able to draw that down and they have given me an assurance that almost all of those families will be in either hubs or social housing homes before Christmas.  One of the outcomes of the housing summit, apart from the list of outcomes that was published, was the renewed focus from the local authorities and the money that I was making available to tackle this.  Much work will have to be done, including more work outside of Dublin than has been happening to date, but in one respect, because Dublin has had this problem for longer, there are many supports now in place that we can roll out more easily outside of Dublin that will help.  Regarding when a person presents as homeless, we have people and teams in place that are there to try to understand exactly what the situation is and a huge amount of effort goes into prevention.  Since Rebuilding Ireland came into effect, 1,000 families have been moved out of emergency accommodation but 500 have been prevented from entering it, so a huge amount does go into prevention work.  That can only happen when one does a proper interview and understands exactly why the person has presented, then sees how one can best keep them from falling into emergency accommodation.<\/p> <p>  There are a couple of points to make about the social housing programme.  One of the focuses we have under the national development plan that I published earlier in the week is our intention that 40% of growth in building and development over the next 20 years will be in already built-up areas, which would take advantage of infill sites.  I had the opportunity over the summer to visit these types of sites in counties such as Carlow and Kildare where infill development is taking place, and some of the sites are quite impressive.  I had to try to break ground on one of them and could not get the shovel into the ground.  It was a bit embarrassing and Deputy Casey's colleague beside him had a good laugh at me at the time.  Building would not be my forte.  The other point is that we do not want to build massive social housing developments.  We want a good mix.  We have seen in D&uacute;n Laoghaire a very important project come forward through the councillors for a mix of social and affordable housing, which I think is the model that can be replicated elsewhere.  I will announce more affordability measures next week on the builds side that will help.  After the budget we will have another round of affordability for buyers, which I think will be helpful as well.  When we have those, it means we can have more ambition around certain sites that are in public ownership and what can be delivered.  Regarding the build programme, we are pushing more and more towards rapid.  Dublin City Council has come with its first volumetric rapid build of about 600 units, which is important.<\/p> <p>  We have been doing work over the past number of months as to how we can shorten the four-stage process and lock in a guarantee of a certain number of months - and no longer than that - and we are very close to being able to finalise that process with officials.  We have never refused a project on money grounds that has been requested of us by a local authority, and that is an important point to note.<\/p> <p>  I was with An Bord Plean&aacute;la a number of weeks ago.  It has its own internal change management programme under way regarding how it uses technology and how it might better use it.  I will ask An Bord Plean&aacute;la for any data it can give me and I can give those data to the committee to help it to understand exactly how the fast-track process is going.  The figure I think I heard at the time was that it had 5,000 homes or units on its books going through that process.  I will get more up-to-date information on that for the committee.  I want to give the committee more data sets rather than publishing quarterly reports and the amount of time that goes into that, so we will definitely follow through on that.<\/p> <p>  Regarding vacancy-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017092800002#F00300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1506585600,"counter":1701,"content":"<p>I must cut the Minister off to allow Senator Coffey in because we have gone over the time.

I welcome the fact the Minister is establishing an inter-agency group to look at homelessness, because we need more coherence in the sector.  Does he have detailed levels of funding that are being provided to local authorities, approved housing bodies and the various agencies and NGOs?  I am conscious that a lot of resources and funding are being put into the sector, and it would be helpful if we had a breakdown of that as well as guidance as to how we can improve on the delivery of the service to maximise the impact of that funding.  That would be critical.<\/p> <p>  The second point I wish to make concerns housing in general.  I am concerned about a cohort of our citizens who are essentially falling between two stools.  First, they do not qualify for mortgages because their wages are not up to it and, second, they do not qualify for social housing.  They are struggling to meet the rent due to rent pressures, especially in the rental pressure zones, RPZs.  Are new initiatives being brought in to address and assist these people?  The Minister mentioned affordability.  I am hopeful that these affordability mechanisms, whether through purchase or rent, will be introduced to help this cohort of people.  The number of them out there, and we all know them, is bringing pressure in the rental pressure zones and having a knock-on impact right throughout the housing system.  If we could do something to address that cohort, it may reduce or relieve some of the pressure on rent in the RPZs.<\/p> <p>  I wish the Minister well and offer my support in anything he does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017092800002#F00800","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speech","time":1506585600,"counter":1706,"content":"<p>Regarding the inter-agency group, and not to personalise it, but the chair, John Murphy, is the former Secretary General of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and led the Action Plan for Jobs.  He also has previous experience in the housing side of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government so he is more than qualified to help get a better co-ordination of the various services.  Many supports are spent on trying to help people in homelessness, and rightly so.  This year, my Department will provide - I will give the committee a proper detail of this, but this is off the top of my head - around &euro;100 million in homelessness services.  Between local authorities separately and the HSE there will be about another &euro;50 million to perhaps &euro;65 million.  A little less than half of that, maybe 40%, goes through the voluntary sector in terms of service delivery.  One of the things I have heard back from the voluntary sector is that they will hear of a commitment for funding from somewhere else regarding a facility or services that will be run in a homelessness facility, the money does not materialise and then they find themselves chasing it down.  This is to make sure that the money that is committed is being spent appropriately in the right place.  That is a piece of work that Mr. Murphy will do.  He has already commenced that work.  We have met and a series of meetings is coming up very shortly.  I will get an accurate breakdown to the committee following today's meeting.<\/p> <p>  As for people falling between two stools and not being able to qualify for a mortgage or for social housing, we have affordable buy schemes on the way in certain sites such as O'Devaney Gardens.  It was intended that there would be a mix of affordable buy and affordable rent there but more than likely, in terms of the numbers adding up, it is probably going to be more affordable buy.  I am conscious that people are locked out of the mortgage market.  I am conscious that these people would be able to finance or repay a mortgage if they could get better financing terms and, again, without wanting to fly any kites or be accused of doing so, we will have measures to announce later on in a couple of weeks.<\/p> <p>  Senator Coffey mentioned the rent pressure zones.  They are working, and the data for Dublin show us that if the trend for this year continues, rent inflation will be about 3% in Dublin.  Last year it was 8.5%.  When one is paying a high rent of &euro;1,500, as most people in Dublin are, that kind of change does make a difference.  It is good that we saw two new areas, Drogheda and Greystones, qualify.  Given that we have that criterion in law now, we will more than likely see over each of the coming quarters more areas fall into those zones, although ideally we would not because the rents would not be increasing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017092800002#F00900","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1506585600,"counter":1707,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for coming before the committee and acknowledge the very constructive engagement we have had with them in the committee and outside it.  That is worth saying.  I want to stay focused on the questions because our time is limited.  The Minister might give us some detail on the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF.  There is much controversy surrounding the affordability aspect of LIHAF.  I appreciate there are sensitivities around this, but I want the Minister to comment particularly on the following if he can.<\/p><p>Regarding Cherrywood, we see that an application came in yesterday.  There is some suggestion that all of that housing will be built to rent so one could say we might have an affordable rent scheme in Cherrywood.  There is affordability.  Huge amounts of public funds are being committed under the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF.  We have got to get commitments, and we have got to deliver in that regard.  The Minister says that 80% of them are fine tuned and ready to go, but there has to be transparency.  That is the key word.  People want to know if taxpayers' money is assisting the private sector - and I have no problem with the private sector - which will capitalise and make a lot of money on it.  I accept it may provide some housing but people need to know what is happening.  I have referenced Cherrywood in particular so I ask the Minister to respond to that.<\/p><p> The Minister issued a call to local authorities in August in terms of the capital assistance scheme, CAS.  That is not that long ago but I would be interested to know if he has had feedback on that.<\/p><p> The Minister mentioned data sets.  The big problem with Rebuilding Ireland and monitoring the policy here and generally around the country is a uniform data set.  Every agency and every person speaking in the media has different sets.  We need to tidy up that.  That is an important focus so that in terms of data we know what we are dealing with in real terms.  The Minister might also comment on that.<\/p><p> Regarding use of the social housing construction projects status report, we need one.  I am not suggesting we could have it today, but we need to be updated on that.<\/p><p> Regarding a complete inventory of all council lands, it has been brought to my attention on numerous occasions, and I have direct experience of it in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, that the local government audit service, which operates within the Minister's Department, has identified local authorities failing to comply fully with the requirements to log, register and carry out a detailed inventory.  Some of this is about literally transferring data from paper to some sort of system but this has gone on for four, five and six years, which raises an issue.  It is not happening and local chief executives are saying they have no funds to do it.  That is not a good enough reason.  The auditors are on record.  It is on the Department's website, which I looked at again this morning to see that they have identified failure to comply cases in 2014, 2015 to 2016.  No action has been happening on this.  How can the Minister complete his detailed information if he cannot find that out?<\/p><p> On the indemnity scheme in respect of the agreement on residential institutions, it was identified that substantial lands would be made available.  Has the Minister done anything on that?<\/p><p> I refer to the targets set by the Minister's Department regarding local authorities.

It was great to see him in Carlow.  It is welcome to see houses being built but my biggest issue is that we do not get a timescale in that regard.  The two housing estates the Minister was launching were brought to the local authorities two years ago.  We are now two years on and a brick has not been laid on those two sites, although I understand the Minister is probably not aware of that.  When a housing estate is being launched, a timescale for its completion should be given because people see the pictures in the newspapers and think the houses are coming on stream but one cannot state they will be available next year, for example.  While I understand we must be careful on giving timescales, issues like that need to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  The issue of affordable housing is not being addressed.  As previous speakers said, too many people are falling between the cracks in the system and are not qualifying to go on the local authority housing list.  That is a problem.  I could give the Minister ten examples of applications for mortgages that went from Carlow County Council to Dublin.  One was passed and nine were refused.  These are the people who are not going on the housing list but they do not seem to be getting any help.  Will the Minister look at the issue of local authority mortgages because it is one option that needs to be addressed?  <\/p> <p>  We still have not addressed the question of people left in their family home when they have a mortgage.  I know that is a separate issue but each member present could speak about the number of people who come into their clinics in dire straits and who have nowhere to go for help.  We are not addressing any of those issues.  That is why we are seeing a new homelessness.  I appreciate that we have to have the hubs in Dublin, but the new assessment of rent pressure zones the Minister has brought in, and they are working, should have been national.  When in a housing crisis such a measure should be rolled out across the board.  Areas such as Carlow, Kilkenny and others are not included in that assessment.  That is a disaster for us because I know of people who cannot afford to pay &euro;1,000 a month rent.  They are not going on the housing list and they cannot qualify for the housing assistance payment, HAP.  That is where I believe the Minister is creating a new homelessness and it is not being addressed.<\/p> <p>  I believe the Department is looking at more private housing, as in co-operative organisations such as Cl&uacute;id and Respond!.  That seems to be the way it is moving forward, which is not good.  I believe the Department is pushing that approach.<\/p> <p>  In regard to NAMA, there has been funding available for seven years for purchasing houses but I still believe the Department is pushing the lease-to-rent idea.

I heard Deputy Jan O'Sullivan state that I was on a couple of sites recently which she had announced three or four years ago.  I cannot speak to any problems that might be encountered in the course of any development but we need to make sure, and we can do that now with the new procurement tender framework for rapid housing, that we can be confident about these timelines.<\/p><p>I recently visited a site where a commitment had been given to have the houses built within 12 months and I was talked through exactly how the commitment would be met.  It is important that we have such commitments and every contract will have one.  Through the different processes we have coming into place, we can get many sites built more quickly than in the past because we have been coming from a low base.  While it takes time to get the wheels turning, the wheels are now turning very quickly and  I am certain we will see considerable progress in the next 12 months. <\/p><p> On affordability and the issue of people not qualifying for social housing, the figures of one application being approved and nine refused go against the overall data trend.  Obviously, the approval rate will not be as high as it would be in a bank because some of those applying for mortgages may not have a good credit history or may have outstanding debts on credit cards and so forth.  The local authority approval rate is not as low as one in ten, however.  We are examining this issue with a view to doing something on this issue in the coming weeks. <\/p><p> The purpose of the mortgage-to-rent scheme is to keep people in their homes and avoid them losing their homes.  Yesterday, we announced a new programme involving a new housing body that is working with Allied Irish Banks.  Applicants who qualify under the new scheme will have debt written off.  This will be a game changer and I do not see how other institutions will avoid following suit.  I am hoping other housing bodies will become involved in this area.  The scheme only applies to people who qualify for social housing.  However, at least they will be able to stay in their homes and have protection and security of tenure for the next 25 or 30 years.  They will also have an option to buy back the property at some point if they are able to do so.  While it is difficult for them in the sense that they will lose their homes and will no longer own them, it is important that this voluntary and demand-led programme has been introduced.  It is also good that a housing body has taken advantage of the existing scheme.  I will soon invite expressions of interest for a new scheme that will leverage a different type of finance, which I hope will also deliver more in this area.<\/p><p> I am still not sure what point the Senator was making about housing bodies.

The legislation is an effort to cut costs and time, streamline certification without compromising quality and bring older buildings and housing units above shops into use as quickly as possible.  I hope the Minister will support and, if necessary, amend it.<\/p> <p>  The Taoiseach spoke of re-purposing the National Asset Management Agency and I have publicly stated that NAMA has a role to play in this area.  The Minister indicated that funding for projects was not a problem.  Expenditure on capital projects is only 50% of what it was in 2008.  NAMA has an opportunity to use its expertise and an off-balance sheet model to provide funding at or higher than the 2008 level to address this issue. <\/p> <p>  On affordability, I am pleased to hear the commitment given by the Minister regarding announcements he will make in the coming weeks, especially as the Fine Gael Party scrapped the only State-sponsored scheme in 2012.  I welcome the progress that will be made in this regard, even if it is five years late. <\/p> <p>  I listened to Senator Murnane O'Connor's point on the assistance local authorities could provide to the new cohort of people who find themselves in the predicament of being unable to fund a mortgage or rent.  Credit unions also have a role to play in this area. <\/p> <p>  On the costs of construction, I note that Laois County Council reduced the development charge in the county.  This is a commendable move which sets an example for other local authorities.  The Department should follow its lead by addressing the costs of construction.  I make no apology for advocating targeted reductions in VAT.  The Minister should also consider a new model for certification and the role local authorities can play.  This could generate revenue.  He should also address the costs of construction.  I am disappointed he will engage in another consultation process on how to address these costs.  We have had enough discussion and debate.  The Minister should take a coherent approach under which the cost of finance would be led by a State development bank or State revenue would be provided for this purpose. <\/p> <p>  When the rent pressure zones were introduced the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, gave a commitment to put in place a commission on taxation to make recommendations for this year's budget aimed at helping and assisting those who are providing housing units in the private sector and preventing them from leaving the market.

Only 3,000 houses or 6% of the potential number have been built.  Mr. McDonagh blamed land hoarding for this.  Land hoarding and leaving land unused is not penalised and these practices have been shown to result in land speculation and higher house prices.

Everyone here, including the Minister, accepts that we need more social housing.  It is important that we and the local authorities build more social housing in bigger quantities.

There is almost the same amount of work involved in dealing with those applications as in dealing with the larger ones.  We need to move on with big schemes, such as the Oscar Traynor development in Coolock, and to push them along.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Barry Cowen mentioned a Bill.  The downstairs empty shops - not the upstairs - are probably a bigger concern to me.  The country is littered with them.  Many are in Ballymun.  I have seen them in Sallins and right across the country.  They were built in the Celtic tiger era when it was said that there were going to be certain shops for certain apartment blocks.  They have just been left there.  Some have been vacant for ten or 20 years at this stage.  I do not know what the local authorities are saying but we need to deal with that.  I have tortured Dublin City Council over compulsory purchase orders, CPOs.  There are only 20 in train at the moment with the council, the largest local authority in the country.  Nearly half of those relate to Finglas because I have tortured the council that much to put down CPOs on houses that have been left idle and are being vandalised for various different reasons.  We need to up our game.  The council needs to be told that it has to up its game.  I have spoken to Brendan Kenny about this on numerous occasions and we are still in the same boat.  We have not got to the point of issuing CPOs.  Louth has issued CPOs for a large number of units, though I do not know how many.  There are many units in Louth and in other local authority areas.  What the hell is going on that prevents Dublin City Council from doing that?  I do not understand it.<\/p> <p>  We have to look at affordable housing.  Did the Minister have any discussions on the &Oacute; Cualann model in Ballymun?  What discussions have taken place to encourage a number of builders that would be prepared to buy into this process and use local authority lands?  Have we set up a list of builders that would deliver this?  One could then bypass procurement and pick from a list as one does with adaptions when doing adaptions.  That way, we can overcome many problems in procurement and other issues and speed up the process.

As I said in Limerick at a two-day conference on social housing with the housing bodies, one thing we want to do is scale these models.  Hence, we are looking at the affordability criteria that they put in place to see if we could adopt the model and make it a general scheme for all local authorities and not just that particular housing body.

The council tells us that.  Alarmingly, it could be as low as 75 units or, if it is spread across, it could be a &euro;75,000 discount on average prices which are about &euro;450,000.  That is not affordable and it is no use.  It is not a serious return.  As Senator Boyhan said, Cherrywood will be one of the biggest developments in the State.  It could solve D&uacute;n Laoghaire's housing problem but it is not going to do so as matters stand because we will get 800 social units of 8,000 altogether and there may be as little as 1% in affordable housing.  The other big development is in Shanganagh.  The council is currently only talking about 200 units on a site that could potentially have 536 units.  Over a three or four-year period, we will get 1,000 social units against a housing list of 5,700.  By the time those are delivered, the list will be longer.  That is no good.  What is the Minister going to do to increase the percentages of LIHAF and of social housing in Cherrywood?  If he does not do those things, we will not solve the problem.  There is currently no plan to do anything about that.  What will happen to the NAMA land in Cherrywood?  I presume it is part of the 20,000 planned units of which we will only get 2,000 for social housing.  That is no good; it is not enough.  Unless we ramp that up, we will not solve the crisis in our area.  I suspect that D&uacute;n Laoghaire reflects what is happening in the rest of the country.<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister tell me how he is going to increase the percentage and proportion of social and affordable housing?  To nail a myth and get the Minister to confirm it, there is a notion that it is too costly for local authorities to maintain council houses.  I looked at D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council's budget for this year.  It gets &euro;15 million in rent from all its social housing stock.

The Deputy claims that it is only 10% but it not certain what affordability might also be delivered on the site in question.  I cannot speak to the individual circumstances of Cherrywood because we are at a sensitive stage in the contract negotiations.  The Deputy knows that when I had funding, there were two criteria to which the council could apply that funding - one was the cost of production for every unit on a site and the other was an affordability dividend for a smaller number of units.  Different local authorities have done different things depending on the how much money they are getting.  What we can be certain of, and what I will be certain of when we have signed these contracts, is that the public return will be commensurate with the public investment made into that site.  That is the responsibility that I have as Minister.<\/p> <p>  On Shanganagh in the Deputy's local authority area, Councillor Brady has come forward with an innovative proposal for social and affordable housing across the entire site.  It is very welcome.  We looked at it in the Department, the chief executives in D&uacute;n Laoghaire looked at it and we hope it can proceed and that other councils can also take it on board.<\/p> <p>  On the maintenance of local authority housing, there is a myth, and people have told it to me, that certain local authorities are unwilling to invest in new homes because they do not want to take on the ongoing recurrent maintenance charges which would fall on them each year.  I do not see that being the case and certainly local authorities have not raised anything like this with me.  It is just a myth.<\/p> <p>  The eligibility criteria for social housing are being reviewed but I do not expect that there will be a significant increase, if there is an increase at all.  When the position was reviewed previously, an additional buffer of &euro;5,000 was inserted in respect of the anticipated increases - these did occur - in that period.  That review is ongoing.<\/p> <p>  We are coming to an agreement on a definition of what constitutes substantial refurbishment.  I gave a broad outline of what that might look like when I mentioned the change we are putting in place for the RTB.  A number of housing bodies have come to me and to the different agencies with definitions or wordings that might work.  That will be communicated to landlords and owners by the RTB in coming weeks.  If I have to put it on legislative footing, I will do so.  However, the only legislation in respect of which it might be possible to do that would be the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill which has reached Report Stage and which will be coming back to the House in October.  I do not particularly want to do that because it would not be the right place to put it but if it is necessary and Deputies are willing to support me in allowing a late amendment we might be able to do it then.  If not, we will have to do it next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017092800002#K00800","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1506585600,"counter":1781,"content":"<p>I apologise if, following on some of the points arising from the housing summit, I repeat a questiont hat was asked earlier.  Inviting the local authority managers in for a summit seems to be a reactive thing which is done when the housing and homelessness figures are released and show a large increase.  People view it quite cynically.  If the Minister wanted a real summit, one would imagine that members of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government would be invited, as well as other interest groups.  I understand that the Minister cannot host a massive event.<\/p> <p>  Some of the things that came out of the summit were cherry-picked by the media.  One of them was moving families out of Dublin and the refusal of offers; these things are merely tinkering around the edges.  They do not deal with the key issue, which is the lack of social house building.  The Minister announced an increase in the target of 30%, I think, which is 800 new social houses.  That would bring the target up to 5,000 social houses in 2018.  That is still far below what would have been natural in previous decades and is even below what was done by the Government before last in the early 2000s.  It does not reflect a housing emergency.  These points are being made again and again.<\/p> <p>  I would have thought that if one were commandeering land to deal with an emergency, one would look at where there are landbanks in key areas in which there is a problem with homelessness.  The Department's website is excellent in some ways.  There is a very good graphic over four pages which shows, very clearly, exactly how many people are homeless in each city.  I looked at the website recently.  Almost 70% of those who are homeless are in to Dublin, then there is spillover into adjacent counties such as Kildare and Meath.  I was surprised to see that the figure for Limerick is higher than that for Cork.  I would have expected Cork to be higher.  Then there is Galway.  We have said repeatedly, if one were to zone in on the problem, there are three or four areas that are really problematic.  Every area has a problem, but the midlands does not have an issue in comparison with other places.  This is not a difficult issue.  Will the Minister look at the landbanks in the areas to which I refer that are owned by local authorities or that are under NAMA's control and focus on those?

I had been meeting with the chief executives of the local authorities during the summer and I realised in July that I needed to bring everyone together.<\/p><p>This was to get everyone onto the same page and see what new measures we needed to take.  That summit was arranged then.  It was not a housing summit for everyone, it was for the chief executives of the local authorities who are responsible to me.  In the course of that week, and indeed every week since I have been in this job, I met representatives of the housing bodies and organisations as well as of the voluntary groups.  This was so that I could have information from them to hand as I then put questions to the local authority chief executives.  The Chair of the Oireachtas committee attended as a witness rather than as a participant because I thought it important that she be there.<\/p><p> In response to the question on social housing targets, the figure is a 30% increase for what we will directly build for local authorities and housing bodies.  That amounts to 3,800 units.  I am focusing on that figure because I do not want to rely on the private sector for the delivery of social housing.  We will get units through Part V which will increase that number.  We will get units through void reconversions which will increase that number again and bring it up to 5,000.  It is important, however, that we focus on what we are building ourselves and that is why I refer to that number.  When one includes acquisitions as well as leasing, which does come into the stock, the number then goes up to almost 8,000, which is not far off that 10,000 that many feel should be delivered every year.  We are ramping up here and ramping up quickly.  The numbers for social housing are good.<\/p><p> I now come to the issue of homelessness.  As I mentioned earlier - perhaps the member was not here - I was in Limerick yesterday.  There is a particular problem there with homeless families, as the member will know from the website.  I met the CEO who assured me that almost all families will be accommodated in either hubs or permanent accommodation before Christmas, which is important.  The homelessness problem is concentrated in certain areas, and that is why we have things like the housing assistance payment, HAP, place finder in those areas, something we are also rolling out nationally.  We have also decided to appoint a Housing First national director and there will be Housing First places outside of Dublin for the first time as well.  We will now have exit co-ordinators coming in as a preventative measure to keep people from falling back into homelessness.<\/p><p> With regard to what D&uacute;n Laoghaire is and has been doing, we supported Councillor John Bailey's mix of social and affordable housing.

Where there have been difficulties with rapid build and with other areas in the past year, we have learned from the experience of fixing these difficulties and from the changes that have been made as a result.  We can have greater confidence in our numbers.<\/p> <p>  There were some additional questions, although I may have addressed them already.  Let me be clear about the vacancy numbers. The Central Statistics Office came out with the figure of 198,000 homes.  Included in that were vacant homes in areas where there was no demand for housing.  The figure also includes homes between lettings, homes that were being sold, and a number of homes caught up in probate.  We did a desktop exercise in the Department at the time which showed that there might potentially be 90,000 homes in high-demand areas that needed to be looked at.  The geodata numbers came out at around that time and they indicated something similar.  We started to drill down into this and thought that we might perhaps be dealing with 25,000 vacant units in high-demand areas throughout the country that could be brought back into use quickly.  There is no point in targeting a vacant home that cannot be brought into use quickly because the probate issue is so complicated, for example, or because of a matter that is making its way through the courts.  We did further work with the local authority chief executives over the summer and I met the Dublin chief executives individually in their offices to examine this and to examine the numbers in question.  Having done this, it looks like the number will be lower than 25,000.  In fact, I think it will be lower than 20,000.  It is still something to pursue and it is absolutely still a stream of housing that we can bring online.  We need a proper understanding, however, of where these vacant homes are and how we can release them.  That work is ongoing and is nearing completion.  Dublin City Council has the end of October as a deadline for getting solid figures on vacancies back to us, while the deadline for the rest of the country is December.  We will have those numbers.<\/p> <p>  We also need to make sure we can take advantage of over-the-shop living.  Dublin City Council estimates that approximately 4,000 homes could be delivered in this way.  The committee members will know that from walking around the city themselves.  It is also true of towns and villages.  Over recent months I have been at a number of different locations where one could see vacant shops on the village street.  There is no reason they could not become homes.  Again, our long-term objective in the national development plan is to revitalise and regenerate town and village centres.  This means building and living in these centres.  Taken out onto a wider scale in the cities, one can look at examples like the Charlemont Court development that we opened earlier this week in my own constituency.  This is a city centre project making use of infill sites as well as redeveloping an old social housing scheme into a new social and affordable scheme.  It is mixed use with private and commercial space as well as leisure facilities and everything else.  That is where we want to concentrate our development as a principle.  That is very important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017092800002#L01800","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1506585600,"counter":1823,"content":"<p>Both Senator Murnane O'Connor and I asked questions about a scheme for competitive construction finance.

There will be freedom of information, FOI, requests, there will be county managers saying one thing, there will be different councils saying that it is for the Minister to make the decision while the Department says it is a matter for the local authorities, so there are a lot of gaps here.  Who is actually making the pitch when it comes to LIHAF?  There will certainly be transparency issues, FOI requests will be made and parliamentary questions will be answered.  The Minister is aware of that but he just needs to be conscious that there is a need for transparency in anything he does.<\/p> <p>  Would the Minister consider raising the proposed vacant site levy above the 3% level?  This has been recommended by both the ESRI and NAMA and should be considered in the context of bringing the tax forward for 2018.  He should at least consider it because it is important.

That is a simple measure the Minister could undertake.<\/p><p> One often hears about An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the context of Rebuilding Ireland.  Its chair attended this committee and there was discussion of resources and the fast-tracking of planning applications.  There are big problems in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.

The issues that have been raised are very serious and members have been raising them for more than a year.  The Minister held a housing summit with the chief executives of 31 local authorities.  However, the issues raised by members are concerns that are not being addressed in local authority areas, such as the income thresholds for people trying to get on a housing list, the HAP, rent allowance and that people who do not qualify for the housing list cannot get rent allowance.  They are not massive issues but they are being raised every month by members.  The Minister is doing his best and everybody is trying to get funding.  We are told there is a lot of funding but the homeless crisis is getting worse.  People are dying.  It is a crisis.  Regulation for a few years to resolve the crisis is needed.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned homeless families in Dublin who wish to locate outside the capital and that a place finder service will be set up in local authorities, and that is to be welcomed.  However, there are local authorities such as my own where people are trying to get on the housing list in Laois or Kilkenny or both and cannot do so because the local authority housing income threshold is higher in some local authorities than in others.  The Minister needs to broaden his horizons and consider rural towns that are not being addressed.<\/p> <p>  Another issue dealt with at the housing summit was the establishment of a new interagency group to carry out an awareness campaign to promote services to prevent homelessness.  That is also to be welcomed but there is no timescale involved.  There are different agencies involved but this issue requires everybody to work together.  It involves Senators and Deputies promoting this in their own areas because local authorities are key.  Only the 31 local authorities working with the Minister and the Department will be able to solve the housing crisis.  If every local authority is not included, that will defeat the purpose because there is homelessness outside Dublin.  I acknowledge it is a problem in Dublin but it also exists in rural Ireland and is not being addressed there.  Members have been bringing these issues to the attention of the Department for more than a year and I have not received any answer that means I could tell my constituents a problem has been solved.

We should not dismiss the fact there has been a 40% increase in planning permissions since this time last year and a similar increase in construction commencement notices.  As I said last night, there has been a 33% increase in connections to the ESB grid in Dublin.  Things are happening but more needs to happen, and that is why we have the rolling analysis of Rebuilding Ireland to see where we can tweak and improve things as needed.<\/p> <p>  HAP is working, in spite of some people's criticisms of it.  It has supported 17,000 or 18,000 people this year.  Approximately 411 people have moved out of Dublin under HAP, but the purpose is not to move people from high-demand areas to other high-demand areas.  In the programme for Government negotiations, Deputy Harty added a section on a rural regeneration programme, and HAP will play a part in that.  At the housing summit it was agreed to pursue that.  I have spoken to the Deputy about him being involved in that and how it can be done.<\/p> <p>  Homelessness is not a funding issue.

I recently met the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to discuss a change management programme to make it a stronger regulator in the sector such that it could put greater protections in place for tenants and that tenants would not have to take their own cases because they can be in vulnerable positions and not always able to do so.  That will be done over the coming two years.  Another issue dealt with is the definition of substantial refurbishment, and that will be communicated very quickly to landlords in order that people are not taking advantage of perceived loopholes in rent pressure zones.  If that has to be put on a legislative footing, that will be done and that is not a problem.<\/p> <p>  Prevention is very important.  Arising from the housing summit, we announced exit co-ordinators to prevent people falling back into homelessness.  We also announced a change in policy whereby a landlord will have to communicate with the RTB when he or she is serving a notice to quit.  The RTB can then get the different available services to engage early and prevent people from having to access emergency accommodation.<\/p><p>We know that early intervention works.  It needs to happen more.  If it only becomes known that people must vacate their property in one week's time, they will almost certainly fall into emergency accommodation.  It then becomes even more difficult for them to get back into a better form of accommodation.  Early intervention is a key measure and I think it will help the preventive measures to be put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017092800002#M02300","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506585600,"counter":1867,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Cowen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017092800002#N00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1506585600,"counter":1868,"content":"<p>I have three brief questions.  Deputy Ellis raised the powers of the local authorities to serve compulsory purchase orders under the compulsory purchase orders and the derelict sites Acts.  The Minister has stated that funding is not an issue in addressing these problems.  It most certainly is in the case of CPOs and the derelict sites legislation because the local authorities have to fund that process from their own resources.  They do not have the resources because they are not adequately resourced to deal with derelict sites let alone to have the personnel or the finance for inspections of properties or HAP properties that the Minister states are working well.  That is the problem.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the repair and lease scheme, how many successful applications have been approved?  If the figure is as low as has been quoted recently - that is eight such application were successful nationally - surely the Minister now knows why the scheme has failed?  It has failed because of the cumbersome planning certification and regulations associated with the reinstatement or refurbishment of older buildings.  Hence the reason I would expect, as the Minister intimated, that he might support the Fianna F&aacute;il Party Bill next week, which would seek to address that issue.<\/p> <p>  Senator Boyhan raised an issue on the legislation to fast track large developments through An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The legislation was enacted by the D&aacute;il in November 2016 but was not signed into law until May or June 2017, a seven month delay on the part of the Government that wanted to ensure the planning procedure would be carried out expeditiously.  Second, it is without doubt a problem that An Bord Plean&aacute;la also is neither adequately financed nor resourced to deal with those applications as evidenced from UCD's application for 500 apartments in July which was not responded to for seven or eight weeks at which time UCD was told its application was invalid.  That is a sham.  That cannot continue.  We have been told the problem is sorted but it is far from sorted.  It is far from resourced.  The Minister should not try to tell me again that money is not an issue in resolving this issue.  It clearly is when neither An Bord Plean&aacute;la nor the local authorities are adequately resourced or funded to deal with the damning problems that exist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017092800002#N00300","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1506585600,"counter":1869,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

I wish to discuss hubs with the Minister.  My view is that hubs are not homes, they are an interim solution, but the point that Dr. Murphy made that is that we should not see hubs becoming a long-term solution because of the lack of housing.  What is the timeframe for the families who are in hubs in terms of exiting the hubs?  My real concern is that we will have people stuck in hubs.  Even hubs are being spoken about in terms of the five star, the four star or the three star hub as if hubs were the solution.  They are not.  In my view they are an interim solution.  I would like to know the timeframe for the exit point.  If a family goes into a hub, can we say that a family will stay a maximum term of three months and then they are moved out into some kind of social housing, that people do not get stuck in hubs and hubs become a solution as opposed to an interim fix?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017092800002#N03500","speaker":"1385"},{"type":"speech","time":1506585600,"counter":1901,"content":"<p>I do not disagree with any of the Senator's remarks.  Hubs are not an interim solution, they are the first response.  They are meant to replace hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation.  We do not see them as the second stage.  We want people to go directly into hubs and that is why we currently have nine.  We will have 15 hubs when the funding for the current programme is completed.  It is a first response.  It is a very good response.  I know some people who may not be as familiar with what is happening in the hubs and how they work have been too quick to criticise them.  That has undermined them unfortunately.  Great care and support is given to the families that go into the hubs.  We want them to be there for as short a time as possible but we must recognise that different families hove different needs and we must have tailored solutions for each family and to be sensitive to that.  It is not like moving stock, we cannot say that boxes come in and we will move them in three weeks time to the next location.  We have to work with these families and be sensitive to their needs.  If we look at a facility like Mater Dei, and I spoke about this yesterday evening or last week in the D&aacute;il, which can accommodate 27 families at present and which will be able to accommodate 50 families when all the work is completed.  Since that was opened in June 2017, half of the families have moved on into social housing or into HAP supported homes.  They have moved on very successfully, which is great.  For those who have not moved on yet, more solutions will come and they will tell me.  There are a few families who will be there for longer than we would like them to be there because they will find it difficult to move on to a facility or a private home where they do not have the support which they have now, but which they had not had before and which are helpful to them.  I think that is something which we have to be conscious of.  We will do everything that we can to make sure that families in hubs are getting every care while they are there and we will do everything we can to try to move them into sustainable permanent secure accommodating as quickly as possible.  In a number of cases, however, those families unfortunately will be there for a very long time.  Thankfully they will be in hubs rather than hotels.  Some families have been in hotels for far too long and the damage that has inflected on them is really unacceptable.  If we can make sure that those families get out of the hotel rooms, that is very important.  For families, who have to say in hubs longer than we would like, they will continue to get every support possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017092800002#N03600","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1506585600,"counter":1902,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair.

One would expect a full Press Gallery to be present when the Minister is present to answer to the housing committee.  Unfortunately the issue blows hot and cold in the media.  It is sexy for one or two weeks then it goes off the boil again.<\/p><p>Some people here sat on a special housing and homeless committee which met when the Members of the D&aacute;il were all on their holidays last summer because the Government had not been formed.  It brought out a raft of proposals.  I cannot think of one proposal that has actually been implemented.  I would be happy to be corrected on that, but even things like transport for homeless families from hotels have not been addressed.  While we were doing that, the Government was working on its own Rebuilding Ireland, which was a parallel process.  <\/p><p> There is a mantra that HAP is working, but people cannot find HAP houses.  That is the problem.  Nobody can find them.  There is no point in citing a certain number of families because the point is that landlords are not willing to avail of it.  Why would they when they get more money elsewhere.  The failure to stop homelessness is down to the failure to stop evictions.  If no Government is willing to introduce measures to stop evictions, the problem will get worse.  It will reach 10,000 very soon.  It is obvious that we need a movement for housing in this country like we had with the water charges, where massive pressure is put on the establishment to build on the massive scale that is needed. <\/p><p> On the local authority proposals, I do not want to be parochial but I have said before that the area I am in, which is also the Taoiseach's constituency, is a massive homeless blackspot.  The figures speak for themselves.  There is only one piece of council-owned land left in Blanchardstown that is zoned for housing, which is incredible, but we will be bringing a proposal, as the Solidarity councillors did, on how that can be developed.  The local authority managers have been taking too long to do it.  I live in that area and I know it well.  There are 30 hectares there.  Up to 1,200 housing units could be built there, with a park and other facilities.  It could be done with a mixture of social and affordable houses, be it 60-40 or 50-50, with the mortgage income accruing back to the local authority.  It will all be costed.  The Minister says that homelessness is not a funding issue or that money is not a problem.  He has just said that no local authority has ever been turned down for a project on the basis of funding.  There would be a requirement for funding here, but the Minister would resolve much of the homeless problem in Dublin if he did that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017092800002#N03700","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506585600,"counter":1904,"content":"<p>Nobody doubts the importance of this issue.

We will do that.  <\/p> <p>  I look forward to seeing the proposal about the site in Blanchardstown but I have not seen anything yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017092800002#O00600","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1506585600,"counter":1909,"content":"<p>We spoke about land banks.  There is a huge amount of land at Dunsink Lane in Castleknock.  Much of it was compulsorily purchased over the last while by Fingal County Council but there are no plans in place for building on that site.  Recently I was at a meeting with the managers of Fingal County Council which was attended by some Deputies, and it was made clear that it has not been looked at.  We are in a crisis and there is a massive amount of council-owned land there.  I do not understand why it has not even got onto the table.  I feel somewhat tetchy about it.<\/p> <p>  Dublin City County used to make contributions to senior citizens complexes.  It stopped those contributions and has not been making them for a long time.  We have a large number of bedsits in different areas, such as Finglas, Ballymun and Whitehall which are empty and we were supposed to convert two into one.  Now we are returning to the old idea of bedsits.  These are small things that can contribute to helping solve the housing crisis.  We need to ask why those bedsits have been left there.  There are many idle units, not just a couple.  <\/p> <p>  We also need to look at adaptions for overcrowding.  While we stopped these years ago and never went back, families were huge.  That could take a number of people off the housing list.  It would also stop many people from becoming homeless.  It is a small thing.  The local authorities tell us that it is down to funding.  If it is down to funding, surely we should be able to find more money.  We are finding money for dealing with extensions or otherwise, but the overcrowding issue is not being looked at and I believe that it is worth considering. <\/p> <p>  The embargo on recruitment in the local authorities has led to a build up of voids across the city.  It has recently been lifted, but not in the maintenance section.  Most of the people in the maintenance section of Dublin City Council are now aged over 50.  There are no apprenticeships, which is absolutely mad.  Dublin City Council uses private contractors.  In the past we were able to turn over the voids very quickly.  There is a loss of staff there, whether carpenters, metalworkers or electricians, and there is scarcely a person under 50.  I would love it if the Minister would raise that issue, because having more apprenticeships could improve the situation.<\/p> <p>  We have a public private partnership, PPP, supposedly, in Scribblestown, but we seem to be struggling to get it going for some reason in terms of tying up the finance.  Can the Minister explain why we are struggling to get these PPPs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017092800002#O00700","speaker":"1303"},{"type":"speech","time":1506585600,"counter":1910,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

It is obvious that this approach takes longer because, rather than a council doing it itself or getting a contractor in to do it, public private partnership involves having to go through a tendering process, etc.  That is why we are getting delays.  We should stop.  Another reason we get messes is because developers want to make money from PPPs.  They do not enter into PPPs unless they are going to make money.  That slows things down.  I am tetchy and I do not appreciate the politicking.<\/p> <p>  I will explain the record of the Shanganagh site since 2002, when it was given to the local authority.  Along with my People before Profit colleagues, I have been agitating since that time for the development of the site, on which 530 council houses could be built.  In July of this year, for the umpteenth time we proposed a motion calling for the entire site to be developed for public and affordable housing.  Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, the Labour Party and, tragically, Sinn F&eacute;in, voted against that motion.  They were very embarrassed about that decision over the summer.  Lo and behold, all of them, without engaging in any discussion with us, popped up with a plan in September to have 40% of the site developed for social housing, with the other 60% of it being developed for forms of affordable housing which will end up back in the private market.  I do not accept that 60% of a public site should end up back on the private market in five or ten years.  I will explain why.<\/p> <p>  I am not just talking about people I know through politics.  I am personally acquainted with a woman who is living with her eight children in an hotel.  This week, the family is being pushed into its third HAP tenancy.  I could tell similar stories about any week.  I ask the Minister to imagine what it is like to be moved in and out from an hotel to a hostel with eight kids.  This woman, who is crying every day, is being told to go and find a HAP tenancy that does not exist because she will not get a council house for many years.  Another friend of mine, who has been in a car for eight weeks, is trying to prove to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection that he is living in the car.  This is what is going on.  If I am tetchy about this issue, and if I resent politics being played with it, it is for the reasons I have given.<\/p> <p>  It is not good enough that we are getting just 40% of a public site.  It is not good enough that we are getting just 10% in Cherrywood, or just 1% in the case of the local infrastructure housing activation funding.  When homeless people who are now joining the housing list ask me when I think they will get a council house, I have to tell them they are looking at ten or 15 years on the current figures.  At the current rate of delivery, that is what we are looking at, even with the ramped-up plans.  The construction of 1,000 houses on these sites over the next three or four years will not even keep pace with the current list, which is at 5,700.  The person at the end of that list will be waiting 18 years.  I am not exaggerating when I say there are people who have been on the list for 18 years.  What solution is the Minister proposing?  I suggest that there should be more public housing on public land.  The Minister needs to get more off the private developers in sites like Cherrywood than the miserable 10%, or 1% in the case of the local infrastructure housing activation fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017092800002#P00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1506585600,"counter":1918,"content":"<p>I do not mean to play politics at all.

We are talking about 2021 because we tend to deal in five-year time horizons.  It is meant to be the parliamentary cycle.  It is probably part of the human condition.  We can understand five-year periods.  Of course we have ring-fenced the capital funding until 2021.  We have to look beyond 2021.  That is what we are doing at the moment.  We have to approach this from basic principles.  I spoke about this recently.  We must always be confident that each year, a certain percentage of the total housing stock is being built by and will be owned by local authorities and housing bodies and the people in those homes will be protected as a result.  That is something I want to achieve beyond 2021 so that it does not matter who is sitting in this seat.  It could be Deputy Cowen or Deputy &Oacute; Broin, depending on what happens in the future.  This is an important thing to do.<\/p> <p>  We know we need to build more.  That is why I announced a 30% increase in direct builds recently.  That will come from existing funding.  We know we need more money.  That is why I am in negotiations with the Minister about securing more money.  We are hoping for a positive outcome from that.  We know that HAP, in a steady state, is good for some people because it suits their point in life or their choices of what they want to do.  In the current circumstances where supply is so low, HAP is not working for some people.  It is having a potentially detrimental effect on the market in other areas because it is making things more difficult.  We know these things.  That is how we know we have to build more, which is what we are doing.<\/p> <p>  We are ramping up from a very low base.  Before we had our economic crisis, approximately 90,000 homes were being built each year.  I do not think we needed 90,000 homes a year.  What has happened since then probably speaks to that.  At the same time, we did not have a proper social housing construction programme from the Government.  The private and public sectors have had to ramp up from a position of almost nil.  We are ramping up quickly.  We are learning every week and every month.  In every engagement I have, I hear new things that might help what we are trying to do.  That is why we have moved away from some sort of Rebuilding Ireland redux 2.0 to a constant rolling analysis of what we can do to improve this.  That is what we are doing.  Rebuilding Ireland is the plan.  It has made great progress in the past year.  I believe we can do more.  That is what we are trying to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017092800002#P00500","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1506585600,"counter":1921,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I look forward to working constructively with them in the weeks, months and years ahead.  As they have requested, I will outline my priorities in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, including those arising from the expansion of the Department's remit into employment affairs.  I will also, as is normal at this time of the year, outline how the Department is performing against the 2017 budget allocation, but I am keen to listen to members' views and what they see as the key issues for employment affairs and social protection in the years ahead.<\/p> <p>  It would be useful, in the first instance, to outline the scope and scale of the Department&rsquo;s expenditure and its importance for millions of citizens in our country.  An allocation of &euro;19.85 billion was provided for the Department this year.  This represents 37% of gross current Government expenditure.  To the end of August, expenditure was just over &euro;13 billion and is very close to target for the year to date.<\/p> <p>  Each week, about 1.35 million people, including pensioners, people with disabilities, people on maternity or sick leave, carers, and jobseekers, receive a payment from my Department.  In addition, over 626,000 families receive child benefit each month for almost 1.2 million children.  What is significant about these figures is not just their scale, but what they represent, which is a social contract where the State, on behalf of all our citizens, provides supports to those of our citizens who, for whatever reason, need help at certain times in their lives.<\/p> <p>  As the members are no doubt aware, there can be a misconception that most welfare payments go to the unemployed.  That is simply not the case.  The biggest single block of expenditure in 2017 will be on pensions, which will amount to approximately &euro;7.3 billion or 37% of overall expenditure.  Expenditure on working age schemes comprises two programmes, income supports and employment supports, which combined account for about &euro;4.6 billion or 23% of total expenditure.  Income supports, including jobseeker's payments, one-parent family payments, and maternity and paternity payments, account for almost &euro;3.7 billion or 18% of overall expenditure.  Expenditure on employment supports, including community employment, back to education-enterprise and various employment programmes, amounts to just under a &euro;1 billion or 5% of my Department&rsquo;s expenditure.<\/p> <p>  The next biggest expenditure subhead relates to illness, disability and carers' payments, which will amount to just over &euro;3.8 billion or 19% of expenditure in 2017.  Expenditure on children and families will account for nearly 13% of expenditure or &euro;2.6 billion, of which &euro;423 million will be spent on the family income supplement, FIS, paid to low income working families.  Expenditure on supplementary payments like rent supplement, agencies such as the Citizens Information Board, CIB, the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, and miscellaneous services accounts for &euro;863 million or 4% of our expenditure.  Almost all of the expenditure incurred by the Department is demand led.  The demand is driven by demographic trends, including an ageing population and economic factors such as developments in the labour market.<\/p> <p>  As we all know, Ireland has experienced a recovery in employment that has been much more rapid than even the most optimistic analysts projected.  There are now more than 2 million people in employment, with over 48,000 net new jobs added in the year to the end of the second quarter.  As a result of this growth in employment, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, data shows that the unemployment rate estimate stands at 6.1% for August, almost nine percentage points lower than its peak level of just over 15%.  Long-term unemployment stands at 3.1%, which represents a great reduction of 27,000 people over the year.  Youth unemployment has fallen to 16.5%, down from a peak level of over 30%.<\/p> <p>  These trends in unemployment have fed into the live register, which now stands at just over 248,000 people.  There are now over 42,000 fewer people on the live register than the same time last year and 84,000 fewer people than this time two years ago.  The ongoing fall in the live register is freeing up resources we need to meet rising demand in other areas, for example, pensions, people with disabilities and carers.  We estimate that we will need another &euro;180 million in 2018 for increasing numbers of pensioners as our population ages.<\/p> <p>  The question I and my Government colleagues are now considering is how we build a sustainable budget over the coming weeks that will benefit all our people, young and old, rural and urban, and to do so in a way that it does not spread resources too thinly so as not to make any difference.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of developments in 2017 that I would like to mention.  The back to school clothing and footwear allowance was increased this July by 25%, from &euro;100 to &euro;125, for children between the ages of four and 11 and from &euro;200 to &euro;250 for children aged 12 years and over.  That brings the total allocation for the allowance this year to &euro;47.4 million, an increase of &euro;10 million on what was originally proposed for 2017.  The total number of families who have been supported under the scheme this year to date is 139,170.  The scheme remains open until 30 September and the Department is continuing to process applications.<\/p><p> A Government decision was made in June to increase the weekly rate of direct provision allowance for children from &euro;15.60 to &euro;21.60 per week, while the weekly rate for adults increased from &euro;19.10 to &euro;21.60 per week.  These increases took effect in August.<\/p><p> As was the case in the past three years when, due to the continuing improvement in the State's financial position, the Government was ultimately in a position to pay a Christmas bonus, there is no provision for a bonus in the Department's allocation for 2017 currently.  However, I will continue to monitor the financial position and consult my colleagues, and I am hopeful that we will be in a position to pay a Christmas bonus again this year.<\/p><p> The Taoiseach announced to the D&aacute;il on 15 June that labour affairs and labour law responsibilities would transfer from the then Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to the then Department of Social Protection.  At a national level, the following employment policy and legislative functions have transferred to my Department: employment rights policy and legislation; the Low Pay Commission; and legislation on the national minimum wage and related areas.  At EU and international levels, the following employment policy functions are now the responsibility of my Department: a lead role in, and co-ordination of, the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council, EPSCO; the Employment Committee, EMCO, and the EU semester process; the response and input to the EU pillar of social rights; engagement with the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, Eurofound; and the Council of Europe and co-ordination of responses on the Social Charter.<\/p><p> The details of the employment legislation that transferred to my Department following the Government decision are set out in the Labour Affairs and Labour Law (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order 2017, SI 361 of 2017.  The transfer of functions involved 11 pieces of primary legislation in the area of labour affairs and labour law.  The Department's name has changed to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to reflect these new responsibilities.<\/p><p> The transfer of these functions to the Department reflects the close linkages between the welfare and activation remit already in the Department and the operation of the labour market.  As members of the committee will be aware, the conditions for receipt of in-work income supports, unemployment benefits, illness and disability payments, and pension and child support payments reflect and influence how the labour market operates.  Bringing responsibility for employment affairs and social protection together under one Minister recognises this reality and will help to ensure, for example, that developments in respect of minimum rates of pay, working hours and illness absences within the workplace will be co-ordinated with the relevant State welfare supports.  This will be a new challenge for our Department and is one that I am looking forward to leading in the months ahead.  I am pleased to say that 13 staff from the former Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation joined us this week.  I welcome them and hope that they have a long and happy time with us.<\/p><p> In the immediate term, my priority is to publish the employment Bill, which is being drafted.  The committee is aware that the Bill is in response to a commitment in the programme for Government to tackle the problems caused by the increased casualisation of work and, in particular, to strengthen the regulations pertaining to precarious employment.  The proposals contained in the Bill are the result of extensive consultations.  They include public consultation following the University of Limerick study of zero-hour and low-hour contracts, in addition to detailed dialogue with ICTU and IBEC for several months.  I have met IBEC and ICTU in recent weeks to hear first hand their concerns and ideas.  The Bill aims to address a number of issues that have been identified where current employment rights legislation can and must be strengthened to the benefit of employees, particularly low-paid and more vulnerable employees, without imposing unnecessarily onerous burdens on employers and businesses.  That is the trick that we must get right.<\/p><p> Looking ahead to the budget in the next couple of days, the programme for Government contained a number of commitments on employment affairs and social protection.  These include increasing payments, such as pensions and carer's and disability payments, in line with inflation.  We have already met this commitment through the increases granted in the 2017 budget, but we will review what more can be done in the context of this year's budget parameters.  Any change in this regard will have to take account of other priorities, including improving payments to working families on low incomes and tackling child poverty, particularly in single-parent households.<\/p><p> In finalising proposals, I will have due regard to the output from the Department's annual pre-budget forum, which we held on 21 July in Dublin Castle.  The forum enabled me to listen directly to the concerns and views of more than 45 NGOs, including advocacy and representative organisations.  This was worthwhile from our perspective as well as theirs.  It provided useful information to my officials and afforded me a great insight into the competing priorities in the welfare spending and employment affairs parts of our portfolio.<\/p><p> Although the fiscal space available for budget 2018 is yet to be finalised, the summer economic statement indicated that there would likely be less than &euro;500 million of fiscal space available for new expenditure initiatives across all Departments' budgets in 2018.  In this context, it is worth noting that a &euro;5 increase in all weekly payments would cost &euro;350 million, which would absorb most of that fiscal space.  As such, I would welcome input from the committee as to what it believes are the main two or three priorities that my Department should be concentrating on in budget 2018.  I look forward to this dialogue and to hearing members' suggestions and inputs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017092800002#C00300","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506589200,"counter":1936,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  Before I turn to the first questioner, Deputy Brady, I wish to mention that the committee has submitted a number of reports.  The Minister commented on them and mentioned how she would welcome the committee outlining a number of priorities.  Some of those priorities are contained in the reports.  She will get more detail in a moment.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask the Minister two questions that may help the committee in future.  The Minister set out the Government's fiscal space and mentioned how much it would cost to grant &euro;5 across all heads.  On the other hand, she did not say what savings might be inherent.  For example, she mentioned at the outset the reduction in unemployment.  One must add that into the equation.  If she has those figures, they would be helpful to the committee.  It is not just a question of more expenditure.  Are there inherent savings that will accrue that should be considered in the process?  I will revert to the Minister on that point in a moment.<\/p> <p>  One of the reports that we published was on the issue of pensions, with which the Minister is familiar.  She and the Minister before her, the now Taoiseach, clearly indicated that there would be a move away from an annual average pension system to a total contribution one.  Our committee examined that matter, reported and made a number of recommendations.  One of those recommendations had to do with the cohort of people - primarily women, but not exclusively - who had been caught in the transition and were now on a scheme that was introduced in 2012.  Effectively, they are receiving significantly lower weekly payments than they would have had they qualified for pensions a number of years ago.  The problem is that they had no control over the situation.  They got to pension age and this is where they are now.  Someone with an annual average of 25 contributions would, under the old system, have received &euro;233 per week.  Now, that person is getting &euro;202.  There are substantial differences.<\/p> <p>  The committee's recommendation was that the 2012 change should be suspended and people should revert to the old system until the new total contribution system was introduced.  This is not just about the amount of money, but equality and the fact that the cohort of people who were caught had no other option.  The Minister might try to address this matter in her response.<\/p> <p>  For the rest of the meeting, I will allow two members at a time to put their questions so that we can get detailed answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017092800002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1506589200,"counter":1937,"content":"<p>It was probably remiss of me not to thank the Chairman for the amount of reports that the committee had sent me in recent months.

I would like to thank the committee for those reports and I should have mentioned that in my speech.  The first question concerned savings.  There are obviously some savings in the budget for our overall spend this year.  I am reliably informed, however, that although the savings are made in our Department we do not own that money.  It goes back, rather, to the Department of Finance before the end of the year and it is at that level that the Department of Finance decides where that money does and does not get spent.

At the end of the day there is a greater reduction in our unemployment figures, which has obviously made some savings.  A large chunk of that has however been eaten up by the increase in people of pensionable age.  To be clear then: there will be savings at the end of the year but they will go back to central Exchequer funds and will be distributed in accordance with whatever decisions are made within the budget parameters next week.  I will be fighting very hard to address the specific issues raised by this committee over the past few months, and which I also hope to hear again today.<\/p> <p>  The issue of pensions has been raised.  As I have said on a number of occasions, this is one of the most contentious issues that arises in my own personal constituency office in County Meath.  It is not possible to address the pensions anomaly on a stand-alone basis.  Firstly, it would probably take as long to do this as to address the overall reform of pensions, which is what we are currently carrying out towards a total contributions approach.  I very much value the fact that this committee agrees with the Department's approach on this.  To reverse this and go back to what the Chairman has suggested would in fact cost millions of euro, and that money is not available in the current budget.  I am more concerned with fixing the anomaly, which has a very strong voice in our communities, in the context of moving towards a total contributions system as soon as we can.  Our ambition is to reach this target by 2020.  That is two years away and will not be fast enough for some people.  I want, however, to address the entire pensions system by moving it to a fairer and more sustainable model sooner rather than later.  We will address any further anomalies in the system at that stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017092800002#E00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506589200,"counter":1941,"content":"<p>I will conclude on this point, which I do not need the Minister to answer.  We are disappointed that the anomaly is not being addressed through a short-term measure.  The Minister is right: it does cost millions.  The problem is that it is a relatively small cohort of pensioners who are paying those millions.  The anomaly is disproportionately affecting this group.  It is having a much greater impact because they are not losing &euro;3 or &euro;5 a week; they are losing quite a substantial amount.  I ask the Minister again then if she could go back fully to the 2012 situation, while I absolutely understand how much that would cost.  Perhaps she could go partially back.  She has clearly indicated that in a few years time we will have a new system.  In the meantime, however, it is the view of this committee that that particular cohort is not being treated fairly?  I will leave it there but the Minister might reflect on that.<\/p> <p>  I will now take the questions of two colleagues at a time.  Members have five minutes each and I ask them to respect that time.  We will have direct answers after that.  If there is further time after that we can come back for a second round of questions.  The first questioner is Deputy John Brady.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017092800002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1506589200,"counter":1942,"content":"<p>I will find it hard to contain my questions in five minutes.

The Minister's refusal to look at this is disappointing when there has been so much talk of the gender pay gap.  The changes introduced in 2012 are unacceptable and the impact that these have had on 40,000 people, most of them women, is disgraceful.  A change in this situation will cost money, absolutely, but we in Sinn F&eacute;in have been able to find the money in our alternative budget to address this.  I again ask the Minister to have a look at this matter.  It is totally unacceptable that women, for the most part, will have to wait until 2020 before we move to the proposed total contributions system.<\/p> <p>  Still on pensions, the other cohort that is currently being discriminated against by the State are those who, due to the nature of their employment contracts, are forced to retire at 65 years of age.  They are then forced onto a jobseekers' payment for 12 months before being able to claim the State pension at 66.  These people are down approximately &euro;40 a week.  I ask the Minister to have a look at this matter.  The State transition pension was done away with but needs to be looked at again.  This is a discriminatory practice in the Department and needs to resolved.<\/p> <p>  I want to touch on a number of other areas briefly.  The previous Minister told this committee here last year that he was unable to take on board proposals put forward both by myself and by Age Action to bring forward a bulk payment on the fuel allowance.  I welcome the fact that the Department has now rolled these proposals out.  Could the Minister give us some detail on this matter?  How many applicants have come forward at this point?  How is the scheme proceeding?  It is a welcome development.  <\/p> <p>  I also have questions on the live register and specifically on labour activation measures such as JobPath.  More than 150,000 people have now been referred over to Turas Nua and to Community Training and Education and Education Centres, CTEC.  Last week I asked the Minister about the nature of these contracts, with particular regard to the initial focus for the long-term unemployed.  I have all of the evidence for this and I will give it to the Minister.  I ask her again whether the contract is solely to deal with the long-term unemployed and what provisions are made for people engaged in part-time work, many of whom are also being hounded by Turas Nua and CTEC.  This is particularly true of teachers who, by the nature of their employment, cannot get permanent contracts and have to sub instead.  I would like some information on that.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of priorities that I would like to see included in this year's budget.  The Minister referred to this committee's report on lone parents.  She will also be aware that I got an amendment passed to the Social Welfare Act 2016.  This amendment, which was welcomed, mandated the Department to carry out on independent report on the changes made to the lone parent payment in 2012 and the impact this has had on lone parents.  The Taoiseach told me yesterday that that report has indeed been carried out and that the Department has it.  I would have hoped that this committee would have had seen it by now as it was to have been in published in June, well in advance of the budget discussions.  Where is that report now and when will we get to see it?  We know that 26.2% of children growing up in lone parent families live in consistent poverty.<\/p> <p>  My next point concerns discriminatory practices in the Department.  There is discrimination towards young jobseekers under the age of 26.  The Minister was quoted at a conference yesterday as saying that she would find it very difficult to live on &euro;193 a week.  I think she meant-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017092800002#E00700","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1506589200,"counter":1945,"content":"<p>I said &euro;198.

Discrimination is one of the main areas that the Department will have to deal with in the future and if there is blatant discrimination then there is a problem.<\/p><p>A Department not having proper standards does not reflect well on other sections of society.  One cannot stand over that.  The Department has to work to resolve the pensions issue, particularly the gender gap issue.  It was probably one of the worst cuts during the austerity years.  No one really knew it was happening.  It was brought in but it was three years later when people thought they would get the full pension &euro;233 that they found out they were &euro;30 short because of the changes in the bands and credits.<br\/><br\/>I am not <i>au fait<\/i>with how the budget process works in the Department.  I have a bit of an idea but do not know the full details.  The Minister says she got &euro;19.85 billion in her Department's budget last year.  Is she expecting it to be the same this year?  Is it cut to the cloth of employment and unemployment figures?  Is the Minister not fighting to keep that &euro;19.85 billion on the basis of discrimination in the Department?  That is an argument that could be made to the Minister for Finance.  We could gain something from dealing with this issue.<br\/><br\/>I agree with the strong points on young people made by Deputy Brady.  We talk about money going into the Department.  I also want to raise the issue of RCT, relevant contracts tax, on building sites and self-employment.  The Department is losing crucial PRSI payments which could be used to offset some of the areas I have raised.  It is a key area of work which has to be addressed.  Looking at the numbers, there is little money coming into Revenue or the Departments from RCTs.  Why is that?  There are plenty of them out there.  Why have the moneys not accrued to the Department?  There is something wrong there.  For example, people are getting paid on the two-year back to back to work scheme.  They are on site and get grants but we are not seeing that money come back in again.  There are issues with other self-employed workers such as English language teachers in private schools and workers in the film industry who do not get whole-day pay.  As a result, moneys are not coming back into Revenue or into the Department of Employment and Social Protection in PRSI.  That is one of the biggest areas of work that the Department has to examine.  Significant sums of money in stamps and payments are being lost to the taxpayer.  The conditions and pay of the workers in these industries is also an issue.  It is right across the board with pilots in Ryanair and people in the film industry.  We have had a number of people telling us how they cannot get full-time work in the film industry but only as a trainee with short-term employment.  This is an issue that must be examined by the Department, as well as by the committee.<br\/><br\/>Legislation on banded hours must move on to Committee Stage and not be left behind.  Deputy Cullinane&rsquo;s Banded Hour Contracts Bill 2016 is quite advanced and we should work together to get it passed as quickly as possible.  In August, the trade union, Mandate, was in the Labour Court about Dunnes Stores and banded hours.  It was told to wait until the legislation came through the Houses of the Oireachtas which makes it more urgent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017092800002#E01500","speaker":"1306","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506589200,"counter":1954,"content":"<p>Obviously, we will be looking to keep the moneys we have and I do not anticipate that our budget will be reduced next year.  It will be in line with what we had this year.  As I said, just because there is a drop in one column does not mean it is not taken up in another column.  We anticipate we will have the same amount of money next year.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure we can call the pension issue discriminatory.  I heard what the Deputy said about the cohort of people affected.  It is not all women but it is women in the main.  I am going to fix it but it will be in the context of overhauling the entire pensions system.  I have a more ambitious aim to do that quicker than we had originally envisaged.  I know matters are complicated and we must get a new IT system to put that new platform on.  However, we are going to work exceptionally hard over the coming months to ensure the total contribution system model comes in, as soon as is physically possible, to address the issue of the pension gender division raised by the Deputy.<\/p> <p>  The people who are affected by this are not the most vulnerable pensioners we have.  If they were, they would qualify for a non-contributory pension at &euro;233 per week.  That does not excuse the fact there are still people getting less than they potentially could have or would have expected.  We are going to address it in the overall total contribution model which we will move to as soon as we physically can.  We will have to have some public consultation around that to ensure we use the right platform and there is a large awareness of what we are moving towards when it comes in for new entrants in 2020.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in the Deputy&rsquo;s view on precarious employment, banded hours contracts and the low-paid in insecure situations.  I have said that one of my priorities is that legislation in this area is drafted and published before Christmas.  I have an ambition to bring it to the House before Christmas.  I met with ICTU which expressed its views in strong terms.  I agree 100% with its suggestions.  I also met with IBEC but I do not 100% agree with the concerns it raised.  Our job as a Parliament is to introduce legislation which protects the most vulnerable people.  That is what we are going to do and my aim is to do that before Christmas with the Opposition's help.<\/p> <p>  When I got this job, I was under the impression there were significant amounts of social insurance receipts not being paid by particular employers.  It is not as large as I would have thought originally, however.  I will extend the rights that exist in the social insurance scheme to all self-employed people, so they enjoy the same social insurance rights as employees.  I know this is an issue Senator Butler has been championing since the first day he got here in 2011.  With this particular legislation and other matters we are considering, I will ensure the rights of those self-employed who work for somebody else will be enshrined in legislation to ensure they enjoy the same employment rights, terms and conditions as an employee does.  Having said that, there is still something inside me that says it is not fair to allow employers, particularly sectorial small employers who are employing contractors, to not pay some sort of social contribution towards those.  To that end, I recently had an interesting discussion with the Revenue Commissioners and we will work on that.  If the Deputy has any ideas how we can address this, I would be interested in hearing them.  This is not off the table.  It is definitely a work in progress for me.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brady spoke about the gender pensions issue too.  As I said, it will be addressed in the overall reform of our pensions system with regard to moving to the total contribution method.  He alluded to the fact they were the most vulnerable people.  In actual fact, that is not necessarily the case.  As I said, if they were, they would be entitled to a non-contributory pension of &euro;233 per week.<\/p> <p>  The transition from when people retire to when they go on to a pensionable age does not just affect people who are 65.  There are many people who are older who are on the live register.  Our ambition is not to put them on the register.  It was the Parliament which made the decision several years ago to extend the pensionable age from 65 to 66.<\/p><p>I believe everyone is aware that we will move to an age of 67 in a number of years and then on to an age of 68 by the 2020s.

I will try to find employment for older people who want to work.  That the legislation was passed is an acknowledgement that people are living longer and healthier and perhaps we must get industry to recognise that 65 is an arbitrary retirement age and people of 65, 66 or 67 are often willing and able to stay in their jobs.  We need to start that discussion and get the magic number of 65 out of employers' heads and that will be considered by the Government.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Deputy for his welcome for the changes to the fuel allowances.  It was one of the simplest things to do and arose from the suggestions of others.  It has been exceptionally well received.  In excess of 50,000 people have asked for their bulk payments to be made twice a year and as people talk with their feet, the measure obviously is being welcomed.<\/p> <p>  The Taoiseach did not yesterday say that we have the lone parents report on which he engaged with the Deputy last year because we have not yet received its final draft.  As soon as it is issued to me, which I hope will be within the next week, it will be laid before the House and I will send a copy to the committee.  Members are very aware that the significance of the findings made by the committee in its report on lone parents were not lost on me and the report reinforces my belief that it is difficult enough to bring up children when there are two parents in the household.  Whatever the State can do to enable lone-parent families, which are mainly led by working mothers, to keep more of the money they are earning when they go back to work will be a very large priority for me, as I have said previously.<\/p> <p>  As I told Deputy Brady last week, the Government is not discriminating against those who are under 25.  There are a variety of methods for a person between 18 and 25 who needs to take home &euro;193 every week to so do.  Back to education is only one option.<\/p> <p>  The ambition of the Department, the Government and most Deputies in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is to get the unemployed or under-employed into full-time employment.  JobPath was an ambitious programme launched by the previous Minister for Social Protection and it has hit the money.  There was a target of finding full employment for 8% of the 120,000 people sent to JobPath in the past 18 months.  Both Seetec and Turas Nua have exceeded their targets and found work for 15% of those people.  It is working exceptionally well.  It looks after the long-term unemployed and long-term under-employed.  Those people who are in part-time work, to whom the Deputy specifically referred, and who are also claiming another welfare payment from the State are classified as under-employed.  Their ambition is to be in full-time employment and the vast majority of them welcome the opportunity to work with JobPath.  We conducted a survey of the 120,000 people who have gone through the doors of JobPath over the past 18 months and only approximately 300 people had a complaint.  The vast majority found it exceptionally worthwhile and I suggest the 15% who have found full employment would speak about it in glowing terms.  It is a project that has worked exceptionally well.  Members are aware that it is going to come to an end but we will be reviewing what we do, how we do it and how to ensure that all the activation programmes we run are in the best interests of the unemployed or under-employed in finding full-time work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017092800002#G00500","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1506589200,"counter":1960,"content":"<p>The Minister said all 120,000 people have been consulted, which is not correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017092800002#G00600","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506589200,"counter":1961,"content":"<p>I will afford Deputy Brady an opportunity to speak at a later stage but I must be fair to other members.

I apologise for my croaky voice.  I thank the Minister for her presentation and authentic engagement with the reports produced by the committee.  I will not go over the ground again in terms of pensions but perhaps it is not an adequate solution to talk about the non-contributory pension because the issue at hand is a matter of economic independence for women.  Because the non-contributory pension takes account of household costs it would not be an option for many women.  It is also discriminatory because there are situations whereby a person who has made the same amount of contributions as another is disadvantaged by the averaging system.  It has been acknowledged by Governments for many years that the system disadvantages and discriminates against some people who have made the same contribution as others.  We are moving to total contribution because the current system is flawed.  The problem with the 2012 changes is not solely what was done then but that they were changes on top of a system that was acknowledged to be flawed.  As was very ably said by the Chairman, it will cost millions to amend the changes that were introduced as austerity cost-saving measures but the cost will not disappear if the system is not amended in the budget and, rather, it will be carried by women and is a very systematic disadvantaging of women.  We are trying to strengthen the Minister's hand in addressing this issue.  It is a concern for all of Government because the Government has a commitment, for example, to gender and equality proofing of the budget.  That is a key point because there is no clearer issue that addresses concerns of gender and equality.  Extra money should be found to address this anomaly because it is an all-of-Government concern.  The Minister should make that demand and I urge her to do so.<\/p> <p>  There are several other anomalies in respect of pensions and I engaged with the Minister's predecessor on some, such as voluntary contributions.  There are also questions regarding anomalies for carers but perhaps they can be addressed at another time as I do not want to go into too much detail on them.<\/p> <p>  When considering the new system and auto-enrolment, the Minister has emphasised she does not wish to see discrimination based on income .  The current tax credits and Revenue system in terms of tax relief for private pensions is discriminatory as it gives a higher protection to those on the marginal rate and therefore there is a concern in that regard.  I welcome that the Minster is committed to trying to address it in any new system.  I would like her to assure members that she will also address the issues of care and how care credits may be given or care recognised within any new system.  The issue of care will not only be addressed in terms of auto-enrolment but in terms of a total contribution system when that is commenced.  I again thank the Minister for her engagement on that issue but it needs to be further addressed.<\/p> <p>  I very much welcome the Minister's statements over the summer regarding lone parents.  She is committed to the issue and has responded to it.  There is a very strong mandate from society and from this committee in its report to address the issue while bearing in mind issues of gender and equality because the figures in terms of poverty and deprivation in respect of lone parents are quite shocking, as the Minister is very aware.  Perhaps she could expand on some of the recommendations made by the committee and her thinking on them.  Some do not have a direct cost but probably would have a knock-on cost.  One such recommendation involves re-arranging the qualifications for various options for lone parents.  There are specific recommendations in areas such as maintenance, housing and education and I will not address all of those issues.  However, recommendations I will mention are an increase in the qualified child payment for teenage children in particular given the evidence the committee has seen - evidence funded by the Department through the Vincentian Partnership - of the higher cost of teenage children, ensuring the income disregard is restored for both the one-parent family payment and jobseeker's transitional payment and ensuring return to education as an option is not compromised by hurdles in respect of the rent allowance or SUSI.<\/p><p>There is also an anomaly relating to FIS where, for example, 15 hours of child care is available but 19 hours of work are required to be entitled to the payment.  That can be particularly hard on lone parents.<\/p><p> Another crucial question relates to separating activation supports from conditionality and developing quality part-time employment services.  A key element is people remaining on the jobseeker's transitional payment until their child reaches the age of 18.  They could access the supports without conditionality.  That is a wider question.  I acknowledge the Minister is piloting a scheme with jobless families but many more of the hidden unemployed could be brought into employment if, for example, the requirement for full-time availability was removed and the message of conditionality separated out with the focus instead on empowering people who want to voluntarily seek employment and widen access to employment supports.<\/p><p> I hope to communicate with the Minister in respect of the citizens information services and the public services card.  I compliment her on putting the public duty relating to equality and human rights into the strategic plan and I would like to engage with her further on that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017092800002#G00800","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506589200,"counter":1964,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for attending and I congratulate her on her new role.

Deputy Brady raised a separate issue relating to the fuel allowance.  A small adjustment could be made to the threshold but it would be meaningful for people who are not eligible for the allowance.  There are ancillary benefits in various areas around the county when someone is in receipt of the allowance.  Certain HSE areas give home insulation grants to private homeowners.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say on it.<\/p> <p>  She and other colleagues have raised the issue of the retirement age and the lacuna whereby people who have worked all their lives must sign on for a year on foot of a stipulation in their employment contract that they have to retire at 65 years.  Has the Department considered legislation to make that stipulation null and void and, for example, to apply a red hand rule to such a stipulation to make it less onerous on employers?  Currently, an employer has to point out to the employees that they must retire at age 65 and then sign on.  This should be considered given the proposed changes to the retirement age coming down the tracks.  People seem quite shocked that they have to sign on when they retire.  They do not mind but they cannot believe they have to do it.  If they knew about it in advance, they might be able to plan for the few years they have to sign on.  Many of them have worked all their lives and the idea of not working is strange to them.<\/p> <p>  I refer to stopgap payments.  When people in receipt of a jobseeker's payment take up full employment, they will not be paid for, perhaps, a month and sometimes they are left without an income for that period.  Discretionary payments were available in the past but they would not apply to them because they are not in a bad way.  They are in a better position because they have taken up full-time employment but they have no income for a month.  The Minister should examine this.<\/p> <p>  Will there be an increase in the old age pension?

Last year, hearing, eye and dental benefits were extended to the self-employed while the invalidity pension will come online at the end of the next month for them.  I hope over the next few years, as the economy recovers, to provide equal benefits for both PAYE workers and the self-employed.

The State will have to lead by example because it is not as simple as just bringing in legislation that says people have to retire at 65 because employee contracts have standing in law, and no law states people have to retire at 65.

She will see the fruits of those negotiations in the next ten days.  Fingers crossed that all goes well.<\/p> <p>  I am at pains in response to Senator Higgins to emphasise that I did not say it is a cop-out to say people can take the non-contributory pension.  I totally recognise the issue that has been raised not just by her but by the entire committee.  What I said was in direct response to Deputy Brady's comment that these were the most vulnerable pensioners.  In most cases, they are not but that is not to suggest what she said is invalid.  I agree with her.  I would like to be clear that my comment on the non-contributory pension was in direct response to Deputy Brady.  It is not a panacea for those who take home less on a weekly basis because of the current situation.  There is not an ideological issue here where I say the Senator is wrong and I am right.  I would love to be able to fix it but there are many competing good causes in the overall budget, which will not increase this year given the fiscal space is so low.<\/p><p>However, I hear the Senator loud and clear and I do not disagree with her.<\/p><p> I acknowledge the valuable work that carers do.

I want to acknowledge very clearly and be appreciative of the work that carers do.  It is hard work, and I recognise that.  Anything we can do to improve their situation is something I would be very keen to look at.<\/p><p> On the overall context of the report on social protection and lone parents, which I believe the chairperson gave me either on the day or the day after I was appointed, I reiterate that I do not need to be sold on this.  I have huge admiration for anyone in this country, whether a man or, as is mostly the case, a woman, raising a family on his or her own because it is bloody hard work.  Anything we can do, as a State, to support people in their endeavours to provide a better family life for their children and themselves, I am already sold on.  The individual recommendations made in the report are all under consideration in the context of the budgetary discussions.  I will do my very best to make sure this budget has a significant impact on people who are rearing children and families on their own.  That is not just to talk about extra money but also about extra services.  The Minister, Deputy Zappone, is equally and keenly aware of the difficulties, particularly with child care and the child care hours.  In her deliberations, she will be taking into consideration the inputs from this committee through its report, which was very valuable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017092800002#H00900","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506589200,"counter":1973,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and wish her all the best in her new job.  I also welcome Mr. John McKeon.  During the recession we had the self-employed disaster where, basically, the self-employed suffered big-time.  We had to lower threshold levels to try to get people to become self-employed and, thankfully, the Minister of the day, Deputy Joan Burton, and the then Government did that.  It was an absolute nightmare.  One of the issues I found was that people who could have been paying an S class stamp did not know their entitlements.  I asked a couple of years ago whether, when people get a P60 or P45, it could not be printed on the document exactly what that stamp entitles them to.  Is it a big secret that they are not meant to know what they are entitled to because they might come looking for it?  Could we look at that issue?  It is not a big thing to say what a stamp entitles a person to, no more, no less.<\/p> <p>  It is wonderful that we have 2 million people in employment.  I would say that 360,000 to 400,000 of them are self-employed and the number is growing.  We have come a long way since I was elected to the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  At a previous committee meeting I was told by somebody from the Department that a new stamp for a self-employed person would be at least 30%.  That is on the record.  The Mangan report was published subsequently and it stated we could set up a new stamp at 5.5% that would automatically give sick pay and disability pay to the self-employed, and we could introduce that over a period of perhaps 12 months, 18 months or two years.  At the moment the self-employed person pays 4% and basically it gives a contributory pension when they come to pensionable age.<\/p> <p>  I know this is a priority for the Government and I thank Fianna F&aacute;il, along with Fine Gael, for putting it in the programme for Government.  I hope it is one of the main priorities for the coming budget.  I would like to see this being mandatory but I will be happy once self-employed people are recognised.  Whether it is mandatory or voluntary, I will be the happiest man in this country come budget day if we see a new stamp for the self-employed, because self-employed people have been discriminated against since the beginnings of this State.  We are talking about something that should have been done 30, 40 or 50 years ago, but there was no voice for business people and the self-employed, and they were just left there, as it were.  We then saw the disaster of the recession.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the new PRSI benefits for dental and hearing related treatment, and it is fantastic to see that coming back on stream with the S class stamp in order that there is no charge to self-employed people.  We are the only country in industrialised Europe that does not have cover for the self-employed through social protection, a point that bears repeating.  It varies in different countries from voluntary to mandatory and it is done under different schemes, but there was nothing in Ireland except the pension when the person came to pensionable age.  Self-employed people do not want anything for nothing.  They will pay for their new stamp, they will pay for a safety net and they will pay for security.<\/p> <p>  Last but not least, I welcome the increase in the back to school allowance.  The Government in which I was involved cut that and it was a very hard pill to swallow at the time, so I welcome that it is going back up.  I would also like to see the Christmas bonus going back up because it is huge for local businesses, local shops and the local community, in particular in helping keep small shops going over the Christmas period, given those who get their Christmas bonus will spend it locally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017092800002#J00200","speaker":"1423"},{"type":"speech","time":1506589200,"counter":1974,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and her officials.

I will also talk about self-employed people in the context of what Senator Butler raised, if Deputy Carey does not mind, starting with the Christmas bonus.  As I think I said to other Deputies, that will be discussed in the context of the overall budget.  Those deliberations will not be concluded for the next couple of weeks but we have an ambition in that regard.  As I said yesterday, regarding the social contract that exists between the State and people who need support at various stages in their lives, I very much recognise how difficult it is to live on a fixed income, so anything the State can do, it is our responsibility to make sure we do it.<\/p> <p>  I will tell Deputy Carey about paternity leave.  I hear the points he makes, and we have struggled with this because there has been a lower uptake than we would like.  To that end, we ran a national advertising campaign in August of this year because it was the first anniversary of the introduction of the payment.  We did radio, online, social media and we even had the ad in which Mary talked to Johnny.  We did everything we could on that anniversary to highlight paternity leave.  I fear there are probably other fundamental reasons behind our male colleagues in Ireland not taking it up in the same numbers as our ladies do, but we will look at it again.  Sometimes I wonder: there are so many positive benefits that come out of this Department, yet one still meets people who say they did not know about this or about that.  It is a constant struggle and we are very much aware of it.  We are trying to make it as easy as possible to deal with the people whom we are here to serve.<\/p> <p>  I echo what Deputy Carey said in his opening remarks.  I worked in the Taoiseach's Department earlier this year, and the people there are absolutely deadly; they are great.  I have never come across such a bunch of people - both the people sitting around me and the wider range of people I have met - as those with whom I have had the privilege to work in the past couple of months in the Department of Social Protection.  I have genuinely never seen the ethos, the energy, the passion, the commitment, the enthusiasm and the particular gr&aacute; for looking after people who are more vulnerable than others in society that exist in this Department.  It is a real honour for me to be able to work with them and I totally echo the remarks Deputy Carey made about the Department.<\/p> <p>  The 13 staff have already moved over.  The transition was absolutely seamless.  They have been integrated into the organisational structure for a number of weeks at this stage.  Their remit and authority regarding specific items of legislation have not necessarily changed but their structure has been very much welcomed into &Aacute;ras Mhic Dhiarmada, Store Street, they are now part of a larger and wider team and, as I said, they are very welcome.  The budget, which is just &euro;1.6 million, has been transferred and, as I said earlier to Senator Higgins, the first legislation we will publish will be the employment rights Bill.  I am absolutely adamant not only that it will be published before Christmas but also that, with the good help of all members, we will get it into the House and get it started to make sure we enshrine those people's rights in legislation.<\/p> <p>  Apart from what came in the budget last year, there have been welcome changes in the Department, and I acknowledge Senator Butler's acknowledgement of the fact that we have increased by &euro;10 million the back-to-school allowance.  It has helped 137,000 families.  Therefore, it is not small change; it is a significant increase of 25%.  One would hope to be able to bring it back to the same levels at which it was before the recession took place and the country fell off a cliff.  The size and amount of reductions that have had to take place over the past number of years have struck me.  People felt those reductions; they were real and again, from our perspective, our social contract is to try to return whatever fruits the growing economy brings to those who need it the most.  The increase in the back-to-school allowance is particularly welcome.  We are now spending just over &euro;47 million on it.  I wish to acknowledge the fuel allowance changes that Deputy Carey welcomed.  When one considers the fact that 57,000 people are availing of it, the changes made common sense, were easy to do and were the right thing to do, and I acknowledge that.<\/p> <p>  Regarding self-employed people, we are exceptional in this country in that Irish people have a much higher rate of entrepreneurial genes in our bodies than other countries' populations have.  There are thousands and thousands of enterprising self-starters in this country.  Senator Butler is right in this regard, and Deputy Carey alluded to it too.  They are some of the most hard-working people who had the initiative not only to set up and create their own jobs, but also to employ other people in this country over the years.  They were one of the groups of people hardest affected during the recession because not only did they lose their jobs, they also did not get access to the same support services that were available to all other groups unfortunate enough to lose their jobs, as they did in their tens of thousands over the past ten years.  Thankfully, that has changed now and that corner has been turned.  We welcome that a survey done of more than 20,000 self-employed people suggested they would be willing to pay a higher percentage of social insurance.  We are doing an actuarial review and that will be taken into consideration.  The review will be issued to us in the coming weeks.  We will use it to form part of a much larger deliberation as to how we improve the Social Insurance Fund over the coming years but, more importantly, what it delivers for the people.  I think the committee is well aware that the Taoiseach wants to improve the delivery of that social insurance contract with Irish people and it is my job to make sure that extends to people with self-employed status.  Personally, I do not favour having to ask self-employed people to pay any more but I am only one voice at that table.  However, it is acknowledged, and it is welcome, that the survey of self-employed people has found they would be willing to pay up to 5.5% more.  The difficulty, as the Senator Butler knows, is that it is all in or all out; it cannot just be the people who want to pay in.  It is all or nothing.  There are industry difficulties in this regard and some self-employed people do not want to pay in, but my determination, as well as that of the Department and the Taoiseach is to make sure we extend the same benefits to people who are brave enough to provide their own jobs for themselves and for others as those for people who go to work in other employment scenarios.<\/p> <p>  Senator Butler acknowledged the Mangan report.  That was a very large body of work.  It did not just recommend the 5.5% increase; all the other recommendations will form part of whatever the new social contract, which will be arrived at over the course of the coming months based on our deliberations, will be.  The Senator's suggestion about putting one's entitlements on one's P60 is interesting.  I think An Post would be delighted if we did that because there would probably be about 20 pages in every envelope.<\/p> <p>  A huge amount of information is available to everyone on our website, and I am not saying this just because I am in company, but it is a really easy website to navigate.  There is a huge amount of pictorial elements to it.  It is not a difficult website to find or navigate, but our challenge is probably to get people to go to the website in the first place.  I have had a similar issue with our Twitter account over the past couple of weeks.  My Twitter account has more followers than does the Department's account and that is a bit odd, given we deal with millions of people weekly and monthly, so there is a challenge.  We need to make sure the information we have is exceptionally easy to get and to navigate.  It is just a matter of trying to bridge that gap between people not knowing what their entitlements are to when they are entitled to them and when those entitlements kick in or start to wane.  That is a challenge but it is one I am aware of and one we will look at.  Again, I acknowledge Senator Butler's keen expressed interest that we would continue to give the Christmas bonus to people, and he is right.  People spend it in their local communities and on things they need.  I was at the launch of the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, INOU, booklet yesterday that the Department funds.  It is an exceptionally valuable resource and outlines in a really simple way every single scheme that exists within the Department, how one gets on to each and one's entitlements.  It is a deadly booklet.  I was very struck yesterday by something a lady said to me.  Someone asked why we are wasting money printing the booklet and said we should just put it on our website.  The lady said to me that in order to access broadband, she needs &euro;50 a month to be able to give to Sky, Eir or whoever else provides broadband, and not everyone on a fixed income has that &euro;50 a month.  Another lady mentioned the fact that even an ink cartridge costs &euro;80.  When people make sweeping statements about people on fixed incomes, these are things they do not acknowledge or recognise, namely, that there are additional expenses to being able to access information.  That is why we fund a booklet as valuable as Working for Work that was published yesterday by the INOU and we will continue to fund it.  I acknowledge the Senator's wish for the Christmas bonus to be paid this year and acknowledge the increase he welcomed in the back-to-school allowance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017092800002#K00100","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1506589200,"counter":1976,"content":"<p>I apologise for my late arrival.<\/p><p>I congratulate the Minister and welcome her to the committee.  Like other members, I extend my thanks to the staff of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for the courtesy and consideration which they always afford me when I have to contact them, which I do very regularly.  Many of the points which I wished to raise have obviously already been raised but I would like to zone in on a few.<\/p><p> Deputy Brady mentioned the report on lone parent's allowance which we were promised by the previous Minister.  The reality of life is that the 2012 changes definitely worsened the position of lone parents.  I was very heartened to hear what the Minister said about how damned hard it is to raise a child on one's own.  The Minister who brought about the changes to the lone parent's allowance said that the reason for the change was to encourage such parents to work.  It must have been the first time in the history of the universe that people were encouraged to go out to work by being penalised for doing so and by having their situation made worse in respect of their lone parent's allowance.  I suspect that the report will uncover all of this.  I hope it does.  The Minister says that she expects to see the report in the coming days.  Will she see it in time to feed its recommendations into the forthcoming budget, or at least into the social welfare Bill which will follow the budget?  One should look at the number of parliamentary questions on lone parent's allowance which are tabled in the D&aacute;il.  In the context of the total social welfare bill, the cost of some of the changes which we, and which this committee, have suggested, such as increasing the amount one can earn and so on, is quite low.  There is also the additional benefit that when more people are encouraged to work, money comes back in the other direction.<\/p><p> On the self-employed, I heard what Senator Butler said.  I believe the Senator was talking about the compulsory system and the voluntary system.  In effect, the then Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, had to make a choice, and last year he decided that he would use neither the compulsory nor the voluntary system.  He extended the entitlement to the invalidity pension to the self-employed, which we all welcomed, and paid for it out of the taxpayers' money.  That is also a valid way to do it.  People do not have to be compelled to pay any more.  <\/p><p> The Minister indicated to me on a number of occasions in the D&aacute;il that he was also favourably disposed to extending social protection in the form of jobseeker's benefit to the self-employed, which employees get.  He also indicated to me that, speaking personally for himself, he was reasonably well-disposed to the idea of doing that on a voluntary payment basis.  The Minister, Deputy Doherty, favours the all-in system, which would be a somewhat different approach.  I welcome the extension.  From December, self-employed people with a certain amount of contributions will be able to get the invalidity pension for the first time.  That is progress.  There are other entitlements with different criteria which employees can get, such as illness benefit.  Employees can also get jobseeker's benefit and so on.  Will the Minister indicate whether there will be any new movement in the budget towards the extension of those benefits to the self-employed?  What is to happen in December was announced and provided for in the last budget.  Will there be any improvements in this budget?<\/p><p> I also wish to ask the Minister about the forthcoming legislation on banded-hours contracts, and I welcome her intention to introduce this legislation quickly.  I noted carefully what the Minister said in reply to one of my colleagues, I believe it was Deputy Collins.  She said that she had spoken to both ICTU and IBEC and that she more or less agreed with ICTU's approach.  ICTU has also approached me about this issue.  I am sure they have approached everybody here.  ICTU have recommended and suggested to me that the legislation should contain a provision whereby, when a banded-hours contract is introduced, there should be a review to see the reality of the situation.  In other words, if the band was between 20 and 25 hours, instead of zeroing in on the lower end, that is the 20 hours, there should be a review to see what the actual performance was.  If the actual average, over whatever period, is agreed as having been 23 hours, for example, it should be regarded legally as a 23-hour contract.  Is it the Minister's intention to accede to that?  It must be if she is saying that she agrees with ICTU, because that is precisely what it is proposing. <\/p><p> Senator Ardagh raised a question about stop-gap measures for people waiting for social welfare benefits.  I know that in theory and on paper there is a thing called supplementary welfare which one can supposedly get at the discretion of the local community welfare officer when one is waiting for a benefit to come through.  I can tell the Minister for a fact that in the case of somebody in Limerick who is waiting for jobseeker's allowance or some other allowance, it would be easier to rob a bank with a water pistol than to get supplementary welfare allowance.  They keep telling us that the money is not there or that the claimants do not qualify for it.  I could give the Minister a whole variety of reasons as to why they do not qualify.  They are left at the mercy of their families.  The supplementary welfare allowance system needs to be looked at radically.<\/p><p> We had an exchange on the question of Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS and Citizens Information centres the other day.  I received a copy of the cost-benefit analysis, which I confess I have not yet had the opportunity to read.  Has the Citizens Information Board signed off on that?  Is there agreement among members of the board on that document?  That is the first issue.  <\/p><p> Perhaps the Minister will comment on the second issue.  I remember when the representatives of the Citizens Information Board were before the committee advocating for the changes.  They said that the present system was cumbersome and that the new system would result in savings which we would be able to use to assist clients.  It is my understanding that the Citizens Information Board has sought &euro;4 million extra in this year's budget to help implement the changes.  That would seem to contradict that assertion.  Will the Minister comment on that?<\/p><p> The Minister mentioned the need to change our mindset about people retiring at 65 and so on.  I could not agree with her more on that issue, but the problem is that it could take a generation to change people's mindset, as the Minister knows.  There are two Bills on mandatory retirement, one from Deputy Brady and one from myself.  The Minister says that contracts are in place and that they cannot be overruled by legislation.  My advice is the opposite.  My advice is that, if it is in the public interest, legislation can overrule existing contracts.  I ask the Minister to advance consideration of that Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017092800002#K00200","speaker":"1227","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506589200,"counter":1978,"content":"<p>I wish the Minister and the Chairman well in their new positions.

Her predecessor made a huge public relations own goal with the campaign \"welfare cheats cheat us all\".  Will the Minister be continuing that culture in her Department?  In our opinion, and I believe I can speak for most of the members of this committee, it was a pretty vile move by the Minister's predecessor to have the Department target a small section of social welfare expenditure.  It was extremely unfair and a public relations disaster for Deputy Varadkar and the Department.  That is one question.<\/p> <p>  I have another question, which is perhaps not a question.  I saw a film over the summer called \"I, Daniel Blake\".  I am not sure if the Minister has seen it.  It is a film by the English director, Ken Loach.  It is a really good film.  I am sure the Minister has heard of Ken Loach.  He is a really good director.  If the Minister watches it she will see what the film relates to.  There are parallels between what is happening to the social welfare system in Britain and what is happening in Ireland, particularly with regard to Seetec.  I think the Minister will enjoy the film.

They give a relatively accurate measure because there is a very large number of people who, when they are investigated arising from those reports, are found to have been claiming something to which they were not particularly entitled.  While there were issues being bandied around about differences in numbers over the last while, the current figures are in the high &euro;40 millions.  It is not small change.  That will continue to play out and the people who do that work in the Department will continue to do it next year, the year after and the year after that.  Whether one will see ads on the sides of busses is another day's work.  It is not something I have in my plans for the next couple of months.  We have 19 garda&iacute; seconded to the Department who work with our inspectors and that is not going to change.  It is right, given that it is taxpayers' money and we have to ensure it goes to those to whom it is supposed to go.  That is a fair system.

I am not opposed to doing it and I do not think anyone else is either.  It would be easier than the method I would have to employ in my head, which is to lead by example in the State.  However, I very much want to try to encourage people to stay working if that is what they want to do.  That usually involves incentives.  That is the way we should do it in our Department, leading by example.  There are other Departments which could provide other measures but I would hope that will be employed.  Certainly, I will check it out and come back to Deputy O'Dea because I am not opposed to doing it.<\/p> <p>  To answer the questions on MABS, it has started to restructure.  I met with the CEO only this morning.  The changes which were mooted on foot of the consultation process initiated by MABS earlier this year are starting to be put in place.

As such, the direct answer to the question I was asked is \"Yes, the board has signed off on it\".<\/p> <p>  I am concerned by what Deputy O'Dea said about our supplementary welfare allowance because it has actually increased in value this year by almost 15%.  If the Deputy has reason to believe people are being turned away, that would genuinely concern me because it is not the practice we employ.

The contract that exists between this taxpayers' money and those who need help at certain times is there to support them, not to make their situations any more difficult than they are already.<\/p> <p>  Without answering the question Deputy O'Dea asked on the specific legislation, the best thing for me to tell him is that I am currently seeking advice on the information that was requested of me with regard to what he suggested.  Certainly, I do not want to see a stand-over scenario where we bring in legislation that allows someone in a casualised or precarious environment but who has an established and practiced work pattern of, for example, 25 hours a week for the previous 12 to 18 months to find himself or herself given a contract for 20 hours a week.  That is because the purpose of introducing the legislation is to allow that lady or gentleman to bring that contract to the bank regarding a mortgage or whatever else.  The Deputy knows what I am talking about.  The very last thing we will allow to happen is for somebody with a practiced and established pattern of work to be given a contract that is for fewer hours.  The Attorney General is looking at that for me and I will certainly revert to the committee with his view.  My aim is to do what the Deputy aims to do.  Perhaps we will talk about that again.<\/p> <p>  On self-employment, I do not favour the compulsory approach.  If I gave that impression, I apologise.  I favour recognising the entrepreneurship that exists among the hundreds of thousands of self-employed people in this country by extending to them whatever rights the State can, in particular employment rights.  That is our priority.  It will not be viable to do it all in this year's budget, but that is the overall ambition.  It is to try to obtain an equilibrium for someone who is in a self-employed position as opposed to being in an employed one.  It costs money.  It is not going to be cheap, but they are no less deserving than those who are in employment situations, in particular since they have been brave enough to provide their own employment and, as I said, employment for others in a lot of cases.  The actuarial review of how we fund the Social Insurance Fund going forward, the potential to merge USC and PRSI, and a future social insurance contract are all in the mix.  What I will certainly not do is have a scenario where some self-employed people are paying in while others are not.  It is either all in or the State pays for it.  That is the scenario that is on the table.  Deputy O'Dea is well aware that if we only had the people who were paying in, it would create increased risk for the Social Insurance Fund, which is not a tenable situation for us.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure I already know what is in the report on lone parents but it does not take a genius to figure out some of the changes that need to be made.  I have been very vocal on them in the last couple of weeks and I will state them again.  I recognise completely that it is far more difficult to raise a family alone than it is when there are two people in a household.  We are going to do whatever we can to improve that.  I am going to do whatever I can to ensure that is raised at the highest level to which I can bring it.  It is certainly the ambition of the Department to improve the take-home pay of people who are single, working and raising families.  As to whether it will feed into the budget, if I get the report today and it strengthens my hand, I will be happy.  The report is only days away but we can all probably guess what will be in it.

I have specific questions on banded-hours contracts and that whole area.  The Minister referred to the Bill she and the Taoiseach want to fast-track.  She will know that last year a Bill sponsored by Deputy David Cullinane was published which dealt specifically with banded-hour contracts.  It received cross-party support and ended up in the jobs committee.  In fairness to the committee, it undertook a huge amount of consultation work with the University of Limerick, trade unions, IBEC and ICTU and the matter was thoroughly scrutinised.  The committee published a very comprehensive 50-page report with 21 recommendations arising from its hearings.  Deputy Cullinane has agreed to accept all of the recommendations and I understand he intends to move his Bill again next week.  As such, the consultation work has already been done.  Why, therefore, is the Government bringing forward another Bill which will slow down the whole process?<\/p><p>The Minister will be aware of a Labour Court case involving Mandate and Dunnes Stores.  It has agreed to suspend that case for six months pending the legislation Deputy Cullinane has brought forward.  That Bill needs to be progressed as quickly as possible.  Why is the Government introducing an alternative Bill, which will ultimately slow it down?  The heads of the Government Bill have only been published; we have not seen the Bill.<\/p><p> I have a number of concerns over the heads of Bill.  The Minister spoke about the need to address the concerns regarding casual workers.  Head 10 of the Government Bill proposes to ban zero-hour contracts but makes an exception if the work is of a casual nature.  That contradicts what she has said here about wanting to address the issues for casual workers.  I ask the Minister to explain the provision in the heads.<\/p><p> Head 11 refers to an initial reference period of 18 months.  Deputy Cullinane had initially proposed a six-month period and after consultation at the committee, it was extended to 12 months.  It received cross-party support at the committee to move it to 12 months and the Minister is now proposing moving it to 18 months.  That will give employers such as Dunnes Stores 18 months to do absolutely nothing other than muddy the waters for people in precarious employment, as well as in zero-hour and banded-hour contracts.<\/p><p> Head 8 proposes that an employee can seek redress from the  Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  I presume that is through the Labour Court within the WRC.  That head would make it an offence for an employer to ignore the Labour Court's ruling.  There has been much legal argument on that area.  What is now regarded as an infamous Supreme Court ruling in 2013 means that what the Minister proposes under that head would be unconstitutional.  The WRC is a voluntary body and does not have the remit to set legislation and set wages.  The ruling from the WRC is not legally binding.  The Minister is now proposing to make it an offence for an employer to ignore the Labour Court's ruling.  Essentially it would be unconstitutional.  What the Minister is proposing in the Bill is crazy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017092800002#M00900","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506589200,"counter":1991,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017092800002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1506589200,"counter":1992,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister to look at the Bill.

It is very clear that poor employment practices create a cost for the State.  Not only do they deny revenue but they also create huge pressure in respect of supplementary payments.  I understand she is addressing those.  I urge her to engage with the ideas that come from many other Opposition groups, which have made some very good proposals.  In the past the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, has been willing to engage constructively with Opposition proposals.  For example, there is a valid concern in respect of the 12 months versus 18 months.  The Minister should be open to engaging because there is cross-party concern on these issues and I believe we can move forward on them.<\/p> <p>  Does the Minister believe she will be able to contribute in some way to the right to work for those in direct provision?  While there has been a small increase in payment, a key step would be to move on the right to work, especially given the ruling.<\/p> <p>  I have some interest and background in the EU semester processes.  I would like to engage with the Minister on that separately.  I will give some thought to that process.<\/p> <p>  Points have been made about the difficulty of living on fixed income.  Those difficulties are compounded by persons with a disability in terms of the costs they can face.  I strongly endorse some of the work done, for example, by the Vincentian Partnership on minimum essential standards of living, to which the Minister has indicated sensitivity and which consider the real costs different cohorts of people face.  People on different payments may have very different costs and we need to address that.<\/p> <p>  I wish to signal two issues of concern to which I believe the committee will return.  There are many questions on the public service card.  I will not now go into all the concerns over identity cards, the data breaches which have been covered, the question of biometrics or even some of the concerns over costs and benefits.  However, I believe the committee may end up looking at them.  I certainly believe the committee will want to know both the responses the Minister and her Department may send to the Data Protection Commissioner and to be assured the latter is satisfied with the responses given.  I will flag two issues of concern.  One is the important legal principle that if a person gives data for a specific purpose, consent for other usage cannot be assumed.  If an individual shares data with the Department and legislation subsequently adds new specified bodies, there is a question as to whether the person can be assumed to have given consent to use of those data by these subsequently added bodies.<\/p> <p>  Another key concern is why we are effectively rushing this process.  I know we will be told it started in 2005, but there appears to be a rush to issue almost 3 million cards just months before the new EU general data protection regulation, GDPR, will come into force in May 2018.  I believe we are rolling this out in a somewhat heavy-handed manner just before these new regulations come in.  I may share an interesting article with the Minister on the matter.  Based on legal opinions, the way it is being done at the moment seems to be contrary to the spirit and letter of the GDPR.  There is a question whether data are freely given when there is pressure, for example, on someone's income, someone's freedom to travel or someone's education being in the balance.<\/p> <p>  We only received correspondence from the Minister this morning in respect of the forced restructuring of the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, and the citizens information services, CIS.  That letter reiterates the same line we have heard from the Citizens Information Board, CIB.  People have written to the committee and the Department indicating that this has shaken their faith in the democratic process.  There has been an overwhelming vote by the D&aacute;il, and a very clear and detailed report from this committee.  MABS and CIS representatives have been very clear that this restructuring has been thrust upon them.  There are many other outstanding concerns but consultation after the fact has been largely inadequate and covers implementation rather than the actual restructuring.<\/p> <p>  In her response, the Minister has indicated that she has a mandate in respect of policy direction but not in regard to a specific decision such as the restructuring of CIB's governance arrangements.  However, in our analysis the committee was clear that this is a question of policy direction, which contradicts clear Department policy statements made previously, for example the assurances made when MABS was integrated with the CIS and previous policy statements on the CIS.  It is a matter of policy and not a matter of day-to-day administration.  It does not relate to the CIB's governance arrangements but to the governance arrangements of numerous independent boards.  It is effectively a decision to exert financial pressure on those boards to dissolve themselves.  This cannot be seen as a day-to-day issue; it is an exceptional thing.  It is also a pressure on them because clearly these are independent boards and are not part of CIB.  The CIB is deciding to exert pressure on those boards, which is a policy decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017092800002#N00400","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506589200,"counter":1994,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017092800002#O00100","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1506589200,"counter":1995,"content":"<p>Will the Minister give one overall comment on gender and equality proofing?

The Minister is aware that as the number of people at work, thankfully, grows, it is more and more difficult for people who are running community employment schemes to get people to involve themselves in such schemes, which have done a lot of very useful work locally.  There is a rule that exacerbates this difficulty.  If a person is put onto JobPath, he or she is tied up for 12 months and even though he or she might be available for a local community employment scheme, he or she is not entitled to go on it.  Some of the local community employment schemes are under threat because they cannot access people like that.  Is it the Minister's intention to change that rule?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017092800002#O00400","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1506589200,"counter":1998,"content":"<p>I share the sentiments expressed by Deputy O'Dea.  There is an issue there.  I also believe there is an issue in this regard for people who are over 55.  Birdhill won the national Tidy Towns award, and congratulations to them.  They attributed a lot of their success to CE schemes.  Unfortunately, we seem to be losing people who are over 55.  Their time runs up, they just get one crack at the scheme now and schemes are falling apart.  This issue should be looked at.  Equally, if a person is on JobPath, he or she cannot transfer over to a CE scheme, even if the scheme is in jeopardy of falling apart.  This should be examined.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the processing times for payments, such as those for illness, disability and carers, there have been delays in such payments in the past.

I reiterate the point that in relation to the restructuring of MABS in particular, there are bundles and bundles of documents - I have no doubt the Minister and her Department officials have them - but one of the key points that comes across as being the core of the problem is the consultation aspect.  There were meetings and minutes and attendees of meetings and so on, but those meetings did not constitute proper consultation in advance of the decision.  In actual fact, if anything, the decision was hurried as the committee began its deliberations and work.  The real engagement is now about process, not about what a new programme should have been.  The people who attended the meetings, and who were supposed to be the representatives of the various organisations, have stated categorically to the committee that they were not entitled to discuss the contents of the meetings they were at.  There was no evidence of real and meaningful discussions and contributions in advance of the decision being made.  That was the frustration the committee found.  The Minister is quite right in acknowledging that meetings are now going on, but they are about implementation rather than about deciding upon a new programme.  That is the kernel of what is going on here.  We could find no support for the view that the consultations were meaningful.

Community employment schemes are probably the backbone of every single town and village in this country and there is not a town or village that is not benefiting from the services provided under those schemes, which probably should be provided by the State or by Departments.  That work is of major value.  In response to questions from Deputies Joe Carey and Willie O'Dea, a review of the community employment schemes is currently being undertaken.  Community employment schemes are currently recognised in the guidelines as being employment activation schemes.  Under that criteria, people on the community employment schemes have a relatively low rate of finding work after their time on the scheme.  Therefore I am of the mind that if there are schemes that are socially inclusive and are providing valuable services in our towns and villages, that perhaps we should call them socially inclusive schemes and change the guidelines from what one would expect under an employment activation model.  At present, one is only allowed to spend six years on the community employment scheme, but if the purpose was employment activation, six years is questionable.  If one has not secured a job from an employment activation course after a much shorter period than six years, then it is not as effective as it should be.  What I favour is that in the course of the review we look at the socially inclusive schemes and call them socially inclusive schemes and change the guidelines to be more in line with the rural social scheme, RSS, and that we work more with people on schemes that are genuinely geared towards employment, that provide the training, the skills and the certification at the end of a certain period of time in order to ensure that those schemes have a higher success rate of getting people who have been through them part-time or full-time jobs.  That review will be conducted in the coming weeks and months and afterwards I will come back and look for further guidance and advice.<\/p> <p>  I do not think there is a town or village that has not been enhanced by the services provided through community employment schemes.  We really value the contributions that they have made.  The last thing we want is to upset people by making changes that are not going to be welcomed.  A number of people have told me that there are insufficient people to fill the places on a community employment scheme and there are empty places on it.  We are not going to change other activation methods that are successful because community employment schemes do not have access to people.  There are 250,000 plus people on the live register.  While we have a number of vacancies on community employment schemes, we need to look more closely at those on the live register and match the skills they currently have with the vacancies on community employment schemes.  I am open to doing that.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the public services card, I disagree with the Senator who thinks we are rushing the uptake of the cards through before legislation will be enacted in the summer of 2018.  The project started in 2011 and some 3 million public services cards have issued, but they were not issued in the past number of weeks.  They have been issued in the past six to seven years.  The main aim of the card is a by-product of an authentication process that was enshrined in law in 2011.  When for example the Senator is invited to come for a public services card, we as a State must be 100% guaranteed that she is Alice-Mary Higgins and that she is getting the entitlements to which she is entitled and nobody else is claiming, either using her name or any of her identification data set.  When she has gone through the process with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, given that we are the largest Department that has a social contract and make payments on a weekly and monthly basis, then she does not have to give all that information again and get authorised again when she wants to get a driving licence, a SUSI grant or a passport or all the other services that we are allowed share the data with as defined in the legislation.  The rules of the card, which is the by-product of the authentication process is to try to make life simpler for people and not to be in some misguided way trying to catch the person out or give the information to people who are not entitled to it.  Its purpose is to make our services more efficient so that if one has already satisfied the authentication process with one Department that one should not have to go through that whole process with other Departments.  That is to put it in a nutshell.<\/p> <p>  I know people have concerns and we will address them, not least the concerns of the Data Protection Commissioner, whom we have met in the past number of weeks.  That office has issued a number of questions to us and we will be replying to it before the end of this week.  The Data Protection Commissioner will get a response to her 49 questions.  Obviously we will then await her response to our replies.  The aim of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and my aim as Minister is to ensure that the data are protected; that we comply with all of the obligations under the law; that people are absolutely reassured that there is no ulterior motive with regard to this card other than it is a card that will help the individual to access public services with more ease so that one does not have to give all the information that we required under the Safe 2 authentication process, again when the person wants to access any of the other State services. <\/p> <p>  I am very clear that if there is a need for reassurance, or if things need to be clarified, we are absolutely willing, ready and able to do so.  Let me repeat that the response will be sent to the Data Protection Commissioner this week and I look forward to her response.  I hope we will come out with a ten out of ten score card.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017092800002#P00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506589200,"counter":2041,"content":"<p>I want to acknowledge that officials from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection have approached me as Chairman of this committee and have suggested that if we want to follow up on the public services card, they will make themselves available.

I believe that rather than differentiating between the weekly payments, that it is the services we should be providing for those with disabilities that recognise there is an extra cost to people who have a disability over and above those who are on jobseeker's or on illness benefits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017092800002#P00500","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1506589200,"counter":2043,"content":"<p>I agree with the Minister that we need a joined-up approach and I hope we will move towards ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCPRD.

A working group was established by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, a number of months ago to look at the outcome of that ruling.  My officials sit on the working group, simply for the fact that whatever action comes from the working group has to acknowledge that with employment rights also come other rights.  We need to be able to afford to be able to extend those rights to people.  We will await the report of the working group.<\/p><p>The reason we are doing it is we acknowledge that if people get extended rights in one element it will impact on their rights in other elements of their daily lives.  I will come back to the committee once that report has been issued and we might have a conversation about it. <\/p><p> The Senator said something I have been saying for years.  We started this new phase of new politics in March last year.  While it has received a lot of bashing over the past 18 months there is huge merit in recognising that nobody in this parliament has a monopoly on wisdom.  I have said it before and I will say it again.  Bringing forward legislation is Government's responsibility and role.  I come back to the point Deputy Brady made about Deputy David Cullinane's Bill.  Regardless of who is in government, if a Government ever finds itself in a position of not listening to the suggestions made by Opposition Senators or Deputies to improve the quality of legislation it brings forward, it is an exceptionally sad day.  There is nobody in this House or the Seanad with a monopoly on wisdom.  As long as I am in the privileged position of being able to bring forward legislation, I will make sure we listen.  If there is ever a stage where we cannot do something that is being put forward, members will get an explanation as to why we cannot.  We might not agree with each other but I will not be shy about explaining why and defending the reasons why we are doing what we are doing.  <\/p><p> To come back to Deputy Brady's concerns, there are parts of Deputy Cullinane's Bill we do not agree with.  It was elegantly expressed by the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen, when the deliberations of that committee were held.  The engagement with University of Limerick was commissioned by my predecessor with responsibility for the employment law aspect, Senator Ged Nash.  The results of that committee formed the deliberations on where we are as a State going forward with legislation to make sure we provide security for people in precarious and casualised employment situations.  That is what this legislation will do.  I will invite all parties and none to bring forward discussions, thoughts and views on potential amendments to the legislation once it is drafted and published towards the end of this year.  My priority is to make sure the legislation is published and passed and that the people in those casualised and precarious working situations enjoy the same employment protections that other people in far more structured settings do.  That is the aim of the Bill; it is certainly not to preclude real casual work which is what the Deputy's suggestion would do.  I do not want to bring forward a law that would outlaw the kind of work done by the average 17, 18 or 19 year old who is getting a couple of hours work here or there or some work in the summer, which is genuinely casual work.  I do not want to outlaw the kind of work that the vast majority of our younger people and students rely on to get them through college.  <\/p><p> I welcome the committee's deliberations.  We will deliberate the legislation in committee once it is drafted, either this committee or the jobs committee, under its new name of the Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017092800002#P00700","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1506589200,"counter":2046,"content":"<p>Deputy Brady may make one brief comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017092800002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1506589200,"counter":2047,"content":"<p>It was interesting that the Minister opened up that contribution by talking about the era of new politics.

What we are going to do in this Bill, which will be a well thought out and considered one after we come back to this or the jobs committee to do pre-legislative scrutiny on it, will be to ensure that banded hour contracts are enshrined on the basis of what is currently the practice.
