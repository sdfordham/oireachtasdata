All children in Special Care or in High Support placement had a written care plan. There were 4,031 children in general foster care in February 2013, of whom 3,581 (89%) children had a written care plan.   A care plan should be developed in advance of a child going into care, except where the child enters care on an emergency basis.<\/p><p>  The Child Care Regulations 1995 require that all children in care have a Care Plan and that the Care Plan is reviewed at regular intervals or when required. The HSE has advised me that day to day exigencies of service provision, such as staff absence due to annual, maternity and sick leave, can impact on services. The HSE further advised that there may be circumstances in which local decisions are made in regard to work planning within the context of service priorities, such as child protection workloads within an area or staff availability. In these circumstances, it may be determined that a &lsquo;child in care review&rsquo; can be deferred for a short period. Such a decision will be made on the basis of risk assessment and would apply to particularly stable care placements. <\/p><p>  The figures for children in general residential care of 90% and general foster care of 89% respectively at the end of February 2013 shows an improvement on the figures at February 2011 where the comparative figures were 87% and 88%. <\/p><p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that in relation to the recruitment of social workers, the HSE has advised me that as of 15th April, there are currently 123 vacant posts being filled.

It is also encouraging that the Board reported that all the findings of the reviews have been fully accepted and that the recommendations are already being implemented.  However, there is no room for complacency, and it is imperative that the standards are fully implemented across the Church and that this continues to be validated by the Safeguarding Board. <\/p><p>  From the perspective of historic allegations, the diocese of Clogher came in for particular criticism on this occasion, having exhibited very poor practice when it came to responding to allegations of abuse.

During the 2010-2012 period, there was an interim qualifying period whereby a person who did not hold a recognised qualification at the equivalent of Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ) but could demonstrate that he\/she had a certified award relevant to early childhood care and education that included significant content covering the core knowledge areas of child development, early learning, health and welfare, and provided they had at least 2 years experience of working in a position of responsibility, was able to work as a pre-school leader.  For the 2012-2014 period, every early years practitioner working as a pre-school leader entering into contract for the first time, must hold a major award at a minimum of Level 5.  To assist  unqualified practitioners in the current workforce  to achieve the full Level 5 award, my Department provided part-subsidies for an on-line course which was developed by one of the voluntary childcare organisations.<\/p><p>  A higher capitation rate is available to services participating in the ECCE programme in which all childcare workers have qualification levels above the minimum requirements for the programme i.e. where all the Pre-school Leaders hold a Bachelor degree in childhood\/early education and all the Pre-school Assistants hold a relevant major award at level 5. <\/p><p>  It is  my objective to incrementally develop the ECCE programme over the term of this Government as resources permit.  A key element of this is the implementation of the Workforce Development Plan by the Early Education Policy Unit of the Department of Education and Skills, which is co-located in my Department.  <\/p><p>  The Workforce Development Plan identified different distinct groups including new entrants to the workforce who wish to become appropriately qualified for specific occupational roles and responsibilities, and unqualified practitioners in the current workforce who want to achieve the Level 5 award.  For new entrants to the workforce the publication of Common Award Standards at Levels 4, 5 and 6 is a welcome development.  Programmes of learning developed to meet these new award standards will incorporate national practice frameworks and will reflect national policy objectives, thereby ensuring that graduates are fully prepared to enter the workforce.  Training providers have begun to meet the new award standards in respect of the FETAC Level 5 Major Award in Early Childhood Care and Education.

The approach I am taking in developing  the Strategy has received Government approval.  My intention is to create an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland's early years sector and a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to 6 years.  <\/p><p>  A broad range of issues relating to regulations, standards, quality assurance, and inspection are currently being considered by the Expert Advisory Group which is advising my Department on the Strategy.  As Minister I am committed to ensuring high standards in early years service provision, both in terms of care and curriculum. The role of quality provision is critical in contributing to childhood development and I an determined that this key objective will be reflected fully in the Early Years Strategy.<\/p><p>  One of the specific issues of policy which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the new Strategy is the future role and regulation of the childminding sector, which is already an important component of early childhood care and education.  At present pre-school services are subject to the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No.2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991.<\/p><p>  Services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Pre-School Inspectorate of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and are subject to inspection and report by the Inspectorate on a regular basis.  Services covered by the Regulations include full-time, part-time and sessional services as well as childminders taking care of more than three pre-school children from different families in the childminder's home.  <\/p><p>  The National Guidelines for Childminders, compiled by the National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee established under my Department, provide guidance to childminders in regard to the Regulations and good practice in the provision of childcare services.  In that context, the City and County Childcare Committees, which assist my Department in implementing its early childhood care and education programmes, encourage childminders to voluntarily notify themselves to their local Committee.  <\/p><p>  As is the case with all regulatory requirements, the Child Care Regulations set the minimum standards which services are legally required to comply with.

Lack of access to affordable, quality childcare is a significant barrier to many low income and disadvantaged families seeking to avail of work opportunities.  This initiative will provide an important support measure to enable parents to avail of job opportunities.  This is in line with the Government's overall strategy to support parents of low income families to take up employment and demonstrates how Departments are working together to deliver the Government's agenda on promoting employment and supporting children's development.<\/p><p>  The initiative is expected to receive full year funding of &euro;14 million to provide over 6,000 after-school places for children attending primary school in order to support parents to take up employment.  This funding has been made possible through savings from the Vote of the Department of Social Protection. <\/p><p>  Eligibility for the new After-school Childcare programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.  Officials from the Department of Social Protection and my Department are continuing in close collaboration on the operation of the programme.  The first pilot phase has commenced.  Up to 500 childcare places are available with  Department of Social Protection local offices in Tralee, Mullingar, Dundalk, Cork City, Finglas, Kings Inn and Limerick City participating.  The second phase of the pilot will be rolled out in July, with the full roll-out of the programme in September 2013, to coincide with the new school year.  The pilot programme will assist both Departments in determining the procedural, quality and practical issues that require attention prior to the finalisation of the programme.<\/p><p>  The programme will provide &euro;35 per week per child enrolled in a participating service for after school services and this payment will rise to &euro;100 per week during holiday periods when parents will be availing of full day care.  A further &euro;20 per week will be paid by the parent to the provider in both instances.<\/p><p>  The new After-school Childcare programme will further augment my Department's programme of childcare supports for low income families.  These include the Community Childcare Subvention and the Childcare Education and Training Support  programmes, both of which provide subsidised childcare for low income parents, including qualifying parents who are on approved VEC and F&Aacute;S education and training courses.  In 2013, my Department expects to spend in the region of &euro;70 million on these programmes, supporting over 30,000 childcare places.<\/p><p>  Any proposed additional funding for childcare or other related services by way of re-allocation of resources currently part of the child benefit budget would be a matter for Government to consider in the context of Budget 2014. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900048#WRB01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":31,"content":"<p>Question No. 17 answered with Question No. 6.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services","counter":32,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900048#WRB01550"},{"type":"question","counter":33,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[21688\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900048#WRB01600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the priority she is giving to the frontline workers in Clondalkin and Lucan Youth Services, Dublin; if she will outline the impact the planned cuts will have on these services; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1012","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":34,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[21687\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900048#WRB01700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the fact that the frontline workers in the Clondalkin\/Lucan Youth Services, Dublin, are dealing with one of the most vulnerable and at risk groups in the greater Dublin area (details supplied); if she will reconsider her policy of funding youth caf&eacute;s and continue to maintain the funding for frontline workers in youth work in Clondalkin and Lucan; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1012","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":35,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 27 together.<\/p><p>The Youth Affairs Unit of my Department provides a range of funding schemes, programmes and supports to the youth sector.

This is delivered in partnership with the young person,  his or her family, carers, social workers, key or link worker and other statutory, community and voluntary agencies. Before a young person leaves care, a needs assessment is carried out to identify a young person's need for accommodation, financial support, social networks, training and education. The most vulnerable group of children are those leaving residential care or short term foster care placements. Children who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers, helpful for good outcomes.<\/p><p>  One of the key features of aftercare is a dedicated aftercare worker who will work with the young person, and advocate on their behalf to promote their safety and development. Many young people continue to reside with foster carers while attending third level education. Young people who do not have family support from a foster carer or family base are helped to find accommodation in either supported lodgings, sheltered housing or independent accommodation and encouraged and supported financially in furthering their training and education. <\/p><p>  The core eligible age range for aftercare is 18 years and up to 21 years which can extend until the completion of a course of education in which he\/she is engaged up to the age of 23 years of age.  <\/p><p>  Ideally, aftercare provides the range and continuum of services to  assist the varying needs of  young people leaving care to help them  achieve a successful transition from the care environment to independent adult life in the community.  This transitionary period may present serious challenges to young people and HSE staff alike, as these young adults encounter all the usual developmental issues of leaving home without, for many, the security of a stable background.   <\/p><p>  Some young people, on leaving care, declare themselves independent of state services and are reluctant to engage with the service. This presents challenges to service providers but is not a reason to cut off a young person from receiving support within the timeframes of the aftercare service. The HSE policy provides that these young people can re-engage with the service at any time until they reach 21 years of age.<\/p><p>  Given the particular difficulties for some young people leaving care in areas of mental health and disability, the aftercare policy has a strong multi-agency dimension. The HSE's Aftercare  Implementation Group is developing protocols with Social Inclusion, Disability Services, Mental Health Services  Primary Care in the HSE and the Department of the Environment regarding housing  to support this approach A protocol has been signed with the Irish Youth Justice Service which covers joint working arrangements for young people in Detention Schools. <\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I am currently examining options to strengthen legislation regarding the provision of aftercare. I have recently held round-table discussions with HSE, service providers, advocates and the voluntary sector in relation to the recent improvements in aftercare service delivery and the proposed legislative change.  My officials have met with their counterparts in Northern Ireland to discuss the nature and impact of the strengthening of aftercare legislatively in Northern Ireland and issues to do with service provision. The Deputy will be aware that I had previously indicated my intention to bring forward legislative amendments and this remains my focus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900049#WRC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":40,"content":"<p>Question No. 20 answered with Question No. 10.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Children in Care","counter":41,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900049#WRC00450"},{"type":"question","counter":42,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[21773\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900049#WRC00500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the steps she is taking to help reverse the increase of deaths by suicide of children in care, children known to the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s child welfare and protection service and young persons in aftercare in 2012 or the 2011 number of cases notified to the National Review Panel (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1080","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":43,"content":"<p>The figures for referrals to the National Review Panel in 2011 and 2012 are as set out in the tables below.

However, in the general youth population deaths by suicide accounted for 22% of all deaths of children aged 10-17 in 2011 (State of the Nations Children Report, 2012). The figures for the general youth population deaths by suicide in 2012 are not yet available.  \u00a0<\/p><p>While the figures above highlight an increase in suicide cases referred to the National Review Panel  between these two years this cannot be considered a trend owing to the very small amount of data available and the short reference period.

However this is an issue which will be monitored closely in the future. Further, the Chair of the National Review panel has recently highlighted the increased prevalence of suicide in the cases referred in 2012.

The Review also showed that there were over 2000 admissions to care in each of the years, 2009 to 2011.  The HSE advise that where there are immediate operational difficulties in assigning one social worker to a child, social workers are assigned based on a needs assessment and prioritisation.  Some of these cases can relate to children in very stable fostering placements, provided perhaps, by a relative.  Where a social worker is not assigned for a period, practice has been to support foster placements through the regular social work duty system  where the child can contact the social worker on duty.

The initiative is expected to receive annual funding of &euro;14 million to provide in the region of 6,000 after-school places for children attending primary school, in order to support parents in taking up employment.  Preparations are well-advanced for the introduction of a pilot project in a small number of locations, with the national roll-out of the programme planned for September this year.  In addition to the new School Age Childcare Programme, my Department provides funding for three other childcare programmes which provide a range of supports to parents of pre-school and after-school children.  The Early Childhood Care and Education programme provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  The Community Childcare Subvention programme, which is provided through community-based childcare services, enables those services to provide childcare at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income families.  The Childcare Education and Training Support programme provides subvention for childcare places to qualifying trainees and students availing of certain F&Aacute;S and VEC courses.  My Department provides in the region of &euro;260 million annually to support parents with the cost of childcare under these programmes.<\/p><p>  Capital funding grants were made available to child-care providers, both community and commercial, during the years 2000 to 2008 for the development and refurbishment of child-care facilities.

It is intended that the Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to be responsible for providing access to adoption records, in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.  The Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to establish and maintain a National Index of Adoption Records, the purpose of which is to help an applicant for adoption information to identify the location of his or her adoption records.  The intention is that the Bill is to provide that either the Adoption Authority, the HSE or an accredited body may hold adoption records, with the Authority having overall charge of those records.  The HSE have already commenced the take over of files.  In late 2011 the HSE Adoption Services took responsibility for the adoption files of the Sacred Heart Adoption Society in respect of homes in Bessborough, County Cork; St Peters, Castlepollard, County Westmeath and Sean Ross Abbey, Roscrea, County Tipperary.  These files have since been transferred to the HSE in their entirety and are stored in specialised facilities in Glanmire County Cork.

The National Strategy for Research and Data on Children&rsquo;s Lives 2011-2016 sets out a comprehensive action plan for research and data on children&rsquo;s lives in Ireland and proposes a systematic, harmonised and coordinated approach across departments and agencies to achieve a better understanding of the factors influencing children&rsquo;s lives. <\/p><p>  There is a growing body of national and international evidence on the prevalence of bullying and its impact on our children and young people, on their confidence, learning outcomes, self-esteem and mental health. Two national surveys, which are Government funded, give us a national picture of the extent of bullying among children in Ireland.<\/p><p>  The first, Growing Up in Ireland, the National Longitudinal Study of Children, which is funded through my Department, provides us with data on the proportion of nine-year olds who have been victims of bullying (40%) and with verbal bullying emerging as the most common form of bullying, followed by exclusion and physical bullying. Boys were more likely to have experienced physical and verbal bullying, while girls were more likely to have experienced exclusion. There was little difference in the proportion of boys and girls who were bullied through written messages and electronic means and these forms of bullying occurred much less frequently than the other forms in this age cohort. There was a clear overlap between children who had bullied another and children who had been victimised &ndash; these children are classified as bully victims and constituted 10% of nine-year-olds.<\/p><p>  The second national survey, the Heath Behaviour of School Aged Children (HBSC) survey, also provides us with important data on this issue. Since 1998, the HBSC survey, which is conducted every four years, provided us with trends in the proportion of children between the ages of 9 and 17 who report that they were bullied at school. Given that this is part of an international study, we can also compare rates of bullying in Ireland with rates of bullying in other countries. The latest international comparisons revealed that rates of bullying in Ireland were lower than the HBSC average (27.3% versus 29.2%). Statistically significant differences were observed across age and gender, with a higher percentage of younger children and boys reporting that they were bullied at school in the past couple of months.<\/p><p>  Internationally, a recent EU study to examine the safety of children on the internet found that 4% of children between the ages of 9 and 16 in Ireland experienced online bullying compared with an EU average of 6%. This finding is also supported by the \"Growing up in Ireland\" research which showed that 5% of 9 year olds experienced cyber-bullying.  However, UNICEF&rsquo;s recently published &ldquo;Child Well being in Rich countries&rdquo; (Report Card 11) highlighted a rise in bullying among Irish young people; the report stated that 28% of children in Ireland aged 11, 13 and 15 reported &ldquo;being bullied at school at least once in the past couple of months.&rdquo;  These reports, which are available in full online, are indicative of the wealth of research on Irish children&rsquo;s lives and experiences now accessible to Irish policy-makers. <\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that ongoing work to implement the Action Plan on Bullying, which is being led by the Department of Education and Skills, represents a significant step in delivering on the Government&rsquo;s absolute commitment to reverse these current trends. To achieve this we must work with a broad base of interests to tackle the underlying causes of bullying, including prejudice in all its forms, in a sustained manner.  The Action Plan on Bullying was produced earlier this year following detailed consideration of available evidence and research on bullying. The Working Group consulted with leading academics in the field of bullying and reviewed the current best practices in bullying prevention in other jurisdictions, to develop the series of specific evidence based actions and recommendations outlined within the Action Plan.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the actions set out in the Plan are being progressed by the relevant sectors.<\/p><p>  In terms of additional research, this includes new research on the prevalence and impact of bullying linked to social media on the mental health and suicidal behaviour among young people through the National Office for Suicide Prevention. The National Disability Authority has also agreed to conduct and support research on effective supports for children with special educational needs.  In addition, my Department, along with the Department of Education and Skills, has agreed to identify and initiate further research on bullying issues as our resources permit, including the monitoring and evaluation of initiatives in schools and other sectors in order to support evidence for further policy development and decision making. This will be considered in future calls for proposals under the National Children's Research Programme.<\/p><p>  My Department will continue to work across all sectors and services to raise awareness about bullying, its impact on children and young people and the effective measures to be taken to tackle prejudice, combat bullying and promote a safer environment for our young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services","counter":87,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRE00750"},{"type":"question","counter":88,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[21736\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRE00800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the steps being taken to protect frontline youth services in view of the funding cuts experienced by the sector; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":89,"content":"<p>The Youth Affairs Unit of my Department provides a range of funding schemes, programmes and supports to the youth sector.

My Department has tried to be as equitable as possible in achieving these savings.

It goes on to focus on strategic objectives for the EU, in particular the need to promote good governance beyond the borders of the Union and to advance the development of effective multilateralism through support for the United Nations.  It considers policy implications for the EU in light of these threats and strategic objectives.  And it concludes that the EU should become more active, more capable and more coherent.  We value also its role in widening the context in which the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) operates.<\/p><p>  A review of the ESS was carried out in 2008 but made no fundamental changes to it.  It did, however, broaden the challenges identified to include threats such as cyber security, climate change and pandemics.  In the lead-up to the review, Ireland worked to ensure that the document remained consistent with our values and concerns.  In particular, we ensured that there was a prominent reference to the pre-eminent role of the UN in the international system and that CSDP remained situated as an integral part of the EU&rsquo;s broader Common Foreign and Security Policy.   <\/p><p>  In 2012 EU Foreign Ministers again looked at the possibility of revising the ESS.  It was decided, however, that an examination of particular emerging threats would be more appropriate at this time.

In making its recommendations for exemptions and for deferrals, the group had regard to the following criteria:<\/p><p> - Ability to pay;<\/p><p> - Reliefs create costs which have to be paid for, either by taxpayers who do not benefit from the relief or by reductions in public expenditure;<\/p><p> - Reliefs should be designed to address clear economic and social policy needs;<\/p><p> - Care needs to be taken in designing relief to ensure they are targeted based on need, and there are not unintended and inequitably distributed gains;<\/p><p> - The LPT is intended to be a tax on the benefit from ownership of a residential property;<\/p><p> - Such residential properties have monetary and non-monetary values which are independent of incomes;<\/p><p> - And that the LPT is not assessed on incomes.<\/p><p>  While there are few exemptions from the charge to LPT, an exemption is available where a residential property was previously occupied by a person as his or her sole or main residence and has been vacated by the person for 12 months or more due to long term mental or physical infirmity and is not occupied by any other person.  The system of deferrals outlined in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended, is targeted at cases of need, and has reference to income stressed home owners, allowing enhanced deferrals where there is low income and liability to mortgage interest.  A liability for LPT will arise where a person owns a residential property on the liability date, which is 1 May 2013 for the year 2013.  The LPT is a self-assessed tax and therefore liable persons are obliged to calculate the tax due based on their assessment of the market value of their property, file their return by the relevant deadline and pay the tax due.  The tax is in place for a half year in 2013 and for a full year from 2014 onwards.<\/p><p>  Revenue has put in place a wide range of payment options to enable liable persons to select the one that best suits their circumstances, to will allow them to pay their LPT liability in full, or to pay by instalments in various ways, including by deduction at source from certain Department of Social Protection payments.  This is intended to assist with budgeting by allowing liable persons to pay the tax in equal instalments.<\/p><p>  For liable persons who choose not to make an LPT Return, the Revenue Commissioners have a duty, in the interests of fairness and equity to those who are compliant, to take effective follow-up action to recover the tax from the non-compliant.  This may mean that tax clearance certificates will not be issued where there is failure to pay LPT.  I believe the vast majority of people will want to be compliant with the LPT, as they are with other taxes legislated for by the Oireachtas.  Revenue is making it as easy as possible for people to comply with their obligations to submit an LPT return and either make arrangements to pay their LPT charge or avail of a deferral of the charge if they are eligible.<\/p><p>  For individuals on low incomes or whose only income is from the Department of Social Protection, the LPT legislation provides for the possibility to defer the charge to LPT in certain cases where specified conditions are met.  The deferral system focuses on ability to pay the tax and is based on the income of the liable person, with increased limits where there is liability to mortgage interest.  A person who qualifies for full deferral can opt to defer 100% of the LPT liability.  A person who qualifies for partial deferral can opt to defer 50% of the liability and must pay the balance of LPT.   In all deferral cases interest will be charged on LPT amounts deferred at a rate of just under 4% simple interest per annum.  This is half the rate of interest that applies in cases of non-compliance with LPT and other taxes, where a daily rate of 0.0219% - just under 8% per annum &ndash; is applied to the outstanding amount from the payment date to the date the tax is paid.  The deferred amount, including the interest, will attach to the property and will have to be paid before the property is sold or transferred.<\/p><p>  The Government does not propose at this time to introduce a wealth tax but all taxes and potential taxation options are constantly reviewed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Repayments Issues","counter":106,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRF00150"},{"type":"question","counter":107,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[22057\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRF00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will respond to issues raised in correspondence (details supplied) by the Irish Brokers' Association on debt forgiveness.","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":108,"content":"<p>I can assure the Deputy that the Government is very aware of the significant difficulties some homeowners are facing in meeting their mortgage obligations and it has put in place a comprehensive strategy to address the problem focusing on four main distinct areas: <\/p><p><b>-  Innovative Personal Insolvency Reform:<\/b> Personal insolvency reform was identified by the Keane Report as a catalyst for addressing the mortgage arrears problem and it indicated that without an effective insolvency system the mortgage arrears problem will not be resolved. The introduction of the new Personal Insolvency Act provides new statutory insolvency frameworks to allow debtors and creditors reach arrangements on unsustainable mortgage and personal debt.  The legislation provides a legal framework for the resolution of mortgage arrears, as well as other personal debt, and it will provide certainty for borrowers and lenders alike about the consequences of non-payment and failure to reach agreement.  It does not preclude, however, borrowers and lenders reaching bilateral agreements to address mortgage or other debt difficulty.  A number of concerns have been raised about the balance of power between banks and debtors, which has commonly been referred to as a 'Bank Veto'.  The reality is that it is in the best interest of both debtors and creditors to seek to conclude an acceptable and workable bilateral arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act, be it a Debt Settlement Arrangement or Personal Insolvency Arrangement.  The latter such arrangement will be of particular use for those persons experiencing difficulty with repayment of their mortgages and to provide, as appropriate, for debt restructuring.  Both debtors and creditors have rights in a financial contract and these must be respected, having regard to the insolvency of the debtor.  Of course, in the event that either a Debt Settlement Arrangement (DSA) or Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) cannot be agreed, the ultimate resolution option is judicial bankruptcy.<\/p><p><b>-  Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategies:<\/b> As announced in March, the implementation of the mortgage arrears strategies has further intensified with the Central Bank now setting time bound and measurable targets for the main banks on their progress in resolving, on a durable basis, the position of their mortgage customers who are in arrears on their mortgage. The &#8220;Keane Report&#8221; has already outlined a number of possible options that can be considered by banks to provide a sustainable solution for a mortgage in difficulty on a case by case basis.  Mortgage lenders have now introduced long-term measures to assist mortgage holders in distress such as split mortgages, trade-down mortgages, negative equity mortgages and through the mortgage to rent scheme and the Central Bank will monitor the performance of banks against the targets.<\/p><p><b>-  Comprehensive Advice and Guidance:<\/b>  In addition to existing arrangements, the Government has introduced a range of additional information and guidance resources to assist mortgage holders through what can be a difficult and stressful process.  A dedicated website, www.keepingyourhome.ie, has been put in place to provide general public information on mortgages arrears issues.  In addition, there is a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline, which is established under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, to provide more tailored information to individual callers.  Finally, a panel of accountants has been put in place to provide &#8220;one to one&#8221; independent advice to borrowers who have been provided a long term forbearance resolution offer by their lender in respect of a mortgage on their primary home.  All of these information services are provided at no direct charge to the users of the service.<\/p><p><b>-  Keeping families in their homes:<\/b> As a social housing response, a &#8220;mortgage to rent&#8221; scheme is now in place on a nationwide basis.  This option will be available to households with unsustainable mortgages and who would qualify for social housing support and meet other appropriate criteria will allow the family, in the context of an agreed resolution to an unsustainable mortgage, to remain in their home.<\/p><p><br \/>  Overall, while progressing these particular measures, the Government is also conscious of the need to restore the economy and employment levels and its overall economic policies are directed to achieve those objectives, the successful achievement of which will be of general benefit to those with mortgages as well as the general economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRF00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Excise

The majority of funds were advanced to IBRC under a Special Master Repurchase Agreement (&ldquo;SMRA&rdquo;), involving the sale and repurchase of the c. &euro;25bn nominal value Promissory Notes and &euro;796m nominal value NAMA senior bonds.  IBRC also had a smaller amount of outstanding borrowing under the Eurosystem&rsquo;s Main Refinancing Operation secured by other assets with a nominal value of approximately &euro;370m.  In addition, &euro;3.46bn nominal value 2025 Irish Government Bonds also provided significant secured funding in a market repo (see Parliamentary Question No. 157 of 30 of April 2013 for further information regarding the Bank of Ireland repurchase agreement).  As is typical for collateralised lending arrangements, these repurchase agreements incorporated standard market terms including the requirement to provide collateral of a value in excess of the amount of lending extended under the agreement, i.e. &ldquo;excess collateral&rdquo;, whereby the collateral taken as part of the repurchase agreement is priced and subject to appropriate haircuts by the respective lenders.  <\/p><p>  As the Deputy is also aware, in addition to the repurchase agreements, ELA funds of approximately &euro;15bn were advanced by the Central Bank under a Facility Deed which benefitted from a Ministerial Guarantee.  The Central Bank also had security over all the ELA lending through a floating charge over the otherwise unencumbered assets of IBRC. <\/p><p>  Upon appointment of the Special Liquidators existing funding arrangements between IBRC and the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) were terminated.  As a result, IBRC was obligated to repurchase the collateral provided under the repurchase agreements from its lenders at prices governed by those agreements.  As IBRC was unable to repurchase this collateral with cash, the lenders retained and valued the collateral in fulfilment of IBRC&rsquo;s obligations under the agreements, with the value of collateral in excess of the borrowings being due back to IBRC.  In effect, the Promissory Notes, the NAMA Senior Bonds, the other assets and the 2025 Irish Government Bonds, held as collateral under the various repurchase agreements, were retained by the lenders in lieu of IBRC repurchasing this collateral with cash.  <\/p><p>  Under the terms of the various repurchase agreements, the value of the collateral in excess of the borrowed amount was applied by the lenders to reduce, or &ldquo;set off&rdquo;, the total amount outstanding under the Facility Deed.  While the values applied to individual securities held as collateral under the various repurchase agreements are commercially sensitive and so are not provided in granular detail, the combined result of these set off arrangements was to reduce the total amount outstanding under the Facility Deed from c. &euro;15bn at the time of the liquidation to &euro;12.928bn at the time it was acquired by NAMA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRF01600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBRC Liquidation","counter":127,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRF01650"},{"type":"question","counter":128,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[21922\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRF01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 238 of 19 February 2013, if he will provide an update on the composition and ownership structure of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation subsidiaries of which there are nearly 300; if he will explicitly confirm whether the liquidator is responsible for overseeing the disposal of the IBRC wealth management business or whether this business is separate to the IBRC liquidation; if he will confirm whether a broker has been appointed to value this business and whether it is expected to be sold or transferred to the National Assets Management Agency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":129,"content":"<p>The special liquidators have confirmed that Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Limited holds an interest (either directly or indirectly) in various entities, some of which are 100% owned, other subsidiaries have equity structures that reflect share ownership by the bank which ranges from minimal ownership up to and including full ownership by the bank.

It would therefore be necessary to know each of these elements in relation to each property sold before it could be established whether a gain or a loss arises on each property.  Where a loss is made on the sale of a chargeable asset, that loss is allowable against other chargeable gains made in the same year or, if not capable of being so used, is carried forward against losses in future years.   Where a chargeable asset now being sold was acquired prior to 6 April 1974, the market value of the property at 6 April 1974 is substituted for its cost price.   The market value at 6 April 1974 or the cost price, if purchased between 6 April 1974 and 31 December 2002, is indexed to take account of the effects of inflation, so that only the real gain in monetary terms is chargeable. <\/p><p>  For example a property with a market value of (say) &euro; 15,000 at 6 April 1974 would be indexed by an indexation factor of 6.112, so that the adjusted base cost\/market value would be &euro;91,680. Any consideration on sale in excess of this indexed base cost would be a chargeable gain (subject to any necessary adjustment for incidental costs associated with the sale as well as any enhancement expenditure that may have been incurred).  On the other hand, a property purchased in 2005 for (say) &euro;500,000, might only realize (say) &euro;300,000 if sold today &ndash; giving rise to an allowable loss to the taxpayer of &euro;200,000, which could be set against other chargeable gains, thereby potentially reducing the amount of CGT that would be raised.<\/p><p>  As principal private residences have been exempt from capital gains tax since its introduction in 1975, each of the elements required to calculate a gain or a loss are not returned by taxpayers or otherwise collected by Revenue in a manner that would enable a chargeable gain or allowable loss to be calculated.  Neither the introduction of local property tax nor the preparatory work that preceded it will be of assistance in estimating the yield from the removal of the CGT exemption for principal private residences.<\/p><p>  Given the fall in the value of residential properties in recent years, it is likely that many residences, if sold, would not make a chargeable gain &ndash; and would in fact incur a loss, thereby reducing the CGT that would be raised in such cases. <\/p><p>  It is necessary to balance the collection of statistical information for Exchequer purposes with the desire to minimise as far as possible the administrative burden placed on individual taxpayers and on the business community to provide such information in tax returns.

The purpose of the report was to identify possible new structures to improve initial teacher education in Ireland so that it is comparable with the best in the world.<\/p><p>  I believe that the recommendations on structural changes will complement other reforms already in train and assist in positioning Ireland at the forefront of teacher education. The implementation of the panel's recommendations concerning research will contribute to this goal. I agree with the review panel that there should be a culture of research in teacher education where staff are familiar with current research and are engaged in research on critical areas of teaching and teacher education. <\/p><p>  The panel made comments on the staffing situation in ITE institutes. I too am concerned that ITE providers have access to and can retain suitably qualified and experienced personnel.  It is hoped that the move to larger institutions will provide more critical mass and certainty for staff planning and development purposes. In the meantime, however, we are required to comply with necessary restrictions on recruitment and employee numbers, given the difficult position with the public finances.<\/p><p>  In terms of the quality of entrants to ITE programmes, as a State we endeavour to set high standards of literacy and numeracy for all school leavers and to produce well informed critical thinkers across various disciplines. The academic standard of entrants to ITE programmes is high. Nonetheless, the Teaching Council, as part of its ongoing and multifaceted work on improving the quality of teaching, is currently undertaking a review of entry requirements and I look forward to receiving its advice in due course.<\/p><p>  My Department is also keen to ensure that forecasting mechanisms are developed to ensure an adequate supply of teachers with the required qualifications. However, even with the best possible systems in place, securing equilibrium between demand and supply is not an exact science, and is subject to quite a number of variables. Recent developments, such as the EU rules on mutual recognition of qualifications, have also meant that supply is more difficult to control and predict. I have asked the Teaching Council to advise on this issue. My Department will work with the Council and other relevant stakeholders, as required, towards developing such mechanisms.<\/p><p>  In the meantime, the numbers approved for entry to State-funded primary ITE programmes will continue to be subject to limits, as I do not believe it is in the interest of graduates or the teaching profession that there be an unregulated increase in graduate teachers from the public sector in the short to medium term.  The level of intake to these Colleges has decreased in recent years in light of available resources and factors impacting on demand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRL01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":249,"content":"<p>Question No. 91 answered with Question No. 87.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Expenditure","counter":250,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRM00250"},{"type":"question","counter":251,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[22034\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRM00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the amount of travel and subsistence both foreign and domestic claimed by each Junior Minister and Secretary General in his Department for the period 2007 to date in 2013; the number of staff appointed by each Minister and Junior Minister in his Department or constituency office and their relevant cost including travel and subsistence in each case for the period 2007 to date in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":252,"content":"<p>The information sought is being compiled at present and will be forwarded to the Deputy shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRM00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staffing","counter":253,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRM00450"},{"type":"question","counter":254,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[22060\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRM00500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason a school (details supplied) in County Galway is due to lose a teacher; the options open to management and parents to retain this teacher; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1041","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":255,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that in the context of Budget 2012, I announced a three year phased adjustment to increase the relevant pupil thresholds for small schools with four teachers or less.

In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement. The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible.

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice.

This advice is provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.  This panel is available on a county by county basis on the website www.keepingyourhome.ie.<\/p><p><br \/>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender advises the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &euro;250 to an accountant of the borrower's choosing for the provision of this advice.  The advisory framework has commenced with practising accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.<\/p><p><br \/>  There is nothing to inhibit other financial intermediaries from continuing to give advice on mortgages as required by borrowers.  The advisory framework is being monitored on an on-going basis and a full review of the service will be undertaken in June 2013.  The review will be undertaken to ensure that it is meeting its objectives and will encompass all aspects of the service including if participation is extended to other interested parties, the criteria that would be required in terms of relevant qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance, etc.  All interested organisations will have an opportunity to input to the review of the service.

There are currently approximately 86,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million for 2013.<\/p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant.  Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.  There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.  However, social welfare legislation provides for the payment of a rent supplement payment to a nominated payee such as a landlord on behalf of the tenant.  This arrangement is entered at the tenant&rsquo;s request and subject to the consent of the Department.  The official dealing with the request will take into account all the relevant circumstances of the particular case and the tenant&rsquo;s preference will be accommodated where possible.<\/p><p>  It is open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the Department any instance where they suspect that a tenant is receiving rent supplement and is not paying their rent.  Where the Department becomes aware that a person is not using rent supplement to meet the accommodation costs, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter investigated.  Where a landlord has a grievance in relation to the non-payment of rent by a tenant, s\/he may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the Board&rsquo;s dispute resolution process.<\/p><p>  The Department has no plans to implement a system whereby landlords would have to sign off each month showing that they have received rent from a rent supplement recipient.  The efficiency of the scheme would be significantly affected if the Department had to create a formal relationship with all landlords, for what should be only a short term need.<\/p><p>  The Government has approved in principle the transfer of responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from this Department to housing authorities using a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Under the proposed arrangements for HAP, landlords will receive the rent for the property directly from the housing authority.  The Department is working closely with officials from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government in developing proposals to give effect to this transfer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRR00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Expenditure","counter":335,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRR00550"},{"type":"question","counter":336,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[22042\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRR00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the amount of travel and subsistence both foreign and domestic claimed by each Junior Minister and Secretary General in her Department for the period 2007 to date in 2013; the number of staff appointed by each Minister and Junior Minister in her Department or constituency office and their relevant cost including travel and subsistence in each case for the period 2007 to date in 2013; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":337,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is currently being compiled and will be sent to him as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRR00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":338,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 125 and 126 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Arrears Proposals","counter":339,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRR00850"},{"type":"question","counter":340,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[22111\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRR00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she disclose the full details of the web traffic for the Citizens Information Board's website keepingyourhome.ie, detailing unique visitors, pageviews, bouncerates, average visit duration,new vs returning visitors, traffic sources, page popularity and so on; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1107","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":341,"content":"<p>The Mortgage Arrears Information and Advice Service was established to provide a comprehensive and coordinated approach to assist people in mortgage distress.<\/p><p>The website <i>www.keepingyourhome.ie<\/i> was substantially redesigned and now acts as the key online access portal for comprehensive mortgage arrears information.

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, who provide services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County, including Counties Meath and Westmeath, can be found on ComReg's website at <i>www.callcosts.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme. NBS services are available within 26 of the 106 Electoral Divisions in County Meath, including the Electoral Division of Bective, and within 18 of the 92 Electoral Divisions in County Westmeath, the list of which is set out as follows.<\/p><p>With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.<\/p><p>During the preparation of Ireland's National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.<\/p><p>The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  In an important milestone towards delivery of this commitment in the Plan, my Department has appointed experts to assist it in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be on-going throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.<\/p><p>Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.<\/p><p>I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland, including the Bellinter and Bective areas as well as all rural areas in Counties Meath and Westmeath, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity, through public or private sector investment, as outlined in the National Broadband Plan.<\/p><p><bu>National Broadband Scheme (NBS)<\/bu><\/p><p><bu>Electoral Divisions (ED) covered by the NBS in Co.

Data regarding the specific application of these funds are not collated by the Department.<\/p><p>  In February 2009, my Department set out details of the financial requirements for local authorities relating to their overall management of capital and current accounts. These requirements flow directly from the requirement for Government finances as a whole to be managed in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact established under the Maastricht Treaty, and the associated limitation on budget deficits.<\/p><p>  The local government sector must not impact negatively on the General Government Balance (GGB) in any one year. The downturn in the economy and substantial pressures on Government funding generally require a sharp focus in all sectors, including local government, to ensure effective control and management of public finances.<\/p><p>  In order to stay within the overall GGB limit, it is necessary for local authorities to maintain both their current and capital accounts broadly in balance. The only restriction on local authorities is that, in aggregate, capital income equals capital expenditure in the year.

Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect the Non-Principal Private Residence Charge.

Edit Snippet   |   Insert Snippet  |  Delete Snippet  |  Insert Question Heading  | Quick Edit    Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan): My Department collates and publishes a wide range of housing and planning statistics that inform the preparation and evaluation of policy, and those data are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.environ.ie.   Data on the number of housing units and \/ or lands transferred under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts and on payments in lieu of such transfers, broken down by year and by local authority, are included within this range.   Comprehensive guidelines have issued to local authorities in relation to Part V including advice in relation to the use of Part V funds. These funds can only be used as capital by local authorities for their Part V functions or functions under the Housing Acts. Data regarding the specific application of these funds are not collated by the Department.   In February 2009, my Department set out details of the financial requirements for local authorities relating to their overall management of capital and current accounts. These requirements flow directly from the requirement for Government finances as a whole to be managed in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact established under the Maastricht Treaty, and the associated limitation on budget deficits.   The local government sector must not impact negatively on the General Government Balance (GGB) in any one year. The downturn in the economy and substantial pressures on Government funding generally require a sharp focus in all sectors, including local government, to ensure effective control and management of public finances.   In order to stay within the overall GGB limit, it is necessary for local authorities to maintain both their current and capital accounts broadly in balance. The only restriction on local authorities is that, in aggregate, capital income equals capital expenditure in the year. Balance is only required at an overall level and this allows considerable scope for authorities to draw on their existing capital reserves as an element of their overall investment programme. The precise manner in which capital and current accounts are managed in order to achieve the overall balance necessary is a matter for individual local authorities.   While I appreciate that these GGB requirements impose limitations on local authorities, there are considerable funding constraints at all levels of Government. It is a matter for every local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources within the GGB limits as set out.

I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested.  To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.<\/p><p>  In terms of addressing the demand for social housing, the social housing capital budget has been reduced from &euro;1.535 billion in 2008 to &euro;287m in 2013 and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes.  The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.  In July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing.  I am monitoring expenditure under my Department&rsquo;s housing programme for 2013, together with the level of contractual commitments extending into 2014, with a view to a decision later this year on approving some limited new construction and house purchases over the period to end 2014.<\/p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.  There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).  My Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure delivery of housing units for social purposes.<\/p><p>  In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities must operate the final outcome for 2012 is expected to be in the region of 4,000 to 4,500 housing units.  Given the current volatility of the market and different challenges to the channels of supply it is difficult to estimate the likely output of new units for social housing this year.  However, it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRU01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"question","counter":410,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[22049\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRU01100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide, in tabular form, the amount of Exchequer funding provided to voluntary or cooperative housing organisations operating here in 2012; and if he will provide the amount of such funding that is allocated for these organisations in 2013.","asker":"1020","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":411,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[22050\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRU01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will outline, in tabular form, the percentage of homes in the social housing stock that are managed by each of the voluntary or cooperative housing organisations; if he is satisfied with the level of input by this sector in the provision of social housing; the number of housing units brought on stream by these organisations in 2012 and to date in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":412,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 and 151 together.<\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to the voluntary housing capital funding schemes relates primarily to the provision of funds to support the annual construction and housing acquisitions programmes by the sector.

Exchequer funding of &euro;1.3 billion was provided under the CAS for the provision of some 15,262 units of accommodation for persons with specific categories of housing need such as older people, the homeless and persons with a physical, intellectual or mental health disability.<\/p><p>Under the CLSS, mortgage finance was provided to approved housing bodies by way of loans from the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) to meet the cost of providing social rented accommodation for low-income families.  At end 2012, approved housing bodies had provided some 10,109 units of accommodation and loans to the value of around &euro;1.4 billion had been drawn down from the HFA.

This includes but is not limited to being independent of Government.  The question of whether Commissioners should be nominated by any social partner organisation or be representative of any particular sector or NGO was expressly considered by the Working Group I set up to advise me on practical issues in relation to the establishment of the new Commission.  The Group recommended that members of the new Commission be selected by a process independent of the Government, serving on appointment independently in their individual capacity and that their appointments should not be made on representative or nomination basis as heretofore was the case in relation to a number of positions on the Equality Authority board.<\/p><p>Members of the Working Group noted the historical development of the Equality Authority from a body purely focused on employment issues with representation from the employer and employee interests.  The Working Group considered with the development of the wider remit of the new IHREC, representation of any corporate body or sectoral interest as of right on the new Commission is not appropriate.  They went on to recommend that the new legislation should allow IHREC to establish subcommittees of the Commission to enable representatives of a wide range of interests to contribute in an advisory capacity.  The Government accepted this recommendation (and indeed all the recommendations of the Working Group relating to the legislation) and this is reflected in the General Scheme of the Bill as published.  I might mention that the selection procedure set out in the Heads was also endorsed by the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, before whom I caused the General Scheme to be laid and whose advice I sought.  In these circumstances, and as I anticipate that the legislation to establish IHREC will be published before too long, I do not regard it as appropriate to make any appointments as Commissioner designate outside of the independent selection process that has recently concluded with the recommendation of the 14 persons referred to in the question to be members of IHREC and of the existing bodies on an interim basis.<\/p><p>As already announced, (and detailed in the table below) these 14 persons were appointed by the Government as members of Human Rights Commission on 16 April 2013 under the Human Rights Commission Act 2000, pending the establishment of the IHREC.

The Plan involves evidence-informed targeted interventions to achieve better outcomes for children who get into trouble with the law, and to reduce crime leading to safer communities. Importantly, the voice and experiences of children involved in the youth justice system have influenced the development of these interventions.   <\/p><p>  Of course, the Deputy will be aware that my Department is responsible for a range of supports to families and children which, although not directly related to juvenile offenders, seek to address many of the social and economic contributory factors.

Our Programme for Government commits that &ldquo;we will encourage schools to develop anti-bullying policies and in particular, strategies to combat homophobic bullying to support students.&rdquo;\t<\/p><p>  The implementation of the Action Plan on Bullying, which is being led by the Department of Education and Skills, is an important step in delivering on this commitment to work with a broad base of interests to protect children from bullying and ensure a safer childhood. <\/p><p>  In recognising the particular need to tackle homophobic bullying, and the broader issues of prejudice in society, the working group which produced this Action Plan included representatives of BeLonG To Youth Services and the GLEN (Gay &amp;amp; Lesbian Equality Network); organisations working to support Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered young people and to advocate for respect and inclusion of all citizens equally.  <\/p><p>  As part of its contribution to the Working Group&rsquo;s deliberations BeLong To Youth Services consulted with young people from across Ireland on their experiences of homophobic or transphobic bullying in schools. Two thirds of the young people consulted had experienced homophobic or transphobic bullying in schools. Research commissioned by the GLEN (Gay &amp;amp; Lesbian Equality Network) and BeLong To Youth Services on the experiences of young LGBT people in Irish schools has found that 50% reported the existence of homophobic bullying in their schools. <\/p><p>  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the actions set out in the Action Plan to tackle this problem are being progressed. My Department is currently developing &ldquo;A Children and Young Peoples Policy Framework&rdquo; which will set out high level goals for both my own and other Departments for the next five years. The Policy Framework is expected to be published later in 2013. The development of an Anti Bullying Framework is being progressed in the context of this whole-of-government policy framework. My Department is also working to place the Children First Guidelines on a statutory footing. Within this process we will explore any additional clarifications that may be required to further assist schools in their response to bullying. <\/p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that an additional &euro;500,000 has been allocated to the Education Vote to supplement the existing substantial resources within the system dedicated to the welfare of young people. I understand that work is underway in the Department of Education and Skills to develop new anti-bullying procedures for schools in consultation with the Education Partners with a view to their introduction from next September. There will also be engagement with Boards of Management and parents in relation to coordinated training and resources development. <\/p><p>  In recognising the lead role of schools, the National Education Welfare Board has issued guidelines requiring each school to have dedicated policies to prevent or address bullying. Schools must make it clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable. <\/p><p>Since the Action Plan was launched, two successful awareness raising initiatives have been rolled out. The first campaign was launched as part of EU Safer Internet Day in February. As part of it, the Government supported a national anti-cyberbullying media campaign specifically targeted at young people.  The second, which I launched on March 6th  , was the Stand Up! Awareness Week Against Homophobic &amp;amp; Transphobic Bullying in second level schools which was organised by BeLongTo Youth Services and was a key action point of the Plan. <\/p><p>  The Anti Bullying agenda is a recurring element in all our consultations with young people. It is notable that the majority of the 34 Comhairle na n&Oacute;g initiatives funded by my Department have identified mental health services, cyber bullying and homophobic bullying as priority issues for young people. In response, this has led a number of targeted measures being adopted by service providers across the country. <\/p><p>  Organisations and schools throughout the country are running anti-bullying campaigns and transition year students continue to pioneer student-led projects aimed at combating bullying and cyber bullying. My Department will continue to support the efforts of these projects and of teenagers who want to play a leading role in the national campaign against bullying. <\/p><p>  Corporations are also playing their part. I recently organised a number of information nights for parents, teachers and youth workers which were supported by webwise and facebook. IBM have just launched free Activity Kits on cyber bullying, online identity and internet safety coaching and I hope that companies such as these will support the development of the of an anti-bullying website to provide a single point of access to practical advice and support in tackling and reporting bullying behaviours. Preliminary scoping work is underway towards this development.<\/p><p>  My Department continues to work with other Departments, childcare services, education welfare services and the youth sector to raise awareness about bullying, its impact on children and young people and to advance measures to tackle prejudice, combat bullying and promote a safer environment for our young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRBB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":573,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRCC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":574,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[22101\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRCC00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she outline the funding being currently provided to all Youth Work projects in County Kildare for each of the past three years; if she will itemise the funding by specific organisation funded; if she will provide the total spend in each year in County Kildare in the context of the total spend nationally on such youth services; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":575,"content":"<p>The Youth Affairs Unit of my Department provides a range of funding schemes, programmes and supports to the youth sector.

Therefore, efforts to combat harmful materials and activities on the Internet can be hampered by the multiplicity of jurisdictions, various legal systems, differing societal norms, or other relevant factors in this regard.  Many pro-eating disorder websites may be hosted outside this jurisdiction, principally in the United States.  As such, they would be subject to US jurisdiction, and any effective action is therefore limited in nature.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding such difficulties, there is in Ireland a self-regulatory framework in place for internet service providers (ISPs).  The Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland Code of Practice and Ethics sets out clear guidelines and minimum standards in respect of dealing with complaints regarding suspected illegal material.  However, pro-eating disorder websites are not regarded as illegal.  The Deputy may rest assured that the Department of Health, in conjunction with other relevant agencies, are cognisant of the issues raised in this instance and will continue to pursue an inter-agency response to policy and service developments to best tackle eating disorders overall.

The insurance companies, operating as commercial providers with a view towards profit generation, make commercial decisions about their prices.  However, it is clear that any significant price increases will make it more difficult for customers to renew their policies, therefore I have consistently raised the issue of costs with health insurers and am determined to address costs in the sector in the interests of consumers.  Last year, I established the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance which comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) and my Department.  This Forum was established to generate ideas which would help address health insurance costs, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law.  I have made it clear to the health insurers that I believe significant savings can be made, the effect of which can be to contain the cost of health insurance premiums.<\/p><p>  Given VHI&rsquo;s very significant share of overall costs in the market, I will continue to focus strongly on the need for the VHI to address its costs and to address aggressively the base cost of procedures, including professional fees.  At my instruction, the VHI recently compiled a detailed cost containment plan, which sets out savings targets for 2013 and for the 2014-2016 period, so as to minimise the need for any future premium increases.  The savings targets over this period are to be achieved through a combination of initiatives including rate reductions with private hospitals and consultants, utilisation management, expansion of clinical audit, reductions in high cost drugs and prosthesis, provider reviews and the continued transition of procedures to lower cost, medically appropriate settings.  I will continue to focus strongly on this issue, as part of measures to ensure the sustainability of the private health insurance market in the transition to a Universal Health Insurance system.<\/p><p>  In the meantime, many consumers can make large savings on their health insurance premiums by shopping around for the health insurance plan that best suits their needs.  For those who have been insured on the same plan for a number of years, it is important to review the level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured.  Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs.  The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits.  The HIA's website www.hia.ie has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRCC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mobility Allowance Scheme","counter":585,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRCC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":586,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[21897\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900051#WRCC01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on the progress made on providing for the needs of those currently in receipt of the mobility allowance when the current scheme will expire","asker":"954","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":587,"content":"<p>A Project Group, which is independently chaired, has been established to seek an alternative method to provide for the priority transport needs of people in a manner that does not run counter to the Equal Status Acts.

The introduction of the new Personal Insolvency Act provides new statutory insolvency frameworks to allow debtors and creditors reach arrangements on unsustainable mortgage and personal debt.  The legislation provides a legal framework for the resolution of mortgage arrears, as well as other personal debt, and it will provide certainty for borrowers and lenders alike about the consequences of non-payment and failure to reach agreement.  It does not preclude, however, borrowers and lenders reaching bilateral agreements to address mortgage or other debt difficulty.  A number of concerns have been raised about the balance of power between banks and debtors, which has commonly been referred to as a 'Bank Veto'.  The reality is that it is in the best interest of both debtors and creditors to seek to conclude an acceptable and workable bilateral arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act, be it a Debt Settlement Arrangement or Personal Insolvency Arrangement.  The latter such arrangement will be of particular use for those persons experiencing difficulty with repayment of their mortgages and to provide, as appropriate, for debt restructuring.  Both debtors and creditors have rights in a financial contract and these must be respected, having regard to the insolvency of the debtor.  Of course, in the event that either a Debt Settlement Arrangement (DSA) or Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) cannot be agreed, the ultimate resolution option is judicial bankruptcy.<\/p><p><b>-  Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategies:<\/b> As announced in March, the implementation of the mortgage arrears strategies has further intensified with the Central Bank now setting time bound and measurable targets for the main banks on their progress in resolving, on a durable basis, the position of their mortgage customers who are in arrears on their mortgage. The &#8220;Keane Report&#8221; has already outlined a number of possible options that can be considered by banks to provide a sustainable solution for a mortgage in difficulty on a case by case basis.  Mortgage lenders have now introduced long-term measures to assist mortgage holders in distress such as split mortgages, trade-down mortgages, negative equity mortgages and through the mortgage to rent scheme and the Central Bank will monitor the performance of banks against the targets.<\/p><p><b>-  Comprehensive Advice and Guidance:<\/b>  In addition to existing arrangements, the Government has introduced a range of additional information and guidance resources to assist mortgage holders through what can be a difficult and stressful process.  A dedicated website, www.keepingyourhome.ie, has been put in place to provide general public information on mortgages arrears issues.  In addition, there is a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline, which is established under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, to provide more tailored information to individual callers.  Finally, a panel of accountants has been put in place to provide &#8220;one to one&#8221; independent advice to borrowers who have been provided a long term forbearance resolution offer by their lender in respect of a mortgage on their primary home.  All of these information services are provided at no direct charge to the users of the service.<\/p><p><b>-  Keeping families in their homes:<\/b> As a social housing response, a &#8220;mortgage to rent&#8221; scheme is now in place on a nationwide basis.  This option will be available to households with unsustainable mortgages and who would qualify for social housing support and meet other appropriate criteria will allow the family, in the context of an agreed resolution to an unsustainable mortgage, to remain in their home.<\/p><p><br \/>  Overall, while progressing these particular measures, the Government is also conscious of the need to restore the economy and employment levels and its overall economic policies are directed to achieve those objectives, the successful achievement of which will be of general benefit to those with mortgages as well as the general economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900052#WRF00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Excise

The majority of funds were advanced to IBRC under a Special Master Repurchase Agreement (&ldquo;SMRA&rdquo;), involving the sale and repurchase of the c. &euro;25bn nominal value Promissory Notes and &euro;796m nominal value NAMA senior bonds.  IBRC also had a smaller amount of outstanding borrowing under the Eurosystem&rsquo;s Main Refinancing Operation secured by other assets with a nominal value of approximately &euro;370m.  In addition, &euro;3.46bn nominal value 2025 Irish Government Bonds also provided significant secured funding in a market repo (see Parliamentary Question No. 157 of 30 of April 2013 for further information regarding the Bank of Ireland repurchase agreement).  As is typical for collateralised lending arrangements, these repurchase agreements incorporated standard market terms including the requirement to provide collateral of a value in excess of the amount of lending extended under the agreement, i.e. &ldquo;excess collateral&rdquo;, whereby the collateral taken as part of the repurchase agreement is priced and subject to appropriate haircuts by the respective lenders.  <\/p><p>  As the Deputy is also aware, in addition to the repurchase agreements, ELA funds of approximately &euro;15bn were advanced by the Central Bank under a Facility Deed which benefitted from a Ministerial Guarantee.  The Central Bank also had security over all the ELA lending through a floating charge over the otherwise unencumbered assets of IBRC. <\/p><p>  Upon appointment of the Special Liquidators existing funding arrangements between IBRC and the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) were terminated.  As a result, IBRC was obligated to repurchase the collateral provided under the repurchase agreements from its lenders at prices governed by those agreements.  As IBRC was unable to repurchase this collateral with cash, the lenders retained and valued the collateral in fulfilment of IBRC&rsquo;s obligations under the agreements, with the value of collateral in excess of the borrowings being due back to IBRC.  In effect, the Promissory Notes, the NAMA Senior Bonds, the other assets and the 2025 Irish Government Bonds, held as collateral under the various repurchase agreements, were retained by the lenders in lieu of IBRC repurchasing this collateral with cash.  <\/p><p>  Under the terms of the various repurchase agreements, the value of the collateral in excess of the borrowed amount was applied by the lenders to reduce, or &ldquo;set off&rdquo;, the total amount outstanding under the Facility Deed.  While the values applied to individual securities held as collateral under the various repurchase agreements are commercially sensitive and so are not provided in granular detail, the combined result of these set off arrangements was to reduce the total amount outstanding under the Facility Deed from c. &euro;15bn at the time of the liquidation to &euro;12.928bn at the time it was acquired by NAMA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900052#WRF01600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBRC Liquidation","counter":695,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900052#WRF01650"},{"type":"question","counter":696,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[21922\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900052#WRF01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 238 of 19 February 2013, if he will provide an update on the composition and ownership structure of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation subsidiaries of which there are nearly 300; if he will explicitly confirm whether the liquidator is responsible for overseeing the disposal of the IBRC wealth management business or whether this business is separate to the IBRC liquidation; if he will confirm whether a broker has been appointed to value this business and whether it is expected to be sold or transferred to the National Assets Management Agency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":697,"content":"<p>The special liquidators have confirmed that Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Limited holds an interest (either directly or indirectly) in various entities, some of which are 100% owned, other subsidiaries have equity structures that reflect share ownership by the bank which ranges from minimal ownership up to and including full ownership by the bank.

It also applies to certain personally owned assets which are used by the company and to land which has been leased under the 1992, 1999 or 2005 EU Early Retirement From Farming Schemes, where the land was owned by an individual for a period of at least 10 years and used by him for the purposes of farming throughout that period.    <\/p><p>  Land which has been let for the period of 5 years prior to its disposal under a compulsory purchase order for the purposes of road-building or road-widening, but prior to its first letting was farmed for 10 years by the person making the disposal, also qualifies for retirement relief as does land which has been let at any time in the period of 15 years prior to its disposal but, prior to its first letting, was farmed for 10 years by the person making the disposal and the disposal is to a child.  For this purpose, &quot;child&quot; includes certain nephews and nieces and foster children of the individual concerned. <\/p><p>  The assets or shares in question must have been owned by the individual for a period of not less than 10 years ending on the date of the disposal and must have been chargeable business assets throughout the 10-year period ending with the disposal (subject to the variation mentioned above in relation to land that is let for part of the period of ownership). <\/p><p>  In addition, where the disposal is of shares, the company in which the shares were held must have been a trading or farming company and the individual's family company, or a member of a trading company of which the holding company is the individual's family company, during a period of not less than 10 years ending on the date of disposal.  Moreover, in any case, the individual must have been a working director of the company for a period of not less than 10 years during which he or she has been a full-time director for not less than 5 years. <\/p><p>  In the case of disposals outside the family, the relief threshold is currently &euro;750,000, that is to say, where the value of the consideration given for the disposal is less than or equal to &euro;750,000, any gain accruing on disposal is fully relieved.  Marginal relief may apply in certain situations.  The current threshold of &euro;750,000 that applies to disposals outside the family will be reduced to &euro;500,000 for disposals of qualifying assets by individuals aged 66 or over on or after 1 January 2014.<\/p><p>  In the case of disposals within the family, there is no restriction at present on the amount of relief that can be claimed but a cap of &euro;3m will apply to disposals, on or after 1 January 2014, of qualifying assets by individuals aged 66 or over.  If qualifying assets on which relief is granted are disposed of within 6 years, the relief granted is clawed back.<\/p><p>  From information on personal tax returns for 2011, the most recent year available, 58 individuals claimed capital gains tax retirement relief within the family on disposals where the consideration exceeded &euro;1.5million.  The total aggregate consideration in respect of these 58 disposals was &euro;292.8 million.  The number of individuals that claimed capital gains tax retirement relief on disposals outside the family where the consideration exceeded &euro;500,000 was 148.  The total aggregate consideration in respect of these 148 disposals was &euro;117.7 million.    <\/p><p>  However, as the amount entered on tax returns refer to the value of the consideration and not the actual capital gains, there is no dedicated basis for separately identifying an estimate of the yield that would have arisen in these cases if the lower cap had been in place for the 2011 tax year.  Accordingly the specific information requested by the Deputy is not available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900054#WRH01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":745,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900055#WRJ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":746,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[21999\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900055#WRJ00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 176 of 30 April 2013, in which he said that the Revenue Commissioners could not estimate the amount that would be raised if CGT was applied to the sale of principal residences because it is not a current policy, the reason an estimate cannot be made by his Department in view of the wealth of knowledge that has been accumulated by his Department in relation to house transactions in preparation for the local property tax; his views on whether it is acceptable that his Department cannot make estimates of revenue that could be raised or saved as a result of a new policy; and if he considers this an impediment to formulating new policies at budget time.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":747,"content":"<p>Capital Gains Tax is payable on any &ldquo;chargeable gain&rdquo; that arises on the sale of a chargeable asset, i.e. the difference between the sale price less the cost price (or market value in certain cases) and taking account of incidental costs associated with the purchase and the sale as well as any enhancement expenditure that may have been incurred.  It would therefore be necessary to know each of these elements in relation to each property sold before it could be established whether a gain or a loss arises on each property.  Where a loss is made on the sale of a chargeable asset, that loss is allowable against other chargeable gains made in the same year or, if not capable of being so used, is carried forward against losses in future years.   Where a chargeable asset now being sold was acquired prior to 6 April 1974, the market value of the property at 6 April 1974 is substituted for its cost price.   The market value at 6 April 1974 or the cost price, if purchased between 6 April 1974 and 31 December 2002, is indexed to take account of the effects of inflation, so that only the real gain in monetary terms is chargeable. <\/p><p>  For example a property with a market value of (say) &euro; 15,000 at 6 April 1974 would be indexed by an indexation factor of 6.112, so that the adjusted base cost\/market value would be &euro;91,680. Any consideration on sale in excess of this indexed base cost would be a chargeable gain (subject to any necessary adjustment for incidental costs associated with the sale as well as any enhancement expenditure that may have been incurred).  On the other hand, a property purchased in 2005 for (say) &euro;500,000, might only realize (say) &euro;300,000 if sold today &ndash; giving rise to an allowable loss to the taxpayer of &euro;200,000, which could be set against other chargeable gains, thereby potentially reducing the amount of CGT that would be raised.<\/p><p>  As principal private residences have been exempt from capital gains tax since its introduction in 1975, each of the elements required to calculate a gain or a loss are not returned by taxpayers or otherwise collected by Revenue in a manner that would enable a chargeable gain or allowable loss to be calculated.  Neither the introduction of local property tax nor the preparatory work that preceded it will be of assistance in estimating the yield from the removal of the CGT exemption for principal private residences.<\/p><p>  Given the fall in the value of residential properties in recent years, it is likely that many residences, if sold, would not make a chargeable gain &ndash; and would in fact incur a loss, thereby reducing the CGT that would be raised in such cases. <\/p><p>  It is necessary to balance the collection of statistical information for Exchequer purposes with the desire to minimise as far as possible the administrative burden placed on individual taxpayers and on the business community to provide such information in tax returns.

The purpose of the report was to identify possible new structures to improve initial teacher education in Ireland so that it is comparable with the best in the world.<\/p><p>  I believe that the recommendations on structural changes will complement other reforms already in train and assist in positioning Ireland at the forefront of teacher education. The implementation of the panel's recommendations concerning research will contribute to this goal. I agree with the review panel that there should be a culture of research in teacher education where staff are familiar with current research and are engaged in research on critical areas of teaching and teacher education. <\/p><p>  The panel made comments on the staffing situation in ITE institutes. I too am concerned that ITE providers have access to and can retain suitably qualified and experienced personnel.  It is hoped that the move to larger institutions will provide more critical mass and certainty for staff planning and development purposes. In the meantime, however, we are required to comply with necessary restrictions on recruitment and employee numbers, given the difficult position with the public finances.<\/p><p>  In terms of the quality of entrants to ITE programmes, as a State we endeavour to set high standards of literacy and numeracy for all school leavers and to produce well informed critical thinkers across various disciplines. The academic standard of entrants to ITE programmes is high. Nonetheless, the Teaching Council, as part of its ongoing and multifaceted work on improving the quality of teaching, is currently undertaking a review of entry requirements and I look forward to receiving its advice in due course.<\/p><p>  My Department is also keen to ensure that forecasting mechanisms are developed to ensure an adequate supply of teachers with the required qualifications. However, even with the best possible systems in place, securing equilibrium between demand and supply is not an exact science, and is subject to quite a number of variables. Recent developments, such as the EU rules on mutual recognition of qualifications, have also meant that supply is more difficult to control and predict. I have asked the Teaching Council to advise on this issue. My Department will work with the Council and other relevant stakeholders, as required, towards developing such mechanisms.<\/p><p>  In the meantime, the numbers approved for entry to State-funded primary ITE programmes will continue to be subject to limits, as I do not believe it is in the interest of graduates or the teaching profession that there be an unregulated increase in graduate teachers from the public sector in the short to medium term.  The level of intake to these Colleges has decreased in recent years in light of available resources and factors impacting on demand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900057#WRL01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":817,"content":"<p>Question No. 91 answered with Question No. 87.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Expenditure","counter":818,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900058#WRM00250"},{"type":"question","counter":819,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[22034\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900058#WRM00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the amount of travel and subsistence both foreign and domestic claimed by each Junior Minister and Secretary General in his Department for the period 2007 to date in 2013; the number of staff appointed by each Minister and Junior Minister in his Department or constituency office and their relevant cost including travel and subsistence in each case for the period 2007 to date in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":820,"content":"<p>The information sought is being compiled at present and will be forwarded to the Deputy shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900058#WRM00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staffing","counter":821,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900058#WRM00450"},{"type":"question","counter":822,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[22060\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900058#WRM00500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason a school (details supplied) in County Galway is due to lose a teacher; the options open to management and parents to retain this teacher; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1041","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":823,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that in the context of Budget 2012, I announced a three year phased adjustment to increase the relevant pupil thresholds for small schools with four teachers or less.

In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement.

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice.

This advice is provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.  This panel is available on a county by county basis on the website www.keepingyourhome.ie.<\/p><p><br \/>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender advises the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &euro;250 to an accountant of the borrower's choosing for the provision of this advice.  The advisory framework has commenced with practising accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.<\/p><p><br \/>  There is nothing to inhibit other financial intermediaries from continuing to give advice on mortgages as required by borrowers.  The advisory framework is being monitored on an on-going basis and a full review of the service will be undertaken in June 2013.  The review will be undertaken to ensure that it is meeting its objectives and will encompass all aspects of the service including if participation is extended to other interested parties, the criteria that would be required in terms of relevant qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance, etc.  All interested organisations will have an opportunity to input to the review of the service.

There are currently approximately 86,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million for 2013.<\/p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant.  Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.  There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.  However, social welfare legislation provides for the payment of a rent supplement payment to a nominated payee such as a landlord on behalf of the tenant.  This arrangement is entered at the tenant&rsquo;s request and subject to the consent of the Department.  The official dealing with the request will take into account all the relevant circumstances of the particular case and the tenant&rsquo;s preference will be accommodated where possible.<\/p><p>  It is open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the Department any instance where they suspect that a tenant is receiving rent supplement and is not paying their rent.  Where the Department becomes aware that a person is not using rent supplement to meet the accommodation costs, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter investigated.  Where a landlord has a grievance in relation to the non-payment of rent by a tenant, s\/he may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the Board&rsquo;s dispute resolution process.<\/p><p>  The Department has no plans to implement a system whereby landlords would have to sign off each month showing that they have received rent from a rent supplement recipient.  The efficiency of the scheme would be significantly affected if the Department had to create a formal relationship with all landlords, for what should be only a short term need.<\/p><p>  The Government has approved in principle the transfer of responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from this Department to housing authorities using a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Under the proposed arrangements for HAP, landlords will receive the rent for the property directly from the housing authority.  The Department is working closely with officials from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government in developing proposals to give effect to this transfer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900063#WRR00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Expenditure","counter":903,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900063#WRR00550"},{"type":"question","counter":904,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[22042\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900063#WRR00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the amount of travel and subsistence both foreign and domestic claimed by each Junior Minister and Secretary General in her Department for the period 2007 to date in 2013; the number of staff appointed by each Minister and Junior Minister in her Department or constituency office and their relevant cost including travel and subsistence in each case for the period 2007 to date in 2013; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":905,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is currently being compiled and will be sent to him as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900063#WRR00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":906,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 125 and 126 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Arrears Proposals","counter":907,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900063#WRR00850"},{"type":"question","counter":908,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[22111\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900063#WRR00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she disclose the full details of the web traffic for the Citizens Information Board's website keepingyourhome.ie, detailing unique visitors, pageviews, bouncerates, average visit duration,new vs returning visitors, traffic sources, page popularity and so on; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1107","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":909,"content":"<p>The Mortgage Arrears Information and Advice Service was established to provide a comprehensive and coordinated approach to assist people in mortgage distress.<\/p><p>The website <i>www.keepingyourhome.ie<\/i> was substantially redesigned and now acts as the key online access portal for comprehensive mortgage arrears information.

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, who provide services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County, including Counties Meath and Westmeath, can be found on ComReg's website at <i>www.callcosts.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme. NBS services are available within 26 of the 106 Electoral Divisions in County Meath, including the Electoral Division of Bective, and within 18 of the 92 Electoral Divisions in County Westmeath, the list of which is set out as follows.<\/p><p>With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.<\/p><p>During the preparation of Ireland's National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.<\/p><p>The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  In an important milestone towards delivery of this commitment in the Plan, my Department has appointed experts to assist it in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be on-going throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.<\/p><p>Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.<\/p><p>I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland, including the Bellinter and Bective areas as well as all rural areas in Counties Meath and Westmeath, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity, through public or private sector investment, as outlined in the National Broadband Plan.<\/p><p><bu>National Broadband Scheme (NBS)<\/bu><\/p><p><bu>Electoral Divisions (ED) covered by the NBS in Co.

Data regarding the specific application of these funds are not collated by the Department.<\/p><p>  In February 2009, my Department set out details of the financial requirements for local authorities relating to their overall management of capital and current accounts. These requirements flow directly from the requirement for Government finances as a whole to be managed in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact established under the Maastricht Treaty, and the associated limitation on budget deficits.<\/p><p>  The local government sector must not impact negatively on the General Government Balance (GGB) in any one year. The downturn in the economy and substantial pressures on Government funding generally require a sharp focus in all sectors, including local government, to ensure effective control and management of public finances.<\/p><p>  In order to stay within the overall GGB limit, it is necessary for local authorities to maintain both their current and capital accounts broadly in balance. The only restriction on local authorities is that, in aggregate, capital income equals capital expenditure in the year.

Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect the Non-Principal Private Residence Charge.

Edit Snippet   |   Insert Snippet  |  Delete Snippet  |  Insert Question Heading  | Quick Edit    Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan): My Department collates and publishes a wide range of housing and planning statistics that inform the preparation and evaluation of policy, and those data are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.environ.ie.   Data on the number of housing units and \/ or lands transferred under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts and on payments in lieu of such transfers, broken down by year and by local authority, are included within this range.   Comprehensive guidelines have issued to local authorities in relation to Part V including advice in relation to the use of Part V funds. These funds can only be used as capital by local authorities for their Part V functions or functions under the Housing Acts. Data regarding the specific application of these funds are not collated by the Department.   In February 2009, my Department set out details of the financial requirements for local authorities relating to their overall management of capital and current accounts. These requirements flow directly from the requirement for Government finances as a whole to be managed in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact established under the Maastricht Treaty, and the associated limitation on budget deficits.   The local government sector must not impact negatively on the General Government Balance (GGB) in any one year. The downturn in the economy and substantial pressures on Government funding generally require a sharp focus in all sectors, including local government, to ensure effective control and management of public finances.   In order to stay within the overall GGB limit, it is necessary for local authorities to maintain both their current and capital accounts broadly in balance. The only restriction on local authorities is that, in aggregate, capital income equals capital expenditure in the year. Balance is only required at an overall level and this allows considerable scope for authorities to draw on their existing capital reserves as an element of their overall investment programme. The precise manner in which capital and current accounts are managed in order to achieve the overall balance necessary is a matter for individual local authorities.   While I appreciate that these GGB requirements impose limitations on local authorities, there are considerable funding constraints at all levels of Government. It is a matter for every local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources within the GGB limits as set out.

I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested.  To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.<\/p><p>  In terms of addressing the demand for social housing, the social housing capital budget has been reduced from &euro;1.535 billion in 2008 to &euro;287m in 2013 and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes.  The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.  In July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing.  I am monitoring expenditure under my Department&rsquo;s housing programme for 2013, together with the level of contractual commitments extending into 2014, with a view to a decision later this year on approving some limited new construction and house purchases over the period to end 2014.<\/p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.  There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).  My Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure delivery of housing units for social purposes.<\/p><p>  In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities must operate the final outcome for 2012 is expected to be in the region of 4,000 to 4,500 housing units.  Given the current volatility of the market and different challenges to the channels of supply it is difficult to estimate the likely output of new units for social housing this year.  However, it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900064#WRU01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"question","counter":978,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[22049\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900064#WRU01100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide, in tabular form, the amount of Exchequer funding provided to voluntary or cooperative housing organisations operating here in 2012; and if he will provide the amount of such funding that is allocated for these organisations in 2013.","asker":"1020","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":979,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[22050\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900064#WRU01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will outline, in tabular form, the percentage of homes in the social housing stock that are managed by each of the voluntary or cooperative housing organisations; if he is satisfied with the level of input by this sector in the provision of social housing; the number of housing units brought on stream by these organisations in 2012 and to date in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":980,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 and 151 together.<\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to the voluntary housing capital funding schemes relates primarily to the provision of funds to support the annual construction and housing acquisitions programmes by the sector.

Exchequer funding of &euro;1.3 billion was provided under the CAS for the provision of some 15,262 units of accommodation for persons with specific categories of housing need such as older people, the homeless and persons with a physical, intellectual or mental health disability.<\/p><p>Under the CLSS, mortgage finance was provided to approved housing bodies by way of loans from the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) to meet the cost of providing social rented accommodation for low-income families.  At end 2012, approved housing bodies had provided some 10,109 units of accommodation and loans to the value of around &euro;1.4 billion had been drawn down from the HFA.

This includes but is not limited to being independent of Government.  The question of whether Commissioners should be nominated by any social partner organisation or be representative of any particular sector or NGO was expressly considered by the Working Group I set up to advise me on practical issues in relation to the establishment of the new Commission.  The Group recommended that members of the new Commission be selected by a process independent of the Government, serving on appointment independently in their individual capacity and that their appointments should not be made on representative or nomination basis as heretofore was the case in relation to a number of positions on the Equality Authority board.<\/p><p>Members of the Working Group noted the historical development of the Equality Authority from a body purely focused on employment issues with representation from the employer and employee interests.  The Working Group considered with the development of the wider remit of the new IHREC, representation of any corporate body or sectoral interest as of right on the new Commission is not appropriate.  They went on to recommend that the new legislation should allow IHREC to establish subcommittees of the Commission to enable representatives of a wide range of interests to contribute in an advisory capacity.  The Government accepted this recommendation (and indeed all the recommendations of the Working Group relating to the legislation) and this is reflected in the General Scheme of the Bill as published.  I might mention that the selection procedure set out in the Heads was also endorsed by the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, before whom I caused the General Scheme to be laid and whose advice I sought.  In these circumstances, and as I anticipate that the legislation to establish IHREC will be published before too long, I do not regard it as appropriate to make any appointments as Commissioner designate outside of the independent selection process that has recently concluded with the recommendation of the 14 persons referred to in the question to be members of IHREC and of the existing bodies on an interim basis.<\/p><p>As already announced, (and detailed in the table below) these 14 persons were appointed by the Government as members of Human Rights Commission on 16 April 2013 under the Human Rights Commission Act 2000, pending the establishment of the IHREC.

The Plan involves evidence-informed targeted interventions to achieve better outcomes for children who get into trouble with the law, and to reduce crime leading to safer communities. Importantly, the voice and experiences of children involved in the youth justice system have influenced the development of these interventions.   <\/p><p>  Of course, the Deputy will be aware that my Department is responsible for a range of supports to families and children which, although not directly related to juvenile offenders, seek to address many of the social and economic contributory factors.

Step 3 &ndash; the initial assessment is a time-limited process to allow the gathering of sufficient information on the needs and risks within a case so that informed decisions and recommendations can be made and actions that will result in better outcomes for children are taken.<\/p><p>  The duty team leader together with members of the team will deem the information received as: level 1 &ndash; child and family must be seen immediately; level 2 &ndash; child and family must be seen within 3 days; level 3 &ndash; child and family be seen within 7 days.<\/p><p>  In identifying Risk it is the &lsquo;professional judgement&rsquo; of the duty team leader to assess if immediate action is required. Risk is assessed if the child is at &lsquo;ongoing significant risk&rsquo;. This is to be decided based on the information received on the referral: 1) The seriousness of the abuse reported; 2) The likely level of risk to the future safety and welfare of the child; and 3) The degree of professional confidence in the information that either the abuse has occurred and is likely to be repeated or that the child is at immediate risk.  Risk analysis continues throughout the 21 days allocated to complete the assessment.  All information on the extensive process is available on the HSE website under the Standardised Business Process documentation.  The full implementation of the Business Process continues to enhance the processing of all referrals throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900064#WRBB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bullying in Schools","counter":1137,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900064#WRBB01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1138,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[22100\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900064#WRBB01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will outline her progress within her Ministerial remit on combatting incidences of bullying amongst young persons; in particular, if she has consulted with the Department of Education and Skills on a multi-Departmental approach to combatting homophobic bullying in schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1139,"content":"<p>As Minister for Children &amp;amp; Youth Affairs, I am committed to working with colleagues in Government to ensure that integrated policy responses to combat bullying are high on our agenda. Our Programme for Government commits that &ldquo;we will encourage schools to develop anti-bullying policies and in particular, strategies to combat homophobic bullying to support students.&rdquo;\t<\/p><p>  The implementation of the Action Plan on Bullying, which is being led by the Department of Education and Skills, is an important step in delivering on this commitment to work with a broad base of interests to protect children from bullying and ensure a safer childhood. <\/p><p>  In recognising the particular need to tackle homophobic bullying, and the broader issues of prejudice in society, the working group which produced this Action Plan included representatives of BeLonG To Youth Services and the GLEN (Gay &amp;amp; Lesbian Equality Network); organisations working to support Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered young people and to advocate for respect and inclusion of all citizens equally.  <\/p><p>  As part of its contribution to the Working Group&rsquo;s deliberations BeLong To Youth Services consulted with young people from across Ireland on their experiences of homophobic or transphobic bullying in schools. Two thirds of the young people consulted had experienced homophobic or transphobic bullying in schools. Research commissioned by the GLEN (Gay &amp;amp; Lesbian Equality Network) and BeLong To Youth Services on the experiences of young LGBT people in Irish schools has found that 50% reported the existence of homophobic bullying in their schools. <\/p><p>  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the actions set out in the Action Plan to tackle this problem are being progressed. My Department is currently developing &ldquo;A Children and Young Peoples Policy Framework&rdquo; which will set out high level goals for both my own and other Departments for the next five years. The Policy Framework is expected to be published later in 2013. The development of an Anti Bullying Framework is being progressed in the context of this whole-of-government policy framework. My Department is also working to place the Children First Guidelines on a statutory footing. Within this process we will explore any additional clarifications that may be required to further assist schools in their response to bullying. <\/p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that an additional &euro;500,000 has been allocated to the Education Vote to supplement the existing substantial resources within the system dedicated to the welfare of young people. I understand that work is underway in the Department of Education and Skills to develop new anti-bullying procedures for schools in consultation with the Education Partners with a view to their introduction from next September. There will also be engagement with Boards of Management and parents in relation to coordinated training and resources development. <\/p><p>  In recognising the lead role of schools, the National Education Welfare Board has issued guidelines requiring each school to have dedicated policies to prevent or address bullying. Schools must make it clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable. <\/p><p>Since the Action Plan was launched, two successful awareness raising initiatives have been rolled out. The first campaign was launched as part of EU Safer Internet Day in February. As part of it, the Government supported a national anti-cyberbullying media campaign specifically targeted at young people.  The second, which I launched on March 6th  , was the Stand Up! Awareness Week Against Homophobic &amp;amp; Transphobic Bullying in second level schools which was organised by BeLongTo Youth Services and was a key action point of the Plan. <\/p><p>  The Anti Bullying agenda is a recurring element in all our consultations with young people. It is notable that the majority of the 34 Comhairle na n&Oacute;g initiatives funded by my Department have identified mental health services, cyber bullying and homophobic bullying as priority issues for young people. In response, this has led a number of targeted measures being adopted by service providers across the country. <\/p><p>  Organisations and schools throughout the country are running anti-bullying campaigns and transition year students continue to pioneer student-led projects aimed at combating bullying and cyber bullying. My Department will continue to support the efforts of these projects and of teenagers who want to play a leading role in the national campaign against bullying. <\/p><p>  Corporations are also playing their part. I recently organised a number of information nights for parents, teachers and youth workers which were supported by webwise and facebook. IBM have just launched free Activity Kits on cyber bullying, online identity and internet safety coaching and I hope that companies such as these will support the development of the of an anti-bullying website to provide a single point of access to practical advice and support in tackling and reporting bullying behaviours. Preliminary scoping work is underway towards this development.<\/p><p>  My Department continues to work with other Departments, childcare services, education welfare services and the youth sector to raise awareness about bullying, its impact on children and young people and to advance measures to tackle prejudice, combat bullying and promote a safer environment for our young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900064#WRBB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":1141,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900064#WRCC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1142,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[22101\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900064#WRCC00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she outline the funding being currently provided to all Youth Work projects in County Kildare for each of the past three years; if she will itemise the funding by specific organisation funded; if she will provide the total spend in each year in County Kildare in the context of the total spend nationally on such youth services; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1143,"content":"<p>The Youth Affairs Unit of my Department provides a range of funding schemes, programmes and supports to the youth sector.

Therefore, efforts to combat harmful materials and activities on the Internet can be hampered by the multiplicity of jurisdictions, various legal systems, differing societal norms, or other relevant factors in this regard.  Many pro-eating disorder websites may be hosted outside this jurisdiction, principally in the United States.  As such, they would be subject to US jurisdiction, and any effective action is therefore limited in nature.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding such difficulties, there is in Ireland a self-regulatory framework in place for internet service providers (ISPs).  The Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland Code of Practice and Ethics sets out clear guidelines and minimum standards in respect of dealing with complaints regarding suspected illegal material.  However, pro-eating disorder websites are not regarded as illegal.  The Deputy may rest assured that the Department of Health, in conjunction with other relevant agencies, are cognisant of the issues raised in this instance and will continue to pursue an inter-agency response to policy and service developments to best tackle eating disorders overall.

The insurance companies, operating as commercial providers with a view towards profit generation, make commercial decisions about their prices.  However, it is clear that any significant price increases will make it more difficult for customers to renew their policies, therefore I have consistently raised the issue of costs with health insurers and am determined to address costs in the sector in the interests of consumers.  Last year, I established the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance which comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) and my Department.  This Forum was established to generate ideas which would help address health insurance costs, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law.  I have made it clear to the health insurers that I believe significant savings can be made, the effect of which can be to contain the cost of health insurance premiums.<\/p><p>  Given VHI&rsquo;s very significant share of overall costs in the market, I will continue to focus strongly on the need for the VHI to address its costs and to address aggressively the base cost of procedures, including professional fees.  At my instruction, the VHI recently compiled a detailed cost containment plan, which sets out savings targets for 2013 and for the 2014-2016 period, so as to minimise the need for any future premium increases.  The savings targets over this period are to be achieved through a combination of initiatives including rate reductions with private hospitals and consultants, utilisation management, expansion of clinical audit, reductions in high cost drugs and prosthesis, provider reviews and the continued transition of procedures to lower cost, medically appropriate settings.  I will continue to focus strongly on this issue, as part of measures to ensure the sustainability of the private health insurance market in the transition to a Universal Health Insurance system.<\/p><p>  In the meantime, many consumers can make large savings on their health insurance premiums by shopping around for the health insurance plan that best suits their needs.  For those who have been insured on the same plan for a number of years, it is important to review the level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured.  Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs.  The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits.  The HIA's website www.hia.ie has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900064#WRCC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mobility Allowance Scheme","counter":1153,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900064#WRCC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1154,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[21897\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900064#WRCC01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on the progress made on providing for the needs of those currently in receipt of the mobility allowance when the current scheme will expire","asker":"954","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1155,"content":"<p>A Project Group, which is independently chaired, has been established to seek an alternative method to provide for the priority transport needs of people in a manner that does not run counter to the Equal Status Acts.

It is expected that the matter will be put to final tender in the very near future.    The final decision to proceed with implementation of a national postcode will be one for Government and will be based on appropriate financial, technical and operational considerations.

Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect the Non-Principal Private Residence Charge.   I understand that the Local Government Management Agency will be issuing reminder notifications to liable owners over the coming weeks. This measure will be complemented by media campaigns conducted by local authorities. Snippet Ref No: WRT00550 ...

Edit Snippet   |   Insert Snippet  |  Delete Snippet  |  Insert Question Heading  | Quick Edit    Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan): My Department collates and publishes a wide range of housing and planning statistics that inform the preparation and evaluation of policy, and those data are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.environ.ie.   Data on the number of housing units and \/ or lands transferred under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts and on payments in lieu of such transfers, broken down by year and by local authority, are included within this range.   Comprehensive guidelines have issued to local authorities in relation to Part V including advice in relation to the use of Part V funds. These funds can only be used as capital by local authorities for their Part V functions or functions under the Housing Acts. Data regarding the specific application of these funds are not collated by the Department.   In February 2009, my Department set out details of the financial requirements for local authorities relating to their overall management of capital and current accounts. These requirements flow directly from the requirement for Government finances as a whole to be managed in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact established under the Maastricht Treaty, and the associated limitation on budget deficits.   The local government sector must not impact negatively on the General Government Balance (GGB) in any one year. The downturn in the economy and substantial pressures on Government funding generally require a sharp focus in all sectors, including local government, to ensure effective control and management of public finances.   In order to stay within the overall GGB limit, it is necessary for local authorities to maintain both their current and capital accounts broadly in balance. The only restriction on local authorities is that, in aggregate, capital income equals capital expenditure in the year. Balance is only required at an overall level and this allows considerable scope for authorities to draw on their existing capital reserves as an element of their overall investment programme. The precise manner in which capital and current accounts are managed in order to achieve the overall balance necessary is a matter for individual local authorities.   While I appreciate that these GGB requirements impose limitations on local authorities, there are considerable funding constraints at all levels of Government. It is a matter for every local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources within the GGB limits as set out.

Ireland has been dealing with the issue of radioactive waste for some time. My Department is currently developing the necessary Regulations to ensure that Ireland meets its obligations to transpose this Directive. The establishment of a National Implementation Committee (NIC) was one of the recommendations made in the Interim Report of the Interdepartmental High-Level Group on Radioactive Waste which was accepted by Government in December 2010.    The NIC was established to progress work on;   Developing an Inventory Reduction Programme to reduce the overall amount of waste requiring storage in Ireland;   The interim centralisation of sources by sector in a small number of sector-specific existing storage facilities;   The development of options for final disposal.   It comprises co-ordinators nominated by the key stakeholders in the sectors where disused sources are held; technical advice is also provided by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).   The Committee is chaired by my Department.   It is too early in the process to attempt to quantify the costs that may arise as a consequence of the transposition of the Directive.   These will be influenced by the quantity of such waste requiring long-term management in Ireland. Snippet Ref No: WRT01150 ...

I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested.  To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.<\/p><p>  In terms of addressing the demand for social housing, the social housing capital budget has been reduced from &euro;1.535 billion in 2008 to &euro;287m in 2013 and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes.  The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.  In July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing.  I am monitoring expenditure under my Department&rsquo;s housing programme for 2013, together with the level of contractual commitments extending into 2014, with a view to a decision later this year on approving some limited new construction and house purchases over the period to end 2014.<\/p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.  There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).  My Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure delivery of housing units for social purposes.<\/p><p>  In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities must operate the final outcome for 2012 is expected to be in the region of 4,000 to 4,500 housing units.  Given the current volatility of the market and different challenges to the channels of supply it is difficult to estimate the likely output of new units for social housing this year.

Exchequer funding of &euro;1.3 billion was provided under the CAS for the provision of some 15,262 units of accommodation for persons with specific categories of housing need such as older people, the homeless and persons with a physical, intellectual or mental health disability.<\/p><p>Under the CLSS, mortgage finance was provided to approved housing bodies by way of loans from the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) to meet the cost of providing social rented accommodation for low-income families.  At end 2012, approved housing bodies had provided some 10,109 units of accommodation and loans to the value of around &euro;1.4 billion had been drawn down from the HFA.  The CLSS was terminated in 2009 and expenditure in respect of projects over the period 2010 to end 2012 relates to projects at construction or approved to commence construction prior to the decision to terminate the scheme.<\/p><p>In 2012 My Department recouped some &euro;58 million to Local Authorities (LA&rsquo;s) in respect of voluntary and co-operative projects progressed under the CAS Loan charges and management and maintenance allowances of over &euro;68 million were recouped to LA&rsquo;s in respect of accommodation provided under the CLSS.  Earlier this year I announced capital allocations to local authorities under the CAS amounting to some &euro;38.5 million.  Detailed information in relation to the amounts of CAS funding recouped to each of the AHB&rsquo;s across all local authorities in respect of the CAS for 2012 is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.

The question of whether Commissioners should be nominated by any social partner organisation or be representative of any particular sector or NGO was expressly considered by the Working Group I set up to advise me on practical issues in relation to the establishment of the new Commission.  The Group recommended that members of the new Commission be selected by a process independent of the Government, serving on appointment independently in their individual capacity and that their appointments should not be made on representative or nomination basis as heretofore was the case in relation to a number of positions on the Equality Authority board.<\/p><p>Members of the Working Group noted the historical development of the Equality Authority from a body purely focused on employment issues with representation from the employer and employee interests.  The Working Group considered with the development of the wider remit of the new IHREC, representation of any corporate body or sectoral interest as of right on the new Commission is not appropriate.  They went on to recommend that the new legislation should allow IHREC to establish subcommittees of the Commission to enable representatives of a wide range of interests to contribute in an advisory capacity.  The Government accepted this recommendation (and indeed all the recommendations of the Working Group relating to the legislation) and this is reflected in the General Scheme of the Bill as published.

My Department worked closely with the Departments of education and skills, social protection , jobs, enterprise and innovation and others as part of a cross departmental effort  to realise this objective  and to progress the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs. <\/p><p>  Youth unemployment is a particular concern because of the prospects it holds for young people themselves, their personal development and for social inclusion. The Government has a range of measures in place to tackle youth unemployment and these include programmes and initiatives in education, training, job search assistance\/ work experience and to encourage job creation.   <\/p><p>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, my aim is to highlight the potential youth work can play, as part of the response to the youth employment challenges, through collaboration with other interests. Each year over 380,000 young people participate in youth work services throughout the country. Youth Work and non formal learning, in its many programmes and activities, recreational, sporting, learning, volunteering and skills development, offers young people opportunities to acquire new competences and skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, motivation, creativity and leadership. These are core and transferable life skills- the 21st   century skills that are so important to training and career readiness. There is a growing recognition in Ireland and across Europe of the potential of youth work services to enhance employability of young people as part of a wider employment and enterprise strategy. <\/p><p>  Youth employment is a theme which I prioritised during my Presidency of the EU Council of Youth Ministers through focusing on the potential of youth work and young people's engagement in youth activities and the way that non formal learning complements more formalised systems of employment, education and training. At the recent EU Youth Conference in Dublin, hosted by the Irish Presidency, over 250 young people and policy makers jointly discussed social inclusion challenges that impact on young people&rsquo;s lives such as employment and social supports as well as the role of quality youth work.<\/p><p>  I will invite the EU Youth Council later this month to adopt Council Conclusions   on the contribution of youth policy to addressing the goals Europe 2020 to maximise the contribution of youth policy in addressing the challenges young people face.  I also plan, as part of the Presidency programme, to host an expert round table event on quality youth work and its contribution to youth employment (20&ndash;21 June 2013, Kildare). <\/p><p>  On my invitation the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI) has submitted a proposal for the development of a national programme to address the needs of the most marginalised young jobseekers not in education, employment or training.

Our Programme for Government commits that &ldquo;we will encourage schools to develop anti-bullying policies and in particular, strategies to combat homophobic bullying to support students.&rdquo;\t<\/p><p>  The implementation of the Action Plan on Bullying, which is being led by the Department of Education and Skills, is an important step in delivering on this commitment to work with a broad base of interests to protect children from bullying and ensure a safer childhood. <\/p><p>  In recognising the particular need to tackle homophobic bullying, and the broader issues of prejudice in society, the working group which produced this Action Plan included representatives of BeLonG To Youth Services and the GLEN (Gay &amp;amp; Lesbian Equality Network); organisations working to support Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered young people and to advocate for respect and inclusion of all citizens equally.  <\/p><p>  As part of its contribution to the Working Group&rsquo;s deliberations BeLong To Youth Services consulted with young people from across Ireland on their experiences of homophobic or transphobic bullying in schools. Two thirds of the young people consulted had experienced homophobic or transphobic bullying in schools. Research commissioned by the GLEN (Gay &amp;amp; Lesbian Equality Network) and BeLong To Youth Services on the experiences of young LGBT people in Irish schools has found that 50% reported the existence of homophobic bullying in their schools. <\/p><p>  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the actions set out in the Action Plan to tackle this problem are being progressed. My Department is currently developing &ldquo;A Children and Young Peoples Policy Framework&rdquo; which will set out high level goals for both my own and other Departments for the next five years. The Policy Framework is expected to be published later in 2013. The development of an Anti Bullying Framework is being progressed in the context of this whole-of-government policy framework. My Department is also working to place the Children First Guidelines on a statutory footing. Within this process we will explore any additional clarifications that may be required to further assist schools in their response to bullying. <\/p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that an additional &euro;500,000 has been allocated to the Education Vote to supplement the existing substantial resources within the system dedicated to the welfare of young people. I understand that work is underway in the Department of Education and Skills to develop new anti-bullying procedures for schools in consultation with the Education Partners with a view to their introduction from next September. There will also be engagement with Boards of Management and parents in relation to coordinated training and resources development. <\/p><p>  In recognising the lead role of schools, the National Education Welfare Board has issued guidelines requiring each school to have dedicated policies to prevent or address bullying. Schools must make it clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable. <\/p><p>Since the Action Plan was launched, two successful awareness raising initiatives have been rolled out. The first campaign was launched as part of EU Safer Internet Day in February. As part of it, the Government supported a national anti-cyberbullying media campaign specifically targeted at young people.  The second, which I launched on March 6th  , was the Stand Up! Awareness Week Against Homophobic &amp;amp; Transphobic Bullying in second level schools which was organised by BeLongTo Youth Services and was a key action point of the Plan. <\/p><p>  The Anti Bullying agenda is a recurring element in all our consultations with young people. It is notable that the majority of the 34 Comhairle na n&Oacute;g initiatives funded by my Department have identified mental health services, cyber bullying and homophobic bullying as priority issues for young people. In response, this has led a number of targeted measures being adopted by service providers across the country. <\/p><p>  Organisations and schools throughout the country are running anti-bullying campaigns and transition year students continue to pioneer student-led projects aimed at combating bullying and cyber bullying. My Department will continue to support the efforts of these projects and of teenagers who want to play a leading role in the national campaign against bullying. <\/p><p>  Corporations are also playing their part. I recently organised a number of information nights for parents, teachers and youth workers which were supported by webwise and facebook. IBM have just launched free Activity Kits on cyber bullying, online identity and internet safety coaching and I hope that companies such as these will support the development of the of an anti-bullying website to provide a single point of access to practical advice and support in tackling and reporting bullying behaviours. Preliminary scoping work is underway towards this development.<\/p><p>  My Department continues to work with other Departments, childcare services, education welfare services and the youth sector to raise awareness about bullying, its impact on children and young people and to advance measures to tackle prejudice, combat bullying and promote a safer environment for our young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900068#WRBB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":1444,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900068#WRCC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1445,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[22101\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900068#WRCC00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she outline the funding being currently provided to all Youth Work projects in County Kildare for each of the past three years; if she will itemise the funding by specific organisation funded; if she will provide the total spend in each year in County Kildare in the context of the total spend nationally on such youth services; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1446,"content":"<p>The Youth Affairs Unit of my Department provides a range of funding schemes, programmes and supports to the youth sector.

Therefore, efforts to combat harmful materials and activities on the Internet can be hampered by the multiplicity of jurisdictions, various legal systems, differing societal norms, or other relevant factors in this regard.  Many pro-eating disorder websites may be hosted outside this jurisdiction, principally in the United States.  As such, they would be subject to US jurisdiction, and any effective action is therefore limited in nature.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding such difficulties, there is in Ireland a self-regulatory framework in place for internet service providers (ISPs).  The Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland Code of Practice and Ethics sets out clear guidelines and minimum standards in respect of dealing with complaints regarding suspected illegal material.  However, pro-eating disorder websites are not regarded as illegal.  The Deputy may rest assured that the Department of Health, in conjunction with other relevant agencies, are cognisant of the issues raised in this instance and will continue to pursue an inter-agency response to policy and service developments to best tackle eating disorders overall.

The insurance companies, operating as commercial providers with a view towards profit generation, make commercial decisions about their prices.  However, it is clear that any significant price increases will make it more difficult for customers to renew their policies, therefore I have consistently raised the issue of costs with health insurers and am determined to address costs in the sector in the interests of consumers.  Last year, I established the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance which comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) and my Department.  This Forum was established to generate ideas which would help address health insurance costs, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law.  I have made it clear to the health insurers that I believe significant savings can be made, the effect of which can be to contain the cost of health insurance premiums.<\/p><p>  Given VHI&rsquo;s very significant share of overall costs in the market, I will continue to focus strongly on the need for the VHI to address its costs and to address aggressively the base cost of procedures, including professional fees.  At my instruction, the VHI recently compiled a detailed cost containment plan, which sets out savings targets for 2013 and for the 2014-2016 period, so as to minimise the need for any future premium increases.  The savings targets over this period are to be achieved through a combination of initiatives including rate reductions with private hospitals and consultants, utilisation management, expansion of clinical audit, reductions in high cost drugs and prosthesis, provider reviews and the continued transition of procedures to lower cost, medically appropriate settings.  I will continue to focus strongly on this issue, as part of measures to ensure the sustainability of the private health insurance market in the transition to a Universal Health Insurance system.<\/p><p>  In the meantime, many consumers can make large savings on their health insurance premiums by shopping around for the health insurance plan that best suits their needs.  For those who have been insured on the same plan for a number of years, it is important to review the level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured.  Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs.  The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits.  The HIA's website www.hia.ie has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900068#WRCC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mobility Allowance Scheme","counter":1456,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900068#WRCC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1457,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[21897\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900068#WRCC01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on the progress made on providing for the needs of those currently in receipt of the mobility allowance when the current scheme will expire","asker":"954","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1458,"content":"<p>A Project Group, which is independently chaired, has been established to seek an alternative method to provide for the priority transport needs of people in a manner that does not run counter to the Equal Status Acts.

This includes but is not limited to being independent of Government.  The question of whether Commissioners should be nominated by any social partner organisation or be representative of any particular sector or NGO was expressly considered by the Working Group I set up to advise me on practical issues in relation to the establishment of the new Commission.  The Group recommended that members of the new Commission be selected by a process independent of the Government, serving on appointment independently in their individual capacity and that their appointments should not be made on representative or nomination basis as heretofore was the case in relation to a number of positions on the Equality Authority board.<\/p><p>Members of the Working Group noted the historical development of the Equality Authority from a body purely focused on employment issues with representation from the employer and employee interests.  The Working Group considered with the development of the wider remit of the new IHREC, representation of any corporate body or sectoral interest as of right on the new Commission is not appropriate.  They went on to recommend that the new legislation should allow IHREC to establish subcommittees of the Commission to enable representatives of a wide range of interests to contribute in an advisory capacity.  The Government accepted this recommendation (and indeed all the recommendations of the Working Group relating to the legislation) and this is reflected in the General Scheme of the Bill as published.  I might mention that the selection procedure set out in the Heads was also endorsed by the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, before whom I caused the General Scheme to be laid and whose advice I sought.  In these circumstances, and as I anticipate that the legislation to establish IHREC will be published before too long, I do not regard it as appropriate to make any appointments as Commissioner designate outside of the independent selection process that has recently concluded with the recommendation of the 14 persons referred to in the question to be members of IHREC and of the existing bodies on an interim basis.<\/p><p>As already announced, (and detailed in the table below) these 14 persons were appointed by the Government as members of Human Rights Commission on 16 April 2013 under the Human Rights Commission Act 2000, pending the establishment of the IHREC.  The issues in relation to the interim appointments to the board of the Equality Authority, also under the relevant existing legislation (the Employment Equality Act 1998) will be discussed when I meet the members designate shortly.<\/p><p><pli4>  TABLE<\/pli4><pli4><\/p><p><table><tr><th>Name<br \/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/th><th>Current Position<\/th><th>Appointment Period<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally\u00a0<\/td><td>Professor of Law UCC <br \/>Member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration The Hague, Member of the Council of Europe Group of Experts on Action Against Human Trafficking<\/td><td>5 Years<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ms Teresa Blake<\/td><td>Chairperson of Mental Health Tribunal, Barrister<\/td><td>5 years<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ms Orlagh O'Farrell<\/td><td>Lecturer in employment and equality law NUl\u00a0Maynooth, Member of Community Legal Resource network.

The Plan involves evidence-informed targeted interventions to achieve better outcomes for children who get into trouble with the law, and to reduce crime leading to safer communities. Importantly, the voice and experiences of children involved in the youth justice system have influenced the development of these interventions.   <\/p><p>  Of course, the Deputy will be aware that my Department is responsible for a range of supports to families and children which, although not directly related to juvenile offenders, seek to address many of the social and economic contributory factors.

Our Programme for Government commits that &ldquo;we will encourage schools to develop anti-bullying policies and in particular, strategies to combat homophobic bullying to support students.&rdquo;\t<\/p><p>  The implementation of the Action Plan on Bullying, which is being led by the Department of Education and Skills, is an important step in delivering on this commitment to work with a broad base of interests to protect children from bullying and ensure a safer childhood. <\/p><p>  In recognising the particular need to tackle homophobic bullying, and the broader issues of prejudice in society, the working group which produced this Action Plan included representatives of BeLonG To Youth Services and the GLEN (Gay &amp;amp; Lesbian Equality Network); organisations working to support Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered young people and to advocate for respect and inclusion of all citizens equally.  <\/p><p>  As part of its contribution to the Working Group&rsquo;s deliberations BeLong To Youth Services consulted with young people from across Ireland on their experiences of homophobic or transphobic bullying in schools. Two thirds of the young people consulted had experienced homophobic or transphobic bullying in schools. Research commissioned by the GLEN (Gay &amp;amp; Lesbian Equality Network) and BeLong To Youth Services on the experiences of young LGBT people in Irish schools has found that 50% reported the existence of homophobic bullying in their schools. <\/p><p>  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the actions set out in the Action Plan to tackle this problem are being progressed. My Department is currently developing &ldquo;A Children and Young Peoples Policy Framework&rdquo; which will set out high level goals for both my own and other Departments for the next five years. The Policy Framework is expected to be published later in 2013. The development of an Anti Bullying Framework is being progressed in the context of this whole-of-government policy framework. My Department is also working to place the Children First Guidelines on a statutory footing. Within this process we will explore any additional clarifications that may be required to further assist schools in their response to bullying. <\/p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that an additional &euro;500,000 has been allocated to the Education Vote to supplement the existing substantial resources within the system dedicated to the welfare of young people. I understand that work is underway in the Department of Education and Skills to develop new anti-bullying procedures for schools in consultation with the Education Partners with a view to their introduction from next September. There will also be engagement with Boards of Management and parents in relation to coordinated training and resources development. <\/p><p>  In recognising the lead role of schools, the National Education Welfare Board has issued guidelines requiring each school to have dedicated policies to prevent or address bullying. Schools must make it clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable. <\/p><p>Since the Action Plan was launched, two successful awareness raising initiatives have been rolled out. The first campaign was launched as part of EU Safer Internet Day in February. As part of it, the Government supported a national anti-cyberbullying media campaign specifically targeted at young people.  The second, which I launched on March 6th  , was the Stand Up! Awareness Week Against Homophobic &amp;amp; Transphobic Bullying in second level schools which was organised by BeLongTo Youth Services and was a key action point of the Plan. <\/p><p>  The Anti Bullying agenda is a recurring element in all our consultations with young people. It is notable that the majority of the 34 Comhairle na n&Oacute;g initiatives funded by my Department have identified mental health services, cyber bullying and homophobic bullying as priority issues for young people. In response, this has led a number of targeted measures being adopted by service providers across the country. <\/p><p>  Organisations and schools throughout the country are running anti-bullying campaigns and transition year students continue to pioneer student-led projects aimed at combating bullying and cyber bullying. My Department will continue to support the efforts of these projects and of teenagers who want to play a leading role in the national campaign against bullying. <\/p><p>  Corporations are also playing their part. I recently organised a number of information nights for parents, teachers and youth workers which were supported by webwise and facebook. IBM have just launched free Activity Kits on cyber bullying, online identity and internet safety coaching and I hope that companies such as these will support the development of the of an anti-bullying website to provide a single point of access to practical advice and support in tackling and reporting bullying behaviours. Preliminary scoping work is underway towards this development.<\/p><p>  My Department continues to work with other Departments, childcare services, education welfare services and the youth sector to raise awareness about bullying, its impact on children and young people and to advance measures to tackle prejudice, combat bullying and promote a safer environment for our young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900069#WRBB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":1653,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900069#WRCC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1654,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[22101\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900069#WRCC00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she outline the funding being currently provided to all Youth Work projects in County Kildare for each of the past three years; if she will itemise the funding by specific organisation funded; if she will provide the total spend in each year in County Kildare in the context of the total spend nationally on such youth services; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1655,"content":"<p>The Youth Affairs Unit of my Department provides a range of funding schemes, programmes and supports to the youth sector.

Therefore, efforts to combat harmful materials and activities on the Internet can be hampered by the multiplicity of jurisdictions, various legal systems, differing societal norms, or other relevant factors in this regard.  Many pro-eating disorder websites may be hosted outside this jurisdiction, principally in the United States.  As such, they would be subject to US jurisdiction, and any effective action is therefore limited in nature.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding such difficulties, there is in Ireland a self-regulatory framework in place for internet service providers (ISPs).  The Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland Code of Practice and Ethics sets out clear guidelines and minimum standards in respect of dealing with complaints regarding suspected illegal material.  However, pro-eating disorder websites are not regarded as illegal.  The Deputy may rest assured that the Department of Health, in conjunction with other relevant agencies, are cognisant of the issues raised in this instance and will continue to pursue an inter-agency response to policy and service developments to best tackle eating disorders overall.

The insurance companies, operating as commercial providers with a view towards profit generation, make commercial decisions about their prices.  However, it is clear that any significant price increases will make it more difficult for customers to renew their policies, therefore I have consistently raised the issue of costs with health insurers and am determined to address costs in the sector in the interests of consumers.  Last year, I established the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance which comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) and my Department.  This Forum was established to generate ideas which would help address health insurance costs, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law.  I have made it clear to the health insurers that I believe significant savings can be made, the effect of which can be to contain the cost of health insurance premiums.<\/p><p>  Given VHI&rsquo;s very significant share of overall costs in the market, I will continue to focus strongly on the need for the VHI to address its costs and to address aggressively the base cost of procedures, including professional fees.  At my instruction, the VHI recently compiled a detailed cost containment plan, which sets out savings targets for 2013 and for the 2014-2016 period, so as to minimise the need for any future premium increases.  The savings targets over this period are to be achieved through a combination of initiatives including rate reductions with private hospitals and consultants, utilisation management, expansion of clinical audit, reductions in high cost drugs and prosthesis, provider reviews and the continued transition of procedures to lower cost, medically appropriate settings.  I will continue to focus strongly on this issue, as part of measures to ensure the sustainability of the private health insurance market in the transition to a Universal Health Insurance system.<\/p><p>  In the meantime, many consumers can make large savings on their health insurance premiums by shopping around for the health insurance plan that best suits their needs.  For those who have been insured on the same plan for a number of years, it is important to review the level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured.  Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs.  The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits.  The HIA's website www.hia.ie has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900069#WRCC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mobility Allowance Scheme","counter":1665,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900069#WRCC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1666,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[21897\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900069#WRCC01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on the progress made on providing for the needs of those currently in receipt of the mobility allowance when the current scheme will expire","asker":"954","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1667,"content":"<p>A Project Group, which is independently chaired, has been established to seek an alternative method to provide for the priority transport needs of people in a manner that does not run counter to the Equal Status Acts.

We have also discussed the scope and definitions, the provisions on active farmers, coupled support and the schemes for young farmers and small farmers. On Monday, we started looking at the provisions on capping and flexibility between pillars.<\/p><p>  As to the single CMO, we have looked at the introductory provisions, trade issues and the school schemes.

This earlier programme involved the implementation of a range of evidence based programmes and practices on a pilot basis in three areas of high social and economic disadvantage.

In order for the public to have confidence in a youth justice system, it needs to be reasonably assured that it is effective in its policies and delivery.<\/p><p>  The focus for the forthcoming Youth Justice Action Plan   will be to continue the downward trends in high volume crime and detention; becoming more adept in understanding and intervening in more serious crime offending patterns; and improving the effectiveness and efficiency of these interventions in addressing the behaviour and needs of these children. The Plan involves evidence-informed targeted interventions to achieve better outcomes for children who get into trouble with the law, and to reduce crime leading to safer communities. Importantly, the voice and experiences of children involved in the youth justice system have influenced the development of these interventions.   <\/p><p>  Of course, the Deputy will be aware that my Department is responsible for a range of supports to families and children which, although not directly related to juvenile offenders, seek to address many of the social and economic contributory factors. I hope to bring a seamless new approach to policy development and integrated service provision for children so that they have the best possible start to life. In order to design and develop effec  tive policies and services that make a difference, then as a first step, we need to better understand our children: their lives, their experiences, their expectations.<\/p><p>  My Department's National Strategy for Research and Data on Children&rsquo;s Lives  2011-2016   sets out a 5 year plan to guide and support the development and use of research and data on children&rsquo;s lives, for the purpose of improving understandings and creating an evidence base to support policy and practice.

At the heart of the new Agency will be a new Service Delivery Framework, which will differentiate between child welfare and protection cases, such that family and child welfare concerns can be responded to by new multi-agency, community-based models for early intervention and family support.

The training is based on the resource Mindout which was developed by Health Promotion HSE West and NUI Galway. MindOut is a twelve session mental health programme which takes a positive approach to the promotion of emotional and mental health among young people,  looking at the ways they cope ranging from personal coping skills to informal networks of support to professional or voluntary support services.

Each year over 380,000 young people participate in youth work services throughout the country. Youth Work and non formal learning, in its many programmes and activities, recreational, sporting, learning, volunteering and skills development, offers young people opportunities to acquire new competences and skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, motivation, creativity and leadership. These are core and transferable life skills- the 21st   century skills that are so important to training and career readiness. There is a growing recognition in Ireland and across Europe of the potential of youth work services to enhance employability of young people as part of a wider employment and enterprise strategy. <\/p><p>  Youth employment is a theme which I prioritised during my Presidency of the EU Council of Youth Ministers through focusing on the potential of youth work and young people's engagement in youth activities and the way that non formal learning complements more formalised systems of employment, education and training.

Two thirds of the young people consulted had experienced homophobic or transphobic bullying in schools. Research commissioned by the GLEN (Gay &amp;amp; Lesbian Equality Network) and BeLong To Youth Services on the experiences of young LGBT people in Irish schools has found that 50% reported the existence of homophobic bullying in their schools. <\/p><p>  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the actions set out in the Action Plan to tackle this problem are being progressed. My Department is currently developing &ldquo;A Children and Young Peoples Policy Framework&rdquo; which will set out high level goals for both my own and other Departments for the next five years. The Policy Framework is expected to be published later in 2013. The development of an Anti Bullying Framework is being progressed in the context of this whole-of-government policy framework. My Department is also working to place the Children First Guidelines on a statutory footing. Within this process we will explore any additional clarifications that may be required to further assist schools in their response to bullying. <\/p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that an additional &euro;500,000 has been allocated to the Education Vote to supplement the existing substantial resources within the system dedicated to the welfare of young people. I understand that work is underway in the Department of Education and Skills to develop new anti-bullying procedures for schools in consultation with the Education Partners with a view to their introduction from next September. There will also be engagement with Boards of Management and parents in relation to coordinated training and resources development. <\/p><p>  In recognising the lead role of schools, the National Education Welfare Board has issued guidelines requiring each school to have dedicated policies to prevent or address bullying. Schools must make it clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable. <\/p><p>Since the Action Plan was launched, two successful awareness raising initiatives have been rolled out. The first campaign was launched as part of EU Safer Internet Day in February. As part of it, the Government supported a national anti-cyberbullying media campaign specifically targeted at young people.  The second, which I launched on March 6th  , was the Stand Up! Awareness Week Against Homophobic &amp;amp; Transphobic Bullying in second level schools which was organised by BeLongTo Youth Services and was a key action point of the Plan. <\/p><p>  The Anti Bullying agenda is a recurring element in all our consultations with young people. It is notable that the majority of the 34 Comhairle na n&Oacute;g initiatives funded by my Department have identified mental health services, cyber bullying and homophobic bullying as priority issues for young people. In response, this has led a number of targeted measures being adopted by service providers across the country. <\/p><p>  Organisations and schools throughout the country are running anti-bullying campaigns and transition year students continue to pioneer student-led projects aimed at combating bullying and cyber bullying. My Department will continue to support the efforts of these projects and of teenagers who want to play a leading role in the national campaign against bullying. <\/p><p>  Corporations are also playing their part. I recently organised a number of information nights for parents, teachers and youth workers which were supported by webwise and facebook. IBM have just launched free Activity Kits on cyber bullying, online identity and internet safety coaching and I hope that companies such as these will support the development of the of an anti-bullying website to provide a single point of access to practical advice and support in tackling and reporting bullying behaviours. Preliminary scoping work is underway towards this development.<\/p><p>  My Department continues to work with other Departments, childcare services, education welfare services and the youth sector to raise awareness about bullying, its impact on children and young people and to advance measures to tackle prejudice, combat bullying and promote a safer environment for our young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900073#WRBB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":1837,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900074#WRCC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1838,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[22101\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900074#WRCC00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she outline the funding being currently provided to all Youth Work projects in County Kildare for each of the past three years; if she will itemise the funding by specific organisation funded; if she will provide the total spend in each year in County Kildare in the context of the total spend nationally on such youth services; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1839,"content":"<p>The Youth Affairs Unit of my Department provides a range of funding schemes, programmes and supports to the youth sector.

Therefore, efforts to combat harmful materials and activities on the Internet can be hampered by the multiplicity of jurisdictions, various legal systems, differing societal norms, or other relevant factors in this regard.  Many pro-eating disorder websites may be hosted outside this jurisdiction, principally in the United States.  As such, they would be subject to US jurisdiction, and any effective action is therefore limited in nature.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding such difficulties, there is in Ireland a self-regulatory framework in place for internet service providers (ISPs).  The Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland Code of Practice and Ethics sets out clear guidelines and minimum standards in respect of dealing with complaints regarding suspected illegal material.  However, pro-eating disorder websites are not regarded as illegal.  The Deputy may rest assured that the Department of Health, in conjunction with other relevant agencies, are cognisant of the issues raised in this instance and will continue to pursue an inter-agency response to policy and service developments to best tackle eating disorders overall.

The insurance companies, operating as commercial providers with a view towards profit generation, make commercial decisions about their prices.  However, it is clear that any significant price increases will make it more difficult for customers to renew their policies, therefore I have consistently raised the issue of costs with health insurers and am determined to address costs in the sector in the interests of consumers.  Last year, I established the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance which comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) and my Department.  This Forum was established to generate ideas which would help address health insurance costs, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law.  I have made it clear to the health insurers that I believe significant savings can be made, the effect of which can be to contain the cost of health insurance premiums.<\/p><p>  Given VHI&rsquo;s very significant share of overall costs in the market, I will continue to focus strongly on the need for the VHI to address its costs and to address aggressively the base cost of procedures, including professional fees.  At my instruction, the VHI recently compiled a detailed cost containment plan, which sets out savings targets for 2013 and for the 2014-2016 period, so as to minimise the need for any future premium increases.  The savings targets over this period are to be achieved through a combination of initiatives including rate reductions with private hospitals and consultants, utilisation management, expansion of clinical audit, reductions in high cost drugs and prosthesis, provider reviews and the continued transition of procedures to lower cost, medically appropriate settings.  I will continue to focus strongly on this issue, as part of measures to ensure the sustainability of the private health insurance market in the transition to a Universal Health Insurance system.<\/p><p>  In the meantime, many consumers can make large savings on their health insurance premiums by shopping around for the health insurance plan that best suits their needs.  For those who have been insured on the same plan for a number of years, it is important to review the level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured.  Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs.  The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits.  The HIA's website www.hia.ie has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900074#WRCC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mobility Allowance Scheme","counter":1849,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900074#WRCC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1850,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[21897\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050900074#WRCC01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on the progress made on providing for the needs of those currently in receipt of the mobility allowance when the current scheme will expire","asker":"954","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1851,"content":"<p>A Project Group, which is independently chaired, has been established to seek an alternative method to provide for the priority transport needs of people in a manner that does not run counter to the Equal Status Acts.
