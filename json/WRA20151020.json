I am conscious of the serious impact of such crimes on families and communities and recognise the public concern at these crimes, in Tipperary and elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  As I have outlined in answer to other questions today, my response to burglaries, and to crime generally, is focussed on two key objectives; strengthening the law to get tougher on serious and repeat offenders and investing in the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enforce that law effectively.  Earlier this year I initiated a broad and urgent review of the criminal justice system's response to the problem of burglaries.  This included a focus on interagency measures in relation to the management of prolific offenders, visible policing, crime prevention support for communities, and an examination of legislative issues.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of this review, I have published the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill, 2015.  This legislation targets repeat burglary offenders through bail measures and provisions concerning the imposition of consecutive sentencing for repeat burglary offending.  The key objective of this legislation is to target a cohort of persistent offenders who prey on law abiding householders and clearly have no concern for the damage and distress which they inflict on others.  As the Deputy is aware the detail of the legislation is currently before the Houses of Oireachtas for debate and I hope to have it enacted as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I am also in ongoing contact with the Commissioner to ensure that we maximise the enforcement of all relevant laws in this area, by providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the appropriate supports to take account of evolving trends and patterns in burglary offences.<\/p>  <p>  As I have outlined previously, the Garda strategy to counter burglaries and related crimes has been coordinated under Operation Fiacla, which has led to 14,672 arrests, and 8,358 charges brought to date.  I am providing the Commissioner with the means to enhance this operational response.  Most significantly, last September we reopened the Garda College to new recruits for the first time since 2009.  To date, 400 new Garda&iacute; have started their training, with the first 295 having already passed-out and are now working in communities nationwide. 150 more recruits are due to enter Garda College in coming weeks, and, following the Budget Day announcements, there will be a further 600 new recruits in 2016, underlining the Government's commitment to providing communities throughout the country with the reassurance that comes from a visible and determined police force.<\/p>  <p>  In a modern context the provision of policing in rural areas must be focussed on highly mobile and flexible responses to crime patterns and the needs of communities.  This will be facilitated by the very significant investment in Garda vehicles and equipment including the &euro;700,000 for new high powered vehicles in 2015, and &euro;1.75m to upgrade surveillance equipment on Garda aircraft.  In all, we have invested nearly &euro;29 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012, with 370 new vehicles coming on stream already this year.  In addition, the future commitment to supporting an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in opposing criminals in all areas of the country is underscored by the Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 which makes provision for the ongoing delivery of new Garda vehicles, as well as very significant investment in new technology and information systems for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, amounting to an investment of &euro;205m over the life of the Plan.<\/p>  <p>  With the benefit of the very significant allocations which the Government is making for Garda resources, I am working closely with the Commissioner to finalise details of an enhanced operational response to burglaries and related crimes, and I expect to be in a position to make further announcements in this regard shortly.  These measures represent an investment in the safety of our communities and underscore the commitment of this Government to ensure that those on the frontline in tackling crime, including burglary, have the capacity to do so effectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000058#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":10,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 113 and 114 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000058#WRA00900"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[35309\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000058#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when she will advance the long-awaited mediation Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas.","asker":"998","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>The Mediation Bill, which is currently being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, will introduce an obligation on solicitors and barristers to advise any person wishing to commence legal proceedings to give consideration to mediation as an alternative to legal proceedings.

We continue to ensure that violent offenders and other serious offenders serve appropriate prison sentences while at the same time switching away from prison sentences and towards less costly non-custodial options for non-violent and less serious offenders.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that it is continuing to reduce the capacity of our prisons to align with the Inspector of Prisons recommended bed capacity of 3,982 in so far as this is compatible with public safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system.  On 7th October 2015 there were 3,663 prisoners in custody which is 92% of the Inspector's recommended total capacity of 3,982.  Significant decreases in prison numbers have taken place.  The overall daily average number in custody for 2014 was 3,915 compared to 4,390 in 2011, a decrease of 10.8%.  The Deputy may wish to note that the number in custody reached a peak of 4,621 on 23rd February 2011.  On the 7th October 2015, there were 958 less prisoners in custody, a decrease of 21%.<\/p>  <p>  Huge improvements have been made to prison conditions in recent years. Overcrowding has been eliminated in Mountjoy Prison and priority has been given to addressing capacity issues in Cork, Limerick and the D&oacute;chas Centre.  All of the wings in Mountjoy Prison have been completely refurbished thereby facilitating the elimination of the practice of slopping out in the prison.  A completely new replacement prison in Cork is almost complete and will be operational by early 2016.  The enabling works for a major redevelopment of Limerick Prison are also scheduled to begin in 2016 with the main construction phase to start in early 2017.  Significant building and refurbishment projects are also scheduled for 2016 in Castlerea Prison.<\/p>  <p>  Alternatives to custody continue to be pursued and legislation has already been passed.  This includes the Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Act 2011 which requires the sentencing judge to consider the imposition of community service where a custodial sentence of 12 months or less is being considered.<\/p>  <p>  The Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014 provides that the Court imposing a fine shall take into account a person's financial circumstances.  It further provides, inter alia, that where a person fails to pay a fine by the due date, the Court may make an attachment order to earnings as a means of recovering the unpaid fine.  As a result of this legislation, it is expected that we will see a reduction in the number of committals to prisons on short sentences.<\/p>  <p>  In conjunction with the Probation Service, the Irish Prison Service has continued the national roll out of the Community Return Programme, an incentivised scheme for earned temporary release under which carefully selected offenders can be granted structured temporary release in return for supervised community service.  In addition to this programme, Community Support Schemes have been set up in Cork Prison, Mountjoy Campus, West Dublin Campus and Limerick Prisons, the aim of which is to reduce recidivism rates by arranging for additional support structures and provide for a more structured form of temporary release.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000059#WRB00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Resources","counter":48,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000059#WRB00400"},{"type":"question","counter":49,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[35248\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000059#WRB00500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which she expects extra members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to become available for duty over the next five years; if adequate resources for the procurement of modern technology are likely to become more available; if Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deployment and policing strategy is likely to compare favourably with other jurisdictions throughout the European Union, with the objective of achieving best practice; if the use of effective closed-circuit television is likely to become more available in the fight against crime in general, and the activities of criminal gangs in particular, with specific reference to the need to confront the mobilised criminal gangs carrying out raids throughout the country; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":50,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel among the Garda Regions, Divisions, and Districts.

Such authorisations are only issued following application from the Garda Commissioner or the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, in accordance with the Act.<\/p>  <p>  The 1993 Act also makes provision for independent judicial oversight of its operation by a serving Judge of the High Court who is designated for this purpose.

While significant efforts are devoted to addressing the issues referred to by the Deputy, it is important to note that the system of fixed charge notices and penalty points have formed a key part in Ireland's Road Safety Strategy for several years, have gained widespread acceptance, and contributed to enforcement and reduced road fatalities.  The system represents an efficient means of dealing with road traffic infringements with most fixed charges being paid without recourse to court, and an approximate payment rate of nearly 80% in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  The systems involved are, however, large and complex ones requiring continuous attention and development.  The issues of concern referred to by the Deputy are being addressed by the Criminal Justice Fixed Charge Processing System (FCPS) Working Group on a number of fronts.  These include the  project which is underway to introduce a '3rd Payment Option' whereby a person served with a summons would have a final opportunity to pay the penalty and receive the points without attending Court.  The IT project to give effect to this facility is due for completion in July 2016.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a working group has been established by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to actively examine how the rate of summons serving can be improved and to regularly monitor the level of summons service throughout the country, as well as to consider longer term solutions with a view to improving service of summonses generally.  This group has reported improvements in the rate of successful service of summonses.  As the Deputy will be aware there are long-standing challenges with effecting service of summons in certain circumstances, relating to such matters as inaccurate address data, persons moving address, or living in multi-occupancy dwellings or other settings which make service difficult.  In addition, certain persons will take steps to evade service. Similar difficulties are experienced by many other police forces.<\/p>  <p>  Further short term steps have been undertaken to improve enforcement of penalty point matters in the Courts.  These include:<\/p>  <p>  - A range of prosecutions are being brought for the non-production of driving licences in Court, with a view to ensuring that penalty points are applied whenever a conviction is recorded.  The outcome of these prosecutions and their impact will be assessed, including in relation to the most efficient means of bring such prosecutions on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  - A pilot project is underway to allow 2 Dublin courtrooms electronic access to the National Vehicle Driver File (NVDF) to check driving licences where a person found guilty of a penalty point offence does not produce their driving licence to the Court.  Again this will assist in ensuring that penalty points are applied where convictions are recorded.<\/p>  <p>  One longer term measure also under consideration is a project which will associate vehicle and driver records in order to achieve optimum penalty point endorsement as well as other benefits.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I received an update recently in relation to the development of this project and hope to be in a position to provide further information in this regard in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I can assure the Deputy that there is ongoing liaison between all of the stakeholders involved at an operational level with a view to addressing the above issues and any other matters that arise, including in the development of road traffic legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000059#WRB02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Deaths in Prison","counter":72,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000059#WRB02800"},{"type":"question","counter":73,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[35187\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000059#WRB02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the action she proposes to take in response to the report of the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention in relation to the deaths of two prisoners, which exposed inaccurate record-keeping.","asker":"1192","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":74,"content":"<p>I take this opportunity to offer my sympathy to the families concerned on their loss.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na make full use of the extensive range of legislation which is in place to address street crime and anti-social behaviour, including knife crime and drug related crime.  In this regard there is a comprehensive and robust legal framework in place with respect to knife crime including strong Garda powers to search without a warrant and  penalties of up to five years imprisonment.<\/p>  <p>  Tackling this type of crime is central to the overall and ongoing implementation of the Dublin City Centre Policing Plan.  This involves a high-visibility uniformed presence on key thoroughfares, as well as the use of undercover Garda&iacute; as appropriate.  As part of the Garda Plan a range of dedicated policing operations and measures are in place to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour in the city centre.  The resumption of Garda recruitment and the deployment of newly attested Garda&iacute; are of course key components in providing visible policing in the city centre and elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the Garda responses, I am sure the Deputy would concur that the issues involved are not simply policing ones.  He will also recall that I have previously met with the key state agencies and other stakeholders in relation to various actions which are aimed at improving the general environment in Dublin City Centre, and strongly support this ongoing work.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the concerns which have been expressed about drug misuse in the city centre, the Deputy will be aware that the Government's overall response to the problem of drug misuse, is set out in the National Drugs Strategy for the period 2009-2016.  The Strategy is being delivered under the stewardship of my colleague, Minister of State &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, and it provides a coordinated and comprehensive response founded on a partnership approach.<\/p>  <p>  I think it is generally accepted that the complex issues which contribute to drug addiction and related behaviours must be addressed in a coordinated and cross-cutting manner.  In response to the particular issues arising in Dublin City Centre a multi-agency street outreach approach is being used to work with vulnerable and high-risk individuals and an offender management programme is being piloted to address repeat offending in the Dublin City area.

My response to burglaries, and to crime generally, is focussed on two key objectives; strengthening the law to get tougher on serious and repeat offenders and investing in the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enforce that law effectively.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year I called together the heads of all of the Criminal Justice agencies to devise a new approach to tackle burglaries.  One important factor which emerged was the finding that a large proportion of domestic burglaries are committed by serial offenders.  Figures from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service indicate that 75% of burglaries are committed by 25% of burglars.  Targeting these repeat offenders must be a priority and has the potential to significantly reduce the number of burglaries being committed.  In response, I introduced the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill which is targeted at those repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary.  The new Bill will require the District Court to provide for consecutive jail sentences where a burglar is being sentenced for multiple offences, and will allow Courts to refuse ball for offenders who have a previous conviction for domestic burglary coupled with two or more pending charges.  This Bill, which I hope to see enacted in the next few weeks, will go a long way in giving the Courts the power to ensure that repeat burglars are kept off the streets.<\/p>  <p>  Legislation on its own is not enough, however.  I am also in ongoing contact with the Commissioner with a view to ensuring that the policing response is as effective as can be and that Garda operations take account of evolving trends and patterns in burglary offences.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda strategy to counter burglaries and related crimes has been coordinated under Operation Fiacla, which has led to 14,672 arrests, and 8,358 charges brought to date.  I am providing the Commissioner with the means to enhance this operational response.  Most significantly, last September we reopened the Garda College to new recruits for the first time since 2009.  To date, 400 new Garda&iacute; have started their training, with the first 295 having already passed-out and are now working in communities nationwide. 150 more recruits are due to enter Garda College in coming weeks, and, following the Budget Day announcements, there will be a further 600 new recruits in 2016, underlining the Government's commitment to providing communities throughout the country with the reassurance that comes from a visible and determined police force.<\/p>  <p>  I am also ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the necessary vehicles and technology to respond to the highly-mobile gangs behind much burglary offending.

The approach of the Oireachtas has generally been to specify in law a maximum penalty for an offence, so that a court, having considered all the circumstances of a case, may impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient.<\/p>  <p>  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  This system is being developed as a valuable tool not only for members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those concerned with the needs of victims and their families, and I very much support the initiative led by the Judiciary through the Judicial Research Office in undertaking the detailed work of gathering and providing information on sentencing via the website.<\/p>  <p>  The report of the Working Group on the Strategic Review of Penal Policy, published in July 2014, considered the issue of developing sentencing guidelines.  However, the majority of the Review Group took the view that the primary role of developing sentencing guidelines is the responsibility of the judiciary and does not lie in bringing forward detailed statutory based guidelines.  It might also be noted that a Sentencing Council was not advocated by the Law Reform Commission in its Report on Mandatory Sentencing which was published in June 2013.  Work is currently underway to implement some of the key recommendations of the Penal Policy Review Group including preparing proposals and options for Government on reform of sentencing policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000060#WRC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Misconduct Allegations","counter":106,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000060#WRC01600"},{"type":"question","counter":107,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[35283\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000060#WRC01700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"for an update on the barristers panel review of all the cases it is dealing with; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":108,"content":"<p>A panel consisting of two senior and five junior counsel was established for the purpose of conducting an independent review of certain allegations of Garda misconduct, or inadequacies in the investigation of certain allegations, which have been made to me as Minister for Justice and Equality, or the Taoiseach.

This included a focus on interagency measures in relation to the management of prolific offenders, visible policing, crime prevention support for communities, and an examination of legislative issues.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of this review, I published the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill, 2015 which targets repeat burglary offenders through bail measures and provisions concerning the imposition of consecutive sentencing for repeat burglary offending.  The key objective of this legislation is to target a cohort of persistent offenders who prey on law abiding householders and clearly have no concern for the damage and distress which they inflict on others.  As the Deputy is aware the detail of the legislation is currently before the Houses of Oireachtas for debate and I hope to have it enacted as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I am also in ongoing contact with the Commissioner to ensure that we maximise the enforcement of all relevant laws in this area, by providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the appropriate supports to take account of evolving trends and patterns in burglary offences.  In this regard, the Garda strategy to counter burglaries and related crimes has been coordinated under Operation Fiacla, which has led to 14,672 arrests, and 8,358 charges brought to date.  I am providing the Commissioner with the means to enhance this operational response.  The reopening of the Garda College for new recruits in September last year and the deployment of newly attested Garda&iacute; during the current year clearly demonstrate the Governments commitment to supporting communities on the front line.  We are committed to ongoing Garda recruitment to further enhance our ability to confront criminals and protect the law-abiding majority.  150 more recruits are due to enter Garda College in coming weeks, and, following the Budget Day announcements, there will be a further 600 new recruits in 2016, underlining the Government's commitment to providing communities throughout the country with the reassurance that comes from a visible and determined police force.<\/p>  <p>  In a modern context the provision of policing in rural areas must be focussed on highly mobile and flexible responses to crime patterns and the needs of communities.  This will be facilitated by the very significant investment in Garda vehicles and equipment including the &euro;700,000 for new high powered vehicles in 2015, and &euro;1.75m to upgrade surveillance equipment on Garda aircraft.  In all, we have invested nearly &euro;29 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012, with 370 new vehicles coming on stream already this year.  In addition, the future commitment to supporting an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in opposing criminals in all areas of the country is underscored by the Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 which makes provision for the ongoing delivery of new Garda vehicles, as well as very significant investment in new technology and information systems for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, amounting to an investment of &euro;205m over the life of the Plan.<\/p>  <p>  With the benefit of the very significant allocations which the Government is making for Garda resources, I am working closely with the Commissioner to finalise details of an enhanced operational response to burglaries and related crimes, and I expect to be in a position to make further announcements in this regard shortly.

On consideration of any such assessment I will decide what information might appropriately be put into the public domain.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy will be aware that in the context of the current discussions between the parties in Northern Ireland and the Irish and British governments, the British Government has arranged for an assessment to be made of paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000060#WRC03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Repossession","counter":131,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000061#WRD00150"},{"type":"question","counter":132,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[32834\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000061#WRD00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to reform the family home repossession legislation; and if she will make a statement on the matter. ","asker":"1177","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":133,"content":"<p>This Government has put in place a number of legislative provisions regarding protection of the family home in cases where repossession of the property is being sought. <b><\/b><i>Section 2 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013<\/i>provides that in repossession proceedings involving the borrower's principal private residence, a court may, where it considers it appropriate, or on application by a borrower, adjourn the proceedings to allow the borrower to explore with a Personal Insolvency Practitioner whether a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 would enable him or her to resolve their financial difficulties other than by repossession.  The section does not apply to investment or commercial properties.<\/p><p>The intention is to ensure that homeowners in mortgage arrears who are at risk of losing their homes are aware of, and have an opportunity to access, the legally protected debt resolution arrangements available under the Personal Insolvency Act, which may enable the borrower to remain in their home while resolving the debt in a sustainable manner.<\/p><p>The borrower may propose a Personal Insolvency Arrangement following a court adjournment as indicated above, or through the main route set out in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  The Personal Insolvency Practitioner has a range of statutory responsibilities and duties, including advising the borrower on all their options so that they can make an informed decision, and (where a PIA is appropriate and the borrower so instructs) formulating and negotiating a PIA proposal on their behalf.<\/p><p>I should add that the recently enacted Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015 presents additional options to borrowers struggling to resolve mortgage arrears on their homes, and particularly for those at risk of repossession.  It provides at section 21 for the introduction of a new review mechanism, if a borrower's proposal for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement, which includes their home mortgage, has been rejected by creditors. The borrower now has the option, in certain circumstances, of asking the Circuit Court to review the creditors' refusal.  Under this new provision, the Court will consider a range of tests set out in the legislation and has power to impose the proposed Personal Insolvency Arrangement on the creditors, where the Court considers appropriate.<\/p><p>The 2015 Act was signed by the President on 28th July, and the necessary changes to Court rules to bring the review mechanism into effect are currently being finalised by the Courts Service.<\/p><p>This important reform forms part of the Government Action Plan on strengthening support to those in mortgage arrears on their homes, announced on 13 May this year.  It is designed to ensure that fair and sustainable debt deals are upheld for  borrowers who want to work their way out of debt with a view to keeping their homes.  It will protect distressed mortgage-holders, and will provide a better balance between the interests of banks, and of those facing unsustainable mortgages.<\/p><p>I have no immediate plans to further amend legislation in this area, but will keep the operation of the law in this area under review. <\/p><p>Finally, I think that it is also important to reiterate the Government's message that independent help and advice is available to borrowers who find themselves in arrears on their homes and who want to reaching a solution to their difficulties: they should engage in this as early as possible, and should make contact with MABS, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, or with the Insolvency Service of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000061#WRD00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Communications Surveillance","counter":134,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000061#WRD00350"},{"type":"question","counter":135,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[35281\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000061#WRD00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to bring forward proposals to change the Interception of Postal and Telecommunications (Regulations) Act 1994.","asker":"1197","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":136,"content":"<p>The Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 provides a legislative basis for the lawful interception of communications in this State.<\/p>  <p>  The Act provides that only the Minister for Justice and Equality may grant authorisations to intercept and then only for the purposes of the investigation of serious crime or in the interests of the security of the State.

The release shows the monthly, quarterly and annual change in the production and turnover index; and it also includes a detailed breakdown by industrial sector.<\/p>  <p>  The production index is regarded as one of the most important measures of economic activity.  The main advantages of the production index compared with other indicators are its combination of early availability and its detailed breakdown.<\/p>  <p>  However, the short-term results from the Industrial Production Index are generally more volatile and do not always give a full indication of the trends in industry.  It is therefore important to take care when interpreting monthly or quarterly trends in the index.  For example, so far in 2015, the monthly change has ranged between an increase of 27.9% and a decrease of 11%.  Similarly, the reduction of 1% in August followed an increase of 9.9% in July.<\/p>  <p>  Such volatility reflects the production decisions taken by individual firms which represent a large share of industrial output &ndash; for example the product mix, pricing or stock changes taking place at a given time of year.

This sector accounts for most of the volatility in the short-term monthly results. <\/p>  <p>  The Traditional sector includes all other areas of manufacturing industry, the largest of which is the Food and Beverages sector.

Insolvency) Act, 1984, which, in turn, derives from EU Council Directive 987\/80, is to protect certain outstanding pay-related entitlements due to employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer.  These entitlements include wages, holiday pay, sick pay, payment in lieu of minimum notice due under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973-2001, and certain pension contributions.  Various other statutory awards made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal and Rights Commissioners are also covered by the scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  Where a person&rsquo;s former employer was a limited company, the company must be in liquidation or receivership in order for the person to be eligible to claim under the insolvency payments scheme.  In such circumstances, the liquidator or receiver becomes the relevant officer for submitting claims as he or she has access to the company records and can certify that the amounts claimed are in order.   <\/p>  <p>  There can be situations whereby employers have ceased trading without engaging in any formal wind-up process and some or all of their former employees are left with money owed to them.  Such people are not covered by the insolvency payments scheme.     <\/p>  <p>  The Department is continuing to review the position to establish what, if anything, can be done to progress payments to individuals in situations where employers cease trading without engaging in a formal winding-up process and owe moneys to their employees.  The Department is consulting a range of interested parties, including the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Revenue Commissioners, in respect of these issues.  Officials from the Department will continue to engage with all relevant parties to try to progress the matter.  There are very difficult legal issues that need to be addressed and the potential impacts that any proposed policy development might have must be considered. <\/p>  <p>  I am not in a position to indicate at this stage when the review will be completed.

These include the requirements that the host organisation must have Public\/Employers Liability insurance and Motor Insurance, if applicable, that will cover any interns on the JobBridge Scheme, and be fully compliant with current workplace Health and Safety and all other legal and sectoral requirements.  A Host Organisation cannot proceed beyond the application stage until it confirms compliance with the Terms and Conditions of the JobBridge Scheme.  Host Organisations must also ensure procedural and regulatory compliance in relation to placements that require Garda Vetting or other sectoral requirements.  In such instances, interns must agree to comply with requests for Garda Vetting and\/or other sectoral requirements, where necessary, in accordance with the Host Organisation&rsquo;s policy.<\/p><p>It is also important to note that participation on JobBridge is not mandatory.  Jobseekers avail of JobBridge opportunities on a purely voluntary basis and there is no sanction of any kind if a jobseeker does not apply for or avail of JobBridge.  The Department has not and will not tolerate any abuse of the JobBridge Scheme or exploitation of participants.  There is a rigorous control and monitoring regime in place to mitigate the risk of misuse or abuse.  The Department also conducts regular monitoring visits to determine how individual internships are progressing.

A PSC is issued following the SAFE registration of an individual involving verification of their identity including capture of a photograph and signature.

A physical examination, is by its nature of limited value and would not paint an accurate picture of the child&rsquo;s care needs on an average day in their normal home environment.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000064#WRG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":320,"content":"<p>Question No. 224 answered with Question No. 161.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":321,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000064#WRG01450"},{"type":"question","counter":322,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[36047\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000064#WRG01500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a decision will be made on an appeal for a carer's allowance by a person (details supplied) in County Galway, given that the refusal was based on the carer working more than 15 hours a week, and that this decision appears to be based on a misreading of the hours on the payslips, which were fortnightly hours rather than weekly hours; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":323,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance (CA) from the person concerned on 3 June 2015.

Prior to 2015, while the income and gains arising in an AMRF could be drawn down, the initial capital invested (a maximum of &euro;63,500) could not be accessed (except to purchase an annuity) until the owner of the AMRF reached age 75.  From 2015 onwards, an individual may draw down a maximum of 4% of the value of an AMRF annually.   <\/p>  <p>  When the owner of an AMRF reaches age 75 the AMRF is automatically converted to an ARF and the owner is then free to draw down the monies therein subject to taxation.  <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a Qualifying Fund Manager (QFM) who manages an ARF is required under section 784A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, to treat a withdrawal from the fund as a payment of emoluments in the year in which the payment is made and to subject that payment to income tax under the PAYE system.  The fund manager is obliged to deduct tax at the higher rate of income tax for the year in which the payment arises (40% for 2016) unless Revenue has issued a certificate of tax credits and standard rate cut-off point for the individual prior to the payment being made.  USC would also be payable on any payments at the reduced rates applying to the over 70s (1% and 3% for 2016).  <\/p>  <p>  In this context, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the individual in question should apply to her local Revenue Office for a certificate of tax credits and standard rate cut-off point in advance of withdrawing monies from her ARF.  This will ensure that any such withdrawal is taxed at the individual's appropriate marginal rate of tax.  To that end, she can contact Ms Suzanne Sheahan, Kerry District, Government Offices, Spa Road, Tralee, County Kerry Tel:066-7161000.  <\/p>  <p>  It is not possible to state with certainty what rate, or rates, of income tax will apply to amounts that this individual might withdraw from her ARF, as this will be determined by the amount of her income from all sources (including any amount withdrawn from the ARF) and her tax credits for the year or years in question.  However, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, for 2016, the first &euro;33,800 of income will be taxed at 20%, with the balance being taxed at 40%.   <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Commissioners, that in the event that tax is charged in the first instance at the higher rate (in the absence of a tax credit certificate) in circumstances where the standard rate (20% for 2016) applies to some or all of the payment, a taxpayer can apply to Revenue for a repayment of any tax overpaid after the end of the tax year in question.   <\/p>  <p>  The individual could, of course, consider staggering the withdrawals from her ARF over a number of years so that tax is restricted to the standard 20% rate on any withdrawal.  Indeed, to that end, she might also consider availing of the option to withdraw the maximum allowable 4% of the value of her AMRF in 2015 (which would be subject to tax and USC on the same basis as outlined above).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000065#WRH00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":372,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[36165\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000065#WRH01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is aware that Irish insurers who provide Approved Retirement Funds are granted a tax advantage under the Irish-United Kingdom Double Tax Agreement which is not available to other non-insured Appointed Retirement Fund providers (details supplied); if he is satisfied that this practice accords with European Union law and does not amount to State aid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1096","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":373,"content":"<p>I am informed by\u00a0 Revenue\u00a0 that, under the Ireland\/United Kingdom Double Taxation Convention, and in common with double taxation agreements generally, a taxing right in respect of income and capital gains from immovable property is given to the Contracting State   Ireland or the United Kingdom in which the property is situated.\u00a0 However, Article 14A of the Convention modifies this provision for income or gains from UK property paid to insurance companies in respect of their pension business: Such income will be exempt from UK tax if the income is tax-exempt in Ireland, and vice versa.  \u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In that regard, I am advised by Revenue that subsection (5) of section 784A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 specifically extends the scope of references to the pension business of insurance companies to include approved retirement funds (ARF's) provided by such companies.

These seminars will provide credit unions with the opportunity to engage with the Central Bank\u00a0 on the new regulations and to discuss development of the credit union business model,\u00a0including any changes to the regulatory framework that might be required to facilitate those developments.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the provision of additional services, where a credit union wishes to provide such services to its members, in addition to the services that are provided for under the Credit Union Act, 1997 (1997 Act), an application may be made to the Central Bank for approval to provide such additional services in accordance with the provisions set out in sections 48 to\u00a052 of the 1997 Act.  <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Central Bank\u00a0has informed me\u00a0that since 2010 it\u00a0has received less than 10 applications for approval of additional services under sections 48 to\u00a052 of the 1997 Act.  These have all been received in recent months and are currently at a various stages of the approval process.<\/p>  <p>   The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000065#WRH02800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":399,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000065#WRH02850"},{"type":"question","counter":400,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[36554\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000065#WRH02900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of revenue that would be lost if Capital Gains Tax was reduced from 33% to 30%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":401,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a wide range of statistical information is available on the Commissioners' Statistics webpage: .<\/p><p>In particular, in relation to the Deputy's Question, estimates for changing rate of Capital Gains Tax are included in the Ready Reckoner on the Statistics webpage:<\/p><p>. <\/p><p>While the Ready Reckoner does not show the specific costings requested by the Deputy, the changes can be estimated broadly on a pro-rata (or straight-line) basis with those displayed in the Reckoner.  <\/p><p>All estimates shown in the Ready Reckoner are provisional and subject to revision.

Last year, NAMA funded the delivery of\u00a0nearly 50% of new housing output in Dublin despite having an exposure to less than one-third of residentially zoned development land in Dublin and since the start of 2014 has funded the construction of over 2,000 new houses and apartments in the greater Dublin area. In conjunction with last week's budget, NAMA announced that\u00a0having carried out a review of residential development sites under the control of its debtors and receivers, it\u00a0is aiming to fund the delivery of a target 20,000 additional new homes before the end of 2020.\u00a0 This is in addition to NAMA's ongoing and central role in facilitating the delivery of new commercial and residential space in the Dublin Dockland's SDZ.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Development projects are managed by NAMA debtors, receivers or third-party partners. To achieve the 20,000 target, NAMA will, for instance, work with existing debtors, where possible, but will also work on a commercial basis with developers with no current links with NAMA in developing lands securing NAMA\u00a0loans.

In the case of individuals who have non-PAYE income that exceeds &euro;100,000 in a year, a USC surcharge of 3% applies to the excess.

In 2005, my Department and the Department of Health completed a Service Level Agreement (SLA) which formalised arrangements for the provision of the inter-hospital air ambulance service by the Air Corps.  This SLA was renewed in October, 2011 and provides for inter-hospital transfer by air for patients with medical conditions that require urgent treatment at a hospital within Ireland or in the UK.  There has been a significant use of this service in recent years with 109 inter-hospital missions being completed in 2014, 102 in 2013 and 108 in 2012.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Air Corps also supports the HSE&rsquo;s Emergency Aeromedical Support (EAS) service which operates on a daily basis out of Custume Barracks, Athlone.  This service commenced in June 2012 and was established, initially on a pilot basis, by agreement between my Department and the Department of Health in order to assess the level and type, if any, of dedicated emergency aeromedical support needed to assist the National Ambulance Service, primarily in the west of Ireland.  Following a report of an inter-agency EAS Establishment Group which looked at the various options for service provision, a permanent service has now been established following a Government decision in July 2015.  This is based on the Air Corps providing a dedicated helicopter operating out of Custume Barracks Athlone, with reserve support being provided by the Irish Coast Guard.  Whilst the Government's decision provided that the Air Corps' involvement in the service shall not exceed current levels in terms of the number of helicopters, it was also decided that the various options considered in the report are to be kept under review in the context of ensuring a sustainable long-term service arrangement.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000070#WRN02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Properties","counter":696,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000070#WRN02350"},{"type":"question","counter":697,"qnumday":354,"qnumall":"[36535\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000070#WRN02400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if his Department requested Kildare County Council to delist any structures at the Magee Barracks site in Kildare town; if, in the event of the sale of this property, he will make arrangements for the retention and preservation of the historic gates and their allied boundary railings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":698,"content":"<p>In December 2011 the Department of Defence formally requested that the Council delist the protected structures on the site of the former Magee army barracks in Kildare.

The direct savings from the Programme as highlighted by the Deputy are modest.  However, it is important to recall that the primary objective of the Programme was to identify opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>In its review of the Garda Station Network, Garda management concluded in relation to certain stations, many of which were only open part-time and manned by a single Garda, that resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if those stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.  In reaching these conclusions, Garda management reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.  The Programme supports the provision of a modern 21st century policing service for both urban and rural areas and  allows  front line Garda&iacute; to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility, and in a more focused fashion, particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.  As a result of the Programme, communities have benefited from increased Garda visibility and increased patrolling hours which has enabled  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver an improved policing service to the public.<\/p><p>In tandem with the rationalisation of stations this Government has been determined to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources to deliver highly-mobile and responsive Garda patrols in both rural and urban communities.  Since 2012, we have invested almost &euro;29 million in renewing the Garda fleet to support front line Garda responses. So far this year 370 new vehicles have come on stream including new specialised vehicles.  I have announced  today  the allocation of a further &euro;5.3m to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the purchase of a further 260 vehicles between now and the end of the year.  This new investment will provide the Garda&iacute; with additional high powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, cars for surveillance and covert operations, motor cycles for high visibility road policing and vehicles for public order policing. This investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue  under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides an additional &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles over the life time of the Plan. The increased budget allocation for 2016 will also facilitate additional funding for Garda surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing.<\/p><p>This substantial level of investment will be accompanied by the continued renewal of Garda personnel with 600 new Garda to be recruited next year on top of the 550 to be recruited by the end of this year.

The type of work involved is intended to assist the community and the scheme is involved with a large number of charitable organisations and local community groups.<\/p>  <p>  A recent report on the Community Return Scheme has showed that there were 232 persons released in the first year of the Scheme, from October 2011 to end September 2012. Of this group the report highlighted that as at the end of year 2013, 91% of those involved in the Scheme had not returned to custody.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to Community Return, a Community Support Scheme has also been introduced to reduce recidivism rates of short term prisoners by arranging for additional support structures post release and by providing for a more structured form of temporary release.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that they do not collate such information in the format requested by the Deputy.  However, the Irish Prison Service Recidivism study for 2008 shows that 1,809 persons out of a total of 5,489 that were released in that year went on to re-offend within the first 6 months of release.

Garda management keep this distribution under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of resources.<\/p>  <p>  I have been informed that the area in question is policed by both Castlepollard and Granard Garda sub-Districts. I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that, as of the 31 August 2015 the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 4 Garda&iacute; assigned to Castlepollard and 27 assigned to Granard Garda stations.  The work of these Garda&iacute; is supported by 2 Garda Reserve members and 3 civilian staff.  The work of these Garda&iacute; is   augmented when necessary by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB). Organised criminal activity is currently being targeted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na across a number of fronts, including the use of focused intelligence-led operations by specialist units such as the Drugs and Organised Crime Unit and CAB. <\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Justice and Equality I am determined to tackle rural crime and to ensure that those on the frontline have the legislation and resources to do so effectively.  My approach is focussed on two key objectives; strengthening the law to get tougher on serious and repeat offenders, principally through the  Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill, 2015, and investing in the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enforce that law effectively through the significantly enhanced Garda resources which the Government is making available. <\/p>  <p>  Insofar as the specific policing measures in place to tackle burglary are concerned, the Garda strategy to counter burglaries and related crimes has been coordinated under Operation Fiacla, which is the national operation targeting burglary using an intelligence and analysis-led approach.  This sustained Garda campaign against burglary, which incorporates burglary related Operations in each Garda Division has resulted in many successes in disrupting those involved in this type of criminality. As of 31 August 2015, Operation Fiacla had led to 14,381 arrests, with 8,181 charges being brought against suspects.<\/p>  <p>  I am also in ongoing contact with the Commissioner with a view to ensuring that the policing response is as effective as can be and that Garda operations take account of evolving trends and patterns in burglary offences.  In this regard, I have made specific funding available for new specialised vehicles and technology  to support an enhanced operational response by Garda&iacute; to current and emerging crime threats, including burglary offences being committed by highly-mobile gangs.<\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to the ongoing recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute;, and to this end the first intake since 2009 of new recruits commenced training at the Garda College, Templemore, in September of last year. To date there has been four intakes of Garda Trainees into the Garda College, giving a total intake of 400.  A further 150 recruits will enter the college by year end, bringing total recruitment of Garda Trainees to 550.  So far 295 of the new Garda Trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. On attestation, new Probationer Garda&iacute; are assigned to Garda stations throughout the country by the Garda Commissioner, where they are deployed to mainstream policing duties. I am assured by Garda management that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute;.<\/p>  <p>  The ongoing recruitment of new Garda&iacute; is crucial for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the safety of communities throughout Ireland and I was pleased to announce that the budget allocation for 2016 will allow for the further recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; in 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000073#WRQ02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":881,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000073#WRQ02550"},{"type":"question","counter":882,"qnumday":418,"qnumall":"[36111\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000073#WRQ02600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding an application for a visa  by a family (details supplied) in County Louth; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1069","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":883,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that a visa application was received in the Irish Visa Office in Abuja on 5 October, 2015 and is currently being examined.

The programme also provides a part time day care rate of &euro;80 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods.  Places are approved for 50 weeks.  Eligibility for the CEC programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.<br \/><br \/>- The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, which provides childcare places, including part-time and after-school places, to qualifying Solas or Education and Training Boards (ETB) trainees or students for the duration of their courses.  Eligibility for the CETS programme is determined by the Department of Education and Skills.

From September 2016, I am expanding the ECCE programme to allow children to access free pre-school from the time they are 3 years of age until they start primary school.  There will be three intakes of eligible children during the pre-school year: children who reach the age of 3 between April and August can access the programme from September; children who reach the age of 3 between September and December can access the programme from January; and children who reach the age of 3 between January and March can access the programme from April. <\/p><p>The number of weeks of free pre-school a child will benefit from will depend on their birth date and on the age at which they start primary school.

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice. <\/p><p>Immunisation is regarded as one of the safest and most cost-effective of health care interventions.  The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  The vaccine is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school.  This is in accordance with the recommendation received from the NIAC which indicated that the HPV vaccine should be offered on an annual basis to all girls aged 12.  The advice, based on public health considerations and supported by the cost-effectiveness analysis, is that HPV vaccines confer maximum benefit both individually and on a population basis if administered prior to HPV exposure.  The vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.<\/p><p>In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  There are 2 licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland (Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;<\/sup>).  Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme.  Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>is a medicinal product which has been authorised for use across the European Union since September 2006 following a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) at the European Medicines Agency (EMA).<\/p><p>While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  This is done by both monitoring of individual adverse reaction reports received by competent authorities across Europe (including the HPRA) and Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (i.e. license holder) for the vaccine on a regular basis.<\/p><p>As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting ().  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.  <\/p><p>As of the 9 October 2015, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has received 921 reports of suspected adverse reactions\/events notified in association with the use of HPV vaccines (Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>918 and Cervarix<sup>&reg;<\/sup>3).  The vast majority of reports received by the HPRA regarding both Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>and Cervarix vaccines to date have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects for the vaccines, as described in the product information. <\/p><p>The EMA has commenced a review of the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine &quot;<i>to further clarify aspects of their safety profile<\/i>,&quot; although the agency points out that this review &quot;<i>does not question that the benefits of HPV vaccines outweigh their risks<\/i>.&quot;<\/p><p>The HPRA is participating in the Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee's (PRAC) review of HPV vaccines to clarify aspects of their safety profile.  As for all licensed medicines, the safety of these vaccines is monitored by the PRAC (an EU level drug safety committee) where the HPRA is actively represented and contributes.<\/p><p>The current review will look at available data with a focus on rare reports of two conditions: complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS, a chronic pain condition affecting the limbs) and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS, a condition where the heart rate increases abnormally after sitting or standing up, causing symptoms such as dizziness and fainting, as well as headache, chest pain and weakness).  Reports of these conditions in young women who have received a HPV vaccine have been previously considered during routine safety monitoring by the PRAC but a causal link between them and the vaccines was not established.  Both conditions can occur in non-vaccinated individuals and it is considered important to further review if the number of cases reported with HPV vaccine is greater than would be expected.  The outcome of the PRAC review is anticipated before the end of this year.<\/p><p>In addition the EMA is currently evaluating data from a on the safety of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines, Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;<\/sup>.  The study conducted jointly by the French medicines agency (ANSM) and the French national health insurance fund (CNAMTS) compared the incidence of autoimmune conditions in girls given HPV vaccines with the incidence in girls not given the vaccines.  <\/p><p>The EMA have advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of these vaccines.  Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;<\/sup>in accordance with the current product information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000074#WRR04700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Dementia Strategy","counter":957,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000074#WRR04800"},{"type":"question","counter":958,"qnumday":446,"qnumall":"[36170\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000074#WRR04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is aware of a submission from the Alzheimer Society of Ireland regarding the need to support persons with dementia to live at home for as long as possible; and the Government policy and his plans in this regard.","asker":"1203","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":959,"content":"<p>The overarching policy of this Government is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.

It is in this context that the HSE requires all safety incidents to be reported, managed and investigated. <\/p><p>The HSE's National Safety Incident Management Policy 2014 and the Guidelines for Systems Analysis Investigation of Incident and Complaints 2012 were developed by the Executive to protect patients and ensure that robust investigations are carried out.

I would like to advise the Deputy that, to 13 October, the number of people registered in 2015 was 1,495 and when this is compared to the same period in 2014, the number of people registered is 967 - this represents an increase of 55%.<\/p>  <p>  The latest figures from the NMBI indicate that they have 1,980 open applications, of which:<\/p>  <p>  -  1,348 have documentation outstanding (61%);<\/p>  <p>  -  81 have been approved and a fee is awaited by the NMBI; and<\/p>  <p>  -  168 further cases are waiting review.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has approved the filling of 16 posts and temporary measures have been put in place to ensure all applications received are dealt with in a timely manner.  NMBI informed the department on the 24 September that there are currently no backlogs in processing the post.  <\/p>  <p>  Seven adaptation programmes have been held for the nursing home sector since 2014 in order to allow overseas nurses to register in Ireland. One adaption programme has commenced and a further programme is scheduled later in the year. I understand that five adaption programmes will be held in 2016. At 23 September 2015, some 405 places have been made available so far on these courses.<\/p>  <p>  The NMBI has approved on a pilot basis, a new aptitude test with RCSI as an alternative method to assess candidates for registration. Nurses are currently being advised of the availability of this test and all who have a letter for adaptation are being contacted to advise them of this development. This test will be provided in November 2015 when a minimum cohort of 25 nurses is secured. Successful candidates will be recommended for registration to NMBI by RCSI.<\/p>  <p>  On 8 October 2015, a new overseas call centre service was launched by NMBI in response to the significant increase in applications for registration from overseas nurses and midwives. NHI and other key stakeholders were informed of the new overseas call centre service on 7 October. The website has been updated to inform the wider audience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000078#WRV03700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":1186,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000078#WRV03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1187,"qnumday":523,"qnumall":"[36609\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000078#WRV03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when children will be called for tuberculosis, BCG, vaccinations which have been missed due to the shortage of vaccines; if priority will be given to children who missed out on the vaccine as infants, and in primary school, as is the case in the west of Ireland, given that there is an upper age limit for the BCG vaccine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

There is only one licensed supplier of BCG vaccine to Ireland and to other countries within the EU.  The vaccine has not been available since the end of April 2015 and babies born after the last day of April have not been immunised.  Based on an estimated 5,500 - 6,000 babies born every month this means that 33,000 - 36,000 babies are due to be vaccinated.  The licensed supplier has informed the HSE that the BCG vaccine will be delivered into Ireland in late October.  The HSE will arrange appointments for vaccination clinics when the BCG vaccine supply is received.<\/p>  <p>  Since this problem became apparent, the HSE National Immunisation Office has been in regular contact with the manufacturer of BCG and with the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) who licenses vaccines in Ireland as well as with other relevant stakeholders.  The HPRA have been seeking to find an alternative supply of BCG that meets safety, quality and effectiveness standards and that could be used in Ireland.  To date no appropriate alternative manufacturer of BCG vaccine has been found.<\/p>  <p>  In early 2015 the HSE asked the HPRA to look at extending the shelf life of BCG vaccine from 12 months to 18 months.  The HPRA reviewed the necessary documentation and agreed to extend the shelf life of any new delivery of BCG vaccine to 18 months.  Any new deliveries of BCG will have an 18 month shelf life.<\/p>  <p>  The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and the National TB Advisory Committee have recommended stopping routine BCG vaccination of newborn babies and instead provide a selective vaccination of babies in high-risk babies groups.  The Department of Health have requested the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to conduct a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) to review the implications of this change.  HIQA commenced a public consultation on proposed changes to the BCG vaccination programme in Ireland on September 9th 2015.  The HTA will be available by the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  Tuberculosis (TB) is a notifiable disease under the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 452 of 2011).  In 2014, 328 cases of TB were notified to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, giving a national TB notification rate of 7.1 per 100,000, the lowest rate reported since surveillance commenced.  According to the World Health Organisation, the definition of a low incidence TB country is one with a national TB notification rate of less than 10 cases per 100,000, Ireland is in this category.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland the number of cases of TB has been falling and there were no cases of TB in young children in 2014.  Most European countries, including the UK, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland do not give BCG vaccine to all babies.  Babies are not at risk of TB because of the delay in getting BCG vaccine in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  BCG vaccination is usually given to newborn babies, but can also be given to older children and adults who are considered to be at risk of developing TB.<\/p>  <p>  Resolving the issue of the shortage of BCG remains a priority for me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000078#WRV04100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":1191,"qnumday":525,"qnumall":"[36611\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000078#WRV04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason some primary, community and continuing care, PCCC, services are still calling newborn children for the tuberculosis, BCG, vaccine while children are left on a two-year waiting list in other PCCC areas; if the procurement and distribution of vaccines has been centralised, as advised, following previous problems; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1192,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.

The Taoiseach and all Ministers agreed to work across Government Departments to achieve better health for the Irish population.

Both groups have been proactive in relation to obesity.  One of the agreed programmes is the development of a National Physical Activity Plan for Ireland. My Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in partnership with a number of other key stakeholders have developed this draft Plan to encourage greater levels of physical activity by everyone living in Ireland and encouraging more children to be active will be a key focus of attention.

The SDGs are universally applicable and will guide the actions of all countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty and hunger and achieve sustainable development over the next fifteen years.<\/p>  <p>  The Summit was a proud moment for Ireland, which played a central role in helping to deliver this historic agreement. The successful role of our diplomatic team in New York, as co-facilitators to the final round of negotiations, was widely acknowledged.  Ireland had already played a key role in framing the parameters of the new agenda at both EU and UN levels.  The SDGs are universally applicable, and all countries will need to take action.

Over the past four years, we have protected and stabilised budget allocations, at a time of extraordinary economic difficulty.

As our economic recovery gains momentum and becomes more widely established, we can now begin delivering on that commitment.  <\/p>  <p>  The Budget for 2016, announced on 14 October, involves the first substantial increase in the aid budget in seven years.  For next year, we have provided a total of over &euro;640 million in ODA, an increase of &euro;40 million, or almost 7% on the 2015 level.

In particular, the role of thousands of Irish missionaries in Africa, over a long period of time and in extraordinarily challenging circumstances, deserves special mention.<\/p>  <p>  Irish people continue to play a critical role in the fight to eliminate poverty, hunger and injustice in developing countries.  Their work continues to make a significant difference to long term development efforts and to emergency humanitarian action globally.  <\/p>  <p>  An important element of overseas development and aid work is volunteering.  In 2013, the Government, as part of its commitment to volunteering, launched the Irish Aid Volunteering Initiative, which recognised the huge contribution that Irish volunteers have long made.  This Initiative aims to strengthen support for overseas volunteering &ndash; from the earliest stage when a person first considers volunteering to the volunteer&rsquo;s return home.<\/p>  <p>  Comhl&aacute;mh, the Irish Association of Development Workers and Volunteers, with support from Irish Aid, the Government&rsquo;s overseas development programme, undertook a survey into International Volunteering in 2013 from Ireland.  Based on this survey of Volunteer Sending Agencies, it is estimated that there were more than 1,700 Irish volunteers involved in development work in 2013.  <\/p>  <p>  The survey showed that volunteers from Ireland worked in 47 countries, including those countries with which Ireland has developed a longstanding relationship through Irish Aid.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p><p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.

The primary staffing schedule currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils, with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools. The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. My Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.).

Two implementation reports have been produced to date on this programme which provide the detail sought by the Deputy in terms of overall participation, uptake of particular measures and labour market status of affected populations of both redundant workers and young persons not in employment, education or training. Copies of these reports are being issued to the Deputy and published on the dedicated website www.egf.ie <\/p><p>  These implementation reports do not contain financial data.  The level of final approved expenditure on EGF programmes is only known when all claims are duly made by the various service providers such as SOLAS, Education and Training Boards, Local Enterprise Offices, Higher Education Institutions and the Department of Social Protection who are generally carrying such expenditure under their own budgets.  Though interim claims may be made, it is usual for claims to be made to the Department for relevant EGF services in their entirety at the end of the programme. 60% of approved eligible EGF expenditure is provided by the EU and the balance is provided through national sources including voted Department expenditures and the National Training Fund.  As the LTAI EGF programme ends on 19 September 2016, expenditure will be eligible until that date with the exception of third level expenditure which may be eligible in certain instances until 19 March 2017. A final report will be presented to the European Commission by my Department on the implementation of the EU financial contribution of &euro;2.49m by 19 March 2017.  <\/p><p>  My Department submitted an EGF application for a programme of measures in support of 108 workers made redundant at the PWA International Ltd.

The application is currently undergoing inter-service consultation within the European Commission and, if approved by the College of Commissioners, must also be duly approved by the EU Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. Similar services are currently being provided to the redundant PWAI workers as are being provided under the LTAI EGF programme though these are being funded entirely through national sources in anticipation of subsequent EU approval.

The details of the particular case highlighted in the Question have been forwarded to the Department of Social Protection for further consideration.<\/p><p>In order to qualify for rent supplement, a person must have been residing in private rented accommodation or accommodation for homeless persons or an institution (or any combination of these) for a period of 183 days within the preceding 12 months of the date of claim for rent supplement. A person may also qualify for rent supplement where an assessment of housing need has been carried out and the person is deemed by a housing authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support. In all other cases, a person who wishes to apply for rent supplement is referred, in the first instance, for an assessment of eligibility for social housing support by the housing authority. Only when the person has been assessed as being eligible for and in need of social housing support, does the person become eligible for consideration for rent supplement. There is no entitlement to rent supplement pending the completion of this assessment. <\/p><p>I understand that it is the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s policy that an assessment of eligibility for social housing support should generally be carried out by the relevant local housing authority in the area where a claim to rent supplement is made and the person intends to reside. This ensures that the relevant local authorities are made aware of and can take responsibility for the long-term housing needs of rent supplement tenants living within their administrative area. This reflects both the responsibility of local authorities in providing long-term housing supports and the temporary income support nature of rent supplement. <\/p><p>It is in this context that the Housing Assistant Payment (HAP) scheme, which is operational in the South Dublin County Council area, is being introduced on a pilot basis across local authorities. The implementation of the HAP scheme is a key Government priority and a major pillar of the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020<\/i>. HAP provides for the transfer of responsibility for long term recipients of rent supplement who have a recognised housing need from the Department of Social Protection to the local authority sector, thus bringing all long-term social housing supports provided by the State together under the local authority system.<\/p><p>To be eligible for HAP, a person must first apply for and be approved for social housing support by the relevant local authority. Upon its introduction in a local authority area, HAP will replace rent supplement for those with a long-term housing need and who qualify for social housing support; rent supplement will no longer be an option for applicants in such cases. If a household is already on the local authority&rsquo;s housing list and currently in receipt of rent supplement, the household will be eligible for HAP. Such households, who are in receipt of rent supplement in local authorities areas where HAP is operational, are incrementally transferring from rent supplement to HAP support. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000084#WRBB01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":1545,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000084#WRBB01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1546,"qnumday":647,"qnumall":"[36290\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000084#WRBB02000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"further to a motion passed at a meeting of Meath County Council (details supplied) in October 2015, if he will request An Bord Plean&aacute;la to defer any decision in relation to this matter; if so, if he will do so immediately; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1547,"content":"<p>An Bord Plean&aacute;la is the independent statutory body assigned responsibility for the determination of planning appeals and certain other matters under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, as amended, and for the determination of applications for strategic infrastructure development including major road and railway projects.

Consultations on technical and environmental aspects to the incorporation of the additional area as part of the SDZ have been recently concluded and I expect to bring to the matter to Government in the very near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000084#WRBB04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1092"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tenant Purchase Scheme Administration","counter":1578,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000085#WRCC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1579,"qnumday":658,"qnumall":"[36350\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000085#WRCC00300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to introduce a new scheme to replace the 1995 tenant purchase scheme terminated in December 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1099","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":1580,"qnumday":659,"qnumall":"[36352\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000085#WRCC00400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the introduction date for the tenant purchase scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":1581,"qnumday":681,"qnumall":"[36100\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000085#WRCC00500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when a new tenant purchase scheme will be introduced for council tenants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1582,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 658, 659 and 681 together.<\/p><p>The necessary Regulations for the new scheme for the tenant purchase of existing local authority houses along incremental purchase lines are at an advanced stage and are expected to be finalised and signed by end October 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000085#WRCC00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1092"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":1583,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000085#WRCC00700"},{"type":"question","counter":1584,"qnumday":660,"qnumall":"[36419\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000085#WRCC00800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the reports presently underway into alleged planning irregularities being carried out by his Department; the locations under investigation; and by whom they are being carried out; if he has received completed reports, and the date on which he has received them; when will they be published; if there is any reason they cannot be published immediately; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1069","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1585,"content":"<p>There are no reports of the kind referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question underway in my Department.

Rents for houses were 6.4% higher, while apartment rents were 7.6% higher than in the same quarter of 2014.<\/p>  <p>  These annual rates of increase were driven mainly by the Dublin market. Overall, in the 12 months to the end of Q2 2015, rents were higher by 9.2% in Dublin (with house rents up by 8.8% and apartment rents higher by 9.4%). Annual growth in rents for the market outside Dublin was more subdued. In the 12 months to the end of Q2 2015, rents were higher by 5.8% (with house rents up by 5.8% and apartment rents higher by 5.9%).   <\/p>  <p>  A shortage of supply is at the heart of rising rents and the Government is addressing this on a number of fronts. Construction 2020: A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector, published last year, is aimed at addressing issues in the property and construction sectors and ensuring that any bottlenecks that might impede the sector in meeting residential and non-residential demand are addressed. Construction 2020 also commits to identifying and implementing further improvements to the planning system to facilitate appropriate development.   <\/p>  <p>  Addressing the supply shortfall in housing will take time but in the period since the publication of Construction 2020, some welcome signs of recovery in the sector have become evident. Particularly notable in this regard is the increase in the number of house completions in 2014 to 11,016 units nationally &ndash; an increase of 33% on the 2013 figure. The latest figures for new house completions show that 8,914 units were completed to the end of September 2015, up 14% on the corresponding figure for 2014.   <\/p>  <p>  Social housing is a key priority for the Government, as evidenced by the &euro;2.9 billion committed to under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan. In Budget 2016 investment in housing infrastructure has again been given priority with exchequer investment of almost &euro;811 million across a range of housing programmes. In addition, local authorities will also fund a range of housing services from their own resources to the value of over &euro;112 million, bringing the total Housing provision in 2016 to &euro;923 million. This will significantly address the needs of households on the housing waiting lists and provide flexibility to meet potential future demand with over 17,000 households to be accommodated in 2016.   <\/p>  <p>  On Budget day Minister Kelly and I also announced the approval of site locations for over 500 new social housing units which are to be delivered through a public private partnership (PPP) programme. This social housing is to be developed at six sites in co-operation with the local authorities in each area, with a capital value of approximately &euro;100 million. There is provision for a total investment of &euro;300 million in social housing through the public private partnership model and, overall, the programme is expected to deliver 1,500 social housing units. <\/p>  <p>  NAMA is aiming to deliver a target of 20,000 residential units before the end of 2020 with 90 per cent of these units to be in the greater Dublin area. Achieving this new target by the end of 2020 means delivering on average 80 new housing units every week, across some 100 active sites. An Affordable Rental Pilot Scheme, which was announced as part of Budget 2016, is currently being developed in my Department.\u00a0 The sum of &euro;10 million has been made available from the proceeds of the sale of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann for the scheme, which I expect to be rolled out in 2016.   <\/p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, I am continuing to work on proposals to address the issue of rising rents. The regulation of rent raises many complex economic and legal issues and I have to be satisfied that any measures proposed are balanced and have the desired effect on the rental market while being fair to landlords and tenants alike. Ultimately, any decision in relation to this issue is a matter for Government and it is my intention to bring final proposals to Government for decision as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000085#WRCC02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1092"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Tax Rates","counter":1598,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000085#WRCC02200"},{"type":"question","counter":1599,"qnumday":665,"qnumall":"[36522\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000085#WRCC02300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to include vehicle registration tax Category C vehicles for the CO2 emission based rate of tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1074","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1600,"content":"<p>As outlined by the Revenue Commissioners, Category C Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) vehicles include larger commercial vehicles, agricultural tractors, and buses with a minimum of 10 seats including the driver&rsquo;s seat.

The targets set and the funding allocated are being invested in a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes by local authorities, designed to accommodate 25% of those currently on the housing waiting lists.<\/p><p>The Rental Accommodation Scheme continues to provide a targeted approach to meeting long-term rental housing assistance needs through the development of medium or long-term contractual arrangements with private accommodation providers. In line with the targets set for social housing delivery, the number of additional units targeted under the Rental Accommodation Scheme nationally to 2017 is 4,000, with 2,000 of these to be provided in 2015.<\/p><p>Also in line with the targets, I announced a major social housing construction programme on 5 May 2015, with &euro;312m investment covering all 31 local authorities and with over 1,700 housing units to be built.  In July I announced a further investment of over &euro;180 million to deliver over 1,100 new social housing units. This included over &euro;150 million in approvals under the Capital Assistance Scheme which supports Approved Housing Bodies in the provision of new housing units for homeless persons, for the elderly and for people with disabilities. Details of the projects approved in May and July are available on my Department's website at the following links:.<\/p><p>Through the annual estimates process, Exchequer capital funding of over &euro; 189million is available to local authorities under these initiatives this year, with a further &euro; 48.6 million being self-funded by local authorities from Local Property Tax.  To date in 2015, local authorities have drawn down almost &euro;39 million, while a further &euro;13.8 million has be en self-funded by local authorities from their Local Property Tax resources.  In relation to the Rental Accommodation Scheme, some &euro;135m in Exchequer funding is available this year, with a further &euro;40m being self-funded by local authorities from built-up RAS reserves. To date in 2015, local authorities have drawn down some &euro;69.3m in Exchequer funding while a further &euro;5.5m has been self-funded by local authorities from those RAS reserves to date.  I expect a significant amount of further funding to be drawn down by local authorities under these initiatives in the final quarter of 2015, which is traditionally the time of greatest funding drawdown by local authorities.<\/p><p>Delivery by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies is being closely monitored by my Department. Minister of State Coffey and I met with local authority Chief Executives and Directors of Housing recently to review progress in this regard. The local authorities indicate that the overall target of 7,000 additional social housing units in 2015 will be achieved. This will include maximising the number of vacant social housing units to be brought back into productive use this year. Last year local authorities returned 2,300 vacant units under my Department&rsquo;s capital programme and I anticipate a further 2,500 such units to be made available this year to those on waiting lists. <\/p><p>Given the time-lag between approval and delivery in terms of construction projects, a successful programme to remediate vacant units, as well as the acquisition by local authorities of properties through turn-key developments and other purchases, are important parts of social housing delivery this year. These areas are being advanced strongly by local authorities, alongside the advancement of the construction projects that I have sanctioned this year. I am confident that by utilising all delivery mechanisms under current and capital expenditure programmes, local authorities will continue to deliver social housing targets in 2015, in line with the Social Housing Strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000085#WRCC03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Event Licensing Regulations","counter":1611,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000085#WRCC03450"},{"type":"question","counter":1612,"qnumday":670,"qnumall":"[35948\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000085#WRCC03600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"for an update on the review of the event licensing framework; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1613,"content":"<p>The Event Licensing Review Group conducted its deliberations on the event licensing legislative regime over the period October 2014 to March 2015 and submitted recommendations in April 2015.

The 2007 Tyre Regulations were focused on matching what was placed on the market with what came off the market as waste. If the required improvement did not happen, it was made clear to the tyre industry that the system would be reviewed and replaced with a full Producer Responsibility  Initiative (PRI)   model. <\/p>  <p>  As part of a wider Ministerial review of producer responsibility matters, a specific module was devoted to structural and environmental effectiveness of all aspects of the current system for managing waste tyres. The results of this examination   were stark. The report, published for consultation in November 2013 and in final form in April 2014, found:<\/p>  <p>-    A non-compliance rate with the Tyre Regulations of 46%,<\/p>  <p>  -  A lack of consistent and accurate data,<\/p>  <p>-  That the current system was not tracking data flows well, and<\/p>  <p>-  Between 25% and 50% of waste tyres were not accounted for.   <\/p>  <p>  Following extensive discussions with the tyre industry, I announced my decision to establish a full PRI scheme for Tyres and Waste Tyres in Ireland on 30 January 2015. The new scheme will be operated by Repak with a registration and reporting role for the WEEE Register Society. Since my decision, significant progress has been made in discussions with the tyre industry.   <\/p>  <p>  Distance sellers, i.e. those placing tyres on the Irish market but located outside the State, will   have exactly the same obligations as any operator based in Ireland so the suggestion that operators based outside the jurisdiction will have a competitive advantage over their Irish counterparts is unfounded. The distance seller approach has been very successfully used under existing arrangements for distance sellers of electrical and electronic equipment.   <\/p>  <p>  The 300% + increase in the cost of tyre disposal referred to in the Question, is a suggestion being circulated by elements within the tyre industry, but is also unfounded. The model that I am proposing will formalise a charge that tyre retailers already apply. The fact is that the fundamental pillars of any successful PRI structure elsewhere in the EU are a robust financial model, supported by an adequate visible Environmental Management Charge (vEMC). This approach ensures that waste tyres are fully accounted for and properly treated without public funds being called on to remove the blight of illegal stockpiles across the country.  Members of the public currently pay an environmental charge when purchasing new tyres but often their contribution is not being used for the intended purpose and waste tyres leak from the system, often ending up stockpiled illegally and causing a   blight on our environment. <\/p>  <p>  Just at the point where discussions on the financial model and the level of the vEMC were about to commence, the Irish Tyre Industry Association (ITIA) withdrew from the Tyres Working Group. Despite their withdrawal, and the earlier withdrawal of ITWRA, my Department will continue to work on the introduction of a full PRI scheme. Both the ITIA and the ITWRA continue to receive all Tyres Working Group related correspondence and I have urged them on several occasions to re-join the process and re-engage. It is a matter for both organisations to accept this invitation and I would again appeal to both organisations to embrace the opportunity to influence the shape of the new structures, particularly in relation to those key issues around funding and structure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000085#WRCC04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Services Funding","counter":1620,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000085#WRCC04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1621,"qnumday":673,"qnumall":"[35962\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000085#WRCC04500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will consider a continuance of the capped charge for Irish Water's household billing for persons of pensionable age, or those who would satisfy a certain means and household composition assessment similar to that applied to the household benefits package or the fuel allowance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1199","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":1622,"qnumday":674,"qnumall":"[35963\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102000085#WRCC04600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the current proposals within his Department with specific regard to the future of the cap on household water charges that is currently in place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1199","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1623,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 673 and 674 together.<\/p>  <p>  A revised water charges regime was announced by the Government on 19 November 2014.

The increased uplift to 50% will increase the competitiveness of HAP homeless households in the private rented market and increase their likelihood of transitioning.
