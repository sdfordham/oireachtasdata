Abandoned shops dot the streetscape while remaining businesses struggle to entice customers and to keep their doors open.  Government public relations are promoting the slow signs of recovery.  However, it is obvious to many of us that outside the M50, towns are struggling under an incessant stream of closures.  It is a vicious circle of reduced spending, declining trade and a move to out-of-town shopping centres, leading to what I call a hollowing-out of towns.<\/p><p>Fewer shops mean reduced footfall on the streets and reduced spending, leading to further closures in a downward spiral.  In short, Irish towns are in crisis.<\/p><p> The rich traditions of town life stretching back centuries, from farmers' marts to a vibrant social life, have been and can be again an integral part of the fabric of Irish society.  Towns have played and can continue to play a pivotal economic role in Ireland, providing local entrepreneurs with a place to set up businesses and provide local jobs through direct and indirect employment.  A lively town centre is one that has a commercial, social and cultural space, with vibrant local businesses at its heart.  Strong local businesses create employment, invest in the civic amenities of towns, provide revenue for local authorities and sponsor local community groups, sports and cultural organisations.  Without them, towns will continue to die.  As is the case with many Deputies, I know that this is true of my constituency.  Banagher, Clara, Birr, Tullamore, Daingean, Kilcormac and so on have traditionally been the centres of their hinterlands, but they are under immense pressure to retain that status.<\/p><p> Ironically, these threats to the future of towns as vibrant economic and social hubs come at a time when broader demographic changes mean that towns are growing in importance.  Over the decades Irish society has been transformed from a predominantly rural society into an urban one.  Some 62% of the population now live in urban areas compared with just 42% in 1951, bringing Ireland closer to the European norm.  Despite these population increases, towns face a grave challenge to their position as hubs of activity.  The systematic closure of 140 Garda stations, the threats faced by An Post to its future viability and the policy of major State-supported banks in withdrawing their services and closing down branches have left numerous towns reeling from the loss of critical local services.  On top of this, the Government is taking the axe to the democratic institutions of town councils which give these communities a focal point to fight their corner.  All the while, the changing nature of commerce and the rise of Internet shopping present new problems for towns to tackle as the old models of business are put under pressure.<\/p><p> In order to rise to the challenges presented by this crisis, it is imperative that we put in place a legislative framework for towns to develop a viable, comprehensive strategy to revitalise their centres.  This Bill is a step towards that aim.  It is drawn from Streets Ahead, a Fianna F&aacute;il policy document specifically designed to revitalise town centres throughout the country.  It would empower and charge local authorities to establish town teams to lead the way in creating an holistic plan to tackle the problems facing each town.  Under the Bill, each town would have a team drawn from business, the Civil Service, politics, the Garda and civic groups to evaluate the issues facing it.  While the broader difficulties are nationwide problems, they manifest in different ways.  As opposed to the unwieldy top-down approach, a localised team for each town would allow people to identify their own needs.  The teams would be tasked with developing individualised town revitalisation plans with clear targets and timeframes encompassing various facets that I will now seek to outline.<\/p><p> A key issue for the teams would be the unsustainable financial burden placed on businesses and consumers that is crippling commerce in towns.  The archaic commercial rates system in Ireland is a Victorian invention in an Internet age.  Businesses faced with a downward spiral of trade are being hit with rate bills that are pushing them over the edge.  Retailers in towns are being burdened with financing local authorities to an unsustainable level, with local authorities deriving 28% of their finance from commercial rates.  For entrepreneurs hoping to set up new businesses or existing retailers fighting to keep their heads above water, the commercial rates system is the straw that is breaking their backs and rendering their efforts financially impossible.  It is imperative that the Government and local authorities work together to establish a revamped system that would create breathing space for retailers in financial difficulty, incentivise new businesses to set up in towns and form a sustainable base for local authority finances.  Rates should also reflect the need to attract businesses away from the environmentally and socially unsustainable out-of-town shopping centre model.<\/p><p> Introducing flexibility for local authorities to use discretion in reducing or delaying commercial rate charges against new businesses would be a vital power that would enable towns to attract fledging businesses and new ideas and foster a greater sense of entrepreneurship across the country.  As old business models change in the age of Internet shopping, fostering new enterprises to fit new demands will be increasingly important in keeping the main streets of towns alive with commerce.  In the United Kingdom, for example, councils have the power to exempt struggling businesses from paying rates and provide a 50% mandatory rates exemption.  Empowering local authorities to alleviate the burden of rates in specific key sites in towns for new businesses would serve as an incentive for innovative retailers to set up shop and create local jobs.<\/p><p> In order to assist town teams nationally, a specific inability to pay clause should be introduced via an amendment to the Valuation Act.  This clause which is standard in valuation procedures in the United Kingdom would be a key measure to help to alleviate pressure on struggling businesses.  It is also a central demand of the Irish Employers for Affordable Rates, IEAR, group and its vision for a reformed rates valuation process.  An overhauled commercial rates system should be cognisant of the turnover and commercial rent specific to a particular business and its location.<\/p><p> In order to balance the financial costs of incentivising new business with rates relief, a special commercial rates surcharge should be levied on out-of-town shopping centres.  This surcharge would encourage businesses to locate in environmentally and socially sustainable town centres.  The additional charge would reflect the parking advantages enjoyed by out-of-town centre developments.  A similar charge has been implemented in Northern Ireland since April 2012 through the introduction of an additional tax at a 15% rate which is expected to yield &pound;5 million per annum.<\/p><p> A major obstacle to enticing greater numbers into towns is the parking charges structure.  The added costs and hassle of parking are encouraging people to flock to out-of-town centres where there is free parking rather than to the traditional hearts of our communities.  The additional costs of parking, the wide variations between local authorities, the expensive fees imposed for overstaying allotted times and the dreaded prospect of clamping have all combined to deter people from shopping in many towns.  Local authorities have grown accustomed to using parking charges solely as a revenue-raising mechanism rather than viewing them as an impediment to business.  In effect, parking charges are an additional cost to customers, penalising them for shopping in towns.  Under the Bill, town teams would be entrusted with tackling this issue head on.  A number of steps can be taken to reduce parking costs and encourage greater numbers into towns, for example, a review of the parking fees structure in out-of-town centre developments, a new graded parking fees structure and payment methods, special parking offers to encourage town centre visits and a published parking cost league.<\/p><p>Many town councils are already taking action to address this problem.  Town teams can build on this progress and open up towns to greater numbers.<\/p><p> Towns are about more than shopping.  They are the social and cultural hubs of communities, not only for those living in the urban area but those across their hinterlands.  They must be welcoming places for all generations, young and old.  Imaginative planning, cultural initiatives and close co-operation with the Garda to ensure streets are safe and accessible are key components in revitalising towns across the country.<\/p><p> Town teams are tasked with taking the lead across these areas.  Out-of-town centres should be discouraged and the retail planning guidelines reviewed to emphasise the need to focus future development on town centres.  Car parking facilities should be conveniently located to help encourage visits to the town centre.  The layout of towns should encompass enhanced cycling facilities and residential uses near the centre to create environmentally sustainable living practises.<\/p><p> Communities and businesses should have a central role in shaping town development plans to ensure they reflect their knowledge and vision for the future, thereby securing community buy-in to achieving the plan&rsquo;s objectives.  Empty shops should be opened up for pop-up businesses rather than left vacant.  Town teams should also be charged with interacting with NAMA to maximise the use of properties in their towns.<\/p><p> In social terms, new cultural initiatives such as local festivals should be undertaken and market days held to foster a more vibrant street life.  National events such as Open House nights should be built upon at a local level with new twists and ideas suited to each locality.  Town teams are charged with instigating these changes.<\/p><p> To open up streets to all generations, town teams should take the lead in securing Purple Flag street initiatives.  Similar to the Blue Flag given to outstanding clean beaches and the Green Flag awarded to the most eco-friendly schools, the Purple Flag is an accreditation scheme that honours excellence in the appeal and management of a town or city centre.  Working with businesses and the Garda we can ensure that our towns eradicate anti-social behaviour as a barrier to people enjoying their local areas.<\/p><p> As stated, Ireland and Irish towns are in the midst of a fundamental crisis.  However, they do, in my opinion, have the capability not only to survive but to flourish.  This Bill is designed to empower them with the tools to rise up to the grave challenges they face.  Reducing the costs of doing business, making it cheaper and easier for customers to come into towns, creating a more inviting atmosphere and streetscape and restoring the position of towns as cultural, social and economic hubs is vital to revitalising Irish town centres.  We do not want to oversee the hollowing out and desolation of historic towns in every county across Ireland.  We do not want a legacy of vacant shop fronts and derelict buildings.  <\/p><p> Strong action that draws up the deep well of co-operation between communities and business can help create vibrant towns that will thrive into the future.  This Bill is a first step towards this.  I hope that the Government will give it full and fair consideration in the constructive spirit in which it is offered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200004#B00400","speaker":"1101","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385115600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200006#D00200","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1385115600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I join with Deputy Cowen in acknowledging the 50th anniversary of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and, in particular, the warm relationship between our country and the United States due largely, but including other factors, to his Presidency of that country.  One of the highlights for anybody visiting this House is the flag which commemorates the people who died in the American Civil War.<\/p><p>  I thank the Deputy for his Bill and welcome the opportunity to discuss his proposals for the revitalisation of town centres.  Like other Deputies, I have a particular interest in this issue and I am familiar with many of the challenges, particularly those facing small and medium sized retailers operating in town and city centre locations.  The Government has also recognised the importance of local economic development and town governance in its 2012 Action Programme for Effective Local Government - Putting People First.<\/p><p>  Towns play a vital role in the life of communities around Ireland.  We have all seen the effects of urban sprawl and poorly planned out-of-town retail development.  Families all over Ireland are paying for those mistakes through more expensive infrastructure, longer journeys and congestion.  Vibrant town centres contribute to social inclusion and create a common civic space where citizens can interact socially, culturally and economically.  <\/p><p>  Much of what is proposed in Deputy Cowen's Bill has been already done by Government.  For example, new development contribution guidelines were introduced earlier this year requiring planning authorities to put in place reduced development contributions or waivers to support town centre development.  The Deputy referred to the guidelines on retail planning.  These are aimed at promoting and supporting the vitality and viability of city and town centres through the planning system.  The guidelines set out the components of city-town centre strategies and recommend that they be prepared by the planning authorities in conjunction with stakeholders such as retailers, customers, chambers of commerce and community groups in parallel with the local area and county development plans.<\/p><p>  Local authorities have been asked to exercise restraint or, where possible, to reduce commercial rates and local charges to assist local businesses in the current economic climate.  The response to this request has been positive with, for example, 87 out of 88 rating authorities either reducing their annual rate or retaining it at the same level as in 2012.  This follows similar trends in commercial local authority rate charges in 2010 and 2011.<\/p><p>  I would now like to turn specifically to the proposals in Deputy Cowen's Bill.  Many of the functions proposed by the Deputy for inclusion in town revitalisation plans do, I acknowledge, have merit but they do not requite the creation of new structures for implementation.  The Local Government Bill 2013 provides for the establishment of municipal districts to empower councillors to consider many of these issues at a local level, including the development of local area plans.  Elected members will be supported in this by administrative structures within the local authority at a county level in order to make the best use of resources.<\/p><p>  Municipal districts will undertake a range of functions, mainly relating to local matters, including policy and regulatory functions in areas such as the aforementioned local area plans, parking by-laws and charges, as well as casual trading.  The new districts will take actions to promote the interests of the community, including establishing a community fund.  There will also be scope for significant citizen-community engagement and leadership, including consultation with local communities and consideration of community plans and initiatives.  As can be seen, many of these functions overlap with those envisaged for the town teams proposed in Deputy Cowen's Bill and provide for consultation with local communities.  The municipal districts will have significantly greater powers than the current area committees of county councils.  Area committees are consultative or advisory arrangements.  They do not have statutory or decision making powers: municipal districts will.  The members at municipal district level will decide a range of important matters for the district.  They will have full powers in this regard.  They will generally decide matters without reference back to the county council, particularly through the development of local area plans for towns and their environs, subject to consistency with overall policy such as the development plan.<\/p><p>  In relation to the specific functions proposed by the Deputy, I am aware that some local authorities have taken measures to encourage tie establishment of pop-up shops in vacant commercial sites.  Appropriate parking charges are also a matter that can be best determined at a local level with appropriate by-laws.  I would welcome appropriately designed parking charge regimes structured to encourage town centre retail activity while balancing the need to avoid traffic congestion and securing the local authorities' revenue base.  Elected members are best placed to consider these matters in conjunction with their council executives.<\/p><p>  The Government and I are fully supportive of the need for local authorities, within the context of their own economic and development planning processes and the action plan on jobs, to promote actively measures to stimulate and support local investment and associated job protection and creation.<\/p><p> The Local Government Bill 2013 makes provision for the establishment of strategic policy committees which will consider matters of economic development and matters connected to the promotion of, including support for, enterprise.  They will also advise the local authority on these issues.  In addition, local enterprise offices in each local authority will provide a one-stop-shop for small businesses, including micro-enterprise support.  Relevant Departments and national agencies also have a role in ensuring the necessary legislative, policy and financial supports are available to local authorities in this regard.<\/p><p> I note that Barry Deputy Cowen envisages a role for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the proposed town teams to address issues such as anti-social behaviour.  As Deputies will be aware, consultation on such issues takes place through joint policing committees and local policing fora.  I take matters of anti-social behaviour and crime seriously, but I do not believe it would be appropriate to duplicate consultation structures which would unnecessarily take up the time of Garda management and other stakeholders.<\/p><p> We need to be mindful of the ever-present issue of the cost implications for the taxpayer of any new proposed public expenditure measures.  Deputy Barry Cowen's Bill states &quot;the expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of this Act shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas&quot;.  It appears that there could be significant expense implications for the taxpayer, depending on the level of activity of the Deputy's proposed town teams.  I appreciate that the Deputy may not agree with this view.  However, as far as I am aware, he has not yet provided details of the cost of his proposals and there was nothing in his contribution this morning that dealt with the issue.<\/p><p> As the Deputy is aware, due to the serious deterioration in the management of the country's public finances in the past decade, the Government has had to take decisive steps to put our finances back on a sustainable level.  One such step has been the ongoing consolidation and re-empowerment of local government structures to reinforce their role at the centre of strategic decision-making at local community level.  At this time it would be at odds with our overall policy of consolidation to create an extra layer of administration at town level, particularly in putting it on a statutory footing.  It would not be appropriate to place additional financial pressures on householders, through higher local property taxes, and business people, through commercial rates, to finance such structures when scare resources are needed to fund essential local services.  That said, elected members will in the future have discretion to increase or decrease the local property tax rate by up to 15%.  Therefore, it will be a matter for elected members to decide on financing priorities locally rather than having measures such as town teams imposed on them nationally by statute.  The Deputy referred to a new system of rates, but, as far as I can see, that is not included in the Bill and I am addressing what is contained in it.  Flexibility in the case of the local property tax will be a matter for the local elected members.<\/p><p> We will have municipal districts and they will have powers at local level to consult and engage with all local interests.  I am determined that we will do all we can to ensure towns can function to their full potential in order that they can be centres of our social, cultural and economic life.  However, I am satisfied that the municipal districts and other existing structures and guidelines already referred to can perform the functions proposed by the Deputy without the need for creating additional structures.  I realise others will be contributing presently, but I note that everyone in the House has a strong concern for the difficulties many towns throughout the country are facing and we are all keen to ensure we revitalise them.  However, measures have already been taken with development contributions, retail planning guidelines and the proposals for local government reform.  I am satisfied that there is no need for another layer of responsibility as recommended in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200006#D00300","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385116200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Deputy Kevin Humphreys is next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200007#E00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1385116200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I did not expect to be called so quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200007#E00300","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1385116200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>To be clear, under the new rules, after the proposer of the Bill has spoken and the Minister's reply whoever indicates first will speak.

It is a fact that towns and villages are closing down for various reasons, as Deputy Barry Cowen explained.  However, it is not only happening outside the M50.  Villages such as Ringsend, Sandymount and Donnybrook have seen shops closing, a lack of demand and urban structures breaking down.  Dublin is a city of villages and towns, but it is being pulled more into the Liffey Valleys and Dundrums.  The social fabric to which Deputy Barry Cowen referred is to be found in urban Ireland also.<\/p><p>  We will not see the municipal districts to which the Minister of State referred for seven years in Dublin.  We have local area committees, but they do not have the same powers and structures as in rural Ireland.  That issue should be considered and addressed.  We do have local area committees, but in themselves they will not have the same powers and functions as the municipal districts.  I would welcome it if the Minister of State had an opportunity to consider that issue at a later stage.  To ask the residents of Dublin to wait for seven years for a mayor and then to ask them to wait for seven years for municipal districts with the same powers and functions as those in place in rural Ireland will gravely disadvantage the towns and villages of Dublin.  I imagine Deputy Finian McGrath would agree with me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200007#E01000","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1385116200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Both could do with a lift.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200007#E01100","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1385116200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Deputy Barry Cowen referred to the pressures on rates for commercial activities in cities and towns.  Certainly, when I was involved in Dublin City Council, we were able to reduce the rates bill year on year, but it was only a tokenistic reduction because we did not have a sufficient income base to do more.  A councillor cannot really ask for commercial rates to be reduced without showing an alternative income stream.  That is where the property tax comes in.  There will be some sharing of the burden across society and it can be used as a mechanism to stimulate employment and the upgrading of town centres etc., which is vital.<\/p><p>  The idea of town teams is excellent.  Retail Ireland has already brought forward the notion of town teams, as explained by Deputy Barry Cowen.  I am unsure whether the original idea for Retail Ireland came from it or the Deputy.  There is an active and working town team in the Minister of State's area in Limerick which is already starting to gain momentum in revitalising Limerick in co-operation with all of the groups the Minister of State outlined.  Another town team is beginning to get up-and-running in Carlow and I hope it will have the same effect.  These two important pilot schemes being run by Retail Ireland should be closely watched to determine whether the idea can be built on and improved.<\/p><p>  Towns and villages, whether in rural or urban Ireland, are the very fabric of Irish society.  In past decades we have failed these towns and villages.  They will have to change as the pressures and way people purchase goods change.  When I was a younger man, I travelled a good deal in Ireland.  Kinsale was an active commercial town at the time.  I have seen the twon reinvent itself for several years.  We should consider how we can reinvent other towns and villages.  We cannot stop progress, the Internet or change how consumers buy goods.  However, we can consider different elements of change.  Ranelagh in my constituency is a good example.  It is reinventing itself and the increased footfall is manifest in local shops and restaurants.<\/p><p>Consequently, it will be necessary to consider new ways to address this.  I acknowledge it will be necessary to consider the rate burden on these small shops and businesses but it also will be necessary to work with the commercial sector and small businesses to reinvent the towns and villages that have been at the heart of Irish society for many decades.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200007#E01200","speaker":"1033","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385116800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>First, I thank Deputy Cowen for introducing this Bill.  Many towns in my constituency, including Mountmellick, Abbeyleix, Portarlington in particular and Mountrath, are struggling despite the best efforts of local people.  My concern about the Deputy's proposals for the establishment of another structure is that this structure will become part of the problem, in that it will be just another talking shop.  I make this point on foot of my experience as a town and county councillor, as all Members will have seen many such committees and forums being established, each one of which claimed to be the solution to problems.  Unfortunately, however, many of them wind up simply being talking shops.  The reason is they do not have any real powers to make the requisite changes.  The Minister has addressed this but the central problem is the issue of local government.  If one looks at this issue honestly, consecutive Governments of all hues have continued to suck the oxygen from it.  There now is an opportunity to breathe life back into local government and Deputy Cowen's Bill is timely, in that it highlights a number of problems that must be addressed by local government.<\/p><p>  It is necessary to combat the blight of empty commercial premises and to use the current and new structures and, more importantly, to devolve power downwards from central government and even out from county councils to the new municipal districts, which must be made to work.  While Sinn F&eacute;in is not happy with all the proposals in this regard, the party welcomes reform and seeks to ensure this new unit be made work and that real powers are devolved to it.  While many of the aims of the Bill already are in the gift of local government, they require responsibility to be devolved to the new municipal districts.  For example, in the case of the promotion of start-up businesses where there are empty shops, local authorities can and should be allowed to take initiatives, which can include the reduction of rates.  While local authorities can reduce the overall rate by 1%, 2% or 3% and some have done that, a key point is that local authorities and the new municipal districts in particular must be given the power to make decisions for a certain village or town or parts thereof.  For example, there may be a Bridge Street and a Church Street in a particular town and in partnership with local residents and businesses, for certain reasons one may decide to reduce rates in that particular area for a period.  The same is true in respect of start-up businesses.  I made such a proposal a number of years ago at a town council meeting and was almost devoured for having the cheek to propose it but many people now see this must happen.<\/p><p>  The prioritisation of town centre capital developments and prioritising for spending already is within the gift of local authorities.  The Bill has the aim of shifting power away from the county manager to councillors.  Local councillors must be in the driving seat to a greater extent with regard to their ability to prioritise such spending.  In theory, they have that power but the practice can be somewhat different.  Similarly, parking charges are within the gift of local councillors and in many towns, these charges are being reviewed and positive changes are being brought about.  As for the question of crime and low-level antisocial activity, it requires engagement with the Garda, council management and most importantly, the engagement of local residents and local councillors.  It is my firm view that this can be improved and while joint policing committees, JPCs, are a welcome development, they are consultative and those Members who take the trouble to attend them will be aware they can be mere talking shops.  Instead, they should be modelled on the district partnership model in the North.  While I admit it is not perfect either and is not everything I would wish it to be, it certainly has a lot more power.  For example, it has the power to make plans, has powers of oversight and can ensure the police are held to account.  It also ensures such strong partnership, because there must be a strong partnership role between police, local authorities and local residents.  On cultural festivals, while they are happening, there must be more of it.  Obviously, it is of huge importance to local towns and local commercial activity.  In my native county, Laois County Council has been very much to the fore in promoting cultural activities and local events.  It has held some major events this year that even have attracted international attention.<\/p><p>  The issue of local government reform must be taken on board.  It is not fit for purpose at present and it is necessary to try to turn around the position that has arisen in recent years whereby more and more powers have been taken away from it.  Powers must be brought back in respect of planning and housing.  The latter have been taken away by stealth because housing has moved to an increasing extent to the private and voluntary sectors.  Powers also have been taken away in respect of transport, roads and waste management and now in respect of water.  The Local Government Bill does not do enough to address this and may not do anything at all to do so but these must be the reserved powers of councillors.  In the case of the arts to which I referred earlier, some councils are active in the promotion of culture and the Irish language.  This must be brought more to the fore and can provide an economic benefit to a local area.  Initiatives should be put in place to use empty properties for cultural activities and perhaps one could introduce zero, or close to zero rates for a period.  There is a considerable role for local authorities in this regard.<\/p><p>  I wish to address the need to have people living in town centres.  If one thinks of any of the towns I mentioned earlier, and in many towns nationwide, people used to live in town centres.  They lived over shops and over their businesses.  Congestion was mentioned earlier and while time does not allow me to go into it, I can give two good examples.  One family in Portlaoise lives over its business while another family travels 14 miles each day to its business with the associated need for the cr&egrave;che, all the commuting and having two cars on the road.  However, the family that lives over its business walked its children to school.  The children in that family now are teenagers and walk themselves to school, which is around the corner.  Moreover, the car is only taken out perhaps once a month.  I often consider this to be an example of the reason people must be brought back to live in the towns.  Another reason is to bring life back to town centres.  If people do not live in an area, it will not be a living area.  If one visits other countries, one will see businesses with apartments and residential areas overhead.  We must get back to doing that to move forward.  We must get people back living in town centres.  I have addressed the issue of antisocial activity, which must be central to making sure people feel safe in town centres and there must be a close partnership between the community and policing.<\/p><p>  Out-of-town developments are a huge issue that must be addressed.  Huge warehouse-type shopping centres have been located on the outskirts of towns, to which people drive and local authorities must have the power to curtail this in future.  Councillors must have the power to change the rating system to ensure that those large multiples are paying the appropriate rates to compensate for the damage that is being done.  Huge damage is being done to the existing infrastructure and moreover, additional infrastructure must be provided.  I also wish to highlight the Government's target of having 50% of foreign direct investment take place outside Cork and Dublin.  Statistics demonstrate this is not happening but it must begin to happen because in many of the aforementioned towns, including Portlaoise, business spaces belonging to the IDA lie empty and the target is not being achieved.  However, such investment is needed to keep people in those areas, to keep them working and to have money circulating in the local economy, which is based around the town centre.<\/p><p>  The key to addressing economic recovery is to have growth at all levels and local government must play a lead role, in conjunction with the Government, in promoting this.  Local government should adopt and implement plans for economic development.  Local authorities should provide incubation space and start-up grants for local businesses where appropriate.  Empty buildings and empty sites can be used to provide some of that incubation space.  In addition, action must be taken regarding the issue of upward-only rents, which has not been addressed.  While the Government has stated there is a constitutional issue in this regard, if a referendum is necessary, it should be held.  It is an issue that must be addressed to change the Constitution.<\/p><p>There is also the issue of a rates reduction.  In respect of start-up businesses and shop front improvements there should be a rates reduction for one to three years.  The key to addressing the issue is reform of local government and partnership with local government and local communities.  Instead of having formal town teams funded by the taxpayer we can have voluntary teams that do not have to be funded by the taxpayer.  We need strong local government that gives local councillors the discretion and the wriggle room to do what is needed to keep town centres alive. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200008#F00200","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385117400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to contribute to the Local Government (Town Centres) Bill.  I commend and thank Deputy Barry Cowen for bringing the Bill before the House as it is part of the economic debate on town centres.  It is also an attempt to arrive at new and radical ideas to kickstart the local economy that has taken a major hit in recent years, where small businesses have suffered and jobs have been lost.  We urgently need to generate economic activity that will benefit our citizens, hence the reason the legislation and this debate are crucial.<\/p><p>  We all know the problem and the issues but what people want is sensible well thought-out solutions.  We have heard all the negative talk in the past couple of years.  Town centres need these breaks.  Governments, local authorities and politicians have a duty to set out ideas, to lead and lay the groundwork for generating our town centres.  We also need an open and honest debate in the current economic climate.  We have to be sensible where we spend our money.  Common sense spending and planning are also the way forward, issues on which many of my colleagues have touched.  I will develop this matter further in relation to the parking issue.<\/p><p>  The issues that need to be dealt with in the current climate are parking charges at out-of-town shopping centres - it should be noted that parking charges raise &euro;360 million per year; the reason town centres are dying on their feet and also opportunities for growth in town regeneration.  I understand the Minister of State has recently backed the vacant site levy.  Such issues must be examined in detail.  Urban centres have been hard hit by out-of-town shopping centre magnates which has led to many town centres being on their knees.  There is also the parking issue.  <\/p><p>  Town centres are not just about shopping.  They have got to be about leisure centres as well as retail, side by side.  That is the key to success.  Town centres that need a break include Tuam, Westport, Killarney and in my own constituency of Dublin Bay North, places such as Howth.  They need our support and sensible proposals to develop the economy.  At the same time town centres have to be different.  I emphasise they are not just about shopping, but developing the town centre in such a way that people will want to go there, where there is less hassle and there are options, such as a nice pub or restaurant and where people can do their shopping.  People just do not want to go town centres for their main shopping.  There is another agenda here and people have to wake up to that reality.<\/p><p>  A number of my colleagues touched on the rates issue.  However, I do not think the Minister of State and the Government really get the issue in respect of commercial rates.  In the legislation Deputy Barry Cowen seeks to address the commercial rates issue, on which I strongly support him.  Recently I spoke to a small businessman who has a restaurant-pub in County Clare, who happens to be a constituent of the Minister of State, who pays &euro;37,000 in commercial rates.  He employs in the region of 20 people in a pub-restaurant business.  Before he gets out of bed he has to pay &euro;37,000 before he starts to pay his staff.  I am aware the Minister of State has said that she has asked local authorities to exercise restraint and, where possible, to reduce commercial rates.  I also heard her mention that 87 of the 88 rating authorities are maintaining the same rate as in 2012.  That is an issue we need to hammer home.  Those authorities that are keeping the rate at the same level are still charging small businesses, which are trying to pay ten, 15 or 20 people, &euro;37,000 per year.  We need to watch that issue.<\/p><p>  Another issue that is dealt with is the parking issue.  One side of the debate that was ignored by many of my colleagues is the effect of parking on the local economy.  For example, many people would not be aware, that the parking industry supports 1,500 jobs and contributes in excess of &euro;100 million to the Exchequer.  There are more than 350,000 car parking spaces in Irish cities, towns and town centres, including 269,000 off-street car parking spaces and a further 84,300 on-street spaces.  It is estimated that local authorities around the country get &euro;115 million in revenue from parking fees while private car park operators generate &euro;80 million.  That is a lot of money in the local economy and it is an issue we have not dealt with.  Other beneficiaries include shopping centres which get &euro;50 million, hotels and hospitals &euro;25 million and transport hubs such as airports and railway stations &euro;70 million.  Therefore, the parking industry is a pretty large one.  If that was a multinational industry providing 1,500 jobs we would all be jumping up and down and giving it tax breaks.  The parking industry across Europe generates in the region of &euro;30 billion from 47 million car parking spaces.  I understand and support the concerns of businesses in town centres in respect of parking.  However, when dealing with this issue we have to look at a well-regulated and managed parking regime as the way forward.  I ask the Minister of State to consider these issues also as they are very important.<\/p><p>  A truly national policy is important.  Cities such as Galway, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and small towns should not be neglected.   These town centres need to focus on making the city and town centres better places to visit.  We need to bring people in for sensible and logical reasons.  We must make town centres more attractive to consumers, tackle crime and improve safety and we need measures to improve business conditions for retailers on the ground.  <\/p><p>  In regard to the town teams issue, the Government should identify pilot towns and cities where new partnerships involving retailers, landlords, local authorities and representative groups can be formed to establish targets and achieve improvements in town centre locations.  The business improvement industry is one we should strongly support.  <\/p><p>  The crime and safety issue is important.  For example, in Dublin less than one in three people do not feel safe in the city centre at night time.  That situation must be improved.  What I am saying is that most of us on a Friday or Saturday night will go local and stay local and do not want the hassle of going into town.  One third of the population of Dublin will not go into town on particular nights because they feel for their safety.  That issue must be dealt with by providing a Garda presence and proper lighting systems in city centres and town centres.  A proper plan must be put in place to deal with anti-social behaviour.<\/p><p>  There is also the issue of litter and tidiness.  In a recent poll, some 32% of people said the city was clean and tidy.  Such a situation will not entice consumers to come to the city centre.  I am aware Dublin City Council has made major improvements in recent years.<\/p><p>We need neat and tidy town and city centres but we also need to have a strong Garda presence.  That is something at which we should look closely.  More community policing is urgently needed.<\/p><p> I know there are major constitutional issues in regard to rents but this issue must be dealt with and other ways must be found to deal with it.  I urge the Minister of State and the Government to look seriously at the proposals in Deputy Cowen's Bill.  There are many good and sensible ideas in it which are an attempt to regenerate our town centres.  That is the important part of the Bill and is why I urge Members to support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200009#G00200","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385118000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I had not planned on speaking but this is a very interesting subject, so I thought I would.  The general thrust of what Deputy Cowen said was positive.  We need to be proactive about the problems in towns.  The problems in the average town and those in Dublin city are very different.  Sorting out Dublin city is a more long-term project.  If one goes into the city at night, which I do, there is an air of aggression and it is not as comfortable as it should be.  Sorting that out will not happen over night.  The root causes of it are linked to serious social deprivation in the city.  There is probably a poverty rate in the region of 20%, which is high by European standards.  There is also a major drug problem.  It was interesting to read Fr. Peter McVerry's thoughts on it.  I would be very much in agreement with his stance on it that we need to take a different approach.  What we have been doing has not worked so we need to look at doing something different.  Fr. Peter McVerry knows more about it than any of us, so we should listen to him.<\/p><p>  I refer to the commercial element of city and town centres.  Over the past 20 years, there has been a lot of in-fill development in Dublin.  I was involved in a lot of it where we put commercial space on the ground floor and residential space overhead.  It was positive, a good idea and it worked well.  Where we fell down was that we did not put the social element in the city centre area because it was not policy.  The builder or developer did not want to do that either because there was not the same kind of money involved.  Under the Part V arrangement developers were eventually forced to give 20% of a project if it was more than 800 sq. m towards social development but, unfortunately, the developer was allowed to park it somewhere else in the region, which was a bad idea and should not have been tolerated.  It would have been good socially and for society in general if we had put a minimum of 20% social development everywhere.  <\/p><p>  Unfortunately, there is not a serious appetite in this Government for social housing, nor was there in the previous one.  It is not on the agenda and that needs to change.  We need to develop a different approach.  It will be positive if we get back to direct social housing provision by the State.<\/p><p>  One of the biggest problems in towns - I know Wexford town best - is that people do not believe they have a say in how their community is organised.  I like to compare this to places which work better in this area.  I know the village of Cortemelia in Piedmont, which has a population of 3,000, very well.  The people there have a very big say in how things are done and there is huge civic involvement in the goings on in the village.  When they elect people to the local authority, those people are put into positions with decision-making powers.  It is not only public servants who make decisions in the local comune but the people who are elected take major responsibility for most of the decisions made at local level.  This is a very good idea because it means that those who are elected organise their local authority.  One does not see any empty shops in the village even though the people do not have a lot of money.  Generally speaking, Italians have less money in their pockets than the Irish but they have a better way and a better quality of life.  Social services are very good and people do not mind paying their house tax, water charge and refuse collection charge because they get a very good return for their investment.  It works both ways.  Rates and rents are much lower than here. <\/p><p>  The Minister of State mentioned that many of the local authorities managed to bring down rates, or at least keep them the same, in 2012.  As I mentioned previously in the House, I have five wine bars and a coffee shop.  We are looking at a rate increase in Dublin of more than 45% on the basis of the new adjustment, which is shocking.  I do not understand the logic behind it; it makes no sense.  We are in a position where rates are 25% of our rent, which is not sustainable.  However, shops are not everything.  If we are going to make our small towns healthy again, there will have to be stronger civic engagement but I do know how we will do that.   <\/p><p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na played a very positive role in my local community when I was younger.  The closure of Garda stations is not a good idea.  This idea of the garda passing through a village in a white van and disappearing again is not the same as what we had in the past where everybody knew the garda and the garda knew everybody.  There was a positive relationship between the garda and the community.  That is something we should hold on to rather than move away from.  <\/p><p>  A huge problem in towns is that large supermarkets have taken much of the life out of town centres.  There must be active support for shops in town centres at the expense of the larger shops on the outskirts of towns.<\/p><p>Bigger is not always better but the trend in the past 20 years, not just in Ireland but in much of the developed world, has been that the bigger the unit the more favourably it is treated and, sadly, the smaller the unit the more difficult it is to make ends meet.  The opposite should be the case.  We must actively engage with and directly help the smaller unit to survive, which can be done in different ways, and not allow the bigger element swallow the smaller one, so to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200010#H00200","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385118600,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I welcome many of the ideas in this Bill.  As a retailer I am aware that the main streets of our towns and villages are becoming like the high streets in the United Kingdom.  When I joined the local authority in 1999 there was a simplistic view that every business was making a fortune and that one could increase the rates every year by an extra 1% or 2% and nobody would notice.  I said at the time that there would be far fewer businesses throughout the country in the future and, unfortunately, that has come to pass.  About six years ago I re-evaluated that and stated that there would be only bookmaker shops and hairdressing salons in many of our main streets.  Things have moved on, however, in that many bookmaker shops are now under pressure because one can have an app on one's phone on which one can gamble 24 hours a day.  The hairdressing salons have moved away from the main street and, unfortunately, many of them have moved into the black economy, working out of their own homes.  There are now many charity shops in our main streets, which are nice to walk around and make great money for the charities, but we need to achieve the right balance in that regard.<\/p><p>  We will never be in the position we were in previously, when the local butcher, the baker and the newsagent, which I was, were located on the main street of a town or village.  We now have the major shopping centres in which Tesco, Lidl and Aldi are located, and regardless of whether I agree with them, they are here to stay.  People will travel to those for convenience and to get value over a range of goods.  That is the position, but that is not to say there is no future in retailing or in the town centre structures.<\/p><p>  I am aware of a local newsagent who began to sell piggy-banks, for want of a better word, which one could use to save for weddings, birthdays and so on.  The footfall on the street for that product would be limited, but he had a Facebook page on which he sold more of those piggy-banks in one day than he sold in a year in the shop.  That is where the innovation is coming in, but we must keep the costs down.<\/p><p>  It is ridiculous that in smaller towns in Roscommon, for example - although I am sure it is no different throughout the country - one will rent out a property almost for nothing to get somebody into it, but half of the year's rental goes towards rates.  I accept that the Minister is examining this.  That is unsustainable and it is a cumbersome way of dealing with the issue.  I am aware that discussions are ongoing, but that must be dealt with if we want to get people to move into vacant premises around the country.<\/p><p>  There are many good ideas in the Bill, but I have difficulty with the establishment of another structure.  We have far too many structures, and establishing another one would lead to much confusion.  There is a great deal of change taking place in local authorities.  I welcome the fact that many of the agencies are moving into local authorities.  I agree with the revitalisation of town centres, but the creation of additional structures is an issue I have with the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200011#J00200","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speech","time":1385118600,"counter":33,"content":"<p>We have had a good debate and I thank Deputy Cowen for facilitating that.<\/p><p>  The context in which all of us are speaking is the economic collapse.  The doughnut effect, whereby much is happening at the edges of towns and cities and not much in the centre, coupled with the economic collapse, has meant that the life has been sucked out of many of our town and city centres.  People have less money in their pockets and understandably, as Deputy Feighan just stated, they will go to the cheaper shops and to places where there is no charge for parking.  We must address that issue, and the most important way we can address it is through economic recovery, on which the Government is working.<\/p><p>  Regarding the specifics of what we are doing in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, in my role as Minister with responsibility for planning, everything I am doing is to ensure that town centres are given priority, whether that be in the retail planning guidelines, the development contribution guidelines or the way we operate the planning and development legislation requiring local authorities to have core strategies.  That means that what can be done in the centre should be done in the centre.  <\/p><p>  Zoning in respect of out-of-town activity is only for activities that cannot be done in the centre.  That is our policy, and I have used my powers under the Planning and Development Act to require local authorities not to zone inappropriately, which would add to the problem of the life being sucked out of town centres.  One aspect of the reform of local government is the establishment of municipal districts, whose role will be to co-ordinate and ensure that our towns are focused on in an appropriate way.<\/p><p>  Many good suggestions were put forward in the debate from all Deputies.  The issue with regard to Dublin raised by Deputy Kevin Humphreys and Deputy Finian McGrath is a specific one that must be considered.  Deputy Wallace raised the issues of social mix and social housing.  I assure the Deputy that we have begun the construction of mainstream housing again, and funding of &euro;30 million was announced for that in the budget.  We want to use brownfield sites and construct these houses on sites in towns or cities, not on greenfield sites.  We also want to bring some empty houses back into use in our town and city centres.<\/p><p>  Deputy Stanley and others spoke about enlivening our cities in various ways and encouraging people to live in towns.  The purpose of the Living City initiative, which was announced in last year's budget and added to in this year's budget, is to encourage people to live in city centres.  Admittedly, it is focused currently on cities, but it was expanded this year to include a number of other cities that were not in the initial scheme.<\/p><p>  In my city - Deputy Humphreys referred to Limerick also - we have a scheme ongoing whereby if empty properties are used by artists they are given the use of those free of charge and, in return, there is a waiving of rates for the owner of the property.  Galway has now adopted that scheme also.  There is a level of flexibility that can be used that will incentivise the use of such buildings.<\/p><p>  A Member referred to stronger civic engagement.  We see examples of towns that work very well where people come together and do tremendous work.  In my city I have seen a huge difference due to the various organisations coming together to ensure they all work as one to develop the community through activities and so on.<\/p><p>  All the structures we are implementing through the local government reform programme, and that I am operating as Minister with responsibility for planning, are designed to achieve what Deputy Cowen wants to achieve in the Bill.  Putting in another layer would be confusing because the municipal districts, and the elected representatives of those municipal districts, have powers and responsibilities.  There are also chambers of commerce and other bodies.<\/p><p>  I believe the structures being put in place are appropriate.<\/p><p>It is the local authority elected members who should be leading the process.  As I said, it will involve community consultation and, as such, will facilitate what Deputy Cowen is seeking to achieve in this legislation.  I thank him for the opportunity to debate these proposals.

I acknowledge that the Minister of State empathises with the grave difficulties being faced by local authorities throughout the country and the reality of the decimation and continued dilapidation of towns both small and large.  I also acknowledge the manner in which she has taken on board her responsibilities, particularly in regard to planning and the initiatives taken in respect of development levies.  Many local authorities are revising those levies downwards, as one would expect, in order to incentivise development in their towns and counties.  I agree with the points the Minister of State made in regard to retail guidelines and spatial strategies, with a focus on the gearing of development into town centres, not only from a residential and commercial perspective but also in terms of the cultural aspects referred to by several speakers.<\/p><p>  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider her stance in regard to the introduction of surcharges for out of town centre developments similar to those introduced in Northern Ireland and Britain in April last year.  Those types of charges could function as an effective funding mechanism to offset the costs of such proposals as I have mentioned to seek to incentivise town centres.  Rather than placing the onus of responsibility solely on local authorities, it is incumbent on the Government to facilitate local authorities, by way of legislation if necessary, in seeking to introduce any such surcharges.<\/p><p>  In regard to commercial rates, all speakers acknowledged the great weight and burden faced by retailers and businesses in town centres for some years now.  The Minister of State mentioned that local authorities have reduced their rates.  I accept that they have done so in so far as they can, despite the revenue-raising constraints under which they are operating.  Most of us in this House have sat through council estimates meetings, which are due to take place in the coming weeks.  While commercial rents have come down by as much as 60% to 80% in many towns, rates, on the other hand, have come down by only 4% or 5% at best.  That in no way amounts to addressing the hardship that exists.  The only revaluation process that is under way at this time is in Dublin.  Moreover, I understand some 9,000 appeals are logjammed in the system.  The demand notes applicable to those appeals are enforceable on 1 January, but there has been no communication as to whether individual appeals have been accepted or if the process is still ongoing.  The demands will remain in place on 1 January.  The number of appeals would serve in itself to indicate that the valuations being struck are not reflective of market realties.<\/p><p>  The time has come to overhaul the system.  It is too easy to fall into the mantra of accepting rates as an annual means of revenue collection on the part of local authorities without recognising the effects this is having on local businesses.  Any overhaul must be cognisant of the commercial rents applying in the areas in which rates are being levied, the turnover applicable to the retailer or business in question and the ability to pay factor.  These issues should be at the core of an overhaul of the system.  Slight amendments to the Valuation Act every five or six years are no longer acceptable.  We are all aware of the crisis that is the dilapidation of town centres throughout the State.  We can play the blame game regarding the role of all parties at local, regional and national level in terms of the manner in which development took place outside of town centres.  I hold my hand up in that regard.  There was an expectation that populations would increase in many areas.  I mentioned earlier that the percentage living in urban areas has increased from 42% to 62% in the past 60 years.  It will not, however, continue to increase at that pace into the future.  Hence the need for a rebalancing that would address the grave difficulties that exist from a commercial rates perspective.<\/p><p>  I hoped the Minister of State would address the issue of upward-only rent reviews.  Her party made a very strong commitment to the electorate before the last election to bring forward legislation to bring that practice to an end.  We have since been informed that the legal advice is that it is not possible to do so constitutionally.  I do not know what legal advice the Labour Party was receiving before the election and what legal advice it has received since.  Notwithstanding that anomaly, I do accept the bona fides of the argument that there is a legal impediment in this regard.  Setting aside the failure of several referendums brought forward by the Government, this is a commitment the Minister of State and her colleagues must honour.  We would have no difficulty in supporting an amendment to the Constitution, if such was considered necessary, in order to bring forward the legislation necessary to honour that commitment.<\/p><p>  There is an expectation on the part of many businesses and retailers, by virtue of the mantra emanating from Government, that the property tax will ease the burden on local businesses in terms of the payments made to local authorities on a regular basis.  Unfortunately, that is not and cannot be true, as we will see at the estimates meetings in the coming weeks and this time next year.  The property tax, we are told, is replacing the local government fund.  The Government, however, has committed to allowing only 80% of what is collected to go back to local government.  That in itself comprises a reduction, and will be seen to be a reduction, on what was available under the local government fund last year and the year before.  How then can it be construed that the burden on local businesses arising from commitments to local authorities will be reduced?  It will not.<\/p><p>  I hoped the Minister of State might have acknowledged in her reply the position of those local authority areas that will become municipal authorities under the legislation we will be discussing on Committee Stage in the coming weeks and whose valuation rate is, in some cases, 30% less than the county rate.  All the Minister of State has said in this regard is that she has informed the councils that they may bring the rates to parity over the next ten years.  I defy her to name one municipal authority area in which this will result in a reduction in rates; on the contrary, it will generally mean an increase.  I had an interesting discussion with a delegation from the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland during the week.<\/p><p>A town council in Donegal is 29% below the county rate so it is facing a 29% increase over the next three to ten years, depending on how its estimates are determined in the coming weeks.<\/p><p> Finally, I acknowledge the Minister's contention that the local government legislation and the establishment of municipal districts will allow those fora to carry out many of the suggestions I have made today, and which the Minister has acknowledged are required.  That is fine.  I hope that on Committee Stage of that legislation we will be able to tease out exactly what functions and fund-raising powers those municipal districts will have, as distinct from their county counterparts.  Only then will I be convinced that the potential exists for those fora, authorities or districts.  The body has yet to be called a &quot;council&quot; and that worries me because there are financial implications.  However, only then will we be able to tease out the teeth they will have and their opportunities or prospects of addressing some of the issues I raised today.<\/p><p> I accept the Minister's right to reject the Bill, although I do not agree with her action.  I hope that, having not taken the opportunity at this juncture, the Minister or some of her colleagues in the Government might comment on the proposals regarding out-of-town developments and the surcharge.  Similarly, a mechanism is required through which the Government should examine the issue of alcohol pricing in many of these multiples.  They are contributing to the demise of many pubs in town centres, where alcohol consumption could be protected by the relevant licence holders.  That is not the case now, with people doing this at home and so forth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200012#K00200","speaker":"1101","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385119800,"counter":37,"content":"<p>There are proposals from the Government on alcohol pricing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200013#L00200","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1385119800,"counter":38,"content":"<p>The Government increased the duty on alcohol sales in pubs, which had a further crippling effect on the licensed trade in many of our town centres.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge the empathy the Minister mentioned and her contribution to the debate.

The flashing blue lights on a dark road lighting up the carnage of a collision are a grim sight for any loved one to bear.  The shock and horror of such fatal road accidents have haunted innumerable families across Ireland.  After the media reports disappear and funerals fade away, they are left with the searing memory of abrupt loss.<\/p><p>  This type of tragedy is rendered all the more devastating by the knowledge that perhaps their loved one could have been saved or that they spent their last moments alone.  There is a unique grief wrought by the fact that a son or daughter, brother or sister, mother or father was the victim of a hit-and-run incident where, regardless of the fault involved, the driver compounded one mistake with an even worse response.<\/p><p>  The Road Traffic Bill 2013, published last May, aims to build on the work done so far to make roads safer over the past 15 years.  It specifically enhances the deterrent measures available to the judicial system to send out a clear and unambiguous message that leaving the scene of an accident is completely and utterly unacceptable, is a serious crime and will receive the appropriate punishment on conviction.  In conjunction with this, the Bill also strengthens the capacity of the Garda to test for alcohol or drug abuse over an expanded 24-hour period to ensure individuals suspected of being involved with a hit-and-run accident do not evade justice.  The Bill's overarching aim is to tackle hit-and-run incidents directly and make the roads safer for all users.<\/p><p>  Significant progress has already been achieved in this aim since successive Governments, with all-party consensus, first began vigorously to pursue a strategic approach to road safety in 1998.  Between 1997 and 2012, roads deaths are down by 65.7%.  Ireland is now the fifth safest country in the European Union for road collision fatalities per million of population.  This achievement may be set against an increase of 66% in the number of cars on the road over that same timeframe.  Steps forward in the area are a testament to the vastly improved legal sanctions, alcohol testing and the commitment of the Garda and the Road Safety Authority under the auspices of government policy targeting the area.<\/p><p>  However, the creeping rise in road deaths this year, even before we move into the Christmas period which is fraught with danger, is a stark reminder of the persistent menace on routes across Ireland.  We have already seen a greater number of road deaths than last year, marking a reversal in the consistent decline in fatalities over the past several years.  It is too early at this stage to read anything fundamental into those statistics.  It informs us, however, that we must keep up our efforts in reviewing road safety legislation and strategy, keeping it at the forefront of the public&rsquo;s mind.  There is also a necessity to ensure the appropriate level of Garda surveillance and resources to ensure this progress is not allowed to deteriorate.<\/p><p>  This Bill is a measure to help restore momentum in challenging the traumatic impact that road accidents inflict on grieving families and to ensure the vital arteries that connect the nation are as safe as possible.  It is designed to help ensure those families who have had their loved ones cruelly taken from them, can draw some comfort in the knowledge that steps are being taken to ensure other families do not have to share that deep sense of loss.  In particular, I pay tribute to the O'Farrell family from County Monaghan who have worked towards legislative provisions to draw a line under hit-and-run incidents.  The tragic story of Shane O'Farrell, a talented young law student who died in a hit-and-run incident, shines a sharp spotlight on the need to tighten the legal framework in the area.  I hope after their sad experience, as well as that of other families affected, they can take some comfort in knowing that something positive may come from their collective loss.<\/p><p>  The first Part ensures this offence will carry a punishment of up to ten years imprisonment and-or a fine of up to &euro;5,000.  That is up from the current maximum jail sentence of six months.  These measures are drawn from similar provisions in Canadian and Australian legislation.  Removing this offence from being considered a summary offence is an important part in setting the tone on this matter.<\/p><p>  The second Part deals with the powers of the Garda to test suspected offenders for drink and drugs.  The Garda only has three hours to find the alleged offenders and test them for drugs and alcohol.  This Bill extends that period to 24 hours, giving the Garda far more scope to track down those involved, test for intoxicating substances and ensure the appropriate charges are brought forward.<\/p><p>  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the Government's decision signalled at Cabinet this week to accept the first Part.  It is a victory for constructive politics and we look forward to working with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, on strengthening the legislation.  I understand the Government will put forward section 2 as an amendment to the Road Traffic Amendment Bill (No. 2) on Committee Stage in the coming months and we can co-operate on strengthening it at that point.<\/p><p>  This section deals with making leaving the scene of an accident causing bodily harm, a hit-and-run, an indictable offence.  An indictable offence is a more serious legal issue than a summary offence.  Indictable offences are those which may or must be tried on indictment before a judge and jury, namely in the Circuit Court or the Central Criminal Court.  It proposes to amend section 106 of the Road Traffic Acts 1961 and 2006.  Under current legislation, there is a six-month maximum sentence for individuals who leave the scene of an accident and it is considered to be only a summary offence.  In light of the devastating repercussions it can have on victims of such incidents, it is absolutely critical that strong deterrent measures are put in place to underline the gravity of these crimes.  The lives of innocent people are at stake.<\/p><p>  The Bill imposes enhanced punishments on those offenders who leave the scene of an accident where somebody has been injured.  Instead of the miniscule six-month sentence, we advocate a ten-year maximum sentence in the case of accidents causing death and a seven-year sentence in cases of serious injury.  The ten-year sentence for leaving the scene of an accident where a death has occurred would, of course, be in addition to the current maximum ten-year sentence for dangerous driving causing death as applicable.<\/p><p>  The Bill recognises the devastating impact that such accidents have on the families affected and sends out a clear, unambiguous message to drivers that they are obliged to stay at the scene of an accident.  The current law also incentivises people who may be inebriated or abusing substances to leave the scene to avoid the harsher consequences of drunk or drug driving.  These measures change that by heightening the punishment.<\/p><p>  Accidents happen and there may be no intoxicant present.  Sadly, because of the way the law is framed, people often feel it is better to leave the scene with no regard to the individual who is left to die on the roadside.  It is important we address this without delay.<\/p><p>  These provisions are based on international best practice as exhibited in Canada.  It is primarily drawn from the even more stringent section 252 of the Canadian Criminal Code.  Our Bill is adjusted in light of the demands of Irish law.  The Canadian Criminal Code states that a person who fails to stop at the scene of accident involving bodily harm is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years.  In the case of failure to stop at the scene of an accident involving bodily harm or death, a person is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life.<\/p><p>Clearly, the Canadians take this issue far more seriously than many of our European colleagues and we can learn a lot from the way in which Canada has developed its legislative code.  The provisions are also drawn from the Crimes Amendment (Roads Accidents) Act 2005 in Australia, which is also known as \"Brendan's law\".  This legislation introduces a similar ten year maximum sentence for hit and run incidents causing death and a seven year sentence for hit and run incidents causing serious injury.<\/p><p> The second part of the Bill which I understand has not been accepted by the Government based on what we have read would expand the amount of time available to the Garda to test suspects for alcohol and drug use from three hours to 24 after an accident.  This part of the Bill seeks to amends section 12 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 and section 2 of the Road Traffic Act 2011.  This significant expansion of the ability of the Garda to test suspects would further discourage drivers from leaving the scene of an accident.  By allowing the test results to be submitted as admissible evidence, it would enable the jury to decide whether the substance had been taken before or after the accident in the context of the trial.  Currently, drivers can simply drive away from the scene of an accident and evade testing after just three hours.  This allows serious offences to be avoided by reckless drivers.  In the state of Illinois, for example, this period is significantly longer, with an 12 hour testing period.  The Bill aims to expand it to 24 hours and allow the test results as admissible evidence in court.  This would enable the judge and jury to decide on whether the evidence was justifiable on the balance of probabilities.  This would involve weighing up the likely rate of alcohol processing by the individual based on weight, metabolism, etc.  This measure would only be applicable in serious cases where a hit and run accident had occurred rather than other road offences.  I trust the Minister will view this aspect of the Bill in the same co-operative spirit with which he has approached the first half of the legislation.<\/p><p> The Bill is ultimately about giving the victims of hit and run incidents a fighting chance for survival by sending a clear message that a motorist cannot leave the scene of an accident.  It underlines that hit and run incidents are serious crimes and sends that message to all motorists.  I trust that it would offer some hope to families who have endured grievous loss and help to ensure other families are spared the same unfortunate experience in the future.  I hope we can all come together in this House on this legislation and that it will be accepted in its entirety by the Government in a manner that seeks to address fatalities on the roads.  It would be another significant step towards ensuring this country will ultimately be recognised as the safest country in Europe in which to drive.  We still have some work to do and if we continue with the same level of co-operation, effort and work between the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport; the Road Safety Authority and the Garda, we can achieve these targets ahead of the strategy dates set out in the work programme.  I appeal to all Members of the House to consider supporting this legislation and look forward to hearing what the Minister and other Members have to say about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200014#M00200","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385120700,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address this Bill and thank Deputy Timmy Dooley for raising some very important issues through this proposed legislation.  The area of road safety is one in which there has been always cross-party support and there is no disagreement on our overall objectives, as the Deputy stated.  Collisions on the roads lead to unnecessary deaths and serious and sometimes life-changing injuries which have an impact well beyond the victims or their families, friends and colleagues.  Any proposal to reduce the casualty rate on the roads should be given serious consideration.<\/p><p>  For many reasons, there has been a welcome decline in the number of road deaths in Ireland, even as the number of vehicles on the roads has been growing.  The decade from 2002 to 2012 saw a reduction in the number of road fatalities annually from 376 to 162, which represents a drop of almost 60%.  There was similar success in reducing the number of serious injuries in that period from 1,009 in 2003 to 487 in 2012.  This represents the impact of a wide range of factors.  We have better roads, better standards for vehicles and better maintenance standards through the NCT and commercial vehicle testing.  There are tougher laws on drink driving, with mandatory alcohol testing check points.  The introduction of the penalty points system was also a major step forward and has both a deterrent and an educational role.  In addition, the driver licensing regime has become more rigorous and will be further strengthened by legislation which I have already placed before the House.  The creation of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, also played a crucial role, bringing together and co-ordinating many activities designed to promote road safety.  The RSA has ensured joined-up thinking across a range of areas, from vehicle standards to driver training and testing to road safety education.<\/p><p>  We should also bear in mind that there has been a shift in driving culture.  Ultimately, road safety can never be ensured by legislation or enforcement alone.  Individual drivers are responsible for their behaviour behind the wheel and reading the road ahead of them.  For safety to increase, it is essential that drivers are responsible and behave in a safe manner, with due regard for other road users.  We have seen a particular cultural shift in the area of drink driving which is no longer socially acceptable. Continued progress in road safety will involve a number of elements from legislation to enforcement and education, but none of this can work without the help of members of the public, be they drivers, cyclists or pedestrians.<\/p><p>  It is a matter of concern to see, for the first time in many years, that we are certain to have a higher number of fatalities on the roads this year than in the previous year. The reasons for this increase, like the reasons for the decrease in the past decade, are manifold.  The solutions, therefore, must come from many angles. Interestingly, the number of serious injuries this year to the end of October was 394, down 20 on the same period last year.  Early this year I launched the road safety strategy 2013-20.  This new strategy sets ambitious targets.  We aim to reduce the number of fatalities from 162 in 2012 to 124 or fewer in 2020.  In addition and for the first time in a road safety strategy, we are extending our focus from fatalities to include serious injuries which we aim to reduce by 30% over the lifetime of the strategy.  We have set out 144 actions through which we aim to achieve these targets.  The sheer number of actions is testament to the complexity of this issue and the interconnectedness of so many measures to increase safety on the roads.  The actions fall into the broad categories of education; engineering; enforcement; and evaluation, data and research.  Actions in each area, backed up, where appropriate, by legislation, will help to keep up the pressure and momentum to improve safety across the board on the roads.<\/p><p>  The Bill before us proposes actions in an area of particular concern on the roads, namely hit and run incidents.  These cases, regardless of whether they involve death or injury, are doubly traumatic for those affected.  Not only is a loved one, friend or colleague killed or injured but the perpetrator has fled the scene.  I know that Deputy Timmy Dooley has been approached by people who have suffered owing to hit and run incidents, in particular the family of Shane O'Farrell, a young man from Monaghan who was tragically killed in 2011 in a hit and run case.  I know his family has highlighted the issue ever since.  I am deeply aware of the profound impact which tragedies such as these have on families and friends.   In this case, not only was a young life ended unnecessarily, worse still, the driver fled the scene and no custodial sentence was imposed on the individual responsible.  There have also been other hit and run incidents in recent months, including one in County Donegal of which I am aware which also led to a fatality.  <\/p><p>  The Bill starts from the premise that there is a gap in current legislation on hit and run incidents and proposes to remedy this gap by new measures to provide for serious sentences for hit and run incidents involving death or serious injury.  We must first consider what the law provides for.  Section 106 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 sets out the duties of drivers when a collision occurs involving injury.  These duties include stopping the vehicle, remaining at the scene and giving appropriate information to a garda or appropriate other person.  This section applies to all vehicles involved in the incident, not exclusively to the vehicle which caused the injury.  The maximum penalty for breach of this provision is a fine of &euro;2,000 and-or six months in prison.  Evidently, this is an important provision in itself and there are sound reasons for keeping it, but it has not been sufficient in addressing hit and run incidents where death or serious injury has been caused.  I understand the common practice in the prosecution of hit and run cases where death or serious injury is caused is to use section 53 of the Road Traffic Act 1961.  This section deals with dangerous driving.  Where the dangerous driving leads to death or serious bodily harm, the penalty under the section is a maximum fine of &euro;20,000 and-or ten years imprisonment.<\/p><p>The difficulty is that it is often not possible to demonstrate that a person was actually driving dangerously, within the terms of section 53.  This means that an individual who causes death or serious injury and flees the scene can often only be charged under section 106 and is therefore liable to no more than a &euro;2,000 fine and on conviction, a six month prison sentence at most.  I agree this is utterly inappropriate and inadequate for an offence which has caused death or serious injury and is compounded and aggravated by the perpetrator leaving the scene.  As the law stands, the deterrent against leaving the scene is not sufficient.  I therefore agree with Deputy Dooley that there is a need for amending legislation in this area and I am happy to endorse the broad principle of the Bill in addressing this issue.<\/p><p> I have asked my officials to examine the specific measures proposed to deal with hit-and-run offences in the current Bill.  They have consulted on this matter with the Office of the Attorney General.  While there is no question that we should and will address this significant gap in legislation, I am advised that there may be difficulties with the way in which this Bill proposes to deal with the matter.  In particular, I am advised that great care is needed in framing an amendment which will not unintentionally undermine the working of section 106 and so that it will be workable.  As politicians and law-makers we must always consider the law of unintended consequences and take care not to do harm in our efforts only to do good.  Deputies will know that last month I introduced the Road Traffic (No. 2) Bill in the House.  I have asked my officials to discuss with the Office of the Attorney General the possibility of introducing an amendment to that Bill which would address the hit-and-run issues that Deputy Dooley has raised.  Work is well advanced on this and I expect to be in a position to introduce an amendment on Committee or Report Stage which will address the issues raised.  My officials have already discussed this matter with Deputy Dooley and they will contact him when the amendment has been finalised.<\/p><p> The Bill we are discussing today also proposes an important change to the law on testing for intoxicants.  Currently, the law provides for testing of drivers for intoxicants, either through breath tests or through the taking of blood or urine specimens.  This Bill is proposing that in cases where an offence under section 106 of the Act applies - in cases where the driver has fled the scene - breath tests should be allowed for up to 24 hours after the incident.  I appreciate the intention behind this proposal.  Normally, if a person remains at the scene he or she undergoes a breath test or to provide a specimen of blood or urine at a Garda station.  The idea behind the proposal in this Bill is that people who have fled the scene and are later detained could still be tested for intoxicants.  However, there are some problems with this provision.  The law as it stands states that specimens to be measured for intoxicants must be taken within three hours of an incident.  This applies whether the specimen is of breath, blood or urine.  The reason for the three-hour limit is that it is not possible, as a matter of science, to use test results from specimens taken a significant period after an incident, to calculate back to what the level of alcohol would have been at the time of the incident.  Inevitably, the value of the indication given by the testing is reduced the later the specimen is taken.  As a rule, it would be unlikely to detect alcohol, even serious alcohol ingestion, more than 12 hours after that ingestion, due to the half-life of the substance.<\/p><p> I have looked into this issue and I note that in some other jurisdictions, specimens of blood and urine can be taken later than is the case in this jurisdiction.  For example, Canadian law allows for the taking of specimens as soon as practicable after an incident.  In practice this has proven difficult from an evidentiary point of view, with drivers in hit-and-run cases often turning themselves in 24 hours after an incident when no meaningful test for measuring their level of intoxication at the time of the incident can be undertaken.  Their defence attorneys use that negative test as part of the defence.  Since it is not possible to calculate back from the level of intoxication when a late specimen is taken to the level of intoxication at the time of the incident, the Canadian law works on the principle that if someone is actually over the limit when the late specimen is taken then he or she must have been over the limit at the time of the incident, unless it can be proved otherwise.  In practice this is not an easy measure to operate.  If we say that a person intoxicated 24 hours after an incident must have been intoxicated at the time of the incident, it would be easy for him or her to claim that they had taken a drink in between.  In fact, if someone were trying to evade responsibility, this is probably the first thing that they would do.<\/p><p> In the UK, there is provision to take specimens of breath, blood or urine for up to 18 hours after an incident.  The norm, however, is to take them much sooner.  This provision does not relate to cases of hit-and-run but rather to circumstances where a driver is incapacitated and incapable of giving consent to provide a specimen for testing.<\/p><p> I have consulted on this issue with the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, which is responsible for the testing of specimens of blood and urine for intoxicants.  The MBRS informs me it is possible to analyse a blood, urine or breath alcohol specimen and determine the alcohol concentration at the time the specimen is provided.  However, the scientist would be unable to provide an exact alcohol concentration for the time of the incident due to the complex nature of alcohol metabolism and inter-individual variation.  The further away in time from the incident that the specimen is taken, the greater the complexity and the wider the range of possible levels giving rise to arguments on calculation and interpretation of the approximated result.<\/p><p> In a hit-and-run situation there is the additional complication that the driver is not observed for a period of time and may or may not take alcohol and or drugs during this period.  If this provision was in place, this almost certainly what would happen.  Similarly, the MBRS can analyse a blood or urine specimen for the presence of a drug or drugs and determine the presence of a drug or drugs in the specimen at the time the specimen was provided.  <\/p><p>Where a drug is detected it would indicate that a person, at some time prior to the provision of the specimen, consumed that drug.  However, it is not scientifically possible to determine when the drug was ingested or consumed.  In other words, it would not be possible to tell whether the drug was ingested before or after the incident.  I listened to Deputy Dooley's contribution in which he expressed the view that the information should still be given to the judge or jury so that they could decide, on the balance of probability, as to whether the person was intoxicated.  As we know in this jurisdiction and in most democracies, when it comes to a criminal case the test is not on the balance of probability but it is a test of beyond reasonable doubt.  If a person was tested positive for alcohol or drugs in their system two or three days after an incident, it would not be possible to say that it is beyond reasonable doubt that during those two or three days, the person did not take alcohol or ingest drugs.  The probable effect would be to create a whole new line of defence for a person suspected of an offence rather than what is intended.  By the same token, the absence of alcohol or drugs several hours after the incident does not allow a scientist to conclude that no alcohol or drug was present at the time of the incident.  Allowing for testing to take place a long period after the incident could inadvertently provide a defence for the person suspected of the offence.<\/p><p> In summary, the advice of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety is that it is possible to conduct an analysis of a specimen taken at any time but the difficulty is in correlating the result to the time of driving if there is a significant time gap before the sample is taken.  There are simply too many variables for it to be possible to calculate back to what would have been the level of intoxication at the time of the incident and this is the information that matters.  In light of the advice from the MBRS, it would not be advisable to extend the time for taking specimens to test for intoxication.  The current law does not actually prevent breath-testing 24 hours after an incident, but the results would be of little value.  This is the reason it is not done.  If the individual was under the limit at the time of testing, it would not be possible to calculate back to his or her alcohol level at the time of the incident, even if we could prove that they had not consumed any alcohol in the interim.  If the person was over the limit at the time of the test, this would likewise not be proof that he or she was over the limit at the time of the incident.<\/p><p> Extending the question from breath to blood and urine, it is clear that the late taking of specimens is not scientifically reliable.  I would be among the first to be pleased if it could be done but it is clear that it would not work, and would lead to a degree of disrespect for the law if cases proved impossible to take or had to be abandoned.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I am in agreement with Deputy Dooley that there is a serious gap in the law with regard to hit-and-run incidents.  I thank him once again for bringing this very important issue to the attention of the House.  Unfortunately, I cannot support the proposal that we should abandon the idea of late testing for intoxicants, due to the expert advice furnished by the MBRS but I agree with the Deputy on the principle of reforming the road traffic legislation to provide proper penalties for hit-and-run cases but care must be taken in how this is achieved.

My officials and I will work with Deputy Dooley to introduce an amendment on Committee or Report Stage of the Road Traffic (No. 2) Bill.<\/p><p> I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and I look forward to discussing these issues further with him when dealing with the Road Traffic (No. 2) Bill.

I commend my colleague, Deputy Timmy Dooley, for introducing it.  I thank the Minister for his response, as this is a question of citizens' safety, protecting their rights and ensuring they have justice.  It should not be a political issue.  We all have a vested interest in road safety.  We know what problems there are, but the Deputy's legislation zooms in on a major issue that needs to be addressed comprehensively.<\/p><p>  Leaving the scene of an accident is a red line issue for me.  It is not acceptable for anyone under the influence of alcohol or drugs to leave someone dead or injured on the side of the road.  It is welcome that this legislation strengthens the Garda's capacity.  Hit-and-run accidents are too commonplace around the world and we know of the horrific tragedies suffered by families.  I welcome the legislation and its provision of a sentence of imprisonment of up to ten years.  Some of its measures are derived from examples of good practice in countries such as Canada and Australia, but in the event of someone dying as a result of a hit-and-run incident, I would go further and opt for the Canadian model, in which the driver is sentenced to life in prison.<\/p><p>  An important point has not yet been mentioned.  Many citizens believe the justice system is letting them down in these issues.  I am annoyed when I see people being given sentences of three, four or five years in cases where intoxicants and the death or injury of others are involved, as people also end up in jail for petty, non-violent crimes.  We should have a specific category to deal with the former offences.  As they used to say years ago, if one does the crime, one does the time.  People should stop whinging about it.  I welcome this element of the Bill.<\/p><p>  It is welcome that the Minister is present to debate the issue.  Many people have stories.  A couple of weeks ago I had the privilege of meeting one such person, Ms Lucia O'Farrell from Magheraboy, Carrickmacross, County Monaghan.  She came to Dublin to meet me to talk about her beautiful son, Shane, who had been killed on 2 August 2011.  A young college student in Dublin, he was killed in a hit-and-run incident by a driver who was out on bail.  She had written to the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice and Equality to make her case.  I raised it in the D&aacute;il.  Essentially, everyone claimed that nothing could be done about it.  I am referring to this case because it is relevant.  The family believes it has been let down by the justice system, as a number of incidents occurred prior to Shane's death in what Ms O'Farrell described clearly as a hit-and-run murder.  One hour before he was killed, the occupants of the car had been pulled up at a Garda checkpoint and the driver had taken no alcohol.  In her letter Ms O'Farrell's letter writes:<blockquote>The driver was asked to switch, as he was also uninsured.  This implied that an hour later he was alcohol free when he murdered Shane.  This was not a Garda Checkpoint, this was an unmarked drug squad car sitting in the ditch, and pulled up this car as the registration was flagged on their system.  No breathalyzer was used, No drug test on the road side.  They were asked to switch drivers and they were searched.  They were waved on.  Our family wanted to stand up and tell the truth, but we knew that was not allowed, unfortunately; we are law abiding people, and we expected the State to do what they are expected to do, their job.<\/blockquote>There are serious questions to answer in this case.  It is appropriate that I read from another part of her letter, which reads: &quot;Shane would frequently say, &quot;You are guilty of all the wrong you do, but you are guilty of all the good you don't do as well.&quot;  How right he was.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport should examine the Shane O'Farrell case of 2 August 2011 and determine what happened.  I will contact the Minister for Justice and Equality again.  What about Shane's human and constitutional rights?  This case should have been about Shane, not about hiding the truth in order that people would not get into trouble.  The individual in this case got off scot free.  It is important that we raise these issues, as families and victims are hurting.  Justice is not the Minister, Deputy Varadkar's brief, but I urge him to examine the Shane O'Farrell case closely.<\/p><p>  When we address the broader issue of road safety, we must ask hard questions of the Minister.  Are the campaigns working?  Sometimes I believe they are going well when, all of a sudden, there are a number of deaths or injuries and the average statistics go out the window.  Law-abiding citizens get caught in these campaigns.  Regularly, constituents complain to me about getting two penalty points for being a few miles over the limit in a safe area.  They take the hit and pay the &euro;80 fine, but they see rich and powerful people walking away from penalty points.  That is unacceptable.  There seems to be one law for the rich and powerful and another for the average law-abiding citizen.  These are the issues being brought to me as a backbencher and I will raise them in the House.  People believe they are being scapegoated.  We hear a great deal about the squeezed middle.  Hundreds of thousands of law-abiding people go down to the shops and get two penalty points for driving 60 mph in a 50 mph zone or so on.  Something else happens to them then and they regularly make massive contributions.  However, they see hit-and-run drivers and others getting away with only four or five years in prison for shooting or stabbing someone.  &quot;Hold on,&quot; they say, and they wonder whether there is any balance in the justice system.  We need to link this debate on hit-and-run drivers and road safety with the issue of equality in the justice system.  These are important points.<\/p><p>  The bottom line in addressing the issue of intoxicated driving is not drinking in the first place.  It was a part of the culture years ago when people used to have two or three pints.  Many Deputies and members of the older generation used to do it.  Now, however, if there is any doubt, do not drink at all.<\/p><p>  I welcome Deputy Timmy Dooley's legislation.  I commend him on introducing it, as it is an important part of the debate.  Road safety is important, but so is justice for the victims of hit-and-run incidents.  Law-abiding citizens are fed up being scapegoated in many of the campaigns.  They want reform and quality in the justice system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200017#P00100","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1385122500,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Dooley for bringing this Bill before the House and commend the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, on his acceptance in principle of the Bill.  I hope it will proceed at an early stage to Committee Stage and that it, like future legislation introduced on Fridays by Opposition or Government backbenchers, will become law.  While it is the wish of Members who avail of the Friday sittings to introduce Bills that this be the case, there has been little progress in this regard.<\/p><p>  The Minister is correct that road safety is not an issue that should divide us.  I was not aware until I read the Bill of this gap in the law, which the Minister articulated well in his contribution.  I had always assumed that a person should not leave the scene of an accident, particularly an accident in which someone is injured, and that we were fully covered in this regard in terms of law.  We would all agree it is important we do not provide in legislation for things that would cause problems in the future.  The last thing we want to do is create loopholes in legislation, particularly in the area of intoxication, which will leave it open to challenges in the courts.  In this regard, any proposed amendments will be important.<\/p><p>  As has been said, the enactment of laws in this area is not sufficient.  We need also to address issues such as culture, Garda resources and enforcement.  We need to get this package right if we are to deal with the issue in a comprehensive manner.  Some months ago, the Road Safety Authority was critical of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, with regard to Garda strength and, in particular, the strength of the traffic corps.  There is a valid criticism there about the level below which Garda numbers cannot be allowed to fall.  There is no point in our making good laws if the resources are not available to enforce them.  <\/p><p>  The phrase &quot;Lies, damned lies and statistics&quot; is often used.  In areas where there is a low ratio of garda&iacute; per head of population the number of recorded incidents that require detection on site - including, for example, road traffic offences - will be low.  If we do not have sufficient garda&iacute;, checkpoints cannot be put in place, resulting in lower crime statistics than would otherwise be the case.  The number and positioning of garda&iacute; is critically important if we are to maintain the significant improvement in road safety in Ireland.  In 2012, road deaths in Ireland decreased by 12%, which compares well with the EU average of 9%.  <\/p><p>  Road conditions also play a part in road safety.  The initiative taken earlier this week in regard to proposed changes in road speed limits, particularly on rural roads, is to be welcomed.  I was a member of a town council when the decision was made to introduce speed limit signs nationally, at which time many members were questioning the decision to erect 80 km\/h speed limit signs on rural roads because they believed drivers would assume that was the speed at which they were required to drive.  This issue was raised in every council chamber around the country at that time.  Ordinary people who are not experts, councillors or politicians are not always wrong.  It is ridiculous to see an 80 km\/h speed limit sign displayed on little boreens and the same speed limit sign displayed on larger roads such as that between the Red Cow roundabout and Kildare county boundary.  I have reviewed the statistics for one year with regard to the roads on which people were caught speeding and acquired penalty points.  The road on which one is most likely to be detected driving above the speed limit and acquire penalty points is that between the Red Cow roundabout and Kildare county boundary, which is the widest road in the country.  The lower speed limit applies on this road because it is not a motorway.  We need to question some of the decisions that may result in a reversal of improvements made in the area of road safety.  However, I welcome the fact that a more sensible approach to the setting of speed limits is to be taken.<\/p><p>  Accidents on our roads that result in fatalities destroy families.  Where a person who is injured is left at the scene without regard for his or her well-being, this inflicts great injury on the family.  There are also significant costs in this regard in monetary terms.  The agency responsible for road safety prior to the Road Safety Authority carried out a cost-benefit analysis with regard to fatalities, because there was a need to put a monetary cost on this to enable the value of different road safety initiatives to be measured.  The monetary value of each fatality was estimated in the late 1990s to be &euro;1 million.  Many people involved in accidents sustain life-changing injuries in respect of which they often require rehabilitation.  <\/p><p>  There are a suite of things that we need to get right in this area, including better laws, enforcement of penalty points, and road conditions, including signage.  We must also ensure we address accident black spots.  In this regard, the mapping of accidents in particular areas, as carried out by the Road Safety Authority, is useful.   <\/p><p>  I welcome the Bill and the approach being taken to it.  I look forward to the enactment of this legislation, which is being introduced during a Friday sitting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200018#Q00100","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1385122500,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill and congratulate Deputy Dooley on his efforts in drafting it.  I also welcome many of the measures contained in the Bill and note the Minister's intention to transpose elements of it into Government legislation, which is a good demonstration of the benefits of reforms introduced in this House, including the Friday sitting.  That Ministers such as the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, are willing to engage in a positive way, take on board proposals and incorporate them into Government legislation is to be welcomed.  However, we need to ensure that Bills introduced during Friday sittings in this House that are not accepted by the Minister are allowed to progress to Committee Stage; otherwise, there is no point in Government backbenchers such as myself or members of the Opposition such as Deputies Dooley or Catherine Murphy drafting them and bringing them forward for debate.  We need to look at how many Bills introduced during Friday sittings are progressing to Committee Stage and, where this is not happening, the reason why.<\/p><p>  The Minister referred in his contribution to the reduction in road fatalities and serious injuries over the past decade, which is to be welcomed.  Equally, it is worrying that the number of road fatalities has increased this year.<\/p><p>As the Minister stated, there are several reasons for this and therefore we need to approach the area from several angles, but it is a concerning trend and one we need to pay attention to because we have been going in the right direction in this area for so long and it would be a bad thing if we were to take a step back for whatever reason.<\/p><p> Deputy Catherine Murphy made some interesting points in this area, including a reference to the presence of garda&iacute; on our roads at the moment.  It is noticeable, particularly in Dublin.  Another point Deputy Murphy made related to the condition of roads.  Again, this is noticeable in Dublin.  I realise the Minister has been fighting his own battles to retain funding in his budgets for the maintenance and upgrade of roads.  There is not enough money to spend at the moment and that is something we need to examine because it is a cause, in certain instances, of fatalities on our roads.  Certainly, this has been the case in some serious incidents.  We have seen this in incidents involving cyclists when the carriageway beside the footpath or the median is not being maintained.  Potholes can develop and, as a result, the cyclist can find himself in a dangerous situation.  He may swerve out of the way, then the car must swerve, in turn, and in certain instances this has resulted in an accident.  This is something we need to examine in a joined-up manner, as Deputy Murphy adverted to, and we should try to figure out the actual cost.  If it is a question of spending &euro;50 million on maintaining our roads, improving them and working on health and safety to save &euro;100 million or &euro;200 million when it comes to the health aspect, including the money spent after an injury or an accident, then it is something we should consider in terms of how we invest our money prudently in the infrastructure in the State.<\/p><p> Another issue Deputy Dooley referred to relates to hit-and-run incidents, which are serious.  A separate road safety issue is not as serious but it is relevant and since the Minister is in the Chamber I am keen to raise it.  This relates to the behaviour of pedestrians and cyclists who break traffic laws, especially cyclists involved in hit-and-run events.  This is becoming more of a menace on Dublin's city streets and pavements.  It is time we started to consider seriously introducing on-the-spot fines for cyclists or pedestrians who are in breach of road traffic laws.  It happens in other countries.  In other countries, if a cyclist is cycling the wrong way down a one-way street, breaks a red light or is found on the footpath, a police officer or traffic warden is able to stop the person and fine him on the spot.  If that person does not have the money on him, he is walked to the nearest automatic teller machine.  It happened to me when I was in Prague some years ago.  I was caught on the subway without a ticket and I was walked to an ATM and had to take money out.  There is no reason we cannot do it here.  We should start to do it because the incidence of cyclist deaths is small in the city and has reduced, but the incidence of cyclists cycling in a dangerous manner, especially on footpaths or through parks where they should dismount, is rising and is causing injury to people.<\/p><p> We want to increase the number of cyclists on our road because it is a good thing.  One way to make cycling safe is to have more people cycling.  However, we want to ensure people are cycling in a responsible manner.  We have a great educational programme for children of a young age.  We see children wearing helmets and high-visibility vests but we see adults cycling on footpaths and that is dangerous.  If we want to stop that behaviour we have to do it through fines because a simple warning or the actions of another pedestrian shouting at such a person to get off the footpath will not change behaviour.  Cyclists will continue to break the lights if no one stops them, calls them on it and fines them for their behaviour.  Since he is in the Chamber I call on the Minister to consider these measures.<\/p><p> Naturally, we need to look at how people are driving on the roads as well.  That is essential because the car is the most dangerous vehicle on the road from the point of view of safety, but we should look at the behaviour of pedestrians and cyclists too, because they are part of the cohort who share the road and in certain circumstances they have been part of the cause of accidents that have occurred in terms of fatalities and serious injuries.<\/p><p> To come back to the measures contained in the Bill, I note the concerns the Minister has in respect of certain elements of the Bill and I support him in this regard.  Furthermore, I welcome the efforts the Minister is making to take the other elements of Deputy Dooley's Bill in respect of hit-and-run cases into his own legislation.  I congratulate Deputy Dooley on the measures and on bringing them forward in legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200018#Q00200","speaker":"1034","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385123100,"counter":55,"content":"<p>We support the overall intent of the Bill, which is to discourage drivers involved in accidents from leaving the scene for fear of stiff penalties.  Ireland is a country where people are very concerned about road safety.  We have made great strides in the past two decades to deal with road fatalities and to make life far safer for motorists and pedestrians.<\/p><p>  I concur with what the previous speaker said in respect of cyclists.  Something needs to be done about cyclists going up one-way streets, breaking traffic lights and so on.<\/p><p>  Last year was the seventh year in a row that the number of people killed on the roads fell.  The State is the fifth safest in the European Union in which to drive.  Road deaths have fallen year-on-year but, unfortunately, the trend has been undermined by cutbacks.  The chairman of the Road Safety Authority, Gay Byrne, said that the fall in Garda numbers and the cuts have resulted in a sea-change in attitudes among motorists, who are no longer afraid of being caught, because they know they are less likely to be caught.  We can all see it, especially those who of us who drive a good deal.  Rural Deputies who do a good deal of driving know about it.<\/p><p>  There are far fewer garda&iacute; on the road.  Gay Byrne said it was frustrating to realise that having come down to 161 deaths on the roads in 2012, we are now looking at reaching over 200 deaths this year.  A Road Safety Authority survey has shown that 70% of the motoring public believe enforcement has dropped.  Garda cuts have led to a drop of more than 50% in the detection of some of the most dangerous driving offences.  Fewer people have been caught drink driving, driving dangerously, not wearing seat belts, speeding or driving while using mobile telephones in 2013.<\/p><p>  I put it to the Minister that there is a major problem with people texting and driving.  It is something the Minister and his officials should consider.  I witness it every day and what we are looking at is horrific.  It is a miracle that there have not been more accidents.  Some action must be taken on this - I say as much in a genuine way.<\/p><p>  As of October fewer than 330,000 breath tests have been carried out on the roadside whereas 470,000 were carried out in the same period last year.  If the trend continues approximately 30,000 fewer tests will be conducted in 2013 compared with 2012 and that is clearly hampering efforts.  The Garda needs resources to stop road deaths and garda&iacute; need to be seen on the roads throughout the State.  I realise they cannot be everywhere but there is a noticeable lack of visibility and there has been a reduction in visibility in the past three years.  The Garda traffic corps has been reduced to approximately 800 officers from 1,250.  The Garda is doing a good job and has done a good job implementing a positive road safety policy but the force needs the resources to hold the line.  It is not something on which we can slacken off.  Unfortunately, austerity is undermining the ability of the Garda to do this.  While hit-and-run perpetrators should face stiffer penalties I wonder whether the Garda has the resources necessary to implement the changes outlined in the Bill.  Are we simply fighting to hold on to the progress made so far?  Of course, that does not mean we should not deal with the issue now.<\/p><p>  The act of leaving the scene of an accident which could possibly cause a life-threatening injury is a gross act of irresponsibility and a maximum sentence of six months for this is not enough.  One could argue that this is likely to be imposed on top of other sentences, including, possibly, manslaughter, dangerous driving or drunk driving, but that will not always be the case.  A person could be involved in an accident in which he was not at fault but still leave the scene of the crime and this is also a serious offence.<\/p><p>  Judges need to be allowed to use discretion to ensure proper sentences are given in each case, taking all circumstances and issues into account as well as the specific details of what happened and why.  This is why Sinn F&eacute;in remains a strong opponent of mandatory minimum sentences, which takes away discretion from judges.  In recent times, several scandalous cases have come up in which judges have handed down incredibly lenient sentences for serious crimes, including rape.  This is unacceptable and I am pleased that in some of these cases there have been appeals and the sentences have been found to be insufficient.  We have a system for dealing with the matter but it should be remembered that when a conviction is secured, for the most part, judges use their wealth of experience and legal knowledge and give appropriate sentences.  Anyway, we should not tie their hands when it comes to making a decision that fits each case and crime.  We should give judges a guide in how certain crimes should be sentenced.<\/p><p>  Leaving the scene of an accident is a serious matter.  The maximum sentence limits imposed on the Bill are adequate and fair, giving the judge sufficient room to punish adequately the full range of potential offenders in hit-and-run cases.<\/p><p>  I wish to take this opportunity to raise the issue of sentencing guidelines.<\/p><p>This is very important because the public must have confidence in the courts' ability to do their job and to uphold justice.  This is especially important for victims, particularly in respect of crimes that have low levels of reporting.  Guidelines could help to deal with this matter while also addressing the issue of unnecessary imprisonment for minor misdemeanours and unpaid bills.  According to the probation services and the Irish Prison Service, there was a 30% increase in the prison population in Ireland between 2006 and 2010, which has placed a massive strain on resources and on the ability of the Prison Service to accommodate prisoners in a humane way.  This is not due to a significant increase in the number of cases that attract prison sentences but because the average length of sentences handed down has increased.<\/p><p> The Minister for Justice and Equality must consider how a reform of prison sentencing policy can be implemented to reduce the prison population.  Sinn F&eacute;in recognises the critical role of sentencing in the justice system and in my party's view, sentencing and penal policy objectives should have a focus on community protection and rehabilitation.  Sinn F&eacute;in understands that custody does not always make a meaningful contribution to the justice system or represent a lasting solution unless it is underpinned by an effective regime that serves crime prevention and offender reintegration objectives.  The Minister for Justice and Equality must introduce these guidelines on sentencing to ensure a level of consistency, supported by proper training for the Judiciary and a sentencing guidelines council to provide monitoring in this area, as part of a broad range of measures to address prison overcrowding, as well as to protect people's confidence in the ability of the courts to deal with serious criminals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200019#R00200","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385123700,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I wish to put on record my support for this initiative by my constituency colleague, Deputy Dooley, which is an important and serious initiative to make the roads safer.  There is a degree of public cynicism, to which I will return, regarding some of the initiatives that have been taken by successive Governments in the name of road safety.  However, I believe the proposal in Deputy Dooley's Bill would be supported by the great majority and I am glad to note the Minister has accepted some of the proposals Deputy Dooley has brought to the House this morning, particularly that of increasing the penalty for leaving the scene of an accident.  No one can really state that leaving the scene of an accident is not a serious offence, and it must be treated as such in the Statute Book.  As the current penalties in place for leaving the scene of an accident are insufficient, I thank Deputy Dooley for highlighting that and I support him in this regard.<\/p><p>  There is an increasing amount of public cynicism, particularly with regard to speed cameras and their location.  I accept that they may have been rolled out in the name of making roads safer but there is a public perception that the increased number of locations at which such speed cameras have been placed has more to do with raising revenue for the State in times of economic need than with making roads safe.  While this may not be the case, the Minister should take the opportunity to dispel such cynicism that is afforded by the upcoming road traffic Bill to which he alluded earlier.  When the Bill is debated in this House, he should, for each site in which speed cameras have been placed, outline the basis for their installation - that is, that such sites have been the location of accidents in the past.  I must state anecdotally that in looking at some of the places where such speed cameras have been installed, one can see they are not necessarily all places where one would imagine accidents would readily happen.  There is a degree of shooting fish in a barrel if one goes out with a speed gun on the Naas Road, as perhaps the only achievement of the Celtic tiger was the establishment of the motorway system leading out of Dublin, and people who travel on it are sometimes being subjected to speed cameras.  While I also welcome the Minister's review of speed limits on rural roads, I question whether that might not also be extended to some of the arterial routes out of Dublin and the speed limits that apply thereon, even between the city centre at the airport.<\/p><p>  However, I reiterate my support for Deputy Dooley and his proposals.  I greatly welcome the Minister's acceptance of these proposals in the spirit in which they were made, namely, as a non-partisan effort to increase road safety and to tackle what are real issues, because sometimes one can get lost on the peripheral issues and fail to tackle the more important issues.  This proposal by Deputy Dooley very much tackles the real issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200020#S00200","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speech","time":1385123700,"counter":58,"content":"<p>First, I commend Deputy Dooley on his introduction of this Bill.  It is very welcome and I commend him on his work.  I certainly look forward to the forthcoming proposals from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on the Bill and some amendments thereto.  I listened to the sister of a hit-and-run victim who appeared on radio this morning.  Obviously, she and her family are heartbroken by the events.  There is a definite need to tighten up this area of law.  Consequently, I look forward to the proposals to be introduced from the aforementioned Department.<\/p><p>  A matter that Members must also consider is that of historic hit-and-run events that never have been solved.  There are hundreds and possibly thousands of families nationwide whose loved ones have been victims of hit-and-run incidents over the years and who still do not know who was responsible.  Much has been heard about historic cases in the context of Northern Ireland and the victims of the Troubles, particularly recently, and there has been much discussion of how historic cases should be dealt with.  However, consideration also must be given to this matter, as there are cases in which people were killed by drivers who failed to stop at the scene perhaps 30 or 40 years ago.  I have spoken to one such family and all they now seek is closure.  They simply want to know what happened and who was responsible.  This is a discussion Members must have and about which they must think.<\/p><p>  I am greatly concerned by the rising number of road fatalities in 2013.  It is a terrible tragedy and a major effort must be made to address it.  However, it is interesting to put the current figures into context.  I recently availed of the fine facilities of the National Library next door to print off the front page of a newspaper from 1973 for someone's 40th birthday.  On the front page of the relevant edition of the newspaper was a headline with a photograph, unfortunately, of a fatal road traffic collision.  However, it was reported that the fatality figures for 1973 were expected to exceed 600, which is an astounding figure.  By the 1990s, the number of fatalities had fallen to more than 400 - I believe it was approximately 470 in 1997.  While it almost sounds crass to be dishing out such statistics and numbers, as they were all people with families, that is the position from which we have come.  The point that got me thinking was that in the 1970s, Irish society accepted that these were the road fatality figures at which one would arrive each year.  In the 1990s, society accepted that 400-plus would be the annual fatality rate each year, these figures of course do not include the huge number of serious injuries.  In a way, we must ask ourselves what level of road fatalities does society accept today.  Clearly, as a society, we make a choice to permit or to accept a certain number, because were we 100% serious about reducing the number of road fatalities to the absolute minimum, we would implement what would be perceived by the wider public as draconian measures.  A debate in this regard is needed and consideration must be given to what more can be done, even if it is extreme, to tackle this problem.  It is a huge problem, as is anything that causes the deaths of hundreds of Irish people every year as well as thousands of other serious injuries.<\/p><p>Perhaps we are not embracing technology enough.  There is technology available that would definitely help to reduce the number of road fatalities.  For example, speed limiters could easily be fitted to vehicles.  Why do we have a speed limit of 120 km\/h on motorways when some cars can travel at twice that speed?  That does not make sense.  We need to think about this issue.  Why can one have on Irish roads a 2.5 litre engine in a sports car that can travel at more than 200 km\/h?  <\/p><p> Vehicle immobilisation technology for testing breath alcohol levels is used in some countries.  Perhaps we need to consider using it.  It means that a person who has alcohol in his or her system and is intoxicated in terms of driving a motor vehicle would have his or her car immobilised.  <\/p><p> Tachographs are used in trucks.  Why not use them in other vehicles?  A father with whom I spoke recently and whose son is 16 years of age is hugely worried about him being on the road next year.  He is worried that no matter how much he speaks to him and tries to educate him, sometime he will get the urge to drive at speed.  He wants to know, when he is not watching, what his son is up to.  Perhaps a tachograph in a car would act as a deterrent to speeding.  I am not speaking only about young motorists.  If and when a motorist is pulled in, the garda could look at the tachograph to see what speeds the motorist has been doing and measure his or her behaviour on the road.  <\/p><p> The issue of cameras has been mentioned.  From time to time we have sitting duck scenarios as cameras are located in areas in which there are no massive risks and many motorists are caught as soft targets.  One of the problems with the system of fines is that it is not progressive.  A person travelling at 62 km\/h in a 60 km\/h zone will be fined &euro;80, while a person travelling at 96 km\/h in the same zone will also be fined &euro;80.  If there was a &euro;5 fine for every kilometre a person exceeded the limit, a person travelling at 65 km\/h in a 60 km\/h area would be fined &euro;25, while the person exceeding the speed limit by 50 would be fined &euro;250.  I am sure there would be revenue implications, but it would be a fairer system.  <\/p><p> I welcome the announcement made yesterday by the speed limit review body.  It is very positive and contains some very practical proposals.  It is welcome that on some rural roads the 80 km\/h speed limit signs will be removed.  It is important that local authorities have the ability to change speed limits on a one-off basis.  I have had people in my constituency ask if the speed limit at a certain location would be reduced.  I would then ask the local authority to reduce the speed limit from, say, 80 km\/h to 60 km\/h because there had recently been three, four or five accidents.  The response I receive is that it can only be done as part of a county-wide speed limit review.  We need to look at streamlining the process involved in reducing speed limits at individual locations in order that local authorities could do so on a one-off basis without having to undertake the huge amount of administrative work currently involved.  I ask the Minister to examine this issue in conjunction with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan.  That would be a practical step.  There are locations at which there are glaringly inappropriate speed limits, but we are powerless to do anything about them until a county-wide speed limit review takes place, which is an expensive process. <\/p><p> I am sorry to deviate from Deputy Timmy Dooley's Bill, but I am sure the Minister will welcome the overall discussion on road safety and the number of road fatalities.  In regard to Garda vehicles, we need to create a specific offence in the case of those who deliberately ram such vehicles.  We have had cases of fatalities where Garda vehicles were rammed and many recent cases of garda&iacute; being injured while driving or being a passenger in a Garda vehicle.  We need to come down hard on people who do this.  Garda&iacute; are the people who uphold and enforce the law.  That their vehicles should be rammed and their lives put in danger is utterly unacceptable.  We need serious custodial sentences for those who do this.  This is an area on which I am working in terms of preparing a Bill to deal with the issue.   It is one we need to discuss because Garda vehicles are being rammed more frequently than we like to think.<\/p><p>  I commend Deputy Timmy Dooley for his work in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200020#S00300","speaker":"1051","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385124300,"counter":60,"content":"<p>This has been a very interesting debate and it has been interesting to hear what Deputies have had to say.  Deputy Finian McGrath mentioned the specific case of Shane O'Farrell.  I do not want to go into too much detail because I am very conscious of the separation of powers between the Legislature and the courts and the fact that the courts have to hear all of the evidence and all of the legal arguments in the case before they make their decision.  That is not to say the courts do not get it wrong; they do sometimes, but we cannot overturn what they decide.  Also people get off on points of law and technicalities, even when, perhaps, they should not.  That is based on our philosophy that when it comes to criminal law, at least in Ireland, one is innocent until proved guilty and that it is better that ten guilty men go free than one innocent man be wrongly convicted.  Sometimes I find that philosophy hard to stomach, but that is the basis on which our system works.<\/p><p>  Deputy Finian McGrath also asked if the road safety campaigns were working.  The evidence shows that they are, as 2012 was the safest year on the roads since records began, although 2013 will see an increase in the number of road fatalities.  I hope it will still be the second safest year, although that, probably, will not be the case based on the way the numbers are going.  There has been a decrease in the number of serious injuries on the roads this year as compared to last year.  It is important, however, not to read too much into any one statistic in any one quarter or year or category.  We often see this in economics also.  Let us see if a trend is emerging before we assume there is one.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy referred to the speed limit review, as a result of which a number of changes are occurring.  The process of removing unnecessary signs such as approaching a bend or a roundabout is under way.  Probably around summertime on boreens and narrow rural roads the 80 km\/h speed limits signs will disappear in favour of the new rural road sign.  For the first time, individuals will be allowed to complain to a local authority about a speed limit and have the complaint answered.  They will be able to appeal to a national body if they are not happy with the outcome.  I will have to check for Deputy Brendan Griffin whether a county council can review a speed limit or introduce a special speed limit on a one-off basis or whether it has to be done as part of a county-wide review.  I was not aware that it had to be done as part of a county-wide review and will have to check to see if that is the case. <\/p><p>  The speed limit review will cover all roads - national roads and motorways, roads in Dublin, as well as all over the country.  There will have to be a review of all speed limits every five years, with the first taking place within the first two years.  Sometimes things may not necessarily be as they appear when it comes to speed limits.  On a number of occasions I have queried speed limits.  Being the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I tend to notice these things.  When I received the explanation as to the why things were the way they were, it actually made sense.  Sometimes it is due to the camber or design of the road and at other times the speed limit on a wide road may be low because there is concealed access.  Perhaps, if one was not keeping to the speed limit, one might not have noticed that there was concealed access.  Even though speed limits sometimes appear absurd, sometimes they are not. <\/p><p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy raised the issue of Friday sittings.<\/p><p>I agree with what she said about the approach to Friday sittings.  When I was in opposition, I was very frustrated that the Government had too much control over the House, which I think it still does.  I have not always been a Minister, nor do I think I always will be one, so it is important that we are, as much as possible, open-minded about backbenchers and Front Bench spokespersons and the contributions they can make to legislation.  If we want Deputies to be legislators and to change politics in this country, we must treat them like legislators and respect them as such.<\/p><p> I really hope the first part of this Bill can be incorporated into an amendment.  I would be very happy to see that amendment introduced in Deputy Dooley's name on Committee Stage, if he were agreeable, so that the record shows it was his initiative that brought this about.  Deputy Eoghan Murphy has a separate Private Members' Bill on other matters, which I hope to bring into law through statutory instrument.  I am examining a proposal from Deputy Lawlor to make it a specific offence to clock cars.  If possible, I would like to include an amendment on that in the Road Traffic (No. 2) Bill.  <\/p><p> In regard to the amendment we hope to frame on foot of this Bill, a particular language is used in the Canadian legislation which states that the law applies to hit-and-runs where it is the intent of the person to escape civil or criminal liability.  We would need to work that into it.  One could conceive a situation in which somebody knocks a cyclist off his or her bike but he or she gets back on and the person drives on thinking the cyclist is fine.  However, the cyclist may have a delayed head injury which only appears two days later.  There may be circumstances in which we do not want to fall foul of the law of unintended consequences.  The Canadian model is a good one which applies where it is the intent of the person to escape civil or criminal liability.<\/p><p> In regard to testing for intoxicants, I have probably made my case on that.  I really have to go with the advice of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  If it gave me different scientific advice perhaps I might look at it again, but I have to go with its advice.<\/p><p> The comments Deputy Eoghan Murphy made on the maintenance of roads were well made.  When road accidents are investigated, very few are found to be down to road conditions, although some are.  While I am always arguing for money for, and calling on local authorities to allocate money for, road maintenance, there are huge costs associated with that.  However, we also need to bear in mind the huge cost of injuries and accidents on the road.  If somebody dies in a road traffic accident, some RSA figures put the cost of that life at over &euro;1 million through lost earnings, lost taxation and so on.  That is a huge amount of money, and it is something we need to bear in mind when we look for money for road maintenance. <\/p><p> Over the past few weeks, there have for the first time been a number of prosecutions of cyclists for dangerous cycling, and in one case for drink cycling, which I think was in County Clare.  That is the first time we have seen prosecutions of cyclists in the courts, which is very welcome.  It is intended to bring in a fixed charge notice system and on-the-spot fines for cyclists as part of the current road safety strategy, although it might be a year or two years before that happens.  I do not know whether we will be able to get garda&iacute; to walk people to ATMs.  From my discussions with garda&iacute;, I know they are uncomfortable about handling cash and are not willing to go down that route at the moment, although it is done in other countries.<\/p><p> Deputy Stanley mentioned texting and driving, which is extremely dangerous.  We will make that tighter in the Bill by making it an offence to even handle or operate a telephone in a car, but the difficulty in prosecuting that offence is that it will have to be witnessed.  A garda will probably have to see the person doing it, and that is why enforcement is very difficult.<\/p><p> I would like to see more enforcement, but the garda&iacute; are doing a very good job with the resources they have; they are doing a robust job in enforcement.  Deputy Stanley mentioned that there is a perception that enforcement is down.  That is a problem in itself because the most effective way to ensure people comply with the law is for them to believe they will be caught if they do not.  The perception that enforcement is down, which research shows, worries me.<\/p><p> Deputy McNamara asked about the location of speed cameras.  They are decided on by the garda&iacute;.  I have been told they are in accident black spots, but people have told me that is not always the case.  It is probably worth inquiring directly with the garda&iacute; about the accident record in that spot to see if they are warranted.  Speed cameras are definitely not revenue-making, as the Garda loses approximately &euro;1 million or &euro;2 million per year on them.  It may make money from some and not from others but, on the whole, it is not a money-spinner or a revenue generator.  The Garda actually loses on them.<\/p><p> Deputy Griffin, in his interesting contribution, asked a philosophical question about the acceptable level of deaths on our roads.  The only way to get to zero is to abolish vehicles altogether but, obviously, we will not do that.  We have to ask ourselves what measures we can bring in to further reduce the number of fatalities, collisions and injuries on the roads.  <\/p><p> Deputy Griffin mentioned speed limiters on cars.  That technology exists.  We will trial something different as part of the speed limit review.  I think in 20 years' time the satellite navigation system in one's car will give one the speed limit and start to beep if one goes over it.  Although it might be a bit Big Brother-ish, in time the satnav will probably be able to tell the Garda that one is driving over the speed limit.  Perhaps that is where we will be in 20 years' time.  <\/p><p> Deputy Griffin also mentioned alco-locks.  Interestingly enough, some of the private bus operators have already introduced alco-locks on their buses.  The driver has to blow into it to ensure he is not intoxicated before he can drive the bus.  Perhaps that will spread to other areas.  I would not like to impose those things on everyone in society, but as part of the current strategy we will allow the courts to do so.  If somebody has been convicted of dangerous driving or has been taken off the road for a period of time, the courts could, as a sanction, state that person must have his or her car governed or must have an alco-lock installed.  At the other end of the spectrum, people would be able to go on a safe driving course rather than take penalty points, which is done in the UK and other places and seems to be very successful, particularly for younger drivers and those with a first conviction.<\/p><p> I have probably covered the contributions made and I thank Deputies for a very interesting and welcome debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200021#T00200","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385124900,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response and general acceptance of the first part of the Bill.  I look forward to taking up his offer of continuing the work with his officials on putting together a comprehensive amendment to his Bill.  I will certainly commit to working with the Minister.  I recognise the points he made, particularly with regard to the potential for unintended consequences.  Having reviewed the Canadian legislation, I note the further elements the Minister identified which could assist us in ensuring we do not have a situation in which somebody is found guilty of an offence even though at the time of the accident he or she sought to do all he or she could.  I think we can find some common ground and a compromise in that regard.<\/p><p>  In regard to the second part of the Bill, on the basis of what the Minister said about the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, I will not pursue that by way of an amendment.  If we can make the provisions in the first part of the Bill on leaving the scene of an accident robust enough, the ideas I had with regard to the intoxication element of the Bill become somewhat redundant.  I never saw the second part of the Bill as replacing the current law as it relates to random breath-testing or testing for an intoxicant, but only to add to the evidence before a jury to assist it in making a decision on what the intent of the individual concerned was.  If we look at some of the provisions in the Canadian legislation and at other examples, we will be able to make an amendment robust enough to achieve what I think everybody in this House wishes to achieve. <\/p><p>  I thank the Deputies who contributed to the discussion for their support and the points they raised.<\/p><p>I hope we can secure cross-party input on an amendment that will seek to ensure there is a change of culture in this country such that somebody involved in an accident will not believe, for whatever reason, that leaving the scene will afford them a get out of jail card.  We cannot allow such a situation to continue.  If we have an amendment to the legislation that is sufficiently robust to stand up to the best minds in the courts, we will have done a considerable job of work in memory of Shane O'Farrell.  I was taken by the comments of other speakers about that case.  There is no doubt that our motivation on this side of the House was in response to it and I hope, in the spirit the Minister has shown, this amendment will ultimately become known as \"Shane's law\" because we will have done something for the family and the families of many other citizens who lost their lives in such tragic circumstances.  While it will not in any way deal with the loss of the individual families concerned, it will set a foundation on which we can continue to build on the body of law in place to help to protect citizens as they travel on the roads.<\/p><p> Specific issues were raised by Deputy Finian McGrath about the management of the case in the courts.  The Minister has rightly identified that that is not something in which we can indulge here, but if we are to take anything from the decision, it is that we must ensure there will be no other similar outcomes.  In doing our work and coming forward with a compromise legislative measure that will meet the needs of all concerned we can do something in honour of Shane O'Farrell and ensure his life which was lost in such tragic circumstances will not have been wasted, that it will have left an indelible mark on the Statute Book and that his death will not have been in vain.  I hope his family and wide circle of friends will be able to take some comfort from the fact that as he was studying law, his death will have added to the body of law on the Statute Book in a manner that I hope will protect and preserve other lives.<\/p><p> I thank all those who contributed to and assisted with the debate.  I look forward to the work we are all committed to doing with the Minister and his officials in drafting an appropriate amendment.  I hope that legislation which will contain other important provisions to do with road safety can be expedited through the House as quickly as possible and that Shane's law can become an Act of Parliament at the earliest possible time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200022#U00200","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385125500,"counter":64,"content":"<p>Is the Bill being pursued?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200023#V00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1385125500,"counter":65,"content":"<p>The Government is not challenging it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200023#V00300","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1385125500,"counter":66,"content":"<p>It is not opposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200023#V00400","speaker":"948"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1385125500,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Road Traffic Bill 2013: Referral to Select Committee","time":1385125500,"counter":68,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013112200023#V00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1385125500,"counter":69,"content":"<p>As this is a Private Members' Bill, it must, under Standing Orders 82A and 118, be referred to a select or special committee.
