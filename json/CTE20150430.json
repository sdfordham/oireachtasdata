I welcome this opportunity to appear before the inquiry and I will, of course, be as helpful as I can to assist you in your work.  As you are aware, I have already submitted a witness statement, which addresses the lines of inquiry as requested by you.  I will not repeat or summarise my witness statement here, but I will make some short introductory remarks.<\/p> <p>  I spent just short of 40 years at Bank of Ireland.  I was group chief executive for the last of those 40 years until my retirement in 2009.  My lifetime career covered both retail and wholesale banking, and I held senior management positions with the group in the US, the UK and in Ireland.  During my time with Bank of Ireland, I always endeavoured to do my job to the very best of my ability in the interest of the bank and in the interests of all of its stakeholders. <\/p> <p>  As you will be aware, Bank of Ireland is a long established entity, which has played an important role in the Irish economy since it's opened its doors in 1783.  Bank of Ireland has, down through the years, fostered a culture which is based on sound judgment and prudent decision-making.  To put it in simple terms, Bank of Ireland has a more conservative approach to banking than many of its peers.  This conservative philosophy continued, notwithstanding the significant growth that occurred during the period from 2000 onwards.  Rolling five year strategies were adopted by senior management and the board in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004.  Loan book growth in each of the markets in which we operated was an integral element of strategy throughout this period.<\/p> <p>  When I assumed the role of CEO in 2004, there were a number of factors impeding the bank's ability to achieve breakthrough in performance.  As a group, Bank of Ireland had evolved as a collection of related but autonomous businesses.  We found ourselves with multiple processes and systems and fragmented support infrastructure and an inability to avail of scale benefits.  We were failing to adequately manage our costs, our relative financial performance was mediocre and our total shareholder return was in decline.  As CEO, I was committed to addressing these factors.<\/p> <p>  In 2005-06, we undertook a new strategy development process.  Over a nine month period, from September 2005, we undertook extensive work, using leading international expertise, to get a fuller understanding of the international trends driving the financial services environment and competitive scenarios.  To identify implications and options for the bank, we undertook a robust process with significant involvement and challenge from the board.  From this process we determined the following: (a) that the economic outlook for our key geographies would be broadly favourable with sustained GDP growth and low unemployment in our chosen markets; (b) that we would be able to support growth, including capital and liquidity through securitisation and wholesale funding; and (c) that we would build on our core capabilities in existing developed geographies, rather than new areas.<\/p> <p>  And finally that we would grow the loan book in a diversified way. he board approved this strategy in July 2006. <\/p> <p>  As things transpired, the growth of Bank of Ireland's loan book during this period generally reflected economic expansion and the overall growth of the market.  There was growth in each of mortgage lending, consumer lending, SME lending, corporate lending, property and construction lending.  Of course, it is now obvious that the absolute amount of property and construction lending was too much.  The economic shocks in Ireland and the UK exposed this vulnerability with crystal clarity.  While the consequence fallout from this was considerably better than our peers, this is of cold comfort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015043000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Goggin"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1430348400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Basel II regulatory obligations dictated that the bank undertake an internal capital adequacy assessment process to assess capital adequacy against the banks risk profile.  This was undertaken in early 2007 and the results were submitted as required to the Financial Regulator.  Bank of Ireland considered three different stress scenarios as part of this process; the first we assumed all prices would reach $200 a barrel and remain there for an extended period.  The second stress was a significant reduction in foreign direct investment in Ireland due to material changes in the corporate tax rate and the third stress was a sudden drop of 20% in Irish and UK residential property values.<\/p><p>We considered these scenarios to be severe at the time; they were considered in fact to be in the one in 25 likelihood of occurring within a one-year timeframe.  We did not believe that we were vulnerable to a shock of this extent, however we were wrong.  As we know now, the severity of what ultimately occurred was considerably greater than this.  According to the Oliver Wyman review of risk governance in Bank of Ireland undertaken in 2009, the bank stress position was ultimately due to the combination of the severe downturn in the Irish and UK economies and the lack of liquidity in wholesale markets.  There was an assumption in the 2006 strategy that Bank of Ireland's core lending business could be grown strongly and that the required funding could be sourced.  As things transpired both of these assumptions were flawed.  Unless we had taken a very contrarian position relative to peers, Bank of Ireland was naturally exposed to the macro risks in our core markets of Ireland and the UK.<\/p><p>Oliver Wyman also identified three broad limitations which contributed to Bank of Ireland's stress position; one, risks in the core business and strategy may not have been fully appreciated.  Two, risk management and control was not geared towards understanding the aggregate risk profile and three, the link between the overall exposure limits and the risk appetite statement was incomplete and dependent on expert judgement.  While improved risk governance structures, in particular the availability of consistent risk information, would have helped the bank to more fully realise the amount and nature of the risk it was accumulating at an earlier stage and potentially reduce the impact of the crisis, the bank's fundamental difficulties arose primarily because the strategy did not anticipate the exceptional extent of the reduction in property values combined with the contraction in wholesale money markets.<\/p><p>I personally deeply regret this failure and its consequences.  Notwithstanding the fact that the State has been repaid in full by the bank, I regret that State assistance was required to support the bank and that shareholders lost a significant proportion of their investment in Bank of Ireland.  I am very sorry that this ultimately happened on my watch.  Throughout the 2000s, my colleagues and I, together with the board, made judgments based on what we genuinely believed were solid grounds following thorough analysis and significant challenge.  These judgments good or bad, were always made in a considered fashion and in good faith.  It is encouraging today to see Bank of Ireland make significant progress in its own recovery and in the recovery of the Irish economy.  The State's support for the bank at a pivotal point in its history has been profoundly instrumental in facilitating this recovery.

You've picked out a segment of the Bank of Ireland balance sheet here.  At 30 September 2008, Bank of Ireland had total loans of &euro;145 billion.  Residential mortgages made up 44% of that; property and construction, 26%; SME and corporate lending, 25%; and consumer and other, 5%.  I should also add that of the &euro;145 billion, 43% was in Ireland, 49% was in the UK, and 8% was broadly in the rest of Europe and in the US.  I don't believe that Bank of Ireland was disproportionately exposed or active in the property and construction sector.  I think the issue that affected the Bank of Ireland was the absolute amount in money terms of that exposure.  Bank of Ireland had quite a broadly diversified loan book in its totality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015043000002#F01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Goggin"},{"type":"speech","time":1430348400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Sure.

Property and construction, I think, as you indicated, was &euro;38 billion.  65% of that was in investment property, property that was generating a contracted rental flow and, you know, stood on its own feet.  Of the &euro;38 billion, &euro;13 billion was in land and development.  And, even again, I think you'd need to look behind that.  &euro;5.4 billion of that &euro;13 billion was in land bank.  I think that is where the real problem was - in land bank, but it's interesting in terms of just looking at that aspect of the risk portfolio.  Pricewaterhouse conducted a review for the Financial Regulator and it looked at the top 30 land bank transactions in the period 2005 to 2007.  To reinforce Bank of Ireland's relative conservatism, Bank of Ireland's share of those 30 largest land bank transactions was 3.5%.  I'm not excusing the fact that Bank of Ireland got into difficulty and required assistance.  I mean that's a matter of record.

And my recollection also is that the original concept of NAMA, and I was retired when NAMA was created, but my recollection was that NAMA was to acquire assets from the banks at medium-term economic value.  I'm not sure, looking back on it, that the discounts applied, and they obviously would've varied by bank, reflected medium-term economic value.  Maybe what we're actually seeing today is more reflective of medium-term economic value.  But look, the bottom line is, the discounts were significant.

Thank you, Chairman.  What I was trying to explain to you, Deputy - and I'll be as full on this as I can be - prior to 2005-06 all of the discretionary bonus was determined by profit.  The reason that it changed in 2005-06 was to align the incentive structure directly to the strategy that I implemented.  And if you recall the comments I made in my opening remarks, I said that the Bank of Ireland Group faced a number of issues when I took over as chief executive.  Its total shareholder return was in decline, it had a multiplicity of different systems and processes, its costs were out of line.  So, I put in place a very comprehensive strategy to deal with that and I wanted to ensure that the top executives were motivated and incentivised to deliver on that plan.  And that's why I removed the 100% profit as a determinant of profit ... of bonus, and I switched the bank in the first year to 70%.  And it gradually declined, as you've correctly pointed out, because the plan began to deliver.  It was a three-year plan.  The plan began to deliver on the costs.

The response by Bank of Ireland to those findings I have here.  It didn't come in my core documents but I requested it of the bank and I can read the answer to you because it deals with these specific issues, just the Bank of Ireland specific issues.  In terms of credit reviews, M1:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>Bank of Ireland corporate banking would stress that when it reviews all borrowing relationships, connected exposures are grouped and clearly highlighted in the credit papers.  The BOI corporate banking credit unit and\/or credit committee therefore have full visibility on the complete risk picture.  There are, however, limited situations where exposures are linked by a common shareholder who, indeed, may only have a minority stake in the borrowing vehicle.  Where Bank of Ireland corporate banking aggregates these lines with the other exposures for reporting purposes, there may be no financial dependence on that minority shareholder for the connected risk.  For these reasons, Bank of Ireland corporate banking believe its approach in these limited situations of aggregating the exposures and reviewing the risks separately is prudent and it can assure the Financial Regulator that where a credit issue arises in a linked exposure, it is promptly reviewed and dealt with, bearing in mind the overall connected limits.  <\/blockquote>And in relation to M2, the response reads:<blockquote>Since credit committee on 30 August 2007, Bank of Ireland corporate banking has exited the [blank] and has achieved a significant reduction in exposure and the risk on the residual facilities remains within tightly controlled parameters.  The strategy remains one of prudence and risk containment to this connection.<\/blockquote>So we substantially exited that connection.  And the frequency of reviews by private banking, the Financial Regulator's recommendation is accepted and agreed.  That was the formal Bank of Ireland response to those issues, Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015043000002#BB02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Goggin"},{"type":"speech","time":1430348400,"counter":864,"content":"<p>NAMA faced a problem though later on to the tune of &euro;26 million for properties and lenders where the security wasn't as secure as it should have been, and-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015043000002#BB02200","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430348400,"counter":865,"content":"<p>In relation to Bank of Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015043000002#BB02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Goggin"},{"type":"speech","time":1430348400,"counter":866,"content":"<p>Yes.

What gave me some comfort in dealing with the liquidity issues that were emerging, and this point in particular, was that Bank of Ireland had a substantial source of collateral for posting with the ECB in the event it was required.  We had substantial mortgage businesses both in Ireland and the UK and we went to considerable efforts to develop pools of non-mortgage loans into securitisation-ready packages that would have enabled us to access even greater funding again.

Could I ask everybody to take their seats as we are about to commence?  Thank you very much.  Good afternoon and you are all very welcome, but before we formally commence the proceedings, a little bit of housekeeping.  Perhaps, as a sign of the era in which we live, you might all wish to check your mobile phone to ensure that it is either switched off or is on silent.  Secondly, you will observe the exits, behind you in here and one here, should it be necessary for us to vacate the hall unexpectedly.  Okay?<\/p> <p>  My name is Brendan Halligan.  I am the chairman of the Institute of International and European Affairs, which is hosting this event here today.  And the institute is delighted to welcome Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet, former President of the ECB, to deliver a lecture, to which there will be two respondents.  The institute, for its part, is very proud of the key role it plays in informing decisions about Ireland's strategic decisions, direction, its policies and its investments.  Our distinguished visiting speakers provide a vital complement to our own research programmes, and this year, for example, we have provided in-depth analysis from an Irish perspective on Britain and Europe, the dangers inherent in the potential British withdrawal.  Equally, our work on banking union has brought compliments from across the European financial services industry and our work on climate change is, of course, renowned.  We ... all of us live in political and economic times of great complexity and, indeed, uncertainty.  The institute understands this context and its implications.  Hopefully, we are acknowledged and appreciated because we narrow the assumptions which underpin the most effective strategic planning.<\/p> <p>  Today, as I said, our guest is Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet, former President of the European Central Bank and an honorary governor of the Banque de France.  He is presently chairman of the Group of Thirty, based in Washington, which aims to deepen understanding of international economic and financial issues, to explore the international repercussions of decisions taken in the public and private sectors, and to examine the choices available to market practitioners and policymakers.  He is also chairman of the Bruegel Institute, the leading economic think-tank in Brussels with whom we have a collaborative relationship, and he is chairman of the Trilateral Commission for Europe.  He is also a member of the Institut de France.  He was born in Lyon.  He is an honorary inspecteur g&eacute;n&eacute;rale des finances, an ing&eacute;nieur civil des mines.  He is a graduate of the &Eacute;cole Nationale Sup&eacute;rieure des Mines de Nancy and of the Institut d&rsquo;&Eacute;tudes Politiques de Paris in economics, and of the &Eacute;cole Nationale d&rsquo;Administration, the famous ENA, which some say governs France.  In 1978 he was made an adviser to the Minister for economic affairs and was appointed adviser to the President of the republic.  In '87, he became director of the treasury and an alternative governor of the International Monetary Fund and of the World Bank.  He was appointed governor of the Banque de France in 1993 and became a member of the council of the European Monetary Institute, the precursor of the ECB, from 1994 to 1998, and thereafter a member of the governing council of the ECB.  He was reappointed for a second term as governor of the Banque de France.  In October 2003, he was appointed President of the European Central Bank for a term of eight years, ending on 31 October 2011.  In late 2010 until the end of October, he was also chairman of the European Systemic Risk Board, the ESRB.  He is a commandeur de la L&eacute;gion d&rsquo;honneur and has been honoured by governments of Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and Portugal in Europe and many others besides, and, of course, by universities, research institutes and business organisations worldwide.<\/p> <p>  Our institute had the honour of first receiving him in November 1997 in his capacity as governor of the Banque de France when he spoke on EMU, the final preparations.  We received him for the second time in February 2009, this time in his capacity as President of the ECB, when he spoke on the external and internal dimensions of Europe's competitiveness and during the visit, he engaged in widespread discussions with the Irish policy community and Irish policy leaders.<\/p> <p>  So today we are privileged to welcome you back for the third time, on this occasion in a personal capacity to speak on the governance of the eurozone, past, present and future, this lecture being part of a series we have already initiated on international economics and finance, the first speaker of which was only as late as last Tuesday, the governor of the Central Bank of Iceland.  So it gives me great pleasure now to call upon Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet to address us on the topic of the Governance of the Eurozone: Past, Present and Future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015043000002#BBB00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Halligan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430348400,"counter":992,"content":"<p>Dear chairman, dear members of the Institute of International and European Affairs, dear panellists, dear Members of the Irish Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, it is for me an immense pleasure and a great honour to be here today for the third time, first and foremost, to acknowledge the major achievements made in just four and a half years by your country.  Ireland returned to market financing well before the end of the programme in end 2013.  The stability of the banking system has been largely restored and, most importantly, since 2014 the economy has been recovering at an impressive pace, to the benefit of the Irish people.  I'm also here because the crisis Ireland has been through has caused considerable hardship and much about the causes of that crisis still needs to be fully understood and explained.  This is very important, not least as we all want to ensure that our economies become less vulnerable and better prepared to weather future adverse shocks.  I hope that by offering my thoughts today, listening to your concerns and answering questions, I can play a part in that process.  You will be familiar - but we are very familiar I have to say in the rest of Europe - with the story of the tourist in a remote area in Ireland who asks a local for directions to Dublin and the Irishman says, &ldquo;Well, if I were you, I would not start from here.&rdquo;<\/p><p>When the crisis started in mid-2007 and then exploded with the Lehman failure in 2008, many policy makers had the very same feeling: starting from here it's terribly difficult.<br\/><br\/>From my perspective as President of the ECB, I remember clearly the huge uncertainty about where we were and which direction we should head in.  I remain convinced that had central banks across the globe in the advanced economies not come together to chart a course out of the crisis, the outcome could have been a repeat, if not worse, of the '30s.  To sum up, we had experienced the worse crisis since World War II, could have been the worst crisis since World War I, with a great global depression and not only a global recession.<br\/><br\/>For policy makers in Ireland, I am sure there was similar uncertainty as the consequences of the burst of the property bubble flared up around them.  The banking system was severely affected and real GDP contracted by 9% between 2008 and 2010, led by a 41% collapse in investment.  As a result, the public debt level exploded from around 25% before the crisis to a level of almost 90% of the GDP by 2010.  On the other hand, contrary to most other stressed European economies, the price competitiveness of the Irish economy, which had strongly deteriorated in the pre-crisis years, had by 2010 already significantly improved.  It is important to remember that this painful adjustment had, to a remarkable extent, happened already before<i><\/i>the financial assistance programme that started at the end of 2010 when both fiscal sustainability and the viability of the banking system came simultaneously under question. <br\/><br\/>At the same time, in the euro area, the crisis revealed major deficiencies in its governance, ranging from the refusal by some member states to comply with the fiscal rules of the Stability and Growth Pact to a benign neglect of the major divergences in price and cost competitiveness, from the absence of a crisis management and resolution framework, and, finally, to the lack of a banking union.  A lot of progress has been made since then in Ireland, in Europe and at the global level.  Against this backdrop, my thoughts today will focus on Ireland and the euro area, with main focus on the past, present and future of their governance. <br\/><br\/>And if you wish, I will commence by the past: governance failures at the heart of the crisis.  Looking back to the years preceding the crisis, the Irish economy experienced the build-up of large imbalances that eventually inflicted serious damage on the economy.  This was partly driven by the decade long upswing in the financial cycle, which was, of course, a global phenomenon, but the fact that this cycle was so pronounced in Ireland compared with many other countries suggests that this is not in itself a sufficient explanation.  As I will argue, specific failures in domestic macroeconomic and financial governance played also a very important role.  Before elaborating on this point, I should stress up front that weaknesses in European governance and its implementation also contributed to the crisis, though the main reason for the associated high costs lies in my view with national governments and, of course, not only Ireland, many national governments. <br\/><br\/>On the European governance and national responsibilities, I would say that the institutional architecture of the euro area, when it was launched in '99, was incomplete, mainly as it did not foresee that national policies could have led unsustainable imbalances to build up.  It has been observed that this was also the result of the fact that several recommendations to strengthen economic governance beyond the fiscal framework by developing the EMU- Economic and Monetary Union which ... this call was made in the Delors report but they were not incorporated in the treaty signed in Maastricht in 1992 because this treaty concentrated on the fiscal governance and not in the economic governance at large.<br\/><br\/>Policy makers made one mistake in the period of benign neglect that preceded the crisis:  They were wrongly convinced that the normal functioning of the economies in a single currency area would always provide for the &quot;competition channel&quot; to foster appropriate and timely corrections in the national real economy in case relative cost and price competitiveness would deviate from the average.  This assumption proved right in a number of cases in Europe, but certainly not for all euro area countries.  And if I sum up the weaknesses that I see in the governance framework, I would say that there are three broad areas which are affecting themselves the Irish situation in their own way, even if they were affecting, of course, the euro area as a whole.<br\/><br\/>First, the Stability and Growth Pact, SGP, was not properly implemented.  The &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; of the pact was severely undermined when the large countries, namely France and Germany, under the Presidency of Italy opposed the full implementation of the SGP in 2003 and 2004.  If the SGP had worked as anticipated and debt levels had been lower, the consequences of the financial and sovereign debt crisis would have been less severe.  So, I know the point.  It is extremely important.  In my first speech in front of the European Parliament at the end of 2003 was to defend the Stability and Growth Pact at the time.  I would say that if all euro area countries would have lived up to their promises, the crisis would not have begun with such a grave situation in Greece nor spread so dramatically across countries, including, even if it was not the case of Ireland because, as I already said, Ireland started the crisis with a very low level of debt outstanding, but, of course, the level of the crisis and the spreading of the crisis as a whole, it played an important role.<br\/><br\/>Second, there was no macroeconomic surveillance mechanism to prevent divergence in competitiveness levels and the build-up of imbalances, particularly external imbalances as well as domestic imbalances.  Such a framework, if effective, could have drawn attention to the excessive wage and unit labour cost developments in several countries, including in Ireland, at a much earlier stage.  Already in '05, long before the crisis, the ECB considered that on top of the loose implementation of the SGP, the main economic challenge in the euro area was the significant loss of relative competitiveness of a number of euro area countries and the ensuing constantly growing domestic and external imbalances.  As there was no established, according to the secondary legislation of the euro area surveillance of these divergences, I decided to draw the attention of the Ministers of Finance every month, systematically, since 2005 - so a long time before the crisis &ndash; by circulating the national evolutions of unit labour costs, the nominal evolution of costs in the private and in the public sectors, and the positions of the various national current accounts.  I have to say that these systematic warnings, which were repeated every month, were ignored as long as there was no financial crisis.<br\/><br\/>Third, and it is also important, there was no European framework to monitor and correct financial imbalances, nor appropriate crisis management and resolution tools to deal with the bank-sovereign nexus.  As a result, capital flowed too easily into countries like Ireland in the upswing, and then, in the downswing, the increasing correlation between the creditworthiness of the banks and the creditworthiness of the sovereign caused capital to flow out extremely quickly, fragmenting the European financial market.  This also seen from the standpoint of the ECB disrupted the transmission of monetary policy.<br\/><br\/>Now let me turn on the role of policies in the case of the Irish crisis.<\/p><p>Again, Ireland was not alone, of course, in this dramatic crisis.<br\/><br\/>First of all, it should be acknowledged that during the pre-crisis years, fiscal and macro-prudential policies in this country were not up to the standard of a country exposed to financial liberalisation in the environment of monetary union.  A consequence of monetary union is that interest rates converge and prevailing rates for the euro area must be attuned to the cycle and the challenges of the area as a whole.  Seen from the monetary policy standpoint, namely, seen from the Governing Council of the ECB, what counts is the entire set of countries, the 330 million people around, that had a stake in the area and not this country or that country.  It goes without saying, we have a single monetary policy.  It is necessarily the same for all and it is designed to deliver price stability, without deflation and without inflation, to the entire euro area.  If it was designed for country A or country B, then all the other countries - we were 15 at the moment of the collapse of Lehman Brothers - all the other countries would protest in saying that the area as a whole must be taken into consideration.  That was very well known and that was really well understood before the euro was introduced but of course, the responsibility of the national policies is of course very important in such an environment.<br\/><br\/>At the moment of the crisis we had a toxic dynamic which was aggravated by a feedback loop, whereby the combination of a rapid increase of unit labour costs and the credit boom contributed to higher inflation in Ireland than in the euro area average before the crisis.  This in turn led real interest rates to fall significantly below the euro area average.  Of course it was fuelling the incentives to borrow, so credit to the private sector increased by 20% per year between 2002 and 2007, creating major vulnerabilities in the financial sector.  Needless to say, the credit boom contributed to wider vulnerabilities.  Above all, the economy, but you know that very well of course, became overly reliant on the construction sector as a driver of growth and employment and as a source of Government revenue. <br\/><br\/>By 2006 roughly half of fiscal revenues were from capital taxes largely linked to the construction sector, and the expenditure side of the budget was based on the assumption that those revenues would continue to flow forever.  A prudent fiscal policy would have realised that the underlying fiscal deficits were much higher than those reported in real time.  However, the total expenditure on compensation of employees in the public sector grew by close to 200% between 1998 and 2008, compared to the euro area figure average of around 45%.  And we are speaking of the same currency, the euro, with the same international purchasing power but also the same international cost.<br\/><br\/>Turning to micro-prudential policies, that is financial supervision, similar failings materialised before the crisis.  There are two very important reports analysing the origins of the Irish crisis: the so-called Nyberg report and the Honohan report.  These reports document well the deficiencies in national banking regulation and supervision during the boom years, where financial stability risks were underestimated.  I have to make a point also there - at the time, as you well know, the European Central Bank had no responsibility at all for banking supervision or for macro-prudential policies in member states.  This changed after the crisis as a lesson learned from the crisis.  But I would say that the principle-based approach to supervision, which was dominating at the time, assumed implicitly that banks would control their risk-taking as long as they are properly governed.  It resulted in a much stronger focus on processes than on real outcomes, and what I would call an inadequate treatment and assessment of the risks taken by financial institutions.<br\/><br\/>Burgeoning credit growth and the consequent expansion of banks&rsquo; balance sheets should have been causes for concern in themselves, but that this expansion gave rise to highly concentrated exposures to the construction sector and the property sector should have sounded the alarm.  We have to recognise - but it's easy to do that now, it was more difficult to do that in real time - and this is good for Ireland, as well as for the entire financial sector in the advanced economy, we had unsustainable bank funding models.  <br\/><br\/>Let me go now to a very, very important issue that has been discussed of course, thoroughly, which is the guarantee.  It was also because of these unsustainable funding models that when the Lehman shock hit, a further prudential decision was taken.  This decision, which would have very momentous consequences, was the introduction in 2008 of the Credit Institutions Financial Support CIFS scheme, better known as the guarantee, quote, unquote.  As I said, this was to a significant extent a response to mounting, dramatic funding pressures on the Irish banking sector.  And I must admit that, given the very difficult situation at that time, one could understand why such a decision was taken - also taking into account that all the big countries, after the sub-prime crisis and bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, were about to give at that time some kind of blanket political guarantee to their own systemic banks, to make the private sector aware of the fact that they were behind their systemic financial institutions.  But it is also important that the guarantee was introduced by the Irish Government without any co-ordination with the ECB or with any other European partners, and I was the witness of that, or any other international partner.  The ECB, shortly after the fact, was critical of some aspects of the guarantee, as can be inferred by reading our legal opinions at the time.  As we know, the guarantee triggered later an intense negative spiral between the banking sector on the one hand and the sovereign creditworthiness.<br\/><br\/>By late 2010, the imminent expiry of the original two-year guarantee - which in the meantime had been partially superseded by the so-called eligible liabilities guarantee, ELG, had left the Irish authorities in an extremely difficult situation.  The so-called CIFS cliff, the wave of debt maturing in September 2010 issued under the guarantee, confirmed Ireland&rsquo;s loss of access to sovereign markets.  Combined with other factors, such as the ever-worsening fiscal situation, the Irish Government was confronted with no alternative but to ask for official support.  At the same time, it should not be overlooked that over the period 2009 to 2011 the holders of subordinated debt issued by Irish banks incurred substantial losses, what we now call burden-sharing, in the order of &euro;14 billion.  In the same vein, shareholders&rsquo; write-downs exceeded &euro;29 billion.  As such, the private investors in the Irish banking system endured, of course, considerable losses, as is normal.  <br\/><br\/>In this context the issue arose, which is being discussed in Ireland as regards the legacy of the crisis, on how to treat the senior bondholders of the banks that were receiving public support.  The ECB&rsquo;s view was at the time, and still is, that a number of factors made this option extremely risky for Ireland.  Before recalling the ECB view however, let me stress that the ECB simply gave advice<i><\/i>on this issue.  The ECB indeed doesn't have any authority to issue instructions to euro area governments or to ministers.<\/p><p>Accordingly, the decisions on the modalities for the resolution of Irish banks were taken, and that goes without saying, by the Irish authorities.  <br\/><br\/>Now, nevertheless, I would like to expose to you the main arguments that we see in the ECB for your consideration, the main argument that explains the decision of the Government of Ireland at the time.  First, it is very simple to read what happened with today's glasses.  One has to remember the situation at the time.  There were neither clear rules back then nor precedent in mature economies for how burden-sharing with senior private creditors should take place.  The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) was only adopted in April 2014.  And this lack of rules on how to deal with heavily distressed financial institutions, coupled with the very high uncertainty at the time, meant that the situation in financial markets was extremely volatile and that is why all the leaders of the major advanced economies had given the blanket political guarantee that I was mentioning.  This ... especially after the so-called &quot;Deauville Declaration&quot; in October 2010, market concerns that possible future bailouts may involve burden-sharing even with senior private investors caused a dramatic surge in yields in stressed euro area countries, first and foremost in Ireland.  I remember well the concerns expressed in those very difficult days by Minister Brian Lenihan, to whom I would like to pay tribute today and with whom I had constantly, in those dramatic circumstances, a very close and confident co-operation.  As you know, Brian passed over and he was attacked by a terrible disease precisely in this traumatic period.  These concerns were formulated in a letter Brian wrote to me on 4 November 2010.  That letter was made public, and I could quote a passage from the letter.  And it is Brian Lenihan, the Minister for Finance of Ireland writing:<blockquote>...it is very noticeable that over recent days the widening in spreads has accelerated on the basis of speculation on the conditions that may be necessary to apply to the debt of countries accessing the European Financial Stability Facility and reported policy comments of senior political figures.  It is the case that many market commentators attribute these comments as being the primary driver of the increased spreads of peripheral countries, including Ireland, in recent days. <\/blockquote>Let me also stress that Ireland, in particular, was very vulnerable to an escalation of market tensions and financial instability at that very juncture.  It is no exaggeration to say that the nature of the crisis facing Ireland, and, in particular, its banks in late '10 was more acute than in any other country.<br\/><br\/>Second, it should not be overlooked that the introduction of the CIFS guarantee scheme had, effectively, limited the potential for any burden-sharing for the two-year period of its validity.  This means that, apart from any other consideration, the guarantee had prevented the Irish Government from fully bailing-in its senior bondholders in the Anglo Irish Bank well before the start of the programme.  And when, by late '10, the CIFS was succeeded by the ELG scheme, which relaxed this limitation, the potential scope for burden-sharing had been reduced considerably because the stock of outstanding debt had fallen.<br\/><br\/>Third ... and I think I have also to mention that by late '10, Ireland was facing a trade-off between large financial stability risks whose materialisation could have in the end impacted more dramatically the real economy and the citizens of Ireland even more profoundly than what had been experienced, and the trade-off would be with the potential gains from burning the senior bondholders.  The consensus view - and I reiterate it was still a consensus in late '10 - was that burden-sharing with senior bank holders at such a critical juncture was too risky to countenance.  It was a consensus view, in my own observation, in Europe, it was a consensus view at the global level so it was not the Europeans which were at stake.<br\/><br\/>When burden-sharing was discussed later ... and I was speaking of '10, now I go to spring '11, with the new Government, it was made clear by the Irish authorities that they didn't wish to pursue the issue of burden-sharing with the so-called pillar banks, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland.  These banks had a retail deposit base that had remained relatively stable during the years of turbulence and acted as a stabilising force.  And that is important to note, that during this dramatic period, the creditworthiness of these institutions, so-called pillar banks, had been maintaining order.  And, of course, it was because appropriate decisions were taken by the successive Governments.  These banks ... anything that could have undermined confidence or called into question the safety of those deposits and led to outflows would have been, you know, placing additional funding and would have created deleveraging pressure on the system, which was already under significant pressure.  And if that had happened, reliance of Central Bank funding would likely have increased further.  This would have resulted in greater recourse to emergency liquidity assistance, ELA, which, from an economic perspective, implies a higher level of contingent debt on the sovereign.  Above some threshold, this could have further affected confidence in sovereign debt sustainability and, hence, confidence in the deposit guarantee.  <br\/><br\/>All in all - and I have referred to the consensus in Europe, the consensus in the world - the ECB assessment at the time was, and with the benefit of hindsight still is - that the repercussions from bailing-in senior bondholders may have far outweighted the gains, or the potential gains.  This is the reason why I think that the Government of Ireland was right to take this difficult decision.  More generally, the actions taken by the Irish authorities during the programme laid the foundations for the significant and rapid rebound in confidence in the Irish banking system, in the Irish sovereign and in the Irish economy.  And this confidence is a whole ... confidence was shared by the three, I would say, constituencies I have just mentioned.  And it is that confidence which makes, clearly, Ireland the major success of the very dramatic adjustment through which a number of countries had to go through in the crisis.  And, again, in the crisis that did not start here but came here dramatically.  <br\/><br\/>Now, let me turn to the present: reforms and recovery.  Fortunately, much has happened in the euro area, especially in Ireland, since those difficult days in '10 and '11.  At the European level also, considerable work has gone into addressing the governance weaknesses, and some major steps forward have been taken in terms of European integration.  Jean Monnet's observation that &quot;Europe will be forged in crises&quot; has proved true again, which doesn't mean that we should be happy with the crisis, but it's clear that a number of decisions were taken in the crisis.  In Ireland, the &quot;r&quot; of reforms has been noticeably coupled with the &quot;r&quot; of recovery, with remarkable outcomes and very important lessons for other European countries.  And this has to be said very clearly.  <br\/><br\/>Now, at the European level, we have reinforced the Stability and Growth Pact.  We have now the &quot;two-packs&quot; and the &quot;six-packs&quot;, which have given the Commission and the EU Council more tools to ensure sound fiscal policies.  As important as the reinforcement of the SGP has been the setting up, in my own vision, for the first time, of a distinct instrument to survey competitiveness developments and macroeconomic imbalances.  We call that the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure, MIP.  Retain this acronym.  MIP is as important as SGP.<\/p><p>It is, what lacked at the very beginning of the euro area ... the absence of surveillance of relative competitiveness.  So we have that now.  SGP re-enforced, MIP setting up... set up from scratch.  And we have the banking union, moreover, which represents a strengthening of the financial framework, moving away from the ... what was existing before with the total segmentation between the various nations of the surveillance.  The single supervisory mechanism lowers the risk of national forbearance for both micro and macro-prudential supervision.  And with the single resolution mechanism, we now have a comprehensive toolkit for dealing with failing banks, including clear procedures and a clear waterfall approach to bail-in liabilities which is known ... <i>ex ante<\/i>.  This, together with the, as I said already, SGP and MIP, should help ensure that if banks fail, they don't bring down their sovereigns with them.<br\/><br\/>Well, living through such dramatic events, one does not always appreciate their significance.  An I believe that the pace and the scope of institutional reform that the euro area has seen since 2010 will, one day, be considered historical by historical standards.  As noted by Herman Van Rompuy, it took only 15 years from the creation of the ... of ... after the creation of the euro area to create a single European banking supervision.  In the United States of America, it took something like 150 years after the creation of the US dollar.  It is not to say that we are very happy with what has happened, it is to say that undoubtedly the Europeans have been ... tried to be up to the lessons of the crisis.  But, I have to say that, of course, we should not be complacence in any respect.  I am well aware of the ... governance reforms are not solving all our problems.  I see that the sole implementation of what has been decided is not easy, in particular, despite all the lessons of the crisis, the SGP.  I see also that the MIP is not considered as it should ... as a major governance pillar for the Europeans but, again, we have to insist and stress how important it is to apply by the rule.  And the rules were just re-enforced after the crisis.<br\/><br\/>Now let me concentrate a little bit on progress in Ireland and the contribution from the euro system.  Progress in Ireland ... many reforms have been implemented in recent years to reverse the macroeconomic vulnerabilities that built up before the crisis - and a lot of headway has been made.  These measures have been in large part driven by the Irish people themselves.  I have to pay homage to the Ministers, Governor, Prime Minister who have led the country through the programme and post-programme phases until today.  They had to cope with huge global, European and ... national challenges and they succeeded.  A few examples.  Fiscal strategy has benefitted from the plans devised by the Irish authorities prior to entering the programme.  This ultimately ensured a very high degree of national ownership and underpinned the credibility of the consolidation strategy.  The need for fiscal adjustment was enormous at the very beginning of the programme and we had a the fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio, excluding the cost of financial support, which was around 11% of the GDP.  Everybody can see that at the end of the programme it had declined down to 5.8%.  And recent forecasts point to the conclusion that in '15 it will be well below the 3% reference value.  So, there you see the progress.<br\/><br\/>Structural reforms have also played a role in the turnaround in this country.  Ireland already had a fairly flexible economy before the programme, with measures of business conditions consistently ranking amongst the top countries in the world.  The programme concentrated mainly on tackling the massive increase in unemployment during the crisis - to around 15%.  It is noteworthy that, unlike in some other stressed countries, unemployment levelled off and then began to fall already ... already in the first quarter of 2012, thanks to the flexibility of the Irish economy.  To the decisions taken in ... spontaneously, if I may, in the private sector and with a full understanding by all Irish citizens that what was necessary to do precisely to get competitiveness and, through competitiveness, jobs.  The financial sector measures programme had been a cornerstone of the recovery in the Irish financial sector.  The liquidity and funding assessment helped produce a more appropriately sized banking sector and improved the sustainability of bank funding models.  All those ... progress has been confirmed by results of the balance sheet assessment conducted at the end of the programme ... by the end of the programme in '13 and the ECB's comprehensive assessment in '14.  I would say ... and, again, we should never be complacent, but the overall restructuring of the Irish banks has resulted in a smaller, stable sector, more... much more focused than before on the domestic economy, as it should.<br\/><br\/>Last but not least, the European Central Bank has also played its role in supporting the Irish economy through this difficult period.  It helped prevent the financial crisis - starting in '08-'09 - from turning into a dramatic great depression - like in the '30s.  I mention this ... ECB, because we are in Europe.  I should mention also the other major central banks which took extraordinarily  important decisions.  On many occasions after the start of the crisis, the ECB intervened to uphold the integrity of the euro area and remove fears of a break-up - an event from which all Member States would have suffered ... suffered hugely.  Let me here just mention, amongst several standard and non-standard measures, the full allotment, at fixed rate, under monetary policy operations, which we started 9 August 2007 - so before Lehman Brothers and at the moment of the ... I would say, start of the so called sub-prime crisis.  I would mention also the securities market programme introduced in May '10 and through which we purchased the treasuries of three countries - including Ireland, in May '10 - in order to show that we are caring for ... helping to restore a better transmission of monetary policy in Ireland, which was particularly shocked by the crisis ... as two other countries.  The two other countries were Greece and Portugal at the time.  We renewed the SMP purchases in August '11, and we purchased again some Irish securities  And, of course, the announcement of the outright monetary transactions in summer of 2012, which was an off-balance sheet, if I may, commitment also designed to help restore a better transmission of the monetary policy.<br\/><br\/>For Ireland in particular, the euro system has provided unambiguously positive support.  The level of liquidity provided by euro system to the Irish economy was simply extraordinary.  And I would ... only for you to have the order of magnitude in mind.  And, again, the paradox there exists in criticising the ECB for not having sufficiently supported Ireland.  The figures are the following.  At a time ... in the heat of the crisis, 25% of the total refinancing ... total support by the euro system to Ireland ... 25% of the total refinancing for the euro area as a whole was for Ireland.  When Ireland, of course, has a very small proportion of the GDP of the euro area and 1% of the capital of the ECB - 25%.  If the United States of America, would have asked the Fed to do for the United States what we have done for Ireland, then they would ask for 100% of the GDP support.  And 100% of the GDP support is not $4 trillion, as is the case in the piling up of the QE, successive QE.<\/p><p> It would be something like the GDP of the US, namely, something like $13 trillion not $4 trillion, $13 trillion.  So you see what has been done for Ireland for very good reason, I don't regret that in any respect.  We had to do that, we did that and it proved to be a full success, thanks to you.  But remember that, this is very, very important to have in mind you had our full support from the ECB, not only at the level of Europe but also full support in taking some kind of global benchmark.  That being said, a central bank can only lend to banks that are solvent and have good collateral.  When these conditions are no longer met, we have, in the central banking, a legal duty to make that clear, which we did through my letter to Minister Lenihan on 19 November 2010.  This letter has been published, the exchange of letter, the four letters, so I don&rsquo;t go to that it&rsquo;s already public.  I would only say that this situation, which was extremely grave with a problem of solvency at the level of the banks, was of course due to the underlying weaknesses of the Irish economy, of the financial sector and only, of course, a credible programme and the help of the international, European and international community, could permit Ireland to get out of this dramatic situation. <\/p><p> If we take stock now, we can see that this combination of measures permitted Ireland to correct its very large unsustainable domestic and external imbalances and paved the way for renewed growth and job creation as I already said.  The hard work done, and we have to pay homage to all the Irish citizens that have done this hard work in the fiscal, structural, financial and monetary fields, has paid dividends for Ireland and, as I already said, the strength of Ireland's return to soundness has been impressive.  The ability of the return to market credibility has been impressive with confidence being there and competitiveness has been largely restored.  <\/p><p> Now, In many ways the experience of your country has set an example for other euro area member states.  I would draw, in particular, three broad lessons from your experience for the other Europeans in the euro area.  First, it has shown the advantage of a flexible economy in a monetary union.  While the crisis was particularly severe here, both the real and nominal economic adjustment and the subsequent recovery have been quicker than in other, I would say clearly than in all other countries, and less flexible economies, of course, have experienced much more difficulty.  Second, it has shown the advantage of undertaking necessary yet difficult reforms and fiscal adjustment at an early stage when a crisis hits.  Throughout the programme, Ireland not only took complete ownership but also managed to comply fully with the memorandum of understanding and it was an impressive demonstration of determination and professionalism in the conduct by the nation of the recovery in this difficult time.  I already said that, but the Irish experience has shown the decisive importance of reinforcing confidence.  Confidence is an encompassing concept.  Ireland gained the confidence of the Irish people in the ultimate success of the programme, the confidence of the European friends, the confidence of the international community and the trust of the external savers and investors coming back on top of that.<\/p><p> Now, what are the challenges for the future?  I will be very rapid on that and I think the questions will be numerous in this domain.  I think it is no time for complacency.  We have done a lot at the level of Europe, Ireland has done a lot but it is certainly totally out of question to declare victory, time is not for complacency.  In Ireland, while you know the domestic priorities much better than I, let me briefly recall, in my own understanding, what are the two main challenges.  The first is working through the legacy of the crisis.  Despite the progress in recent years with private sector deleveraging, the debt overhang is still very large.  The level of youth unemployment also remains very high, at around 22% perhaps in the last quarter of 2014 according to statistics.  It is below the euro area average, which is a disgrace, and much below the crisis high in Ireland, which was reached in early 2012, but it remains unacceptable.  Finally, while the situation in the banking sector is improving, there is some way to go in terms of resolving the still-large stock of non-performing loans.  The second challenge is making sure that the right institutions are in place to prevent bubbles from accumulating again.  Despite the reforms of recent years, it would be naive to assume that the Irish growth model is no longer susceptible to boom-bust cycles.  I will not insist on that, I think that giving a prominent role to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is particularly important in order to prevent the return of pro-cyclical budgets.  Fully implementing the macro-prudential measures recently introduced by the Central Bank of Ireland on mortgage lending is also certainly of the essence and very good and intimate and confident co-operation between the Irish staff and ECB staff within the joint supervisory teams of the single supervisory mechanism also of the essence.<\/p><p>  If I turn now to the European governance, I have already mentioned three dimensions where we have made a lot of progress, remains to be fully implemented: the SGP, the MIP and banking union.  But my intimate conviction is that in the longer term, further progress in Europe, in the euro area, have to be made.  First, we could deepen the fiscal dimension of the European Union, more particularly of the euro area, so that the management of the fiscal union would rely not only upon the respect of the SGP rules but also directly on an embryo of federal budget.  Several proposals have been made in this direction, including the transfer at the level of the centre of new responsibilities.  The main difficulty of course relies on making sure that such transfer of national spendings to the central budget would not augment the overall public spendings across all levels of governance in the Union.  Second, we could reinforce the executive branch of the euro area in setting up a minister and ministry of finance of the area.  I made this proposal myself in a speech I delivered in 2011 in Aachen in the occasion of the Charlemagne prize.  I don't insist on that but it is a way to reinforce the executive branch, of the equivalent of the executive branch of the euro area.  Last but not least, I think that one of the major issue for the present governance of the euro area is that we have improved the governance through SGP, MIP, banking union but the democratic accountability and legitimacy of the decisions taken by the European institutions, when they design the recommendations according to those governance pillars, is not perfect.  Nobody can dispute that the Council of Ministers is legitimate.  They are members of legitimate governments, nobody can challenge in my opinion the legitimacy of the Commission, which now goes through a process which is also implying the European Parliament.  Still, I think that it would be necessary, when we have a conflict between the centre and its recommendation, the open institution at the centre, Commission and Council and a particular country, it would be good in my opinion that the country which disagrees with the recommendation made to it could ask for arbitration, for a final say, which could be made by the European Parliament, deciding in a format composed of the Members of Parliament representing the voters of the euro area.  And that final decision should be taken in close, I would say, contact with the national parliament concerned.  So in such a case, we would be sure that the governance function on a way which would be effective, namely, decisions are taken which would be democratic, final say representative of the people of Europe, at least the people of the euro area.<\/p><p>Of course, it would also respect the subsidiarity principle, because it would be activated only in exceptional cases ... absolutely exceptional cases, because it would be a case where there is an open disagreement between the Council and the Commission, on the one hand, and a particular country, on the other hand.  That country asking for the final say being taken by the representative of the people.  I stand ready of course to respond to questions on that particular point.<\/p><p> Let me only conclude what is extremely important is that ... to recognise that the hardship of the crisis ... the global financial crisis which came in Europe ... in Ireland because I ... immediately through the financial channel ... and then was aggravated by the sovereign risk crisis at the end of '09, this hardship has caused for many, many citizens real tragedy but it was not an accident.  It resulted from a series of failures, both domestic and European, and I would say also global level but it is not the subject of my exposition.  What is important today is to be sure that we take all the lessons for the future to fix what needs to be fixed at European-global levels and, of course, at national levels.  But I have to say that when I look at what Ireland succeeded in doing over the past years,  I am confident that, at the level of individual countries, a lot of very, very good ... and I know, better than anybody, very  hard work can be done and be successful.  I thank you very much for your attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015043000002#BBB00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430348400,"counter":999,"content":"<p>President Trichet, I wish to thank you for this very comprehensive and erudite presentation, which remained faithful to its task - that of reviewing the past, assessing the present and shaping the future.

I am not quite sure why I am here today, whether I am the last person who did not say no or I did not say no forcibly enough or what.  But when I woke up this morning I was thinking, you know, I'd love to stay in bed for another hour but I have to get up and write something to say here today.  And Brendan has warned me not to go beyond ten minutes ... so at least I think many of you down here have much more interesting questions and comments to make than I will have to make.<\/p> <p>  I know Jean-Claude for very many years.  I'll just make a few comments about the interaction we have had over the years.  I first met him in 1987, when I was appointed as the Irish representative through the EC monetary committee and Jean-Claude was the head of the French Tr&eacute;sor.  This was all new to me, I had not been at this particular group before.  In fact, I had spent the previous few years as Secretary of the Department of Defence and when I went in ... it's always interesting to see the interaction between different people ... but Jean-Claude was the French representative and Hans Tietmeyer was the German representative.  And I'm not sure whether you remember this or not Jean-Claude, but you used to come under increasing pressure from Hans Tietmeyer to devalue the French franc and you had decided you were going to adopt a strong French franc policy.  And I remember Hans saying to you that you had to devalue the French franc and you absolutely refused, and he said \"If you won't devalue the French franc, I will revalue the Deutschemark\".  And you said to him \"If you revalue the Deutschemark, I'll revalue the French franc on the same day by exactly the same amount\".  This went on, you know, over several months.  And anyway it was a stalemate ... nothing happened.<\/p> <p>  But we came together actually then in 1990.  When the Soviet Union broke up, I got a phone call one time from our then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, who told me that President Mitterand had been in touch with him and felt there should be a new body set up to fund investment in Eastern Europe, in the former Soviet Bloc, and to go over and talk to this man Attali.  I didn't know what I was supposed to be doing and I rang Jean-Claude and he kind of gave me a bit of guidance.  And he met me in his ... the hotel I was staying in and the two of us drove over to Jacques Attali's apartment.  I don't know whether you remember any of this Jean-Claude.  And the problem was that my French wasn't very good.  They were all speaking French.  Attali had two parrots, or some sort of birds anyway, who proceeded to talk as well.  So in the end I said \"Well, look, you'll either have to talk in English or you'll have to talk a lot more slowly because I don't know what I am supposed to be doing\".  Anyway, we eventually met as the 12 member states sat around the table and ... it was kind of an interesting exercise.  We used to meet almost every weekend, trying to sort out a new bank.  And it was actually, I think ... I chaired the EU group, then there was the OECD group, then there was the wider group, which included the Russian Federation and all these other countries.  But we got the thing signed, sealed and delivered by May.  The Irish had the Presidency for the first half of 1990.  We started in January, we had the whole thing done by May.  And the thing was set up very quickly afterwards.  So it was a great success.<\/p> <p>  I had a lot of interaction with Jean-Claude then thereafter in various guises.  I visited him in Bercy when he was the head of the Tr&eacute;sor.  I visited him in the Banc de France when he was Governor of the Bank of France.  I used to meet him on and off but one of the most difficult things was, when the currency crisis broke, and the NTMA was not particularly involved with the banking sector.  But when NAMA was being born, the late Brian Lenihan said to me \"Would you go over and meet Mr. Trichet and tell him that we need an awful lot of money?\", and I said \"Well would it not better if the Central Bank or the Department of Finance went over because it's really up to them?\"  So he said, \"No no, you know him, you go over, you'll be able to persuade him.\"  So anyway, I went in to see Jean-Claude and after the usual pleasantries and telling him where we stood, I said to him \"By the way, we have a bit of an issue here.  We're going to need a fair bit of money in the near future\" and I said \"This is going to be the end of a beautiful friendship\".  I said \"We need about &euro;60 billion.\"  I thought he'd fall off his chair but he didn't.  He just looked at me and we continued on.  We did get an awful lot of money from the ECB, and I think Jean-Claude was always a good friend to us.  Certainly he was ... personally, we have always been very close, so I was delighted to see him again here today.<\/p> <p>  As I said, Brendan has warned me not to go on.  Just to say to you, I was for many years responsible for managing the national debt, both in the Department of Finance and in the NTMA.  And we could never borrow enough money of course, in the State here, to fund our requirements.  So we borrowed in every currency and country that you could think of and we had exposures then in a vast range of different currencies.  The challenge, of course, was to try and manage these so that the cost to us wasn't enormous. Because there was always the risk ... well, first of all, that our currency would devalue, which it did fairly regularly, and secondly, that other currencies would revalue, so we' get a double whammy.  And we tried every imaginable device to try and minimise the exposure we had and the exchange rate, with very mixed results I have to say.  I mean, I became convinced that you couldn't actually predict foreign exchange rates.  So within the EMS then, of course, that provided a certain amount of stability for us because, in theory, the currencies only moved a little bit against each other.  But, of course, you could devalue.  I remember in '92-'93 ... in '92, when the British left the EMS arrangements, we came under ferocious pressure from the international markets.  And I remember ... because they reckoned we were going to be next and they would force us to devalue.  And, you know, when the markets take a view on you, it's very hard to resist.<\/p><p>But anyway, the Central Bank ... there was no good economic reason, we thought, to devalue the Irish pound, and to try and protect the Central Bank by jacking up interest rates to 100% each weekend, you know, to catch the speculators.  Eventually, in early 1993, the clinch point was when the banks threatened to push up mortgage rates, and we think mortgage rates are high now, they were 14% then, and the banks threatened they were going to shove them up to 18%.  And I remember the late Maurice Doyle, who was Governor of the Central Bank, saying, \"Look, we fought the good fight.  There is a point when, you know, courage turns into stupidity and we'd have to agree to a devaluation.\"  So anyway, we devalued the Irish pound by 10% and moved on.<\/p><p> So I was delighted, really, when the single currency came along, because it meant that we could borrow, first of all, at very low rates of interest, and secondly, without any exchange rate risk and the amounts were certainly adequate for our purposes.  We didn't have to go into all these other capital markets again in the future.  So by the time I eventually left the NTMA, towards the end of 2009, our net national debt was down to about 25% of our ... of our, I can't remember if it was GNP or GDP.  But anyway, it was very low.<\/p><p> The real problem was, when we joined the single currency, as I've said many times before, you know, we joined ... we effectively joined a German team or a German, whatever you like to call grouping, but we continued to play by our own rules, and that eventually caught us out, and so we end up in the difficult situation which we found ourselves for the last few years.  Much of it of our own doing, I have to say.  And so be it.  Okay.  So, I've nothing in particular more to say.  I thought Jean-Claude's expos&eacute; of the whole system was extremely interesting and I'm sure that people will pore over every word he said for many years to come and it'll probably end up in all kinds of textbooks.  So thank you all indeed very much and thank you, Jean-Claude, for your very interesting speech.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015043000002#HHH00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michael Somers","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430348400,"counter":1002,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.

It refers to two different levels, the Irish level and the European level.  Part but only part of its focus has been on Ireland's recent past, and I think that focus is entirely understandable.  There has been a lot of controversy, it's fair to say, about the ECB's rule in relation to the bank guarantee.  I think it's fair to say that that discussion has not always been contextualised by an adequate understanding of the positive role that the European Central Bank has had.  The fact that, for example, its liquidity assistance prevented the collapse of the Irish banking sector and with it, the economy.  The fact that it intervened effectively to diffuse a sovereign debt crisis that could've destroyed the eurozone.  The fact that the banking crisis and a sovereign debt crisis never developed into a currency crisis as well.  Now none of that is meant to diminish the importance of the debate about the bank guarantee, but it does put it in its context and I think we do need to remember that context in discussing the role the ECB has played in recent Irish history.<br\/><br\/>President Trichet's paper focuses just as much, however, on the past, present and future of the eurozone and that's appropriate too.  As he points out, since 2010, the eurozone has seen an astonishing level of institutional development.  It is rapidly becoming the focal point of European level constitutional change and indeed, not to put too fine a point on it, the eurozone is developing into the new European Union.  It's vital for us in Ireland to participate fully in the debate about that eurozone, of which of course we are a founding member.  Otherwise, we may miss the larger picture.  Now, given that President Trichet's paper is about euro area governance past, present and future, I'd like to make a few brief observations if I may, in relation to each.  <br\/><br\/>So first of all, what can we say about the past of EMU?  Well firstly, the eurozone, as designed at Maastricht, was and is, like no other area of European Union integration.  For one point, there is a very weak representation of the common interest.  Strikingly, the traditional supranational institutions are weak.  The Commission, which does enjoy an inclusive right of initiative here, is not to the same extent a policy leader.  The European Parliament lacks a role as co-legislator.  It's essentially a junior partner, more a spectator, really, than a player.  And remarkably ... well, there's also &quot;an executive deficit,&quot; to quote Nicolas V&eacute;ron, and remarkably, the euro group of finance ministers is not even an institution in its own right.  Although, it's increasingly important, it's still essentially a forum for discussions.<br\/><br\/>The major institutional exception in this regard is the European Central Bank.  The ECB functions, in effect, as a kind of supranational technocracy.  A trustee for the public good of price stability, which Article 127 of the treaty expressly makes the primary objective of the European system of central banks.  And what we got, at Maastricht in 1993, when it entered into force, was very much an ECB-centric model of EMU.  It's also noticeable that representative institutions, generally, do not take centre stage in the eurozone.  The ECB is independent to an unparalleled degree.  The formerly dominant and famously independent Bundesbank's independence was and is protected only by ordinary German legislation.  In contrast, the ECB's independence is written into the treaties.  It is especially forbidden to take instructions from unions or governments by the treaty.  It is made deliberately very difficult to remove executive board members from office.  And of course, the central bank members on its Governing Council are all themselves representatives of independent institutions.  <br\/><br\/>All that independence reflected two things: a dominant belief in the 1990s in independent central banks to ensure currency stability and also the political reality that Germany, whose participation in the eurozone was necessary in order to give the euro the great significance it has, could not give up Europe's then most stable currency, the Deutsche Mark, without adequate guarantees and stability.  And ECB independence gave it that guarantee.  In any case, this untypical architecture of EMU was its first striking feature.  <br\/><br\/>Secondly, and as President Trichet has correctly identified in his paper, that same institutional architecture of the euro area, when it was launched in 1999, was incomplete.  Although, I'm not sure all of the signatories to the Treaty of Maastricht would have agreed.  It was built with a unified monetary policy represented institutionally by the ECB but a far from unified and indeed, inadequate economic aspect.  To borrow the words of another great Frenchman, Alexandre Lamfalussy, &quot;the M in EMU was far better developed than the E.&quot;<br\/><br\/>Thirdly, the original model of EMU was never going to last and of course, it didn't last.  As Jean Pisani-Ferry has written:<blockquote>Governance by rules and procedures [and that was the original Maastricht model] can work fine in fair weather conditions, but it cannot be relied on in stormy weather.  That kind of weather requires leadership, it requires innovation, and it requires change.<\/blockquote>And of course we got the perfect storm of the banking and sovereign debt crisis to drive real change in Europe.<br\/><br\/>President Trichet quoted in his paper, the Jean Monnet observation that Europe would be forged in crisis.  Monnet also added that Europe would be the sum of the solutions to those crises.  And that's how exactly how things have worked out.  As President Trichet observes in his paper, the pace and scope of institutional reform that the euro area has seen since 2010 has been remarkable by diplomatic standards.  Although it's fair to say, it didn't seem that way at the time judged by the demands of rapidly changing international markets.  It, at times, seemed painfully slow and very last minute in nature, but it came.<\/p><p>And that leads us on to the present of the eurozone  - where are we now?  And the answer is that we are in a quite different place to where we were before.  I would see three huge changes.  Institutionally, we've seen the creation of bailout funds undreamt of, indeed, thought by some to be illegal at the time of Maastricht.  We saw, first of all, the two temporary funds, the EFSM, the EFSF and now the permanent European stability mechanism, now, of course, given the imprimatur of the European Court of Justice in the Pringle case.  That's a &euro;500 trillion institution ready to lend to sovereigns and, if necessary, recapitalise banks to rescue them from insolvency.<\/p><p> Secondly, we have seen the SGP transformed into a vastly more comprehensive, if still not proven, suite of budgetary legislation in the form of the six-pack, the two-pack and the fiscal stability treaty and that, of course, takes into the macro-economic and balances procedure and the European semester.<\/p><p> And thirdly, we have seen the creation of a European banking union, including a single supervisory mechanism and a single resolution mechanism involving the very new role of banking supervisor for the ECB.  <\/p><p> We have also seen the ECB, however, take on an evolving and at times controversial role.  It has played a key role in efforts to re-establish economic, financial and fiscal stability.  I'm not sure that every signatory to the Maastricht treaty anticipated the extent to which the ECB would be so involved and, indeed, it's noticeable that despite the importance of financial stability as a classic central banking tool, the drafters of the Maastricht treaty didn't include that as an objective of the ECB, although they did give it some legitimatising mention in the treaty.  Overall, however, and fortunately, they left the ECB the legal flexibility to act subject, I should say in that regard, to what the ECJ decides in the Gauweiler case in which the outright monetary transactions policy is being challenged but the advocate general has already reported in that case and expressed approval of the OMT programme.<\/p><p> So that's the past and the present. What can we say about the future of EMU?  As Mr. Jean Pisani-Ferry, another Frenchman, has written most, perhaps not all, but most of the architects of the euro, expected monetary unification to be a stepping stone.  In other words, they regarded choices made at the time of the Maastricht treaty, namely monetary union without a significant federal budget, limited co-ordination of budgetary and structural policies, no integrated financial supervision, no strong political counterpart to the central bank, as temporary.  They regarded these things as temporary and that's where president Trichet's paper is particularly interesting.  It contains, as we have heard, suggestions of three kinds.  First of all, suggestions aimed at securing the economic viability of the eurozone as a single currency area.   So, Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet makes suggestions concerning an embryonic federal budget, possibly centralising, for instance, part of unemployment insurance.  And I think, surely, if one is seeking to safeguard a currency union against asymmetric shocks, the development of some kind of federal budget, at least initially embryonic, is a step we have to be thinking about, instead of the current exclusive reliance on strict budgetary discipline to provide member states with the latitude to dig themselves out of difficulty alone, albeit aided, if necessary, by eurozone level loans.<\/p><p> Secondly, ... yes ... one minute.  That's all I need.<\/p><p> Secondly, we see suggestions aimed at remedying the ongoing institutional deficit at eurozone level.  There is no doubt, I think, that the eurozone is inadequately institutionally served.  It suffers from an executive deficit and weak representation of the general European interest.  The Eurogroup of eurozone finance Ministers, for example, don't even enjoy the decision-making capacity of the ECOFIN Council at EU level, so I think the setting up of a eurozone ministry and minister for finance, perhaps modelled on the high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, seems a sensible way to unify and professionalise tasks currently scattered across the Council of the Commission, European Council of the Eurogroup, and the economic and financial committee.<\/p><p> Thirdly and finally, president Trichet has suggested ideas for combatting the democratic deficit - he has correctly, I think, in his paper, identified the Achilles heel of EMU in his observation that the ultimate question of democratic legitimacy in Europe is still not sufficiently addressed.  His suggestion the European Parliament be used as a democratic arbiter of disputes concerning recommendations under the SGP and the imbalances procedure may or may not be the way forward.  Personally, I would be nervous about squaring off national parliaments and the European Parliament, but there is no doubt that this kind of innovative thinking is exactly what we need to be doing in the eurozone, and, in particular, we need to be doing it in Ireland.  The late Garrett FitzGerald pointed out that small member states like Ireland can punch well above their weight in the marketplace of ideas.  It's one place we can make a difference.  The IIEA has played a huge role in that regard and I hope that today's event not only looks at the controversies of the past, as important as these are, but also makes some contribution to the broader ongoing debate about which way the eurozone should develop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015043000002#JJJ00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Gavin Barrett","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430348400,"counter":1005,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I would say I would agree, of course, that the developments have been remarkable, provided they are implemented in the fiscal compact, six-pack, two-pack, what we call the European semester, all the fiscal elements.  I think we that we should not forget the MIP and the full implementation of the macroeconomic imbalance procedure, which again, as I already said, seems to me as important as the SGP because you can have a pretty good fiscal positioning and you can lose at the same time competitiveness, embark on big imbalances and then, of course, have a crisis.  But all what has been decided, including, of course, the banking element and also the tools that have been set up through a treaty - the ESM has been established through a new treaty - all this is good; it is not sufficient.  So I would respond yes, these moves are not sufficient and I would insist particularly on the fact that we must have, as I already said, more capacity to sustain cycles at the level of Europe through the fiscal embryo of federal budgets I have already mentioned and an element .. additional element for the executive branch, so to give more clout to the equivalent of a minister of finance of the EU area, which would have, of course, the responsibility to care for the SGP and MIP, on the one hand, and also to represent the euro area in international institutions so that we would appear as really a single entity.  And again there is my call for more democratic accountability for difficult decisions in exceptional cases and we know that it might happen that there are disagreements between the European institutions and a national government.  We are observing that now.  We must have a way to have a final say which would be unchallengeable democratically.<\/p> <p>  As regards the relationship between the ins and outs.  First of all, the working assumption of the Maastricht treaty was at the time they will all be in, right or wrong.  At the present moment, out of all the members of the European Union, you have only two countries that have an opting-out clause, as you know, Denmark and the UK and the paradox is that Denmark with an opting-out clause is totally following the monetary policy of the EU area.<\/p><p>As you know, there is a total, absolutely total imitation of what we are doing at the level of the euro area by Denmark.  So ... and when we had the negotiation of the fiscal compact, again, practically all countries, but two, decided not to join in the discussion, because all the others were making the working assumption that later, or sooner, they would be a member of the euro area.  So, the best would be for me to have as encompassing as possible the governance of the euro area, the SGP after all is for all, but for the euro area members it bites, not for the non-euro area members, with the recommendation ... possible sanctions.  The decision-making process, I imagine, of course would go only for the members of the euro area, but the rules should be as they are, applied to all, and the same for the MIP.  I would say it's very important that we continue to be as united as possible, including with the outs, in my opinion in the European Union.  And after all, we have embarked on a historical process.  We have to judge what we do at the level of historical endeavours.  We started 65 years ago with ideas, speeches, Robert Schumann's speeches, the activity of Jean Monnet.  We are 65 years later, and we have, you know, made a lot of progress.  We have enlarged considerably, even in the crisis, and it is something which I found absolutely striking.  We were 15 members of the euro area at the moment of the crisis when Lehman Brothers collapsed, and we had countries in great difficulty.  Ireland knows that better than anybody.  The 15, at the moment I am speaking, are all there.  Of course, with Ireland, which is a fantastic success, but also with Greece, at the moment I am speaking, and four of the new sovereign countries entered in the euro area, so that we are 19 not 15, 19.  So, it gives an idea of what is a historical endeavour, which goes on even in a terrible, terrible period.<\/p><p> Last point - I would very very much call for economic governance in the EU in general and in the EA also, going through quasi-federal method, community method, and not through Government corporation.  That being said, I have to say that in the crisis, with all the major difficulties of the crisis, governments find out ways to go through it, and I think we have to accept and recognise that, all taken into account, the sense of the unity of Europe triumphed.  But of course it goes without saying that in the medium and long run, we have to be much more community-oriented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015043000002#KKK00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430348400,"counter":1008,"content":"<p>Question No. 2 is composited from a number of members, but mainly questions submitted by Blair Horan, a trade union member of the institute.

So it's not possible in our own legal analysis to participate in national parliamentary inquiries, but of course we are fully at the disposal of the European Parliament.  I think, when I look at the treaty that it is fully in line ... this analysis with the letter and also with the spirit of our treaties, because accountability has to be exerted on the level where decisions are made.  For the ECB, clearly, as I said, it is the European level.  At the moment I am speaking, the Governing Council of the ECB decides for what it is the best in its own view, taking into account the fact that we are 330 million fellow citizens and 19 countries, and that is clearly a responsibility that calls, it seems, to accountability at the level of the European Parliament.

I would say that Irish banks, as others in the euro area, encountered liquidity and funding challenges from mid-2007.  This was the subprime crisis and, for the ECB, it was 9 August 2007 that we had to embark on the first non-standard measures that we took in the crisis, which was 9 August 2007, to give liquidity to all banks in the euro area, without any limit, provided, of course, they had collateral.  And that was an Irish issue, clearly a very, very important Irish issue, but it was an issue at the level of the euro area as a whole and we adapted again our market interventions to this potential illiquidity over a period.  Fortunately, we could regain control of the money market after 9 August, but at the end of the year, we had again enormous problems, we embark again on an unlimited ... a limited supply of liquidity.  But when we deal, as central banks, with liquidity issue, we have to stress that solvency issues were at the time not our problem but the problem of the Irish Financial Regulator and we have to rely upon, because there was no centralisation of supervision, we had to rely upon the judgment made by the national authority at that time and there was absolutely no suggestion that I could mention from the regulator that Irish banks were insolvent at the time.  So, we enhanced our own survey of what was happening in Ireland in 2009, after Lehman Brothers collapsed, in light of concerns not just on the banking system but also on the fiscal situation and I would say that we had special attention, without being responsible, because again don't forget that the ECB is responsible for price stability without deflation, without inflation, for the euro area as a whole, but what we understood from the situation in '09 and '10 was that the funding challenges facing Irish banks was particularly acute and that providing assistance, in assisting the banks - and we responded to the crisis at the time - there was an immense call - I have mentioned that already - for refinancing coming from the banks in Ireland.  And it became clearer and clearer over time that the funding concerns were, you know, due to deeper, more fundamental issues that were underlying.  All taken into account, we, as I said, refinanced the Irish economy in a proportion which has been absolutely without any precedent or equivalent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015043000002#MMM00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet"},{"type":"speech","time":1430348400,"counter":1016,"content":"<p>I have a final supplementary on that, just because I've a little bit of time.

I want to particularly draw your attention to the stability report of 2004, which it states that: \"It doesn't preclude the possibility of adverse developments which, should they materialise, would have serious financial consequences for households, corporates and banks\".  They talk about the risk of an unanticipated and sudden fall of residential property prices, accompanied by an increase in the default among mortgage holders and it goes on to say that this risk poses the greatest threat to the health of the banking system.  So, did the ECB take any actions, any measures, as a result to try and intervene, to stop, to mitigate the risks that were outlined in that report published by the Central Bank?  Was it discussed at the ECB board, for example, and if no action was taken, do you regret that?

You have your own responsibility and each institution should ... and I know that a number of questions are also very concentrating on were you over and above your own responsibilities.  Our own responsibilities were at the time very clear.  We were responsible for monitory stability in the euro area, the treaty the primary mandate, and, again, without deflation, without inflation.  Beyond that responsibility, we observed that the Stability and Growth Pact was not respected.  We made the point extraordinarily clear several times that this was absolutely necessary, in our view, for the cohesion of the euro area.  Beyond our primary mandate, we could see that nobody was surveying the evolution of competitiveness.  We made the point since '05 at each meeting of the Eurogroup, every month, that some countries were losing their competitiveness.  Ireland was part of the countries that were losing their competitiveness.  All the figures were circulated every month to the governments.  Again, we had no responsibility.  It was clearly to the governments, to the Commission in some respect, to look at that, but we point to the figure.<\/p> <p>  As regards from a more general standpoint, the final, short stability issue at the time, where we had no particular responsibility in this domain, we made public remarks regularly on ...

It is true that during all these times, before the crisis, during the crisis, after the crisis, the Irish economy proved a level of flexibility which had no equivalent in the rest of the European countries.  So it is not surprising that I was praising that, because it was one of the major, major criticism that we had before the crisis, during the crisis and after the crisis on other countries.  If Ireland has been the country that came out of the crisis more rapidly than others, and I would say, with all the painful exercise that it represents, more successfully than the other crises, it is because of this flexibility.  I'm not surprised that at times I could be very laudative <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>this feature of the Irish economy when I would criticise others.  To go back to the criticism, what is a lesson, a terrible lesson of the crisis, is that you can present the figures, show that you're losing competitiveness, show that you are going in front of future problems at the level of the euro area as a whole, at the level of any individual countries, in the United States of America, in the UK, everywhere, as long as there is no financial crisis the spontaneous tendency of the, I would say, executive branches is to say, &quot;Let's go on.  Why don't you ... it is not broken, why would you fix it?&quot;  And it is a terrible lesson that we have.  We cannot rely upon market discipline to discipline the various entities at stake.

As I already said, the first breach of the Stability and Growth Pact came with the big countries.

I am on record <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the European Parliament to have said that the stability and the cohesion of the euro area were depending on ... heavily depending on the Stability and Growth Pact ... and it was the big countries.  We saved the letter of the pact, the spirit of the pact was largely destroyed and we saved a letter of the pact with the small countries ... clearly ... that were appalled by the big countries.  In the present period, I call for all countries to go by the rule.  I think that experience has demonstrated, and we learned the hard way, that we have to respect the framework of the European euro area governance ... and I will call for all countries to apply by the rule.  So it's a big problem ... big and small.<br\/><br\/>Second part of the question - surplus and deficit.  It is true that the MIP is a very important pillar to survey both, I would say, the loss of competitiveness and the external imbalances of the kind of deficits and also of the possible excessive imbalances when there is an accumulation of surplus countries.  And there again, I think that it is very important that the Commission and the Council apply by the rules of SGP and MIP.

We normally have a certain capacity in the euro area to respond to asymmetric shocks because, let's not forget, in normal times the fiscal balance should be balanced or in surplus ... in normal times.  And it's in difficult times that we can go down to minus 3%.  So normally, all countries should ... in normal times ... in times of asymmetric shocks, those who are hit by the asymmetric shock should have 3% of GDP of fiscal cartridge, if I may, to utilise and try to resist the crisis.  That's one.  You will tell me perhaps 3% is very meagre, it should be higher and so forth - but it is the rationale behind the balance of in surplus rule.<\/p> <p>  Another very important point is the point of banking union and, I would say, capital union more generally as is mentioned now.  Because it is clear in the United States of America that to resist an asymmetric shock the capital union, or the financial union, of the United States of America plays a very important role - because the financial risks are disseminated all over the US and because the credit is more abundant to finance states that have more difficulty.  So I think that through both the SGP, on one hand, and this banking union ... capital union, on the other hand, we have two ways of being perhaps on the safer side.  Now, when we speak of the embryo of budget of the euro area, or more than a number of budgets of the euro area, we are also thinking of a possible cushion in terms of problems.  But, it is more for perhaps for the euro area as a whole, for the entire euro area, if there are particular shocks to weather.  But again I think that we should not forget that not only the fiscal channel is important to resist and, I would say, weather asymmetric shocks but also the capital union ... financial union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015043000002#QQQ00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430348400,"counter":1100,"content":"<p>Thank you very much for that response.

Mr. Trichet, my questions relate to burden sharing and whether or not the ECB sought to influence the decision of the Irish Government on burden sharing with senior bondholders from 2008 to 2013.  Just to give some context to the question, in September 2010 the guarantee expired and some &euro;20 billion of unsecured senior bonds came out of the guarantee.  Roughly &euro;4 billion of these bonds were issued by Anglo and INBS, two banks that no longer exist.  So did you or the ECB influence or seek to influence the decision of the Irish Government to repay these unsecured, unguaranteed senior bonds?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015043000002#QQQ00400","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430348400,"counter":1102,"content":"<p>I again have to go back to what we already said.  In 2010 it seems to me that there was a broad consensus that burden sharing, this kind of burning of senior debt, was a very unwise course of action.  The Irish authorities considered that it was an unwise course of action, but I can refer to the way all other Europeans were looking at it and the way , I would say, the way the international communities - of the advanced economies, on the other side of the Atlantic, everywhere - were considering.  So, again, it's very ... all this is very complex.  The guarantee was the initiative of the Government of Ireland without pre-discussion with anybody ... surprising other governments which, for most of them, embarked only on what I have called a blanket political guarantee.  That's for one.  So an initiative of the Government of Ireland, which was not at all a global consensus or a European consensus.<\/p> <p>  For the particular problem of the burden sharing, in '10 there was a consensus, it seems to me ... very clear.  Later, in 2011 there were discussions on this particular point.  I have to say that the overall risk of a new round of financial instability at the moment where the main goal of Ireland was to regain creditworthiness, to get back the investors and savers instead of having them putting their money out, was, in my understanding, justifying the decision which was taken.  As far as we were concerned, we had put 100% of the GDP of Ireland to help support Ireland and all the entities in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015043000002#QQQ00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet"},{"type":"speech","time":1430348400,"counter":1103,"content":"<p>Mr. Trichet-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015043000002#QQQ00600","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430348400,"counter":1104,"content":"<p>There is no equivalent of that anywhere in the world ... and, of course, it was because you had a loss of creditworthiness and also credibility-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015043000002#QQQ00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet"},{"type":"speech","time":1430348400,"counter":1105,"content":"<p>Mr. Trichet, I don't mean to interrupt ... if I could take you back to 2010 though.

And is it not the case that in that letter the ECB issued a very clear, direct and unambiguous threat to the Irish Government, that if it didn't apply for a bailout the ECB would turn off the life support machine for Irish banks?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015043000002#RRR01600","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430348400,"counter":1139,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.  It's a very important question.  And, as I referred to a moment ago, it was because Brian and I wanted to be absolutely clear on what was the relationship between the ECB and the Government on top of all of, I would say, exchange of views in this very, very dramatic circumstances.  Responsibility for the provision of ELA lies with the NCB concerned, so the national Central Bank of Ireland.  In this particular case, as in all other cases, and you have a number of cases even today, the Governing Council's related competence is based on Article 14.4 of the statute of the European system of central banks and of the ECB itself, the European Central Bank.  The Governing Council of the ECB may restrict the performance of national functions, such as ELA operations, if it considers that such operations would interfere with the euro system objectives and tasks.  This means that if the ELA is provided in large amounts, the Governing Council needs to assess the features of the transactions, their liquidity effects, and whether it would be appropriate to impose specific conditions in order to protect the integrity of the ECB's monetary policy.<\/p> <p>  Additional procedures underlying the Governing Council's role with regard the provision of ELA are aimed at adequately ensuring that these arrangements and their potential effects do not interfere with the single monetary policy.  Moreover, the Governing Council has to adhere to the prohibition of monetary financing.  In the case of Ireland, the level of liquidity provided by the euro system in support of the Irish economy had reached, by November 2010, around &euro;140 billion, including ELA.  It was representing around 85% of Irish GDP.  I mentioned 100% at the peak afterwards and 85% was, of course ... has no equivalent the world over.  So this represented one quarter of the ECB's total lending at the time; one quarter for Ireland in a euro area where you have Spain, Italy, Germany and the like, and it was a totally unprecedented level, of course.  And in the letter you are referring to, implicitly we ... I was saying ... whenever ELA is provided in significant amounts, the Governing Council needs to assess whether it is appropriate to impose specific conditions in order to protect the integrity of our monetary policy.  In addition, to ensure compliance with the prohibition of monetary financing it is essential to ensure that ELA recipient institutions continue to be solvent.  And it is this latter consideration, the solvency of the institution, that is reflected in the four points mentioned in that letter, that would be absolutely necessary in the view of the Governing Council of the ECB to ensure continued solvency of the Irish banking system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015043000002#RRR01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet"},{"type":"speech","time":1430348400,"counter":1140,"content":"<p>But, Mr. Trichet, with respect, the letter goes way beyond the solvency of the institutions.

And, would you not agree with the comments of the IMF mission chief to Ireland, Ajai Chopra, during an address to Oxford University, where he said your letter represented an outrageous over-reach of the ECB mandate?

And this was driving us to this blanket political guarantee, I have been mentioning ... You know pretty well in the UK there has been nationalisation of two banks, that in the US they have managed to avoid AIG, that in a number of other countries, the various institution were also ... they avoided the drama.  All that being said, why did we do that?  I mean I'm speaking of the governments because we were delivering ourselves liquidity.  The central banks, the governments had to come up with a solvency issue.  They did that because they wanted to avoid the much more dramatic consequence on their own people, on our fellow citizens, should not be repeated.  How should not repeat ... how manage not to repeat that?

I hope that the committee will regard it as having been of assistance to it and its work and I'm sure that it will be regarded positively by the general public, many of whom who would have been able to see this transmitted live on TV.  Again, I thank you for your attendance and for your adherence to the modalities which had been agreed.  I would also thank your own staff, committee staff, who have been highly professional at all times, and it was a pleasure, indeed, to work with you.  You can take it that I would also want to thank the two respondents, Dr. Somers and Professor Barrett for their contributions and it would be remiss of all of us if we did not thank the staff of the institute who have laboured heroically over the past month to make this happen.  I think it is customary for a politician, even a former politician, to thank the owners of the hall for the use of the premises, which I now do, so I thank the Irish State for the use of the hall and thank the security forces and so on for ensuring that the thing went as smoothly as it did.  But most particularly, I want to thank you, sir, for your presence here - I know you've had a very long day, you were up early this morning to get a flight which landed in here just after 11 o'clock.  You still have some duties ahead of you.  You're showing remarkable resilience and stamina and I want to thank you for all of that and most particularly for your disposition in dealing with the questions that were put to you, both by behalf of the members and also the members of the committee.  So thank you very much being here and may I just maybe perhaps try to entice you to come back on some future occasion by giving you this history of Dublin, a city you have begun to express an interest in and its history.

We are not just dealing with a grandmother-and-child situation.  I do not think it is appropriate not to address certain childminding operations in the course of this legislation.  It is a serious omission.  We will not get a chance to come back to the Children First Bill.  It is about the children.  The Minister has drawn a distinction between someone who is an employer and someone who is an employee, but I emphasise again that it has less to do with the single individual than with the numbers of children involved.  I believe this area warrants, rather than merits, address and inclusion.  The Minister referred to section 7, which is at the start of Part 2 of the Bill.  I am looking at what we have there.  That section does not mention childminders.  This Committee Stage debate will be followed by a Report Stage debate.  Will the Minister take on board the concerns I am flagging?  On behalf of Deputy McLellan, I will certainly reserve the opportunity to pursue any possible amendment in this regard.  The Minister and I both accept that we will not get another bite at this for many years to come.  I believe it should be inclusive in its address of all the scenarios where children are placed in the care of another person on a day-by-day or occasional basis.  If it is to be truly inclusive, the issue of childminding has to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015043000002#B02400","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1430384400,"counter":1326,"content":"<p>I hear the Deputy's concerns.  There are concerns from a pragmatic point of view about the effect of the inclusion of a single person.  There is a limit to how many children a single person can mind.  That person would then be writing up the child safeguarding statement for herself or himself.<\/p><p>That seems a little less than productive.  In addition, childminders often mind children in their own home and in the child's home.  For instance, if I brought somebody into my home to mind my children, how would this person write up a child safety statement relating to my home, then another one relating to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's home because she minds his children on a Thursday, and yet another one on the home of another Deputy, whose children she minds on a Friday?  I am not closed to the Deputy's proposal and I hear his concerns, but there is a practical issue here for individuals who are single childminders, working on their own.  People have to make their own decisions around the suitability of individuals who mind their children.  That is a separate issue.  A child safety statement in itself is not an absolute guarantee.  It is aimed at people who have one or more employees.  They must have a child safety statement for their premises for the risk they feel might arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015043000002#B02500","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430384400,"counter":1328,"content":"<p>I will not labour the point, but I will make two observations in closing.

From a practical point of view, it does not make sense for somebody to write their own statement, with nobody else to monitor what is happening.

in section 7 to provide greater clarity and to ensure the obligation to prepare a child safeguarding statement falls solely on the provider of the service as opposed to those who commission the service.  This is to ensure there is no scope to interpret the obligation as falling on those who commission the service against those who provide the service.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 10 to section 8 provides that Part 2 is not applicable to an individual who undertakes any work or activity in the course of a family relationship, where the work or activity is undertaken solely for the benefit of his or her child or for a family member or where the work or activity is undertaken in the course of a personal relationship and where assistance is given on an occasional basis for no consideration.  It is proposed to reword section 8 to clarify that the exemption in regard to personal relationships applies to the provider of relevant services.  The exemption for personal relationships arrangements is based on a similar provision in section 3 of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012. <i><\/i>Both are based on the fact that it is not the policy intention to place onerous statutory responsibility on arrangements that are in place as a result of personal relationships rather than commercial consideration.  Also exempted is occasional assistance in local and community events in order not to discourage participation in such activities.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 37 is a technical amendment to paragraph 2 of Schedule 1.  What it proposes is that any work or activity which consists of the inspections of a service provided to a child are included as a relevant service.  It was considered that inspections of health services to children carried out under the Health Act 2007 should be also be included in this paragraph.  For example, this would include inspections of residential centres for children with disabilities, with which I think we would all agree.<\/p><p>Amendment 38 proposes to insert a new paragraph after paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 to include inspections, examinations or investigations by the Ombudsman for Children as a relevant service.  It is considered that as by definition any investigation or inspection by the Ombudsman for Children is likely to include contact with children, that office should come within the definition of a provider of relevant services.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 39 is an amendment to paragraph 3 of Schedule 1.  It is proposed to clarify that an assessment which may lead to treatment is included as a relevant service for the purposes of the legislation.  This is being proposed for inclusion as in some circumstances an assessment for treatment might be separate from the treatment itself and might be carried out by different individuals.  Both the assessment and the treatment should be considered a relevant service for the purposes of legislation.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 40 is an amendment to paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 and it is proposed to limit its application as there are concerns that as currently drafted, it is broad enough to encompass most retail outlets.  This proposed amendment is in response to feedback that as currently drafted any retail outlet where children may be might fall within the scope of the definitions.  This was not the policy intention so an amendment has been proposed to clarify that it applies only where the service to the child is central to the service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015043000002#D01400","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1430384400,"counter":1363,"content":"<p>This in some way is related to the points I made earlier.  Amendment No. 7 seeks to delete lines 29 and 30, which immediately follow the point I made in regard to the \"provider\" person.  The Minister wishes to delete subparagraph (a) and substitute a new subparagraph, that states more concisely that a \"provider\" means a person \"who provides a relevant service\".  My question is complicated.  I would have been open to accepting a positive reply to my earlier question on whether child minders are included, but I did not get it and the Minister's response was that they were purposely excluded.  I am concerned.  My concerns are added to because we have amended the definitions and added to page 7 of the Bill that \"provider\" means in regard to a relevant service, a person \"who provides a relevant service\", yet we are told that child minders are excluded.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 10 to section 8 inserts a new section, which in this instance is excluding the other relationships that we have referred to in terms of a one-to-one or one-to-two, excluding family relationships.  We spoke of child minding cases, such as the grandmother, a personal friend with no commercial considerations or minding that is undertaken on an occasional basis.  My concern is that in the wider area there is a strata of activity across the board that provides, either in a home or a number of homes, a service that involves more than one child.  My concern is about the child.  This comes back to what Deputy Catherine Byrne said.  These are businesses and people are earning.  Their compliance with tax regulations is secondary to my first concern in this instance, which is the child or children in their care.<\/p> <p>  There is a considerable gap between the provision proposed by the Minister to exclude those who have a family relationship, those who may have a personal relationship with no commercial return and those involved on an occasional basis at school sports or community event or activity on the one hand, and the multiple person employer and employee on the other hand, which constitutes a strata of activity engaging with children across the country, providing a service.  It is commercial, it is paid for and is located in a multiple of settings, either in the home of the provider, the home of the child or children, or in doing a circuit of a number of hours per day or hours on different days in any week.  A number of children are involved.  I am only highlighting that this is not provided for in the Bill.  I will be supporting the passage of the Bill and my colleague, Deputy McLellan, will be dealing with it.  We are tasked with ensuring, through scrutiny of the Bill, that it covers all bases and is fit for purpose.  I believe I am shinning a light on a layer of activity that involves children, and on a significant omission by the Minister's own admission at the outset when he said these aspects were being purposely excluded.  I hope the record will conform that.  <\/p> <p>  I ask the Minister and his officials to note the points I have made and address them.<\/p><p>I hope the record will confirm the term \"purposely excluded\".  I appeal to the Minister and the officials from his Department to note the points I have made and to address this matter because it will not be addressed with any greater certainty than by amendments presented by the Minister.

The Children First guidelines are very clearly set out.  They apply to all individuals, childminders or anybody who deals with children, and organisations.  The Children First Bill is to place additional legal requirements on certain specified individuals in organisations.  The statement we are asking people to put in place is to outline the safeguarding policies of the service provider, including how to manage the risk to children availing of the service, details of vetting and recruitment practices.<\/p> <p>  For individual childminders to outline their vetting and recruitment practices and other relevant issues is inappropriate and confuses the issue of the Children First guidelines.  They are very clear about the obligations on people who mind children, their obligations to the child and how the child must be kept safe.  It is a different matter when one has an employer with employees and a premises.  In that instance, a whole range of issues will arise in regard to risk, such as how it can be managed and best looked after.  That is the obligation we are placing on those people.  That is why we define the provider as we do and not as an individual working alone minding children who also has obligations under Children First guidelines.  This is a child safeguarding statement for a service and a premises and it is very different.  We have tossed the matter back and forth.  I have heard the Deputy speak about mandated people which is a separate issue and one that we can certainly look at.<\/p> <p>  It would not be useful to continue this discussion much further.  The amendment is about the obligation to produce a child safeguarding statement.  If an agency commissions the service, then we want to be clear that the obligation to provide the child safeguarding statement falls on the provider of the service.  A childminder operating alone is an entirely different proposition and I do not believe, from a practical perspective, that it is applicable.  The Deputy and I will have to agree to disagree on the matter.

The person operating as a provider of relevant services immediately prior to the commencement of the Act shall carry out a risk assessment and prepare a child safeguarding statement not later than three months from the date of commencement of the Act.  The section provides that a child safeguarding statement shall include a written assessment of risk, including an outline of the procedures in place to manage any risk identified and an outline of the procedures in respect of an employee who is the subject of investigation in respect of any act or omission regarding a child.<\/p><p>The section also provides that the child safeguarding statement shall include an outline of procedures in place for reducing any identified risk, including procedures for the recruitment of staff suitable for working with children; the provision of information, instruction and training on the identification of harm; the reporting to the Child and Family Agency by an employee or the provider in accordance with any guidelines issued by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs under section 5; and a list of persons in the relevant services who are mandated persons.  Section 10 also provides that a provider of relevant services shall make a copy of the child safeguarding statement available to members of staff and, on request, to a parent or guardian, the Child and Family Agency or members of the public.  The provider is required to display the child safeguarding statement, or a review of the statement, which is required to be undertaken at least at intervals of not more than 24 months, as the case may be, in a prominent place related to the relevant service.  The section also provides that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs may make regulations in relation to child safeguarding statements.<\/p><p>The provisions regarding the requirement for a relevant service to prepare and publish a child safeguarding statement stem from the concern that the obligations regarding reporting a concern under the legislation fall on individuals who are mandated reporters.  It was considered desirable at a policy level to also place obligations on organisations which are defined as providers of relevant services for the purposes of the legislation.  This is to ensure the ethos of child protection and the provision of safe services for children is encourage at organisational level to supplement the responsibilities the legislation is placing on individuals.  A number of consequential and technical amendments are being made to section 10 which have arisen from the amendments just discussed to section 7 regarding appointing a contact person for the purposes of the child safeguarding statement.

While most of the amendments have been technical, this is a substantial one in that it attempts to bring forward a consequence for failure to produce a child safeguarding statement.  With all due respect, it is utterly failing in its attempt.  When one considers that failure to produce a safety statement in a business context often attracts criminal sanctions and not merely the name and shame sanction which the Minister and his officials are proposing.  Given that we come from a dark history of child abuse and neglect, surely our children deserve legislation that will have real consequences for people who fail to comply.  The original heads of the Bill the Government produced three years ago, contained penalties up to, and including, five years in prison.  Now, four years later, not even monetary sanctions are proposed.<\/p> <p>  In a business context, at the end of the year, the Revenue Commissioners produce a list of tax defaulters to name and shame them.  However, severe monetary sanctions are also imposed on these people.  Under company legislation, people are named and shamed but there are other consequences up to, and including, imprisonment.  I have grave concerns regarding the amendment as proposed.  We highlighted it on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and said there needed to be tough sanctions.  Although the Minister has made an attempt, it does not go far enough.  I want to hear what he has to say about it.  We need to go much further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015043000002#F02700","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1430384400,"counter":1411,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Troy for his comments.  His concerns are shared.  We have discussed this at length and it may be one of the reasons we are only now coming to Committee Stage.  The Deputy is right that the fact there are no criminal sanctions might be perceived as a weakness.  However, we must consider a practicality around resources.  The Children First Bill does not contain the criminal sanctions proposed in the original published heads.  As Deputy Troy pointed out, there was to have been an offence.  However, we took legal advice, which suggested that in order to do it in a legally sound manner, the Bill would also have to provide for very significant operational complexity, including the operation of an inspection regime.  After detailed consideration of what an inspection regime would involve, we decided to remove the criminal sanction.<\/p> <p>  It was the view of my Department that introducing an inspection regime would mean diverting significant Child and Family Agency resources away from front-line core child protection work in a manner which does not reflect areas of greatest risk to children and young people.  As time passes, it will be reviewed.  At an administrative level, it is expected that all Departments and their agencies, through the Children First interdepartmental group, will require compliance with Children First in order to qualify for State funding.  We do not want to instigate the very expensive inspection regime which would be necessary if we were to fine people or have criminal sanctions because it would divert significant resources away from at-risk children.<\/p><p>We would like to point out to parents and people who use the services that they are now empowered to ask for this child safeguarding statement and if it is not present, they can report it to the Child and Family Agency, which will take a certain series of actions to ensure the statement is made available.  If the service continues to fail to make it available, the agency will put it on a register of name and shame.  Nobody involved in delivering any service, whether community, not-for-profit or for profit wants to be on a list that states this service is not up to scratch and, therefore, one should not use it.  There is a great deal of power in this, if parents use it, and they will get support.  We will continue to keep it under review.  If we find that the name and shame register does not deliver what is required, we will have to go back to the drawing board.<\/p><p> I am not going to be political about this but there are limited resources.  The Child and Family Agency is only now up and running.  There are major child protection issues to be addressed and we have debated them often enough in the other Chamber.  It would not be wise at this juncture to divert scarce resources to a new inspection regime when there are greater priorities to be addressed.  I think the power of name and shame will prove very successful but I am open to reviewing it and I am sure whoever succeeds me in this position will review it, if it is found not to be successful.  I thank Deputy Troy for pointing it out because we deliberated on it long and hard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015043000002#F02800","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430384400,"counter":1413,"content":"<p>Resources are always an issue.  Even in the best of times one has to decide where to spend them.  It is a question of how to prioritise them.  This is a unique opportunity for the protection and welfare of children.  Unfortunately, even in recent months, we have seen high profile cases where name and shame alone did not make people live up to their obligations in terms of child welfare and protection.  I acknowledge that the Minister says he will consider this again in the future but how many children could be affected at some time in the future if this does not work?  Robust legislation needs a deterrent value.  It needs sanctions.<\/p> <p>  Who will inspect the safety audit?  If services are not afraid that an inspector can come in, this will not be fit for purpose.  With the best will in the world we will fail children if it is not fit for purpose.  The Minister needs to reconsider this.  I refrained from putting down amendments because I wanted to see what the Minister and the Department bring forward.  I will use the opportunity on Report Stage to bring forward amendments in this regard because I believe it is not strong enough and that there should be penalties, sanctions or consequences for non-compliance with child welfare legislation, as there are for non-compliance with the Revenue Commissioners, or company law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015043000002#G00200","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1430384400,"counter":1414,"content":"<p>I have no issue with the Deputy tabling an amendment on Report Stage, if that is his wish.  I ask respectfully that he cost it.  The exercise of costing it might colour his view.<\/p> <p>  I do not wish to be argumentative but this is not a unique opportunity.  We have already said we can review this if it is found not to deliver.  It is a child safeguarding statement.  The Children First guidelines are there to protect children, if people observe them.  Even having a child safeguarding statement does not mean it will be observed.  It is essential that parents are alert to the fact each service should have one but if it does not, they should report it and then somebody will visit.  Otherwise, there has to be an enormous administrative system.  We are not talking only about child carers in this Bill.  It does not just cover cr&egrave;ches.  We are talking about the local basketball and tennis clubs or two or three teachers who come together perhaps to provide piano lessons.  At a guesstimate, this covers at least 25,000 organisations and anywhere up to 100,000 different services.  The administrative burden and drain on resources to do this would, I believe, be misdirected, when there are serious child care issues to deal with and children at risk.<\/p> <p>  This involves creating a new culture and empowering parents in a significant way.  We are all ashamed of the situations the Deputy alluded to as part of our society and history.  They were born out of a lack of transparency and out of secrecy.  This is very open.  When one walks in to the service, this has to be on the wall in a visible place.  The first question every parent should ask is, &ldquo;Where is your child safeguarding statement?&rdquo; and if the service does not have one, the parent should say he or she will go elsewhere and in the meantime report the service.  It is a really progressive and positive step forward.<\/p> <p>  We do have the fall-back position that once Tusla is made aware of this, it will be involved immediately and will check out what is happening and why.  It will shine a light on the service.  If the service cannot even provide a child safeguarding statement, one would have to have serious worries about its operation and the risks involved.  Just as making late payments or being out of kilter with other people&rsquo;s returns, draws the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; attention, so this will highlight the service.  To set up an inspection regime to cover up to 100,000 organisations is not, at this point in time, the most sensible use of our resources.  The more we empower the public and parents, the safer our country becomes for children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015043000002#G00300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1430384400,"counter":1415,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s directness and honesty in saying this is primarily a resources issue.  When we raised this on Second Stage the Minister said this legislation should be taken in conjunction with the withholding of information Bill, which deals with a much narrower range of offences.  I thank him for that.<\/p> <p>  Before I bring forward proposals, I will examine how we can do it in a cost-effective manner.

Publicans, in particular, know there is a risk that an inspector may come in at any time to see whether the no-smoking sign is displayed and ensure there is no trace of ash and so on inside the pub.  That is why there is such wide-scale compliance with the ban.  The same should apply in the case of the service providers we are discussing here.  I accept that there is a very large number of voluntary organisations involved, but there must be the possibility of somebody arriving unannounced and checking for compliance.  Non-implementation of a health and safety statement could result in an accident and have serious consequences.  Where a provider is engaged in providing a service on behalf of the State and receiving grant aid from the State, are there consequences, such as the withholding of grant aid, if that provider does not produce a safety statement?

In addition, we already have inspection regimes in place to address these matters.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the Deputy's request that my Department examine the likely cost of his proposals, I will ask that it be done.  However, I have a funny feeling it will point to a fairly large quantum of money.  I do not want to cavil at every single point the Deputy is raising but he must agree that it is not just the idea of somebody coming into one's pub to inspect for ashes that made the smoking ban so successful.  What ensured its success was the public support for it and the fact that if people see another person smoking in a pub or another premises in which he or she should not be smoking, they are not slow to point it out because they know the smoker is affecting the health of others detrimentally.  The premise, which went through this committee, of banning smoking in vehicles where people aged under 18 are present, will be self-policing as much as it will involve the Garda.  I am very confident of that.<\/p> <p>  However, I am open to the suggestion of there being other issues we might look to as the Bill progresses or indeed as we review it.  Grant provision certainly will be affected if a service provider does not submit a statement.  That is something that will be spread out across a whole host of organisations in a similar way to the proviso we attached to the recent provision to local authorities of funding for playgrounds, namely, that unless the playgrounds are to be tobacco-free areas, an application will not be considered in future.  Like the Deputy, I would like to be as strong as we can be in this matter, but we also must be practical.  At this moment in time, it seems to me more practical to deal with this on a name-and-shame basis.  Today's discussion will highlight the fact that any facility to which people bring their children should have a child safeguarding statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015043000002#H00200","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1430384400,"counter":1418,"content":"<p>I admire the Minister's optimism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015043000002#H00300","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1430384400,"counter":1419,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1430384400,"counter":1420,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 21:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>In page 10, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:<b>&quot;Register of non-compliance<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>12. <\/b>(1) The Agency shall establish and maintain a register of non-compliance notices (in this Act referred to as the &quot;register of non-compliance&quot;).<br \/><br \/>(2) As soon as may be after a non-compliance notice comes into effect pursuant to <i>section 11<\/i>, the Agency shall enter the particulars of the non-compliance notice on the register of non-compliance.<br \/><br \/>(3) Subject to <i>subsection (4)<\/i>, an entry made in respect of a non-compliance notice shall be removed from the register of non-compliance upon receipt by the Agency of the child safeguarding statement to which the entry relates or upon being satisfied that a child safeguarding statement is no longer required, as may be appropriate, whichever is the earlier.<br \/><br \/>(4) A person who is the subject of a non-compliance notice may at any time apply to the Agency to have the entry concerned removed from the register of non-compliance and the Agency may, if it considers it appropriate to do so, remove the entry.<br \/><br \/>(5) The register of non-compliance shall be made available for inspection by members of the public at all reasonable times at the principal office of the Agency.&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015043000002#H00500","speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1430384400,"counter":1421,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1430384400,"counter":1422,"content":"<p>SECTION 11<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1430384400,"counter":1423,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 22:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>In page 10, to delete lines 31 and 32 and substitute the following:&quot;(b) he or she knows or believes that&mdash;<blockquote>(i) there is no material difference in capacity or maturity between the parties engaged in the sexual activity concerned, and<br \/><br \/>(ii) the relationship between the parties engaged in the sexual activity concerned is not intimidatory or exploitative of either party,&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>Section 11 provides that certain professionals and other persons in specified occupations, as listed in Schedule 2, are mandated persons for the purpose of the Act.  The section sets out the circumstances whereby a mandated person is required to make a report to the Child and Family Agency.  The categories of persons set out in Schedule 2 were included on the basis of their professional qualifications and-or their ongoing contact with children.  The focus on a small, qualified cadre of mandated reporters will, based on evidence, improve the quality of reports of harm received by the agency.  The receipt of better-quality reports of harm by persons who, by virtue of their training qualifications and professional experience, are well equipped to recognise harm is likely to have a positive effect on the process of assessments of risk by the agency.<\/p><p>A list of mandated persons was developed following detailed consideration of both the objectives of the legislation and the research paper on how mandatory reporting is dealt with internationally.  The persons included in the list have been selected on the basis that their qualifications, role and professional expertise mean they are aware of risks to children and of their responsibilities in this regard.  It is anticipated that reports from these persons are likely to be of a high quality, which will assist the agency in carrying out assessments of risk in a more effective and efficient manner.<\/p><p>Section 11(1) provides that where a mandated person knows, believes or has reasonable grounds to suspect that a child is being harmed, has been harmed or is at risk of being harmed, he or she shall report that belief or suspicion to the Child and Family Agency as soon as practicable.  Section 11(2) provides that where a child makes a disclosure to a mandated person that he or she believes that he or she is being harmed, has been harmed or is at risk of being harmed, that mandated person shall, as soon as practicable, report that disclosure to the Child and Family Agency.<\/p><p>Under section 11(3), a mandated person shall not be required to make a report to the Child and Family Agency where a child aged 15 years or more but less than 17 years is engaged in sexual activity with a person who is not more than two years older than the child, where the mandated person knows or believes there is no material difference in capacity or maturity between the two parties, where the child has made known his or her view that a report should not be made to the Child and Family Agency, and where the mandated person relied upon that view.<\/p><p>It is proposed in amendment No. 22 to amend this subsection to add an additional criterion that will require mandated persons to be satisfied that the relationship is not intimidatory or exploitative before deciding not to make a report.  The policy intention behind this subsection is that consensual sexual activity between older teenagers, where certain criteria are met, will not be required to be automatically reported to the agency as sexual abuse under this legislation.  The rationale for this is that to do otherwise would compromise the provision of services to the young people involved, as they would not be willing to engage with services that would require a report to the agency.  In addition, reporting such consensual sexual activity would contribute to potentially overwhelming the child protection system.  The provision matches proposals in the scheme of the criminal justice (sexual offences) Bill, published in November last year, in regard to consensual sexual activity.  It will be necessary to keep both pieces of legislation under review, as they progress towards enactment, to ensure consistency between them.<\/p><p>Under section 11(4), a mandated person is not required to make a report where the sole basis for his or her knowledge, belief or suspicion of harm is as a result of becoming aware that another mandated person has made a report to the Child and Family Agency in respect of the child concerned.<b><\/b>The proposed amendments to this subsection are designed to avoid a situation whereby a mandated person who is carrying out or assisting in an assessment of a child protection concern would be required by virtue of acquiring additional information in the course of that assessment to make a further report to the agency.  Section 11(5) provides that a mandated person is only required to make a report if he or she becomes aware of the information after the commencement of section 11, irrespective of whether the harm occurred before or after the commencement of the section.<\/p><p>Therefore, the mandated person is obliged to report harm he or she becomes aware of, whether that harm occurred before the commencement of the Act.  The report is to be made on a mandated report form to be made available by the Child and Family Agency and may be made by a mandated person acting on his or her own, or may be made jointly with one or more other mandated persons.  It is proposed to amend section 11(6)(<i>b<\/i>) to provide that a joint report can be made by a mandated person together with another person, whether that other person is mandated or not.  Section 11(7) provides that in circumstances where a mandated person has reasonable grounds to suspect that a child may be at risk of immediate harm, they may make a report to the agency other than on a mandated report form.  However, within three days, the mandated person must provide a report to the Child and Family Agency on a mandated report form.  The policy intention is that in an emergency, the agency should be contacted directly and immediately with the completion of the mandated report form to follow as soon as practicable.  Everyone agrees red tape should not be allowed to delay the reporting of a risk.  The proposed amendment is intended to ensure the threshold that applies in such circumstances is clearly higher than that which would apply ordinarily to a mandated report as it is not the policy intention that every mandated report that meets the threshold in the legislation will also prompt a personal contact to the agency in addition to, and in advance of, a report on the mandated report form. <br\/><br\/>A minor technical amendment is proposed to reword section 11(8) in order to address any potential ambiguity in the section as currently drafted.  Under section 11(9), the Minister of the day may make regulations regarding the procedures for the making of reports to the Child and Family Agency.  Section 11(11) provides that reporting obligations under this section are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other obligations.  Section 11(12) provides that nothing shall affect any other obligation a person has to disclose information to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015043000002#H00800","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1430384400,"counter":1425,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1430384400,"counter":1426,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 23:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>In page 11, to delete lines 1 to 5 and substitute the following:&ldquo;(4) A mandated person shall not be required to make a report to the Agency under <i>subsection (1) <\/i>where the sole basis for the mandated person&rsquo;s knowledge, belief or suspicion is as a result of information he or she has acquired, received or become aware of&mdash;<blockquote>(a) from&mdash;<blockquote>(i) another mandated person, or<br \/><br \/>(ii) a person, other than a mandated person, who has reported jointly with a mandated person pursuant to <i>subsection (6)(b)<\/i>*, that a report has been made to the Agency in respect of the child concerned by that other person, <\/blockquote>(b) pursuant to his or her role, as a member of staff of the Agency, in carrying out an assessment as to whether a child who is the subject of a report or any other child has been, is being or is at risk of being harmed, or<br \/><br \/>(c) pursuant to his or her role in assisting the Agency with an assessment as to whether a child who is the subject of a report or any other child has been, is being or is at risk of being harmed.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015043000002#J00300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1430384400,"counter":1427,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1430384400,"counter":1428,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 24:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>In page 11, to delete line 14 and substitute the following:&ldquo;(b) jointly with one or more than one other person, irrespective of whether or not the other person is a mandated person.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015043000002#J00500","speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1430384400,"counter":1429,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1430384400,"counter":1430,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 25:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>In page 11, to delete lines 15 to 19 and substitute the following:&ldquo;(7) Where a mandated person acting in the course of his or her employment or profession knows, believes or has reasonable grounds to suspect that a child may be at risk of immediate harm and should be removed to a place of safety, he or she may make a report to the Agency under <i>subsection (1) <\/i>or <i>(2) <\/i>other than by means of a mandated report form.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015043000002#J00700","speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1430384400,"counter":1431,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1430384400,"counter":1432,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 26:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>In page 11, lines 20 and 21, to delete &ldquo;provide that report to the Agency by the completion of&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;in addition, complete&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015043000002#J00900","speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1430384400,"counter":1433,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1430384400,"counter":1434,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 27:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>In page 11, line 35, to delete &ldquo;<i>subsection (3)<\/i>&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;this section&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015043000002#J01100","speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1430384400,"counter":1435,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1430384400,"counter":1436,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That section 11, as amended, stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1430384400,"counter":1437,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister about the consequences if a mandated person does not fulfil the obligations and make a report.

On Monday, 27 April 2015, Tusla notified my Department that it had identified evidence of significant risks in how referrals were managed in the child welfare and protection service in the Laois-Offaly area.  Tusla subsequently furnished a draft report on 28 April indicating that a significant number of referrals to its social work service have not been responded to in accordance with established procedures.  Tusla indicated to me that this issue came to light at local level and was notified recently to Tusla senior management.  On being notified of the issue, I met with the CEO of Tusla on Tuesday and I also discussed the matter with the chairperson of the board of management of Tusla.  I have sought assurances and have been assured by Tusla that necessary measures to deal comprehensively with the situation have been or are being put in place.<\/p> <p>  My immediate priority is to ensure that no child is at risk of harm.  I consider it appropriate that this matter is brought into the public domain at the earliest opportunity, which is why I am using this opportunity to inform the select sub-committee.  I have been provided with details of Tusla's action plan to deal with the issues that have been identified and will meet with Tusla again tomorrow to review progress in ensuring that all necessary actions are taken without delay.  Tusla is being assisted in this process by two external independent child care experts in dealing urgently with the referrals that have come to light.  Tusla is committed to working closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other partners in this area.  I will consider in due course whether an independent investigation into this matter is warranted, including the circumstances that gave rise to the unassessed backlog of referrals and to include the lessons to be learned to ensure that such a situation is not repeated.  My view of the seriousness of the issue is shared by Tusla.  I have asked Tusla to expedite its examination of the various issues as a priority.  Tusla is in the process of establishing the precise number of referrals that have not been appropriately responded to and will provide me with an update in this regard as a matter of priority.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ensure that any individual or organisation that is currently concerned about a referral they have made to Tusla in the Laois-Offaly area can be reassured.  I have asked the CEO of Tusla to provide a contact telephone so that any person who has a child protection concern about a child in the Laois-Offaly area can make contact immediately.  I am assured by Mr. Gordon Jeyes that he has allocated additional social work staff to respond to any calls.  <\/p> <p>  The issues involved primarily relate to the management of unallocated child welfare and protection referrals.  Tusla provides data on a monthly and quarterly basis in respect of the management of referrals and unallocated cases.  The matter has been the subject of much discussion, including in the Oireachtas in recent months.  Given the importance of ensuring there is absolute clarity with regard to unallocated access and the management of any associated risk, I have in recent weeks asked Tusla to arrange for a national audit and to ensure complete verification and validation of all known cases awaiting allocation to a social worker.  This was done prior to these issues becoming known to me as part of a standard letter I sent to it a couple of months back.  Tusla is due to furnish me with a report in this regard shortly.  While I know the meeting is technically over, I am happy to take questions insofar as I can answer them but we have limited information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015043000002#K02900","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1430384400,"counter":1499,"content":"<p>I was going to ask Deputies Troy and McLellan to respond but, technically, it is not a matter for the select sub-committee.

The committee will be aware that HIQA found five of the areas were performing to a high standard in how they managed referrals but it found some problems in the remaining seven areas, mainly in the length of time a child had to wait for an allocated social worker.  However, the duty system was managing the risk in an acceptable way.  That is critically important.  On many occasions we have had the discussion, that although it is a high priority, it does not mean it has not been assessed because emergencies and immediate risk are dealt with immediately.  HIQA found, as I stated, there were profound problems in three areas with how referrals were being dealt with and the local area has put in place an action plan to deal with the problems.<\/p> <p>  I take seriously any issue regarding the safety of a child and I am glad to say that HIQA provides an independent reassurance on the standard of service provided to vulnerable children.
