The Bill provides for the suspension of domestic water charges for nine months, from 1 April to 31 December 2016, to provide time for an extensive deliberative process to be undertaken on the funding of domestic water services.  The Government will establish an expert commission which will make recommendations on a sustainable long-term funding model for the delivery of domestic water and wastewater services by Irish Water.  An Oireachtas committee on the funding of domestic water services will then consider these recommendations and make its own.  The Oireachtas will consider and vote on these recommendations.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, and his officials from his Department.<\/p><p>It is my intention that the committee will conclude its consideration of the Bill on Committee Stage this afternoon.

I hope amendment No. 2 will deal with the concerns expressed by Deputy Barry Cowen in amendment No. 4.  I will speak to my amendment first.  I propose to discuss amendments Nos. 2 and 4 together.<\/p><p>I indicated on Second Stage that I would bring forward amendments to deal with concerns that had been raised with me by members of the Opposition about the time lag between Irish Water's charging and billing periods.  The amendments seek to bring clarity and leave no doubt on the periods in which charges are to be suspended.  Amendment No. 2 seeks to align the period of suspension of water charging with the billing periods.  While the Bill provides for charging to be suspended from 1 April to 31 December 2016, the amendment aligns the period of suspension of water charging with the billing period.  Charging will be suspended from 1 July 2016 to 31 March 2017 and no water bills will be issued in this period.  I hope the amendment will allay concerns that liability for domestic water charges may be reintroduced before the finalisation of the deliberative processes and Oireachtas decisions on the future funding model for domestic water services.<\/p><p>It was always the Government's intention to ensure there would no possibility of customers being asked to pay water bills until the Oireachtas had considered and voted on how domestic water services delivered by Irish Water would be funded into the future.  The amendment clarifies my intentions in this regard.  The nine-month period is an honest attempt by the Government to create the space in which a detailed and respectful debate on the funding of water services can take place.  We need to allow the expert commission, the membership of which I announced last week, to make recommendations, a special Oireachtas committee to examine the expert commission's recommendations and endeavour to make its own and the Oireachtas to deliberate on these recommendations and, ultimately, make a final decision on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  I am facilitating this period of extensive deliberation without the distraction of either charging or billing for domestic water services by Irish Water.<\/p><p>Let me be clear - the amendment will ensure two things.  First, no liability shall be created for water charges in the nine-month period from 1 July 2016 to 31 March 2017 or in any extension of the period of suspension.  Second, no bill in respect of this period shall issue during the aforementioned nine-month period or at any stage in the future.  The amendment will ensure no liability for water charges will recommence before the Oireachtas has considered and voted on the enduring funding model for domestic public water services.  While a liability for the charging period of quarter 2 of 2016 - 1 April to 30 June 2016 - remains, the liability in the following quarter - quarter 3 of 2016 - will not be billed by Irish Water during the suspension period of 1 July 2016 to 31 March 2017 or any further extension of that suspension period.  The liability for quarter 2 of 2016 will remain to be discharged at a future date after the period of suspension of water charges has ended.<\/p><p>The amendment will ensure that the deliberative process proceeds unimpeded by bills issuing from Irish Water.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 4 was tabled by Deputy Cowen.  It has the same intent as the Government amendment No. 2, that is to amend the proposed suspension period to a period commencing on 1 July  2016 and ending on March 31 2017.  I hope the Deputy will accept the amendment that I have brought forward, which will ensure the same change as that intended in amendment No.  4.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2016070500002#E00800","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467723600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Cowen wish to move his amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2016070500002#F00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1467723600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I will withdraw my amendment in favour of amendment No. 2.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2016070500002#F00300","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1467723600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>For clarity, when the Minister said that no water bills will be issued during this period, he was referring to charges that would have otherwise been charged during this period.

I sought a referendum to keep the water supply and wastewater treatment supply in public ownership.  Unfortunately, my amendment was ruled out of order not because it would cost the State but because it was not considered to be relevant to the Bill.

This is not a case of kicking the matter down the road for two years because nobody wants to deal with an awkward issue.  It is a case of ensuring that the Oireachtas and the committee have an opportunity to complete the work that we are trying to do here.  The legislation will enable us to put options to the Oireachtas and then have a democratic vote that I hope will be responsible and informed in terms of how we fund the domestic water supply. <\/p> <p>  I  will meet the Commissioner next week and I have already spoken to him on the telephone about this issue.

The former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly provided reassurance and incorporated it in legislation, requiring a future Minister to have a national plebiscite before he or she would change the ownership structure or the infrastructure of Irish Water.  One could not be more emphatic than that.  There may be some who will say that a future Government can chance legislation if it has a majority.  Let us see how we can address that issue.  I have no attachment to any possibility of privatisation or the sale of Irish Water infrastructure.  That is not the agenda of the Government.  It is not my agenda.  We want this to be a single utility in public ownership and we want to build public trust and faith in it as a body that can deliver safe water supplies at a competitive cost.  <\/p> <p>  I have been consistent on this matter.

The draft legislation as it stands states that if the Minister is satisfied that the committee needs more time, he or she shall extend the period by ministerial order.  The amended text ensures that I, as Minister, have to be satisfied that the committee does indeed need the additional time requested in order to complete its work.  I can assure the committee that I will ensure it is afforded whatever amount of time is needed and that I will have no difficulty using the power to extend that time period if it is warranted.<\/p><p>This amendment is therefore worded to ensure the Minister will only extend the suspension period if he or she is satisfied that the special Oireachtas committee genuinely needs extra time for its work.  I think there was a view that it was important to have in the wording the facilitation of a request by the committee, which is what is covered in the new amended wording, as well as the Minister's option if he is satisfied that more time is needed.  That was proposed following a discussion with Deputy Cowen.  I can understand where he is coming from because the discussions were always on the basis that if the committee needs more time and requests more time, the Minister may facilitate that.  That is wording change we have made, which I think is more accurate in terms of the commitments and the reassurance that were given a number of weeks ago on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2016070500002#J00900","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1467723600,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I am glad the Minister has clarified that he will speak to the Commissioner next week.

It is specifically linked to the process needing more time to complete the work, as opposed to somebody saying: \"This is awkward politically, so let us push it off for two years.\"  That is not what is envisaged here or what was agreed.  We have asked the Attorney General to be quite clear in terms of the wording to make sure we are true to the commitment as to what was agreed.<\/p><p> The amendment also states \"for such further period, commencing on the day immediately following the expiration of the first-mentioned period, as does not exceed the period that he or she believes the committee will require to complete its work and is specified in the order\".  In other words, if I am still a Minister at that point and if the chair of the committee says that they need an extra month or six weeks, I have to be satisfied that is a fair request and then we will agree to an extension to allow the committee a reasonable period of time to finish its work if that is necessary.  However, members should not forget that we have given three months here for the committee to do its work.  Therefore, I expect the commission will finish its work in five months, or perhaps even sooner, but we are giving five months for that process.  The committee will then have three months to consider those recommendations and come up with its own views and recommendations, and then the Oireachtas will have a month.  That sets out where the nine months period we are talking about is credible.  Let us wait and see how that transpires.  It is very clear in this amendment that this is about allowing a reasonable amount of time to finish the process that is under way if that is required.  The legislation facilitates that; it facilitates the Minister to be able to do that.  It is not about avoiding awkward decisions.  This is an awkward issue, let us face it.  There are deep divisions politically on this issue within and across political parties.  That is why we are trying to get an informed series of recommendations around which, hopefully, we can build some consensus and on which we can get a majority in the Oireachtas.

Many of us were sceptical about the intention of the commission but were willing to take the Minister at his word.  Having said that, the fact that some of us took the time to submit detailed proposed amendments to the terms of reference and did not even receive a formal response from the Minister's office suggests we may not have been right to take him at his word.<\/p><p>What most concerns me about Mr. Joe O'Toole's comments is not that he has personal views - he is entitled to his views and the Minister could not have appointed a person resident in this State who did not have views on the matter. - but that Mr. O'Toole, in his Newstalk interview, made a particular comment which amounted to much more than his personal view on the issue of water.  Speaking on the commission and the job the Minister has given him, he stated:<\/p><blockquote>It is a political exercise.  It is a democratic exercise.  The reality is we are trying to resolve a problem which has emerged from the democratic process.  People have voted in a certain way.  Leinster House is not prepared to grasp that particular nettle so we have to find a solution that will have enough sugar on it to make the medicine go down easily. <\/blockquote> <p>My interpretation of Mr. O'Toole's remarks is that he has acknowledged that a majority of the Deputies elected in the general election want to abolish water charges but the purpose of the commission as he, its chairperson, understands it, is to continue some form of charge by putting enough sugar on it to allow the D&aacute;il, which technically has a majority against water charges, to swallow it, in other words, to vote in favour of a water charge.  If that is his understanding of his job as the chair of the commission, it is deeply disturbing.  While I am not asking the Minister to interpret what Mr. O'Toole meant by his remarks, I believe the meaning is clear.  My concern, therefore, is not that the chairman has a particular view but that he is describing his understanding of his function of chairing the expert commission as one of identifying how to get water charges through the D&aacute;il, albeit in a different form.  <\/p><p>I have two questions for the Minister.  Is this is an appropriate way for the chairman to describe his role and that of the expert commission?  Is it the Minister's view that the chairman's position is tenable?  While I was willing to give Mr. O'Toole the benefit of the doubt - I did not call for him to resign yesterday but asked that he withdraw the comment he made - the comments he made this morning and this afternoon have made matters worse.  If it was the Minister's intention to take the heat out of this issue, unfortunately the person he appointed as chairman of the expert commission has done the opposite.  This has undermined any confidence among those of us who are sceptical but want to be constructive and engage with the commission that this is genuinely an independent and impartial exercise.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's response to those two specific questions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2016070500002#M00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1467723600,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I do not propose to get into a long debate on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2016070500002#M00400","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1467723600,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I would like to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2016070500002#M00500","speaker":"1254"},{"type":"speech","time":1467723600,"counter":101,"content":"<p>In that case, I will respond to both Deputies together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2016070500002#M00600","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1467723600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>This is a serious issue because the impression given by the new coalition was that an independent commission had been established with an independent chair.

However, the chairman, in advance of the commission's establishment, has expressed strong views that are opinionated and biased in the sense of being very much on one side of the argument.  How can anyone interpret his words in any other way?  He stated:<\/p><blockquote>People voted in a certain way.

I assume that making the medicine go down means the continuation of water charges.  Does the Minister propose to allow a person who believed it was in order to express these views to chair the commission?  Mr. O'Toole has given his honest views but if the Minister expects anybody to take the so-called new politics seriously, Mr. O'Toole must go.  I am also putting it up to Fianna F&aacute;il that it needs to make this clear because its support is the other leg of the table in this arrangement.  Regardless of what spin is put on this issue, nobody can unsay what Mr. O'Toole said.

To be fair, the idea that we will now start debating and changing the terms of reference is not a reasonable request.  We made the purpose of the commission clear.  A group of people with considerable knowledge of issues related to water, including charging and conservation, would examine all the issues in an informed manner, produce a report and make recommendations.  We then indicated that a committee would take these recommendations but would not be bound by them, although I presume the committee's work would be guided by the detail of the report produced by the commission.  The committee will make its own judgment on what is appropriate and fair and what should be put before the D&aacute;il and Seanad to be voted on.  That is how the commission will work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2016070500002#M00800","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1467723600,"counter":104,"content":"<p>When the Minister published the terms of reference of the commission the Department's press release described them as draft terms of reference.

Once they were agreed between two party leaders, they would not be undone.  I would not like to give an impression that I ever said it would be otherwise because I did not do so.  I have been up-front about the commission.  I have seen some commentary on some websites and on social media about some of the members of the expert commission.<\/p><p>It is deeply unfair, in terms of their role and willingness to be helpful to Ireland.  The people include a lead expert in the Environmental Directorate of the OECD, the chair of the customer forum of Water Scotland, a former Scottish Minister, the chair of the Northern Ireland Utility Regulator, the chair of the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, NFGWS, an academic lawyer specialising in water and environmental law from the University of Dundee in Scotland and a strategy consultant from Waternet in the Netherlands.  While I do not know her, she comes highly recommended for her knowledge.  Dr. Andrew Kelly is an environmental economist who is highly thought of in Ireland.<\/p><p> These people are the best experts in the area we could find.  We searched high and low to get names.  Some of them were recommended by other political parties.  I also sought and followed advice from the Institute of Public Administration and the National Economic and Social Forum on the kind of skill set we would need on an expert commission, the number on the commission and the balance of Irish and international expertise.  I do not know any of these people, except Brendan O'Mahony, the chair of the NFGWS, whom I met as a Minister when he was representing group water schemes.  I have had no conversation with him about this.  We have looked to others to make recommendations and tried to pick from those and choose other skill sets in a way that is consistent with the independent guidance we got.<\/p><p> Mr. Joe O'Toole is a very fine person.  I have known him on and off for many years.  We come from different political persuasions, and this is one of the reasons I asked him to do this.  I did not want a Fine Gael person, or the perception of a Fine Gael person.  Mr. O'Toole has given much leadership through the trade union movement.  He was a very talented Senator and parliamentarian when he was here.  He has buckets of experience in handling difficult issues.  This is why I asked him to do the job, to try to pull together all of these experts and to have a political input into the process and ensure the political sensitivities were understood in the context of any recommendations they might make.  I thought Mr. O'Toole would be a very good person to do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2016070500002#M01000","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467723600,"counter":107,"content":"<p>Does the Minister still think he is a very good person to do it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2016070500002#N00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1467723600,"counter":108,"content":"<p>That is an unfair question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2016070500002#N00300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1467723600,"counter":109,"content":"<p>It is a very important question to answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2016070500002#N00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1467723600,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I will answer it in a roundabout way.
