My intention in accepting a dividend, which was\u00a0agreed with the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, was that the dividend should be for the benefit of the Local Government Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process Fund.

On waiving my rights to the dividend, I requested that the HFA uses the funds to help address the issue of mortgage arrears in the local authority sector and that HFA Management will arrange a suitable mechanism for forwarding the funds into the Local Authority MARP fund. In order for the HFA to pay the &euro;20m in funds directly into the MARP Fund, legal advice indicates the HFA may require changes to its statutory powers and its Articles of Association.

The conditions include the requirements that the individual be over 75 years of age or, if younger, that the individual has a guaranteed level of pension income (&quot;specified income&quot;) actually in payment for life at the time the option to effect the ARF or cash option is exercised. The purpose of the specified income requirement is to ensure, before an individual has unfettered access to their remaining retirement funds via an ARF or by way of the cash option, that they have the security of an adequate guaranteed pension income throughout the period of their retirement. The specified income requirement is &euro;12,700.  <\/p><p>  Where the minimum specified income test is not met, and an individual does not wish to purchase an annuity, then an AMRF must be chosen into which a &quot;set aside&quot; amount must be invested.

The capital in an AMRF can be used by the owner at any time to purchase a pension annuity and the AMRF can be changed to an ARF with access to the capital sum (subject to taxation) before the age of 75 where the specified income test is met before that age.This question may have been prompted by changes proposed to be introduced by the UK authorities to their equivalent regime from next year. In terms of increased flexibility, the primary difference between the proposed UK regime and the regime that operates here is the fact that from April 2015, the UK proposes to dispense with their guaranteed income test. In that regard, I have no plans to change the equivalent rule here or the alternative AMRF set aside rule.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400051#WRB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":59,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400051#WRB01100"},{"type":"question","counter":60,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[23704\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400051#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the current tax liability on a social welfare payment in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Galway; if the person is eligible for a refund; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1185","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":61,"content":"<p>Carer's income paid by\u00a0the Department of Social Protection is not subject to the Universal Social Charge but is subject to Income Tax.

The Solvency II EU Directive sets out new, stronger EU-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers with the key aim of increasing policyholder protection.\u00a0\u00a0The new regime will also ensure greater cooperation between supervisors.<\/p><p>Under EU legislation the\u00a0Central Bank of Ireland is not<b><\/b>responsible for the prudential supervision of Irish branches of credit institutions authorised in other\u00a0EEA Member States and operating under a passporting arrangement in Ireland.\u00a0 The Central Bank does however have responsibility for the supervision of such entities in the following areas:<ol type=\"1\"><li>in co-operation with the home state regulator, assessment of their compliance with liquidity requirements;<\/li><li>consumer protection issues; and<\/li><li>compliance with Anti-Money Laundering regulations.<\/li><\/ol>Further information is available on the Central Bank's website on for Credit Institutions.\u00a0 A current extract from the website is\u00a0at the Appendix to the PQ response.<\/p><p>The current legal and regulatory framework for the provision of insurance in the EEA, and the supervision of that activity, is prescribed by European Union Law in the Life and Non-Life Insurance Directives. The provision of insurance throughout the EEA on a freedom of services basis and a freedom of establishment basis (i.e. a branch) within this framework is predicated upon the absence of internal market frontiers and the mutual recognition of the authorisation of insurance undertakings by Member States.<\/p><p>The Insurance Directives specify particular roles for both the home Member State supervisory authority (i.e. the supervisory authority that grants an authorisation) and the host Member State supervisory authority (i.e. the supervisory authority of a Member State where an insurance undertaking conducts business of a freedom of services or freedom of establishment basis) of an insurance undertaking. Insurance undertakings authorised under the Insurance Directives are subject to solvency and financial reserving requirements, the supervision of these requirements is the sole responsibility of the home Member State supervisory authority. The primary objective of these requirements is to ensure that claims made in respect of policies issued will be adequately provided for by an insurance undertaking.<\/p><p>Under EU law which governs non-life insurance, an insurer is required to inform the regulator in its home Member State\u00a0(its home regulator) that it intends to pursue business in another Member State. The home regulator must then provide the host regulator with a certificate attesting that the insurer covers the EU Solvency Capital Requirement, as well as the nature of the business which the insurer intends to undertake. The insurer may start to pursue business from the date that the certificate is communicated to the host regulator, in this case the Central Bank of Ireland.<\/p><p>Under Article 20 of the Third Non-Life Directive the Home Regulator is also required to notify the Host Regulator if the solvency margin of an undertaking falls below the statutory requirement. In such instances the Home Regulator should inform the Host Regulator of the measures it has taken to address the solvency deficit.<\/p><p>EEA insurance regulators are also members of EIOPA (European Insurance &amp;amp; Occupational Pension Authority) and are required to comply with the General Protocol relating to the collaboration of the insurance supervisory authorities of the Member States of the European Union.\u00a0\u00a0 This general protocol statement was issued in 2008 and is currently under review by EIOPA.<\/p><p>With regard to the position of Setanta policyholders, my officials have been in discussions with the Central Bank of Ireland, with the Setanta Liquidator, the Accountant of the High Court\u00a0and with the insurance industry representative bodies and I have asked them to convey my wish that every effort is made to facilitate Setanta policyholders in obtaining new motor insurance policies and in understanding their overall position.\u00a0 We are endeavouring to obtain legal certainty on a number of matters relating to policyholders' claims for compensation and this will be made publicly available in due course.\u00a0 At this time, I propose to set out the position as it currently stands.<\/p><p>Setanta\u00a0was formally placed into liquidation by the MFSA on the 30 April 2014 and a liquidator was appointed. Officials from my Department together with officials\u00a0from the Central Bank\u00a0met\u00a0with the Liquidator and his\u00a0representatives in Ireland\u00a0on 7 May 2014 and the Central Bank is in ongoing contact with him regarding the position of Setanta policyholders.\u00a0All Setanta policies have now been cancelled\u00a0in line with the terms of the policies.<\/p><p>In the circumstances, I continue to strongly advise\u00a0policyholders to make alternative insurance arrangements without delay and that they should contact their insurance broker or an insurer directly to seek alternative cover.\u00a0 This is also the advice of the Central Bank.<\/p><p>The Liquidator\u00a0made arrangements for policyholders to obtain their &quot;no claims bonuses&quot; certificates from Setanta. Insurance Ireland have informed me that these certificates are being honoured by other insurers and we are aware that many insurers are being flexible surrounding requirements for documents.\u00a0 In addition, the Insurance Ireland 'Declined Cases Agreement'\u00a0is available to policyholders of Setanta.\u00a0 I am informed that under the agreement, the insurance market will not refuse to provide insurance to an individual seeking insurance, if he\/she has approached at least three insurers and has not been able to obtain cover from them.\u00a0 I understand that Insurance Ireland\u00a0is also making information available to\u00a0those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to this matter through\u00a0their service at\u00a0(01) 676 1914 or by email at\u00a0.<\/p><p>With regard to Setanta premiums and claims, the position on each policy is for the liquidator to decide in due course.\u00a0\u00a0My officials and the Central Bank will remain in close contact with the Liquidator and I have asked that public statements are provided to clarify matters for policyholders and claimants.<\/p><p>The Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) is a non-profit-making organisation registered in\u00a0Ireland.\u00a0 All insurance companies underwriting motor insurance in this county must, by law, be members of MIBI and contribute to the funding of claims in proportion to their market share.\u00a0\u00a0The principal role of MIBI is to compensate innocent victims of accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles. This is regulated under the terms of an Agreement between the MIBI\u00a0and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.\u00a0 We are endeavouring to clarify the position on a number of matters relating to policyholders' claims for compensation, including the role of MIBI in this regard.\u00a0\u00a0However, if, for legal reasons, MIBI is not in a position to accept a claim, these third party claims will be eligible to proceed for consideration by the High Court for compensation from the\u00a0Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF).<\/p><p>Claims on personal insurance policies will be payable from the\u00a0ICF.\u00a0\u00a0All ICF\u00a0payments are subject to the limit of\u00a065% of the amount due or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser. Under Section 3.6 of the Insurance Amendment Act 1964 (as amended) first party claims by a body corporate or unincorporated body are not covered by the ICF.<\/p><p>The refund of premiums for either commercial or personal insurance policies is not covered by the ICF or MIBI. However, unpaid premium would fall to be claimed from the Setanta Liquidator in due course.<\/p><p><b>APPENDIX<\/b><\/p><p><b>Passporting for Credit Institutions\u00a0 <\/b><\/p><p>Under European Union (EU) passporting rules\u00a0a credit institution authorised in one\u00a0EEA Member State can establish as a branch in another Member State and\/or provide services in another\u00a0EEA Member State without establishing a physical presence there.\u00a0 The supervisory responsibilities of financial regulators in relation to credit institutions operating in more than one\u00a0EEA member state have been set out by the EU in a number of Directives and cover both home and host state regulators.<\/p><p><b>Notification Process<\/b><\/p><p>- A credit institution authorised in Ireland must notify the\u00a0Central Bank of Ireland if they wish to operate under a passporting arrangement in another\u00a0EEA Member State. <\/p><p>- Credit institutions authorised in another\u00a0EEA Member State must notify their home state regulator if they wish to operate under a passporting arrangement in Ireland. <\/p><p><b>Role as Home State Regulator<\/b><\/p><p>When the\u00a0Central Bank of Ireland authorises a credit institution it is responsible, as home state regulator, for regulating their activities in other\u00a0EEA Member States.<\/p><p><b>Role as Host State Regulator<\/b><\/p><p>As host state regulator the\u00a0Central Bank of Ireland is not responsible for the prudential supervision of Irish branches of credit institutions authorised in other\u00a0EEA Member States and operating under a passporting arrangement in Ireland except, in co-operation with the home state regulator, for their compliance with liquidity criteria.\u00a0 The\u00a0Central Bank of Ireland is responsible for consumer protection issues and compliance with Anti-Money Laundering regulations for the services provided by these entities in Ireland.<\/p><p>Download our <\/p><p><b>Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 (as amended) ('the Act')<\/b><\/p><p>Credit institutions operating in Ireland on a branch basis and passporting their services into Ireland must comply with Section 149 of the Act, which provides that you shall not impose or increase a charge for a service provided to a customer or a group of customers, without the prior approval of the Central Bank of Ireland (the 'Central Bank').<\/p><p>Read further details of this requirement in\u00a0.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400051#WRB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabled Drivers and Passengers Scheme","counter":70,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400051#WRB02200"},{"type":"question","counter":71,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[23740\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400051#WRB02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will support a matter (details supplied) regarding a pin number; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":72,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the relevant legislation governing the Drivers &amp;amp; Passengers with Disabilities Scheme is contained in Section 134(3) of the Finance Act 1992 (as amended) and Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 (Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994.<\/p><p>A Form DD1 (Application for Tax Relief in respect of vehicles purchased for use by persons with disabilities) was received in Revenue's Central Repayments Office, Monaghan on 29th April 2014.

Currently about 59% of all credit unions are subject to lending restrictions. This compares to a corresponding figure of 57% at the end of 2012. Almost all credit unions with a lending restriction in place have a maximum individual loan size restriction. Of the credit unions with lending restrictions, over 67% currently, which compares with 68% at the end of 2012, can lend &euro;20,000 or more to an individual member.<\/p><p>  2.8% of all credit unions are restricted to issuing loans of less than &euro;10,000 to an individual member.

These are the cases where there are more significant concerns in terms of risk to members' savings. <\/p><p>  For those credit unions where there is an individual loan size restriction in place, the level at which the limit is imposed ensures that the vast majority of those credit unions can continue to make loans significantly\u00a0greater than the average loan for the sector of just above &euro;6,000. Lending restrictions are, in most cases, intended to be short-term in nature and kept in place until the credit union has addressed the issues giving rise to the particular concerns advised to the credit union. <\/p><p>  The Registrar of Credit Unions informs me that lending restrictions are reviewed on a regular basis\u00a0to determine whether they are still set at appropriate levels.\u00a0  \u00a0Section 14 of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 provides for the appeal of certain decisions of the Central Bank, including some lending restrictions, to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400052#WRC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Central Bank of Ireland Investigations","counter":87,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400052#WRC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":88,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[23873\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400052#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide details of any investigations that have been undertaken into the collapse of Custom House Capital; if he is concerned at the failings of the regulatory system exposed in this case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":89,"content":"<p>The Central Bank's investigation into Custom House Capital Ltd (in Liquidation) and persons concerned in its management has been on-going since the publication of the Final Report to the High Court by Court Appointed Inspectors dated 19 October 2011.

In 2013 the Central Bank published on its website a Consultation Paper on Client Assets Regulations and Guidance, which will replace the existing client assets requirements (issued in 2007). The Review set out the following three objectives as the foundation of any client asset protection regime:<\/p><p>- The maintenance of public confidence in the client asset regime;<\/p><p>- The mitigation of the risk of misuse of client assets whether as a result of maladministration or fraud; and<\/p><p>- The provision of a system which in the event of a firm's insolvency will enable the expeditious return of available client assets to the owner at lowest cost.<\/p><p>It is envisaged that the new rules for the Safekeeping of Client Assets will be in place\u00a0before\u00a0the end of the year.<\/p><p><b>New rules in respect of key management positions\u00a0<\/b><\/p><p>I have already brought forward a very wide range of statutory powers to enable the Central Bank to deal with such an issue across the financial service sector under the Central Bank Reform Act 2010, which sets out a far-reaching regime for the Central Bank to set out and enforce standards of fitness and probity across the financial service sector, including standards of honesty, integrity and ethical judgement, which apply to those in key management positions.\u00a0The Act provides for sanctions, at the discretion of the Central Bank, of suspension, or even, prohibition orders, following an investigation and due process.\u00a0In terms of addressing poor management, the code applies similar requirements in respect of skills and experience.\u00a0 <\/p><p><b>Enhanced monitoring and enforcement powers for the Central Bank\u00a0<\/b><\/p><p>The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 also sets out a number of new provisions that are relevant. The fitness and probity provisions are reinforced by the whistleblower protections, which place an onus on those performing pre-approval controlled functions to disclose information relating to offences, prescribed contraventions, and breaches of Irish financial services legislation or the destruction of evidence. The Act also provides for the Central Bank to commission, as part of the proper and effective regulation of financial service providers, an independent expert report<b><\/b>at the cost of the financial service provider.

It provides for a substantial increase in monetary penalties: for a corporate body, the maximum penalty is increased to the greater of either &euro;10m or 10% of the turnover of the corporate body for its last complete financial year before the finding is made.

My officials have already consulted with school Management Bodies prior to issuing the circular and are currently setting up further meetings with Management Bodies and Parent representative groups to address any concerns which may have arisen since the circular issued.<\/p><p>  The Government approved an extra 390 SNA posts last December for the period to end-December 2014, which means that there are now almost 11,000 SNAS available to work with children who have an assessed care need in primary, post-primary and special schools.  This means that rather than a reduction of SNA posts, there is provision for a further 309 posts to be allocated to schools to the end of December 2014.<\/p><p>  In June 2011, the DES published a Value for Money and Policy Review of the SNA scheme.  In May 2013, the NCSE published its Policy Advice on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools.  Both reports concluded that the SNA scheme has been highly successful in supporting the care needs of children with special needs in schools, and with assisting to facilitate their integration and inclusion. However, the reports also concluded that the intended purpose of the scheme was not always generally well understood by parents or schools and that the scope and purpose of the scheme should be clarified for schools.<\/p><p>  Whereas all SNA allocations are reviewed annually, it should not be assumed that any such review may lead to a reduction in SNA support for individual pupils, or for schools who have pupils who have continuing care needs.  The Circular acknowledges that many pupils will have care needs which may remain constant.  However, the Circular makes clear that whereas supports may be reduced to ensure that pupils who have diminishing care needs can be afforded an opportunity to develop independent living skills, that SNA supports will continue to be provided for those pupils who have ongoing care needs.<\/p><p>  My Department encourages parents and school authorities to engage locally regarding pupils' education.

Public Servants have made a significant contribution to the fiscal recovery of the State, through a number of measures which have helped to reduce the Public Service gross pay bill from its peak of &euro;17.5 billion in 2009, to an estimated &euro;13.63 billion net of the pension related deduction in 2014. \u00a0In this context, reducing the Exchequer Pay Bill has been an important element in reducing public expenditure.  While unprecedented efforts have been made to reduce the cost of the public service pay bill since 2009 through the operation of the\u00a0Financial Emergency\u00a0legislation and other measures, pay costs still account for some 29 per cent of current expenditure.<\/p><p>  The Haddington Road Agreement (HRA), which came into force on 1 July 2013,\u00a0included a\u00a0number of measures including pay reductions\u00a0for those public servants on annual salaries of &euro;65,000\u00a0or more under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, 2013.  These measures\u00a0 provided for a reduction of the public service pay and pensions bill by &euro;1 billion by 2016. It is a three year Agreement covering the period to end\u00a0June 2016 and forms the basis for current public service pay policy over that period. \u00a0Through its\u00a0provisions,\u00a0the Agreement is\u00a0also delivering\u00a0an unprecedented\u00a0structural\u00a0increase of\u00a0almost 15 million additional working hours\u00a0annually in the\u00a0productivity of\u00a0the Public Service. \u00a0That productivity is\u00a0contributing\u00a0to the maintenance of our public services at a time of significant resource constraints and is a core enabler\u00a0for a sustainable reduction in the cost of the public service pay bill. In addition, it is important to note that the measures introduced under Haddington Road\u00a0provides the\u00a0scope to recruit additional staff to frontline services, particularly in the Education Sector and the Health Sector.

The criteria and procedures required for an employee to retire on grounds of ill-health are set out in Circular 22\/2007: Ill-Health Retirement from the Civil Service.\u00a0 This Circular sets out the procedures to be followed in a case of ill-health retirement, either on the initiative of the civil servant or of the Department\/Office.<\/p><p>Where a civil servant applies to retire early on the grounds of ill-health he or she must provide the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) with a completed Ill-Health Retirement form along with a medical report detailing his\/her diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.  Section 9 of the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956 provides for retirement on grounds of ill-health in circumstances where the civil servant has not tendered his\/her resignation.\u00a0 Where a Department\/Office seeks to compulsorily ill-health retire a civil servant, the appropriate authority should refer the matter to the CMO.\u00a0 The CMO will arrange for the civil servant to be medically examined and may also arrange for an outside specialist opinion if the CMO feels that this would be of benefit.  If the CMO is of the opinion that the civil servant is incapable on medical grounds of regular and effective service and that the situation is likely to be permanent, then the CMO will sign the relevant part of the Ill-Health Retirement form and return the form to the civil servant's Department\/Office.<\/p><p>In all cases, the final decision on whether or not a civil servant is granted ill-health retirement, lies with the relevant appropriate authority having received the advice of the CMO.\u00a0 This allows management discretion to consider both medical and non-medical matters.  A civil servant whose application for ill-health retirement has been refused, may request that his or her case be referred on appeal to a medical referee.<\/p><p>Circular 22\/07 replaced a previous circular (Circular 7\/57: Retirement from the Civil Service on the ground of ill-health) to take account of an amendment made by the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act 2005 to the Civil Service Regulation Act 1957.\u00a0 The 2005 Act amended the definition of &quot;appropriate authority&quot; under the 1957 Act to streamline management procedures by allowing the heads of Civil Service Departments and Offices to manage middle-ranking and junior staff without reference to Ministers or Government.  Where an officer retires on the grounds of ill health notional service may, at the discretion of the Minister, be added to his\/her actual service for the purposes of calculating retirement lump sum and personal pension.<\/p><p>Initially the provision for\u00a0&quot;added years&quot; was provided for on an administrative basis during the 1970s as a result of General Agreements.  The provision of added years' service was put on a statutory basis in 1980 (Civil Service Superannuation Regulations 1980, S.I. 188\/1980).\u00a0 There has been no change in the past ten years in pension policy in respect of\u00a0added years for ill health benefits.<\/p><p>The following table provides details of the number of ill health retirements in each Department \/Office in Civil Service over the past 10 years.<table><tr><th><b>Department<\/b><\/th><th><b>Number of Retirees<\/b><\/th><th><b>2004<\/b><\/th><th><b>2005<\/b><\/th><th><b>2006<\/b><\/th><th><b>2007<\/b><\/th><th><b>2008<\/b><\/th><th><b>2009<\/b><\/th><th><b>2010<\/b><\/th><th><b>2011<\/b><\/th><th><b>2012<\/b><\/th><th><b>2013<\/b><\/th><th><b>2014<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Agriculture, Food &amp;amp;

The Scheme is set out in the Public Service Management (Sick Leave) Regulations S.I. 124 of 2014\u00a0and, generally, applies\u00a0to all public servants.  The new Sick Leave Scheme was introduced, following the enactment of the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments)(Amendment) Act 2013 by the Oireachtas, to reduce the\u00a0very high and unsustainable cost of sick leave\u00a0in the public service.\u00a0 The new provisions allow staff access to the following paid sick leave:<\/p><p>- maximum of 92 days on full pay in a rolling one year period;<\/p><p>- followed by a maximum of 91 days on half pay in a rolling one year period;<\/p><p>- subject to a maximum of 183 days paid sick leave in a rolling four year period.<\/p><p>  Temporary Rehabilitation Remuneration (TRR - previously Pension Rate of Pay) can be granted\u00a0where an individual has exhausted the limits\u00a0for sick pay\u00a0provided there is\u00a0 a realistic prospect of that person returning to work.  The maximum period for which TRR can be paid is 547 days under ordinary sick leave arrangements.  In addition, in order to provide support for public service employees the new\u00a0Critical Illness Protocol (CIP) was put in place as part the scheme.  This allows an employee, who suffers a critical illness or serious physical injury, access to 12 months of paid sick leave on the\u00a0same basis as\u00a0the\u00a0previous sick leave scheme\u00a0(i.e. 183 days on full pay in a rolling one year period, followed by 182 days on half pay subject to a maximum of 365 days in a rolling four year period).\u00a0 In such cases TRR is for also available for 12 months with a further possibility of 2 years depending on the severity of the illness.<\/p><p>  The need to protect women during pregnancy and ensure that they are not discriminated against was reflected in the design of the new sick leave scheme. \u00a0In that context, the public service continues to operate its provisions for pregnancy-related illness in accordance with a European Court of Justice ruling (ref: McKenna case C-191\/03) in relation to the application of sick leave provisions to staff who are absent on pregnancy-related sick leave.  This means that a female employee will not be taken off pay while on pregnancy related sick leave.  In addition, the CIP provides specifically for pregnancy-related illness.  Where a pregnancy related illness\u00a0is serious it will also be covered by the CIP. \u00a0One of the criteria for awarding of CIP more generally\u00a0is 2 consecutive weeks of hospitalisation, however, this requirement is reduced to two days for pregnancy related illness in accordance with Labour Court recommendation (ref: LCR 20667).  Moreover, the provision, which allows management discretion to award CIP, can be used where a woman is very unwell requiring extended sick leave in excess of that available under standard sick leave arrangements due to pregnancy-related illness.  The inclusion of this provision enables management within organisations, on the basis of medical evidence, to provide the additional support available under the CIP where an employee may require access to extended sick leave over and above the normal arrangements on account of pregnancy-related illness.  Pregnancy related illnesses are also discounted for consideration of promotion and higher duty allowances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400058#WRJ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Service Contracts","counter":218,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400058#WRJ00675"},{"type":"question","counter":219,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[23957\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400058#WRJ00700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"when the Office of Public Works will finalise the awarding of a contract in respect of a project (details supplied); when this necessary work will be undertaken; the likely timeline for completion of the project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":220,"content":"<p>The pre-qualification of contractors stage of the tender process is nearing completion.

The results of this analysis, along with the Regional Enterprise Framework will form the basis of IDA Irelands strategy for the next five-year period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400058#WRJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regional Development","counter":224,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400058#WRJ01050"},{"type":"question","counter":225,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[23820\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400058#WRJ01100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the steps he has taken to ensure that all areas of the country enjoy a growth in employment; the success of his strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":226,"content":"<p>The Action Plan for Jobs is the Government's key policy instrument to assist job creation.  Its aim is to support enterprises to create employment throughout the whole of the country and in all regions.  The 2014 Action Plan for Jobs recognises that regions that support strong and dynamic enterprises are crucial to Ireland's return to overall economic growth.  In this context, the Action Plan contains a number of measures to be taken in 2014 to support competitive regions.  For example, this year, the IDA will commence building new advanced manufacturing facilities in Waterford and Athlone, and office space in Letterkenn, to help cater for FDI projects.<\/p><p>  The Local Government Reform Act 2014 has introduced wide-ranging reforms to Local Government in Ireland and the reconfigured Regional Assemblies will be tasked with preparing regional Spatial and Economic Strategies which will ensure the coordination of economic and spatial development across the regions and enable Local Government to play a stronger role in economic development in general.  As a core element of the Action Plan for Jobs, my Department has reformed the system for delivery of support to micro and small enterprises by dissolving the County and City Enterprise Boards and replacing them with Local Enterprise Offices within the Local Authority structure.  This reform will help to make the operating environment for businesses more coherent, responsive and conducive to entrepreneurship at local level across the country.  The Action Plan also includes a commitment to develop a framework for a Regional Enterprise Strategy to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprises.  My intention is that the framework will be developed on a pilot basis initially, based on the Midlands region, and focusing, in particular, on co-ordinating the efforts of the agencies under the remit of my own Department &ndash; Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, as well as the new Local Enterprise Offices.  The overarching objective of the framework is to enhance synergies between the agencies, their client companies and other key stakeholders to maximise the potential for job creation in the region.  In addition, many actions under the Entrepreneurship pillar of the Action Plan for Jobs, such as Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Competitive Regional Feasibility Funds, will support enterprise development and job growth at regional level.  The most recent employment data published by the Central Statistics Office show that employment has grown in most regions of the country, year-on-year.  However, we must continue, through the Action Plan for Jobs process, to maximise the job creation potential of all regions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400058#WRJ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Properties","counter":227,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400058#WRJ01250"},{"type":"question","counter":228,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[23821\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400058#WRJ01300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will rationalise the ownership of industrial land and estates between agencies under his remit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":229,"content":"<p>IDA Ireland and Shannon Development are the only two agencies under the remit of my Department who hold industrial property portfolios.  Under legislation both agencies are independent in the exercise of their property function.  Property solutions to companies who are clients of Enterprise Ireland are also provided by IDA Ireland.  As part of the restructuring of Shannon Development, the enterprise support functions have transferred to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  This will ensure the continuation of support to both FDI and indigenous enterprises in the region.  In addition, IDA Ireland is in the process of purchasing lands in the National Technology Park in Limerick and the Raheen Business and Technology Park from Shannon Development.  By bringing together the remaining property functions of a restructured Shannon Development with the Shannon Airport Authority under the umbrella of the new Shannon Group, the combination of the airport business with the adjoining industrial property portfolio can provide the region with the capacity to exploit sectoral opportunities and crucially those in the aviation sector.<\/p><p>  In respect of IDA Ireland, the empirical results of international research has demonstrated that the availability of suitable property solutions is a key element in the location decision making process undertaken by prospective investors in determining where projects will locate.  Most International development agencies with which IDA Ireland competes hold substantial stocks of such properties. <\/p><p>  In recent years, IDA Ireland has taken the decision to rationalise its non-core land holdings in a number of locations throughout the country.  Land holdings are initially offered to Local Authorities and recent examples of rationalisation of IDA Ireland non-core lands completed include the transfer of lands to Roscommon County Council, Donegal County Council, Wicklow County Council and South Dublin County Council.  In addition, current transfers in legal process include Cork County Council, Leitrim County Council, Wexford County Council and discussions are on-going with Galway County Council, Sligo County Council, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and Kilkenny County Council.  The Agency has explained that non-core lands which are not required by the Local Authorities are placed on the Open Market for disposal.  IDA Ireland also markets non-core lands and properties directly to stakeholders including; OPW, HSE, Chambers of Commerce, An Post and other similar bodies through active engagement in sharing portfolio information with common objectives.

This will be achieved by providing:- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and - a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses.  For example:<\/p><p>- Eircom is rolling out a &euro;400 m investment in a Next Generation Access Fibre Network that offers speeds of up to 100Mbps.  Service is already available to over 800,000 addresses, with planned coverage to reach 1.4 million addresses by 2016. <\/p><p>- UPC has invested over &euro;500 m in upgrading its cable network.  Over 700,000 homes can already access minimum broadband speeds of 120Mbps and up to 200Mbps.  Businesses can access speeds of 500Mbps. <\/p><p>- ESB is engaged in a new project allowing a fibre network to be rolled-out on its existing electricity infrastructure.  It is understood that discussions between ESB and Vodafone to form a new Joint Venture Company are at an advanced stage.  The company has initial plans to construct a fibre network directly to 450,000 premises outside of Dublin and it is expected that details will be announced over the coming weeks. <\/p><p>- Mobile operators have launched 4G high speed mobile broadband services following ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction.  There has also been continued investment by all operators in enhancing and broadening 3G services and network improvements. <\/p><p>- Fixed wireless operators are continuing to invest in high speed point-to-point wireless broadband. <\/p><p>- The broadcaster Sky has entered the broadband market, increasing choice for consumers.<\/p><p>Of the estimated 2.3 m premises in Ireland, approximately 1.4 m are expected to be served by these commercial next generation broadband services over the coming years. <\/p><p>This accelerated roll out of high speed services by the commercial sector means that the addressable area required by the State intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched.  While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns.  The speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. <\/p><p>On 25 April, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment under the National Broadband Plan.  This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way. <\/p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network.  It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users.  The fibre build-out will also ensure that fibre is deployed to strategic locations on each route such as schools, business hubs and health facilities.  The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out.  This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the comprehensive mapping process currently underway.  Further locations may be identified as this process continues.  Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention.  Currently I envisage that a total of 108 areas in County Cork will be included in the proposed fibre build-out, including the area of Dromore.  The list is available on my Department's website <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>In tandem with the fibre build-out, the Strategy will include measures to respond to aggregated community demand for services, and the provision of access services in the most remote areas where fibre rollout may be insufficient to stimulate commercial investment or may be cost-prohibitive. <\/p><p>Intensive design work is ongoing in the Department with a view to publishing an end-to-end implementation strategy later this year, together with the outcome of the mapping exercise which will identify the areas that require intervention.  A full public consultation will take place once the strategy is published and EU State Aids clearance will be required for the intervention strategy once finalised.  It is expected that the detailed procurement process will take place in 2015 with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in the areas that require intervention as quickly as possible. <\/p><p>I fully share the concerns of local representatives about the quality of broadband in rural areas.  I intend to ensure that rural Ireland enjoys similar opportunities to urban areas by ensuring an end-to end market intervention with fibre as a core component.  In committing to a fibre build-out at the heart of this strategy, the Government is acknowledging that broadband is the key infrastructure of the 21<sup>st<\/sup>century.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400061#WRM00300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Postal Services","counter":282,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400061#WRM00350"},{"type":"question","counter":283,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[23785\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400061#WRM00400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will amend the current postal services Acts to introduce a public service obligation on An Post to maintain a minimum level of service to rural communities by providing a geographical spread of sub post offices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The National Smart Metering Programme is a central component of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to enhance management of energy demand, deliver smart networks and enable greater energy efficiency.  It is also aligned with EU obligations on Member States under the Energy Efficiency Directive to progress smart metering.  The national roll-out of Smart Meters has been assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  A major programme of technology and user trials showed that a national rollout of Smart Meters could lead to reductions in overall electricity and gas consumption, as well as an 8.8% reduction in peak-time electricity consumption.  Following the successful completion of these trials by the CER a decision to proceed to the design of the National Smart Metering Programme was taken in 2012.  Subject to completion of the design work, which is currently underway, the building and testing of the smart meters infrastructure and confirmation that the programme continues to be justified on cost\/benefit grounds, it is expected that smart meters will be rolled out nationally between 2016 and 2019. <\/p><p>  The rollout of the National Smart Metering Programme will require legal underpinning.

This model provides a predictable and effective methodology for the redistribution of funds from those who currently hold high entitlements to those who hold low value entitlements making it possible to provide precise information to farmers regarding the level of support they can expect to receive for the period 2015 to 2019. As applied in Ireland, the model will include a cap on the payment per hectare of &euro;700 by 2019 as well as a guarantee that all entitlements will reach a minimum unit value of 60% of the national average entitlement value by 2019. This model achieves the stated objectives of a gradual phased redistribution of funds in a fair and objective manner. <\/p><p>  My Department has undertaken an extensive programme designed to make available all relevant information regarding the new Scheme to the farming community including through farmers&rsquo; meetings and the publication of a detailed booklet &lsquo;CAP 2015: An Introduction to Direct Payments&rsquo;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400063#WRO00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Eligibility","counter":340,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400063#WRO00950"},{"type":"question","counter":341,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[23736\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400063#WRO01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will review the penalty process for single farm payments and disadvantaged area scheme payments as many farmers are being unfairly penalised on lands that were formerly qualified; if he will provide clarification on the exact number of farmers that have been contacted as part of this on-going land parcel eligibility review; the number of farmers in County Cork who have been contacted in this regard; the total sum being recouped from farmers in County Cork; his views on whether this review is fair on farmers and that due to these draconian penalties and in some cases no payment, many of these farmers will be forced out of business; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":342,"content":"<p>Under the Terms &amp;amp; Conditions of the Direct Aid Schemes, which includes the Single Payment Scheme and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, farmers are obliged to declare only eligible land when making their applications, ensuring they exclude ineligible features such as roads, buildings, farmyards, dense scrub, etc. These claims are then recorded on my Department&rsquo;s Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS).

The purpose of these roundtable discussions with key stakeholders in the beef sector, which includes representatives from IFA, ICMSA, ICSA, MII, Teagasc and Bord Bia, is to reflect on recent developments in the sector and set out a series of actions that will aid viability across the supply chain in light of current market conditions.<\/p><p>  So far this year there have been two Beef Roundtable Discussions, on 17 April and 3 June.   I believe that all sides agree that these discussions are a worthwhile exercise and the constructive engagement of participants confirms my belief that ongoing dialogue and collaboration, supported by the Government, is essential to improving the interdependent relationship between and producers and processors. The positive outcome of the roundtable discussions is reflected in the various measures announced so far. These include:<\/p><p>-   the Beef Roundtable discussions will reconvene quarterly to exchange intelligence on market developments and forecasts particularly in relation to supply, demand, prices, product specifications, retail changes etc; <\/p><p>-   a commitment to launching a &lsquo;Beef Pricewatch&rsquo; online tool to make price information more accessible and free of charge to farmers, <\/p><p>-   Mr. Michael Dowling, Chairman of the Beef 2020 Activation Group was asked to look at the role that specifications play in the young bull production and prices and to review implementation of the Group&rsquo;s report. His report made a number of recommendations on which I have asked the roundtable participants to reflect and consider. <\/p><p>-   My Department will prioritise its targeted on-farm capital investments for suckler farmers through the new Rural Development Programme; <\/p><p>-   Bord Bia has allocated &euro;0.5m to expand and target promotion of Irish beef through its campaigns in the UK and in certain continental markets;<\/p><p>-   Teagasc will intensify its efforts to enable farmers to maximise on-farm efficiencies through lowering input costs and increasing output value to deliver a better margin for suckler farmers and finishers. This assistance will include advice on adapting productions systems to meet market specifications; &amp;amp;<\/p><p>-   I have undertaken discussions with my Northern counterpart, Ms Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, on issues relevant to the sector including cross-border trade.<\/p><p>  The second Roundtable discussions were open and lively and all sides (farmers, meat processors and officials) committed themselves to continuing the process. For the next Roundtable discussions my Department will follow up on improving the Beef Pricewatch information available to farmers as well as examining the role Producer Organisations could play in establishing a better price for beef farmers. <\/p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that one of my priorities since taking office has been the continued development of the beef sector. The Government&rsquo;s commitment to the primary production in the sector is evidenced by an investment package worth up to &euro;40m to beef farmers in 2014 allied with a number of progressive schemes to be implemented over the lifetime of the new RPD. Taken together with the leadership provided by my roundtable initiative, beef farmers have the necessary supports to enhance the profitability and sustainability of their livestock enterprises.<\/p><p>  In my view the work following on from the Beef Roundtable discussions taken together with the investment outlined above and further support for beef farmers from the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) will mean that the targets set for the sector in Food Harvest 2020 will be achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400063#WRO01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Appeals","counter":346,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400063#WRO01350"},{"type":"question","counter":347,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[23752\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400063#WRO01400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a single farm payment appeal will be finalised in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Tipperary; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1087","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":348,"content":"<p>A review of the lands declared by the person named under the Single Payment Scheme in 2012 and 2013 revealed that a number of land parcels declared contained ineligible features.

It also provided a useful opportunity to examine mechanisms which could promote the further use and recognition of Irish Sign Language and understand practical implications for service users.  Further to this meeting, the Deaf Community prepared a report to reflect their views on key actions and priorities.  This report was submitted for my consideration last month.  The intention is that the recommendations from this report, where practicable, will be reflected in the NDSIP through the incorporation of new actions and related performance indicators and timelines where necessary.

In 2014, this policy was modified to allow candidates in the then forthcoming local Government elections to drop off election leaflets which could be placed in a common area in the centre where they could be picked up by residents.  Candidates could provide on the leaflets contact details or times of political meetings outside the centre which residents could attend.  The RIA circular stresses the importance of RIA centres operating in a politically neutral environment given the particular nature of the accommodation provided in those centres. <\/p><p>  This policy reflects a number of factors - the communal nature of the direct provision system, the desirability that they operate in a politically neutral environment, the many practical and logistical difficulties that would arise for centre managers in providing unsupervised access in circumstances where families and children live together. <\/p><p>  The RIA policy does not breach any national or international legal obligations. No restrictions are being placed on residents&rsquo; voting rights, or on their rights to access whatever information candidates wish to convey to them, or on any rights to meet with candidates, albeit outside centres.  The policy derives solely from the practical issues involved in the particular circumstances of the direct provision system.  The policy is kept under continuous review and, to that end, RIA has invited a number of interested NGO's to submit their views as to how its concerns on the practical issues involved, as outlined in this response, could be reasonably addressed in future local Government elections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400067#WRS01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Resources","counter":443,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400067#WRS01350"},{"type":"question","counter":444,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[23902\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400067#WRS01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of boats currently in the Garda Water Unit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1021","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":445,"content":"<p>The provision and allocation of Garda resources, including boats, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner in the light of her identified policing priorities.

These include the following: supervision, in the form of community return or community support.  Such supervision is undertaken by the Probation Service; training and rehabilitation within the prison system, for prisoners as a continuing component of their post-release programmes; structured temporary (or early) releases from prison granted for the purpose of undertaking educational and\/or training courses or programmes or other rehabilitative opportunities (such as a hostel placement, non-residential placement, participation in a community project, or other support).<\/p><p>  A wide variety of agencies are involved in all of these areas - both from the statutory and voluntary sectors.  I might also mention that my Department and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operate youth diversion programmes in urban and rural communities throughout the State which are aimed at diverting those at most risk of offending away from crime and thus intervening before the youths concerned end up either under supervision by the Probation Service or in the prison system.<\/p><p>  While the specific focus of the Deputy's Question is the post-release training and rehabilitative services for persons whose sentences have ended, I should also mention that the Prison Service provides to those in custody a wide range of rehabilitative programmes, which have the dual purpose of providing prisoners with purposeful activity while serving their sentences and encouraging them to lead non-offending lives on release.<\/p><p>  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015.  There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning through Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.  There is a Guidance Counsellor available to all young persons in prison.  This teacher's role is to make contact with outside schools, informal education centres and community training centres.  In addition he\/she will also liaise with guidance services and social welfare services and be in contact with prison linkage groups and Pathways Education Centres.  The Guidance Counsellor advocates on behalf of the prisoner before their release with these educational facilities in the community.  This teacher also liaises with other services working with the prisoner to get the best possible placement available on release.<\/p><p>  Other areas where there has been significant progress in prison education are in physical education, in the provision of higher education, in the arts and in preparing prisoners for release and supporting their transition to life, and often to education, on the outside.  A top priority for the Irish Prison Service is ensuring help for those with reading and writing problems and peer mentoring programmes are currently active in all of our prisons.<\/p><p>  As part of a joint initiative between the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service, to address the needs of Young Offenders, education and training specific community return options have been designed for young offenders under the age of 21.  A new approach to structured probation supervision of released young offenders is being implemented.  In addition, the Irish Prison Service fund the GATE service, whose staff are trained career guidance specialists based in the prisons.  Young persons engage with the services Training and Employment Officers (TEO&rsquo;s) as early as possible prior to release.  The GATE Service has been in operation since 2007 and is a joint initiative between the Irish Association for the Social Integration of Offenders (IASIO) and the Irish Prison Service (IPS).<\/p><p>  Lastly, I would mention that generally, once a person's prison sentence has ended, there is no enduring obligation on that individual to remain in contact with the agencies of my Department.  There are a small number of exceptions to this including sex offenders who may be required to register with their local Garda station and life sentenced prisoners who will be required to remain under supervision by the Probation Service after their release.  However, every effort is made to encourage prisoners to avail of the community supports available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400068#WRT00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":456,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400068#WRT00450"},{"type":"question","counter":457,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[23937\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400068#WRT00500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason Ireland has chosen not to take part in the European investigation order directive of the European Parliament and Council regarding the European investigation order 7 March 2014; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":458,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[23938\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400068#WRT00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the Government participated in the Council of the European Union debate on the European investigation order; the reservations that were raised and alterations proposed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":459,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[23939\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400068#WRT00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the Government plan to revisit its decision not to participate in the European investigation order scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":460,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 164 to 166, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  In 2010, Ireland chose not to opt into the draft European Investigation Order (EIO) proposal on the basis that it was inconsistent with Irish law and practice.

The objective of this scheme is to support early learning in a formal setting in advance of starting school.  I understand that certain flexibilities are built into the scheme in an effort to accommodate children with special needs, such as an overage exemption, or waiver, for children with special needs who do not meet the age criteria and the option to avail of the free pre-school year over two years.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the free pre-school year.  However, it works at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This is done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some cases at local level disability services have also facilitated children with disabilities to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible.<\/p><p>  The HSE&rsquo;s role in supporting children with disabilities involves it working in close co-operation with the disability service providers that it funds, with the education sector, with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and with the parents and families of the children in question.  However, there is a need to strengthen these arrangements.  A dedicated Cross-Sectoral Team, comprising representatives of my Department, the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs plays a key role in fostering greater collaboration on children&rsquo;s disability issues and to build on the cross-sectoral working arrangements that are already in place.

The Act provides that persons, who are unable to arrange GP services for themselves and family without undue hardship, having regard to their overall financial situation, can qualify for a medical card. The HSE can only award medical cards in accordance with the Health Act and, therefore, it must assess the means and reasonable expenditure of the applicant, and his or her spouse or partner. On this basis, statistical data relating to the condition or illness of applicants is not collated under the Medical Card Scheme.<\/p><p>  The HSE provides a range of health and personal supports to people with disabilities, including those with Multiple Sclerosis, which incorporate hospital, primary care and community services.  Community services and supports for people with disabilities, including those with Multiple Sclerosis, are provided in a variety of community and residential settings in partnership with service users, their families and carers and are provided directly by the HSE or through a range of voluntary service providers.<\/p><p>  People with Multiple Sclerosis can benefit from therapy services including Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, Speech &amp;amp; Language Therapy as well as a range of medical interventions.  The HSE provides assisted living services, including Personal Assistant services, to support individuals to maximise their capacity to live full and independent lives.  People with Multiple Sclerosis may also be eligible for medical \/ surgical aids &amp;amp; appliances that facilitate and\/or maintain mobility and\/or functional independence.<\/p><p>  MS Ireland receives annual funding from the HSE under Section 39 of the Health Act 2004 towards the provision of a range of services at local and national level to those newly diagnosed, carers, children of parents with Multiple Sclerosis and health professionals.  Programmes include physical therapies, symptom management, information \/ education seminars and a confidential helpline.  In 2013, MS Ireland received funding of &euro;2.56 million from the HSE.<\/p><p>  The Government is very aware of the public concern in relation to the issue of medical cards. The Cabinet Committee on Health met last week and decided to develop the policy framework governing eligibility in a manner that will also take account of medical conditions   in light of its decision. The process will include the development of a new legislative framework, as necessary. The HSE will establish an expert panel to examine the range of conditions that should be brought into consideration. The Department of Health has also been mandated to develop a policy paper on the further roll-out of GP care free at the point of access in the context of the move to universal health insurance. <\/p><p>  The Minister for Health will present a Memorandum to Government setting out the next steps.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400072#WRX00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Home Services","counter":547,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400072#WRX00550"},{"type":"question","counter":548,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[23775\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400072#WRX00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"based on the population projections by the Centre for Ageing Research and Development confirming ESRI projections on major growth in the number of persons needing nursing home care, if he will ensure that a meaningful forum on long-term residential care, co-ordinated and led by his Department, will be established to discuss and plan the future of long-term residential care and the broader care requirements of our ageing society, bringing together all of the relevant stakeholders and including the NHI, State bodies, including his Department, the Health Service Executive, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the Health Information and Quality Authority and representatives of older people, with clear terms of reference; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"964","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":549,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question Number 674 of 28 May 2013.

Under the Health Act 2008, automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons aged 70 and over ended on 31 December 2008.  Under the arrangements effected by the Act, a revised system of assessment for eligibility was introduced for those 70 years of age and over, based on the significantly higher gross income limits rather than the standard net income thresholds. This advantageous arrangement for persons aged over 70 years has facilitated a much greater share of this cohort qualifying for a medical card compared to the general population as a whole.<\/p><p>  In the main, persons in the over-70s age cohort do not have the same outlays and expenses as those under 70 years of age who are assessed on a means basis. Under the standard  means tested medical card scheme, allowance may be made for rent\/mortgage, travel to work and child care costs.  Generally, for the over 70s, mortgages have been cleared, children have been catered for and they would not have travel to work related costs. <\/p><p>  However, persons aged 70 or older who are assessed as ineligible under the gross income thresholds may also have their eligibility assessed under the means tested medical card scheme where they face particularly high expenses, e.g., nursing home or medication costs. As I have outlined, this assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses and the qualifying income thresholds under this scheme are lower than over -70s gross income thresholds.  <\/p><p>  Furthermore, persons aged over 70 years may still be eligible for a medical card where discretion is exercised where they face undue hardship in arranging medical services as a result of medical or social circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400075#WRAA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Safety of Hospital Staff","counter":625,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400075#WRAA01700"},{"type":"question","counter":626,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[23960\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400075#WRAA01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of attacks on staff working in the mental health sector in the mid-west region in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The fund closed for applications from staff seeking support under the programme at the end of April.  Over 2,200 staff have applied to the fund.  The cost to staff will be &euro;25 per module with the fund providing the balance of up to &euro;175 per module. The funding available will be sufficient to provide for all the applications on hand.  The applications for support are currently being assessed and training will commence in September this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014060400077#WRCC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"}]
