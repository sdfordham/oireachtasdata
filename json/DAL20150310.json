Further consideration of any IAG proposals will be based on having greater clarity from IAG on the overall employment prospects on the basis of the proposals received, with particular reference to the timeframe within which net additional employment would be created; firm commitments on plans for growing Aer Lingus' transatlantic business; and plans to grow Aer Lingus' routes at Cork and Shannon and to enhance the Knock-Gatwick service.

Furthermore, it is unlikely that it would be open to the courts to insist on the retention or recovery of access to Heathrow.

Of course it should be provided if it is absolutely necessary, but I believe there is a more appropriate, balanced and structured way of achieving the same result.

The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, is very clear on that.  Issues such as the Heathrow slots, connectivity to the United States and operations at Shannon, Cork and Dublin Airports are matters of genuine concern and interest to workers, their families and other people in localities and environs of Dublin, Cork and Shannon.  It is already public knowledge that there will be a further meeting between officials of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and IAG this week.  Obviously, the Department will inform the Minister of the issues presented by IAG during that discussion.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has not made, and is not in a position to make, a recommendation to the Government.  The conditions set out by Government in regard to Aer Lingus are clear.  This airline was privatised a number of years ago under a different Administration.  The Government now holds a 25.1% stake in Aer Lingus on behalf of the people.

The case was extremely well made that the Government should snap those up.  How is regional development to be protected if a private company controls Aer Lingus?  As it stands, any scale-down of operations in, for example, Cork Airport would have a devastating impact.

Clearly, the issues raised are of a very serious nature, relating not only to serious criminal activity but also to the potential risk to children from people who were hidden away in our communities by these organisations.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently investigating information on these issues which they have received from a number of people.  These Garda investigations are ongoing and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on them, except to say that they are a priority given the child protection concerns and the seriousness of the alleged offences involved.<\/p><p>I would further add that it is important to continue to encourage people with any relevant information to come forward to the authorities.<\/p> <p> I have not discussed the allegations of sexual abuse with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, nor did I discuss the issue with the First Minister, Mr. Robinson, or the Deputy First Minister, Mr. McGuinness, at the recent meeting of the British-Irish Council or at the North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, in November.  As Deputies are aware, justice and policing matters are not sectoral areas covered in the North-South Ministerial Council framework.  North-South co-operation in these areas takes place bilaterally.  However, the health and child welfare aspects of child protection are included in the NSMC framework.  The plenary meeting in Armagh in December had a very useful discussion on child protection and noted that very good collaborative work is already taking place, both within the NSMC structures and elsewhere.<\/p> <p> On the margins of this meeting, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, David Ford, also had the opportunity to discuss the issues arising as part of their ongoing co-operation and work in this area.  The Ministers are anxious to ensure that the issues arising are fully addressed and they are looking closely at the best way in which that can be done.  The Minister is briefed on this issue on an ongoing basis.  Arising from their discussions, the Ministers have tasked the relevant officials in their Departments to examine the legal and practical issues that might arise which relate to the issue of establishing forms of inquiry.  Their officials are currently carrying out detailed, joint work in that regard and they will report on developments to Ministers in the near future.  This process of examination is being done against the background of the various investigations, North and South, that are under way into aspects of this issue.

Very often issues get a wave of attention in the public media and then tend to drift to the side in terms of consistency of focus and urgent intervention mechanisms that should have been put in place to enable their further investigation and also to facilitate other victims to come forward.  We were shocked by the Ma&iacute;ria Cahill revelations because they revealed a very dark side to the Sinn F&eacute;in-IRA movement over a number of decades, and in particular the degree to which sex abusers within the movement were protected as a deliberate strategy.<\/p>  <p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that when victims come forward to speak, the very least that should be done is that they should be allowed to speak free of any attempt to undermine them or their integrity.  I just spoke with Ma&iacute;ria Cahill before I came to the Chamber this afternoon.  She again asked that the online campaign that has been ongoing on a daily basis to undermine her and abuse her should stop.  I recall the words of the T&aacute;naiste to Deputy Adams that he would please call off the dogs of war on Ma&iacute;ria Cahill in terms of the vicious online abuse that has been an unseemly feature of what has transpired since Ma&iacute;ria Cahill gave her interviews.<\/p>  <p>  This evening, there will be further revelations on the \"Spotlight\" programme by Paudie McGahon, yet another victim of abuse by a senior IRA member.  I met with Paudie McGahon quite some time ago.  I did not seek the meeting, nor have I ever tried to utilise any of these issues for political gain, as has been alleged.  That is a constant mantra trotted out by Sinn F&eacute;in and others.  When victims come forward, they come forward.  I have met victims in many different walks of life who were victims of various institutions.  It just so happens that in this case two victims came to tell me their story and Paudie McGahon was one of them.  It is a horrific story in itself about the abuse that was perpetrated on him by a senior member of the IRA, but worse again is the fact that a kangaroo court was held.  He was invited to the kangaroo court by a Sinn F&eacute;in public representative and by the IRA movement.  He was given a range of advices.  He was informed that the member who had abused him was in custody and had been guilty of abusing other victims.  They were invited to either dispose of the individual themselves; that the IRA would dispose of him; or other options.<\/p>  <p>  Implicit in all of that is a refusal to bring all of that information to the Garda.  The people in possession of the knowledge relating to Paudie McGahon should not have protected the individual concerned but should have sent all of the detail to the Garda, but they did not.  He was told himself that if he whispered anything to the Garda, he would be found at the side of a road somewhere.  That is the level of protection he got as a victim.  It is extremely sickening to have to listen to protestations about the past and respite for people in the past when a case such as this happened in recent times, namely, 2002.  Paudie McGahon was asked if he wanted to see an in-house psychologist that the IRA movement itself was making available to help him deal with the situation.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Adams himself said he is aware that the Provisional IRA took actions in relation to abusers which involved keeping the crimes away from the authorities, but so too did Sinn F&eacute;in on this occasion.  There was not the usual divide between the military and civil wings in this respect.  Both were acting in unison and concord in dealing with this particular case.  Honest and transparent answers are required, not attempts to bury the case in the past and into a process which would mean it would not get any articulation.  I asked the Taoiseach about the matter in my questions.  I went to Belfast to speak with the Minister of Justice, Mr. Ford, in the aftermath of the Ma&iacute;ria Cahill case.  I believe a cross-Border mechanism should be developed to at least facilitate other victims to come forward, who might not want to go public.  Victims themselves can decide whether they want to go public.  In order to get some sense of closure on abuse they suffered, there should at least be some opportunity to articulate it and bring it forward to a proper forum which would have the right capacity, backup and supports to enable victims to achieve that.<\/p>  <p>  There is a need for far more urgent intervention with both the Northern authorities and the British Government.  We hear a lot about the past, which is important, but this is just as important as other issues that have been dealt with on a government-to-government basis.  I refer to big cases that were the subject of the Good Friday Agreement, the St. Andrews Agreement and other agreements.  This is just as important but there is no excuse for it to be put to one side because it might not suit or be politically convenient.  I ask that the Taoiseach would engage with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, and the Northern Ireland Executive to pursue the matter more vigorously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000021#T00300","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1426003800,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Nobody doubts the seriousness of the issue.  There should not be and there cannot be a hiding place for those who carry out those kind of offences.  Under the North-South Ministerial Council, although it is not specifically part of the remit of the council, the issues are dealt with bilaterally.  I did receive a letter from the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, in regard to a proposal for the establishment through the North-South Ministerial Council of an all-island process to deal with the issue of support mechanisms for those who were victims of sexual abuse during the Troubles, and that it would include support for victims of abuse in all communities and to ensure greater access to counselling and other supports for victims of abuse, and to facilitate victims and survivors in accessing the justice system and making official complaints.  I responded to that letter because people should be aware of the specific processes ongoing in Northern Ireland, namely, the review by the Northern Ireland Director of Public Prosecutions and the reference to the Police Ombudsman's office in respect of a specific case.<\/p><p>It is important that the relevant authorities, North and South, are able to proceed unimpeded with their work in this regard.  I completely agree with Deputy Martin that it is simply not good enough and absolutely appalling that a victim of abuse is being pressurised in whatever fashion, by whomever on the instructions of whomever.  <\/p> <p> The Deputy is aware that the Garda liaises closely with Tusla in respect of any child protection concerns that arise, in accordance with the standing protocol between the two services.  It also liaises closely with the Police Service of Northern Ireland in respect of any criminal activity or child protection issues that arise. <\/p> <p> As far as I am aware, since the Ma&iacute;ria Cahill revelations became public and the discussion in the D&aacute;il, no new information has come into the possession of the Department of Justice and Equality arising from Ms Cahill's revelations or from information received by Deputies Doherty and Adams.  This does not mean the Garda has not uncovered or come across information that is not yet known to the Department or publicly.  It may well be that it has come across other information.  <\/p> <p> When this issue first emerged, we considered whether to have some form of joint North-South inquiry or commission.  As the North and South are two separate legal jurisdictions, it is not as simple as it may appear to take this kind of approach.  At the moment, we have close co-operation and the offices of the Police Ombudsman and Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland are carrying out independent investigations.  The Garda is also liaising with Tusla and is in touch with the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, and her counterpart in the Northern Ireland Executive, the Minister for Justice, Mr. David Ford, are obviously involved in the current situation and some further action may come out of it.  <\/p> <p> I am not sure whether one should set up an institution.  The Deputy First Minister wrote to me about having a process by which these matters could be dealt with.  A number of independent entities are already dealing with this and it is a case of deciding what is the best thing to do here.  We do not want to interfere with the Director of Public Prosecutions and Police Ombudsman's offices in Northern Ireland or the relationship between Tusla and the Garda or the information that may be passing between them.  However, nobody can argue with the seriousness of this matter.<\/p> <p> I have not met Mr. McGahon who made comments publicly today and is, I understand, the subject of a television programme later this evening.  We should all view this matter with the utmost seriousness.  Those in organisations or entities who have information should come forward with it and those who have the courage to speak out should not be abused or pressurised on the instructions of people who might not want his kind of information to come into the public domain in the first place.  I admire their courage and we should do everything we can to have this work done unimpeded and in a confidential manner.<\/p> <p> This issue is far too serious for general assumptions.  These are serious cases which the victims must carry with them every day of their lives.  Politicians must decide what is the best thing to do here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000021#T00400","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426004400,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I very much appreciate the Taoiseach's appeal for people to be very careful about what they say in this House because these matters are under investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This has not stopped the Fianna F&aacute;il Party leader from naming a private citizen in the Chamber in the past in connection with the most serious of allegations.  It did not stop the Taoiseach from asserting that some people suffered mistreatment at the hands of members of Sinn F&eacute;in, nor the Fianna F&aacute;il leader from making similar assertions.  Victims not only require and have the right to support, but no one should be pressurised or subjected to any campaign of harassment either online or in any other way.<\/p>  <p>  I have also read in the media that allegations made by a County Louth man, Paudie McGahon, are to be rehearsed in a television programme this evening.  The agencies to deal with allegations of abuse are An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and social services.  From what I have read, Mr. McGahon clearly feels badly let down.  The Fianna F&aacute;il leader and Taoiseach made the assertion that some of the abusers were associated with republicanism.  If that is the case, they did not act in our name or in the names of the people who suffered for the republican cause over a very long time.  Paudie McGahon feels badly let down and nothing I say may change that.  This is a matter of very deep regret to me.  Mr. McGahon needs support and justice.  I am assured, contrary to what the Fianna F&aacute;il stated, that when this case was brought to the attention of local representatives, the victim of the alleged abuse was advised in person and in writing to go to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <\/p>  <p>  Last November, the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, wrote to the Taoiseach and proposed the establishment, through the North-South Ministerial Council, of a clearly defined, all-island process to deal with the issue of providing support mechanisms for all those who were victims of sexual abuse during the conflict.  We know that one in four people suffers abuse, mainly by a family member, and that society has been remiss in dealing with these issues.  The Ma&iacute;ria Cahill revelation brought a very clear focus on those who had been abused during the conflict and were not properly dealt with by state agencies, statutory bodies and, in some cases, republicans.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy First Minister's letter set out objectives to support victims of abuse in all communities, ensure greater access to counselling and other supports for victims and facilitate victims and survivors in assessing the justice system and making official complaints.  In addition, the letter states that the anonymity and confidentiality of victims and survivors who did not wish to be identified should be acknowledged and protected.  The Deputy First Minister also argued for the promotion of existing helplines and, if necessary, dedicated hotlines, North and South, to facilitate victims and survivors who wish to come forward.  These are A, B and C steps that could be easily taken.  The Taoiseach has not responded to these propositions in the way he should.  The Deputy First Minister has written to him on three occasions and first put his proposals in November 2014.  It is now March and Martin McGuinness has expressed his concern at the lack of engagement by the Taoiseach on his proposals. <\/p>  <p>  I do not have any objections, and nor should I have, to these matters being rehearsed in this Chamber.  A great deal needs to be done in terms of funding rape crisis centres, providing protections and so forth.  However, we need to move beyond commentary and establish mechanisms and processes which deal with the unique circumstance of what occurred during the conflict.<\/p><p>If the mechanisms that the Deputy First Minister is putting forward are not sufficient and if we cannot get a North-South focus on this beyond what we have at the moment, the Taoiseach should bring forward some other proposition.<\/p> <p> It is very disappointing that this has not been responded to in the way that it should have been.  When we had the debate in the House last November I was very critical of the way the Government parties and the Leader of the Opposition dealt with the issues.  I concluded by saying: \"I suppose I should not judge them on what they say in this particular debate as we will all be judged on what we do to protect children and the rights of women.\"  I believe we stand open to the accusation that we have not dealt with this issue in the way that it should have been dealt with.<\/p> <p> I appeal to the Taoiseach once again.  The fact that the Deputy First Minister has not got even the courtesy of a response to what was a serious proposition by him is disappointing indeed.  This is for all the victims and all the survivors.  Obviously, I have a clear focus on those who may have been victims of those who purported to be republicans.  However, there are many other folks outside of that group who also need support.  That between the two Administrations, North and South, we have not moved on this is a matter of some disappointment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000022#U00200","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426005000,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I have responded to the Deputy First Minister, Mr. McGuinness.  He asked for a process to be put in place.  I assume that means there would be an end to that process in any individual case.  I presume that would mean a person or persons would be brought before the court and that the law would take its course.  If an allegation is made about sexual abuse, either an individual case or in respect of an individual over a period, the process would be that if that person decides to speak out, he or she would be able to do so in a protected way and not be pressurised in any way subsequently.  The situation from a legal point of view would be followed through, and if allegations are made against perpetrators, they would be brought before the authorities and a decision made on whether they are guilty or otherwise.<\/p>  <p>  Two independent investigations are ongoing, undertaken by the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Ombudsman.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is briefed by the Garda as needs be and in respect of whatever information comes to the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p>  <p>  I have no wish to prejudge a television programme which, I understand, is taking place this evening, but I understand when the person involved met a Garda superintendent in October last year, he was advised of the supports available to him.  He subsequently made a formal complaint to the Garda and a criminal investigation was launched.  That investigation is ongoing.  My understanding is that the person involved said that he had been abused by a member of the Provisional IRA who stayed at his family home, which was then deemed to be a safe house.  He said his life was threatened by the abuser.  I understand he has also alleged that his brother was abused, but he declined to be public about that allegation and has not pursued a formal complaint with the Garda.  He maintains that he alleged in the early 2000s that he brought the matter to the attention of a local councillor who arranged for what he called a process to be put in place to deal with the allegation and punish the alleged abuser.  He and another victim, his brother, were brought before a number of republican members, including a named person who is a former member of the Provisional IRA, to be interviewed about their allegations.  He says that he was offered a choice of punishments for the alleged abuser, including that he would be killed, and that he opted to have him exiled.<\/p>  <p>  This is a kangaroo court operating outside the jurisdiction of a democracy and the remit of the law of the land as we know it.  I am unsure whether Deputy Adams has any information or has been given any information about this, but this kind of situation is intolerable.  It goes back to what Ma&iacute;ria Cahill made public with her remarks to the effect that hers was not the only case.<\/p>  <p>  If we are dealing with a process involving these serious allegations, then I am prepared to work with the Northern Ireland Executive First Minister and Deputy First Minister, just as the Minister for Justice and Equality is with her counterpart, whether through the North-South Ministerial Council or whatever.  It is not as simple as it sounds to set up an institution covering two jurisdictions with different legal systems.  At the end of the day, if people are sexually abused over a period or threatened and pressurised, then we have to have a system of law that can deal with that.  If the allegations being made by this individual are correct, then it was clearly on the instructions of a person or persons to have a court of punishment and interrogation, and that has nothing to do with the law of the land.<\/p>  <p>  For my part, in replying to the Deputy First Minister, Mr. McGuinness, I would point out that there are two independent operations, Tusla and its remit as well as co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI.  There is consultation between the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister of Justice in Northern Ireland, together with their respective Departments.  Aside from that I do not believe we need an institution for cross-Border justice.  It seems as if the allegations made are that such an institution was set up illegally with threats of death, exile and interrogation at the core of it.<\/p>  <p>  If it is a process the Deputy First Minister is looking for, I believe that through all these elements, organisations and agencies operating strictly within the law, it should be possible to have a process of support generally for victims of sexual abuse in any community.  It should also be possible for those who have the courage to speak out in respect of many of the details, circumstances and names, in some cases, of persons who are alleged to have committed the offences and put all of that together.  I am perfectly happy to speak to the Deputy First Minister, Mr. McGuinness, arising from my response to him to see how this might best be done.  However, that does not involve getting into legalities about the different legal systems and how this might operate.<\/p>  <p>  In this case there are allegations about republican abuse or abuse by persons who were members of the Provisional IRA.  If a young man or woman has been sexually abused, they have to carry that with them all their lives.  We should try in every way we can to see that they get the support and counselling they need and deserve, and that where allegations can be proven, the law of the land takes its course in respect of those who might have committed those offences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000023#V00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1426005600,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I accept the Taoiseach's bona fides in endeavouring to deal with this issue.  He is correct in saying that, in the Paudie McGahon case, we are talking about a safe house.  I think Deputy Adams and those in Sinn F&eacute;in-IRA will have been very well aware of the circumstances of this for a long time, just as they were well aware of the Ma&iacute;ria Cahill case for a long time but chose to do nothing about it either, or about the entire system.<\/p>  <p>  It is all very well for Deputy Adams to say, \"We will be judged in terms of what we do now or into the future\".

He accused me of making some assertion about this earlier, and the Taoiseach too, but it was actually Deputy Adams on the public record in this House who said that the Provisional IRA took actions in regard to abusers which involved keeping the crimes away from the authorities, and that the IRA dealt with it itself internally.

They put forward the untruth that it was because of the RUC and all this kind of stuff.<\/p>  <p>  If we go through all of the sequences and the commentary that has been made, there is a complete thread of inconsistency between what is said one week compared with what is said the next week.

This is not an allegation.  I am not making an allegation at all in regard to this.  Deputy Adams himself has said that this is the way the Provisional IRA dealt with these issues, and that it was unfortunate and that it was a pity it happened that way.  He then tried to say it was because of the lack of policing at the time and all of that.  In these cases, however, both in the Ma&iacute;ria Cahill case and the Paudie McGahon case, we are talking about much more recent times.<\/p>  <p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that the reason a mechanism is required is that there is a lot of fear.  These people who come forward have been afraid for a long time.  They are afraid of the IRA and the IRA community.  There is a palpable fear in terms of what might happen to them.  We cannot dismiss that because it is just the reality, and we can hear it from the mouths of those who have been abused.  There is an absence of trust, particularly when they have been through the kangaroo courts in regard to these issues.  There is a fundamental fear and an absence of trust.  Not everyone will come forward and the majority will not come forward for those reasons.  They will say to themselves: \"Leave well alone.\"  It takes a particular type of courage and commitment to come forward, and it is the individuals themselves who make that decision.  I want to stress that point.  We know from other inquiries, however, that if mechanisms are created with confidential frameworks and so on, it is possible to get a better understanding of what happened.<\/p>  <p>  I am under no illusions, despite what has been said, that Deputy Adams himself will be very well aware of the mechanisms and the procedures by which the IRA dealt with all of these issues, because he said it himself.  He denies other things.  I do not know if the Ceann Comhairle would say I am making allegations if I say that I know he was a former chief of staff of the IRA.

I have no doubt about the allegations that were made.  We know the cost of ignoring information brought by children or young people generally in this jurisdiction, and of ignoring the seriousness of the allegations that many of them have made.  However, when there are criminal investigations going on into a number of these matters, both here and in Northern Ireland, it is complicated to have a process running parallel to that.  These are criminal investigations.  It is important that the courts are there to deal with the end of that particular investigative process and that people are brought before the courts to determine by judge and jury whether they are guilty of allegations made.  To have a process mixed up in the middle of that at the moment is not the way I think this should happen.<\/p>  <p>  I know the Deputy First Minister himself admitted in public he was a member of the IRA.  The names that are mentioned here are well known to them.  I do not know whether Deputy Adams has spoken to the person who is named as a public representative.  If there is information that needs to be given to the PSNI or the Garda, then it should be.  This is a very serious charge.  It is also a very serious matter to say that a person was hauled before people to be questioned and a range of punishment options set out for them to become judge and jury themselves.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Martin.  Imagine a young man being fearful of something like this.  Can we imagine the difficulty there was and the challenge it was for a young woman to make the allegations in public that she made?  Despite this, we find that she has been pressurised and contacted in the most vile ways as a consequence.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the Minister, Mr. Ford, have a very close working relationship in these matters, as have the PSNI and the Garda.  I do not think any of us wants to interfere with the ongoing criminal investigative process, and I am quite sure it is a serious analysis by the PSNI and the Garda.  I do not think I should put forward a view that, because this is proceeding, we should set up a process here.  That investigative process is designed to lead to a conclusion that either there is validity or there is not, and, if there is, there are the court proceedings to follow.  As I said during my reply to the Deputy First Minister, there need to be counselling services and support systems for victims of abuse in whatever community or wherever they come from.  That is something that is dealt with bilaterally by the Minister for Justice and Equality, with the Minister in Northern Ireland, through the North-South Ministerial Council.<\/p>  <p>  I can discuss this with Prime Minister Cameron, not on the individual cases but in terms of whether there is a mechanism through which we can deal with this, when criminal investigations cease, on the basis of support, encouragement, mentoring and protection.  The courts are independent in the way they do their business and this would have to cross the two jurisdictions, but that should not prove to be an impossibility.<\/p><p>I take what the Deputy said in the sense in which he said it.  It is something that now seethes inside people.  They find the courage, after all these years, to speak out.  We have to devise a mechanism to support that courage and protect people, while at the same time allowing criminal investigations to take place so that the courts can do their duty whenever that become necessary.  Deputy Adams might have something to add to that in the context of the public representative named or the matter to which Deputy Martin referred, namely, former members of the Provisional IRA.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000024#W01500","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426006200,"counter":236,"content":"<p>If these issues were not so serious and if so many people's lives had not been destroyed by what had occurred, the process of debate and discussion here would be a very educational one.  The Fianna F&aacute;il leader spoke about the IRA community, Sinn F&eacute;in-IRA, the IRA running Sinn F&eacute;in and so on and so forth.  It is clear that, whatever affinity he may have with victims and survivors, he is using this to try to make political points against the party of which I am very pleased to be a part.  He also misrepresented what I said in the Chamber.  I acknowledged the failure of republicans, including the IRA, to deal with these issues properly, and for that I apologise, as Uachtar&aacute;n Shinn F&eacute;in, because I think that is the right thing to do, especially as part of a process to face up to mistakes or failures and, in particular, to try to ensure that those mistakes and failures are not repeated.<\/p><p>The issue of abuse in our society is a significant one, to which we have not responded properly.  We do not have the time to discuss these matters now.  This is a very specific element of that, namely, those people who allegedly were abused by people who were purported to be IRA members.  In my remarks I said I was assured by the local representatives who were contacted that they advised the victim, verbally and in writing, to go to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Taoiseach went on to say, &quot;Perhaps Deputy Adams knows more about this,&quot; and so on.  <\/p><p>We should not deliberately confuse these issues.  If the perpetrator of abuse presents himself or herself, or if anybody has any information about that person, it is to be given to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the PSNI, and the abuser should be brought through the courts.  There are no ifs or buts about that.  A survivor or victim came forward and made an allegation, which is what prompted Martin McGuinness to write to the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach now says he is quite happy to talk to the Deputy First Minister about his proposal.  He wrote to the Taoiseach in November, and wrote three times in total.  He outlined in detail the types of idea that Deputy Martin spoke about earlier, namely, not getting involved in due process, criminal justice processes or what might be jurisdictional issues North and South.  Why could the North-South Ministerial Council not have met?  Why could the Taoiseach and those in the Executive not announce an all-Ireland process to encourage victims and survivors to come forward and to deal with support and mechanisms for all of them?  God knows how many people are out there who did not go to anyone, or who went to the RUC, loyalist groups and political parties and were not dealt with properly.  Without getting involved in jurisdictional or criminal justice issues, and in view of the fact that none of these issues are <i>sub judice<\/i>, we could announce that and tell people that confidential support and counselling mechanisms are in place.  That would have been, and still is, the thing to do.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach needs to appreciate something about victims.  Every time these cases are rehearsed, that traumatises other victims.  For people like Paudie McGahon or Ma&iacute;ria Cahill to come forward is very courageous, but other people have no support mechanisms, particularly those coming from what was described earlier as a period of conflict in the North which may or may not have overlapped here.<\/p><p>I again put it to the Taoiseach that the proposal put was above and beyond party politics, was victim and survivor-centred and could be put together easily without impinging on any other mechanisms.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have talked to some victims' and advocacy groups about this, and they continue to engage with us.  They think it is a good idea that should be opened up in the way the Deputy First Minister has suggested.  I strongly argue that this issue should have been prioritised.  It should not have had to wait until someone came forward and a television programme was made or a journalist wrote a story.<\/p><p>The problem is that the Taoiseach made no substantive response to what the Deputy First Minister wrote to him about.  I know good work is being done by both justice Ministers.  I know, because I talk to them, that the PSNI and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are co-operating on this and a range of other issues.  When the Deputy First Minister writes to the Taoiseach about such an important issue, he at least deserves the benefit, courtesy and good manners of a substantive response.  As I said in my earlier contribution to this discussion, if there is a better way of doing things, let us find that.  That is our responsibility.<\/p><p>Whatever the failings of Sinn F&eacute;in in this matter, I am sure there are sexual abusers in all political parties, sectors of society, sporting organisations, churches, families and so on, and we have a responsibility to try to sort it out.  When we reduce this particular issue to the type of soundbite-based invective being rehearsed here without any substantial evidence to support it, we let survivors and victims down.  <\/p><p>I want to commend the proposal that has been put to the Taoiseach on four occasions in the past number of months and ask for it to be considered.  I am repeating myself, but I listened very intently to what the Taoiseach said.  This issue must not get confused with policing, judicial and justice matters.  Rather, we need to send a very clear signal that, whatever about the sins of the past, the Executive at Stormont and the Government have put together mechanisms to help those who have been let down in the past, including, as I have acknowledged, those let down by republicans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000025#X00200","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1426006200,"counter":237,"content":"<p>The signal we need here is that everybody should-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000025#X00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1426006800,"counter":238,"content":"<p>Paudie McGahon is very clear in saying there were deliberate attempts to encourage him not to go near the Garda.

That text was subsequently translated into Gaeilge by the Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;n, which is the translation service in the Oireachtas, and included in the Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Marriage Equality) Bill 2015.  Some questions have been raised publicly regarding the Irish version of the text.  The Minister for Justice and Equality and the Attorney General examined that issue with the support of Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;n and legal and linguistic experts.  Their view is that the Irish version as produced is robust and encompasses a right to marry for both opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples.<\/p>  <p>  The Government, however, does not wish the Irish wording, as opposed to the key question in the referendum, to be the focus of any debate in the referendum campaign and in the interests of ensuring absolute clarity as to the intended effect of the amendment, it decided to amend the Irish wording and replace it with a more literal translation of the English wording.  An Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;n has worked on a new wording.

As a result, I must raise this by way of Topical Issue, and I am glad to do so.<\/p>  <p>  It is also disappointing that it proves difficult when one tries to get information on the sums spent on dealing with litter.  I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister last December to try to ascertain the individual sums spent on removing litter generally and chewing gum from the roads and footpaths in various counties and local authority areas, but that information is not available in the Department as it does not collect detailed information.  I did get an answer, however, from the Minister for 2003, when local authorities spent in excess of &euro;82 million on street-cleaning activities.  This shows there is quite an amount spent on removing litter and chewing gum.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware also that last year &euro;841,000 was given to local authorities in anti-litter awareness grants.  In fact, the figure for Galway City Council was &euro;33,000 and for Galway County Council, it was &euro;25,500.  Obviously, there is a big issue in dealing with the various types of litter on the streets and footpaths.  The most common types of litter are chewing gum, cigarette butts, fast-food wrappers, plastic bottles, plastic bags and cans.  The litter I am addressing in my few short minutes is chewing gum.  I saw figures for the Dublin city area where there is a real problem with chewing gum being thrown on the streets and footpaths.  In 2013, in the O'Connell Street to Grafton Street area monitored by the Department, &euro;83,000 was spent on removing chewing gum litter in 2013.<\/p>  <p>  I was hoping a levy would be imposed on manufacturers that would raise funds to remove the litter from public roads and footpaths.  Failing that, I understand that there was to be a meeting of all the major stakeholders - the manufacturers and the local authorities - to come to an arrangement where the manufacturers would contribute towards removing chewing gum.  There was agreement in the past that there would be advertising campaigns but we must do much more than that.  We must get funding from the manufacturers.  The other issue that arose in discussions was the question of a biodegradable product that would ensure we would not have the difficulty in removing such a product.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the Minister can give me some indication of the state of play.

With regard to chewing gum, the study recommended that either a levy on sales be put in place or that a negotiated agreement be entered into with the sector.<\/p><p>However, unlike the use of plastic bags, the Government has no desire to curtail the use of chewing gum.  What the Government wants to do is change the attitude and behaviour of those people who see it as acceptable to discard their gum on our streets.  Some of the chewing gum litter we see on our streets is absolutely disgusting.  I do not currently believe that a levy on chewing gum is the appropriate means by which to achieve our aim.  I would stress the word \"currently\" because this may change.  A levy would penalise both the industry and the consumer and would not provide an incentive to people to alter their behaviour with regard to disposing of gum.  It was therefore decided that a negotiated agreement with the industry was the most appropriate direction to take on this issue.  Such an agreement provides a mechanism for achieving a lasting change in behaviour with regard to the disposal of gum rather than a short-term clean up solution that does not address the underlying problem of the irresponsible disposal of gum.<\/p> <p> A negotiated agreement has been in place with the chewing gum industry since 2007.  The agreement facilitates a partnership approach through a range of agreed programmes that are practical, robust and targeted to address the root cause of the problem.  As part of this agreement, the chewing gum industry mounted a national media campaign involving outdoor advertising throughout the country, national radio and TV advertising, in-store and around store advertising, as well as a schools' educational campaign promoting greater awareness of the damaging effects of chewing gum litter on our environment and of the penalties associated with the irresponsible disposal of gum.<\/p> <p> Evidence indicates that the negotiated agreement approach is working.  Since 2008, my Department's national litter pollution monitoring system report demonstrates that the percentage of national litter represented by chewing gum has decreased from 30.79% in 2008 to 15.32% in 2013, a reduction of 50%.  The most recent programme, which ran from 2012 to 2014, has just concluded.  It was funded entirely by the industry and was valued at an estimated &euro;9.6 million.  I have received a further proposal from the industry to renew the negotiated agreement for the term 2015 to 2017, and this matter is under consideration.  I assure Deputy Kitt that while a renewed agreement is under consideration, it is not something that will simply go through on the nod.  It is something that I will consider deeply.

In 1899, the service dealt with approximately 520 calls but today it deals with approximately 80,000 incidents annually.  The Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service has an added advantage when attending emergency incidents.  Where necessary, a fire tender or other specialist vehicle may also be deployed to an incident.  Each fire tender has fully trained paramedics who are often the first on `the scene in the case of ECHO or DELTA calls and act as first responders.  In many instances, the fire crews initiate first interventions which aid in reducing time to defibrillation and resuscitation as well as reducing on-scene time and ensuring good patient handling and removal.  Fire crews are particularly good at patient handling. They take a full-team approach at road traffic collisions and are vital in the stabilisation, immobilisation and management of spinal injury patients and their removal to hospital.<\/p>  <p>  Dublin Fire Brigade has a duty under section 25 of the Fire Services Act to take charge of major or complex incidents.  Its ambulance crews can be deployed in high-risk situations involving chemical, fire or other serious incidents where it may not be possible to deploy other services such as the HSE ambulance service.  In the event of an emergency incident at Dublin Airport or at Dublin Port, for example, the local authority is responsible under the emergency framework for providing fire and rescue services.  The best resource available to provide this incident cover is the Dublin Fire Brigade integrated fire and ambulance service.  Its integrated control room has a pivotal role to play in providing the cover needed for such events.  An added bonus of the combined fire and emergency medical service is the extra equipment available to crews to ensure scene safety and to extract entrapped patients.<\/p>  <p>  If Dublin Fire Brigade becomes just a fire and non-medical emergency service, vital life-saving services will be lost.  If it loses its ability to dispatch integrated emergency medical services, lives will be put at risk.  Fire services in the United Kingdom are moving towards an integrated service, combining or co-locating fire and emergency medical services.<\/p>  <p>  Dublin Fire Brigade is contracted to supply 11 ambulances to the Dublin area and handles approximately 80,000 incidents per annum.  The National Ambulance Service is supposed to be the first responder in the Tallaght and Swords areas but it usually does not have an ambulance available for these areas.  The National Ambulance Service regularly does not have an ambulance on duty in certain areas because if crew members are unavailable for any reason, they are not replaced, as was highlighted on \"Prime Time\" recently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000032#EE00400","speaker":"1012"},{"type":"speech","time":1426010400,"counter":451,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to update the House on the proposed changes to Dublin ambulance services.  Historically, the Dublin emergency ambulance service has been provided by Dublin Fire Brigade, DFB. The National Ambulance Service, NAS, supports the DFB as required.  However, HIQA published a report last December which identified serious patient safety concerns with regard to the lack of co-ordination between the NAS and the DFB.  The urgent need to address these issues was stressed, particularly for 999 call-taking and ambulance dispatch, as well as overall clinical governance.<\/p>  <p>  Following discussions, the HSE and Dublin City Council have agreed in principle to address the identified weaknesses through the provision of a single point of contact for all emergency calls in Dublin.  Under the agreement reached, all 999 and 112 ambulance calls for the Dublin region will be routed through the national emergency operations centre in Tallaght, and all ambulances, regardless of whether they are DFB or NAS, will be dispatched from Tallaght.  In addition, clinical governance of Dublin ambulance services will become the responsibility of the NAS medical director.<\/p>  <p>  The new arrangements will mean that people in Dublin will get a better ambulance service that will be safer.  Currently, where the DFB does not have an ambulance available, it may or may not pass the call to the NAS.  Passing calls between call centres is not without risks.  Calls can be delayed or, worse, missed.  The people of Dublin can also look forward to a more responsive service, as all ambulances will be dispatched from Tallaght.  The dispatcher will be able to see every available ambulance in the region.  The nearest available ambulance, regardless of whether it is NAS or DFB, will be sent to the incident.  The clinical governance changes will mean that patients will receive exactly the same level of care no matter which ambulance arrives.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that concerns have been expressed in the media about a takeover by the NAS of Dublin ambulance services.  I can assure the House that claims of a takeover are wide of the mark.  The proposed changes will not impact on the delivery of services.  The DFB will continue to provide ambulance services in Dublin.  Only the structures around clinical governance of the service and call management will change.<\/p>  <p>  The DFB has provided very well for the emergency needs of Dublin since 1898, as the Deputy outlined.  However, no health service can afford to stand still.  A single contact and dispatch point for emergency ambulance calls is needed to address the safety issues raised by HIQA.  I am delighted, therefore, to note that agreement in principle has now been reached with the unions on the integration of emergency ambulance call taking and dispatch.  It has also been agreed that the DFB will continue to be fully involved in emergency ambulance service delivery and there will be no diminution in such services.  I understand that a joint forum within Dublin City Council, which will include management and union representatives, is to be established to address issues regarding the control centre reconfiguration.  That is a very welcome development and will ensure that the people of Dublin get the ambulance service they deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000033#FF00100","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1426010400,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply and take special note of the fact that the new arrangements mean that the people of Dublin will get a better ambulance service.  She made reference to delays, which are clearly a resource issue.  It is my understanding that the DFB was allocated one additional ambulance during a period of approximately 20 years.  I may stand corrected, but that is my understanding.  The population has increased and the numbers of calls has increased exponentially without a corresponding increase in required resources.  The broader problem is that while these arguments rage, lives can often be put at risk.  It is my understanding that both the DFB and the NAS are committed to their respective roles.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the recent announcement by the Dublin city manager that a forum will be created to discuss these issues.  Many welcomed the statement by the Minister for Health recently in which he committed to discussion on this matter.  It is important to take into account the views of stakeholders, the workforce, service users and, of course, the citizens of Dublin.  These views need to be gauged before any step is taken.<\/p>  <p>  The truth needs to be made clear.  We should not throw the baby out with the bathwater.  After all, 80% of DFB ambulance responses are within the HIQA standard of seven minutes and 59 seconds.  We should not overlook that.  It is likely that it is one of the best performers in the country.  The response time, supplemented by the ability to dispatch a fire attender fully staffed by paramedics, is not something we can lightly afford to lose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000033#FF00200","speaker":"1012"},{"type":"speech","time":1426010400,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I should have declared an interest when I first stood up.

In a major accident, it might be necessary to use equipment that paramedics in an ambulance service would not necessarily have.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of ambulance time response, be it the DFB or the NAS, I often wonder whether we are setting the bar too high, because there can be circumstances in which ambulances cannot possibly meet the timeframe set for them.

I am very disappointed to find myself here once again.  This is an issue I have raised on numerous occasions in the D&aacute;il Chamber and at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  It shows how important the issue is for the people of Waterford.  Two years ago, I received a letter from the former Minister, Deputy Reilly, offering certain assurances to the people of Waterford and the south east regarding the health services in Waterford.  This letter came after a winter of discontent in Waterford in which we saw thousands of people take to the streets, having come from all around the south east, to show that they were concerned about a possible downgrading of Waterford Regional Hospital, as it was known then.  Their fear was centred, as it is centred now, around the Higgins report, which examined the reorganisation of hospital groupings.  After a lot of fear, we were promised that this would make things better.  I attended a lot of meetings, and at each of these Professor Higgins promised us time and again that what we had would be protected and services would be enhanced.  We were told this would be a good thing for people in Waterford and the south east.  The letter from the former Minister, Deputy Reilly, said that the establishment of hospital groups would enhance cardiology cover in Waterford.  It went on to say: \"[T]he increased flexibility of staff across the group will enable us to achieve our goal of providing cardiology cover at Waterford Regional Hospital 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\"<\/p><p>Two years on, we are no closer to that.  Deputy John Halligan, who also represents Waterford, raised the very serious case two weeks ago of a man from Waterford who sadly and tragically died because the service was not available.  A second cath laboratory to provide 24-7 cardiology services is needed.  We were told at the time that we would get it.  I now understand that a business plan is being put together and that this would cost &euro;1.5 million, which is only a small amount in the context of the delivery of health services.  This small amount of money would copperfasten services at University Hospital Waterford, UHW.  We need an around the clock service.  This requires provision of a second cath laboratory and the staff required to keep two laboratories open.  <br\/><br\/>There are also shortcomings at the hospital in terms of dermatology services.  It is worth noting that the south east has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the country.  Currently, there is no consultant dermatologist at University Hospital Waterford.  One consultant is due to return from leave at the end of the month and interviews are taking place to fill other posts.  This means that the people of Waterford now have to travel from the city to the South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital in Cork to see a consultant.  I will give an example in this regard.  I was contacted by a distressed family whose mother is 79 years of age and is in a great deal of pain because of a very serious skin condition.  She constantly breaks out in blisters which burst which, as one can imagine, is very painful.  This lady, who is almost 80 years of age, is forced to travel to Cork to see a consultant for a five or ten minute consultation.  This involves a four hour round trip journey for a fragile woman.  It also places extra pressure on her family, who, because there is no transport available, have to take days off work to bring her to Cork, and all for a service that should be available in Waterford.  Dermatology services at University Hospital Waterford have been reduced to one afternoon clinic on a Wednesday.  This is not the vibrant future that was promised to the people of Waterford.  The case I highlighted is only one of the less serious cases.<br\/><br\/>I invite the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, to read last week's <i>Waterford News &amp;amp; Star<\/i>which outlines a truly awful case of a man who almost died because of a lack of dermatology services in University Hospital Waterford.  A father of two whose skin was red and bubbling arrived in accident and emergency, where he spent 18 hours on a trolley and was misdiagnosed twice.  As the doctors had never before seen the condition, a conscientious nurse faxed photographs of the man's skin to the Cork hospital.  The consultants there took one look at them and advised that the man be sent to Cork immediately.  The irony is that although there was a consultant dermatologist conducting his Wednesday clinic in UHW, the man did not get to see him.  There were no ambulances available to take this extremely sick man to Cork as, he was told, access to the ambulance service required two days notice.  This man, whose life was in danger, was then put in a taxi and sent to the Cork hospital.  When he got there, he was told by the hospital staff that had he spent any more in Waterford hospital he would no longer be with us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000033#FF00500","speaker":"1093","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426011000,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I will first address the Deputy's last concern regarding dermatology services.  There are three approved permanent consultant dermatologist posts at UHW.  As rightly pointed out by the Deputy, one consultant is currently on maternity leave but is due to return to work on 25 March.  Interviews to fill the other two posts were held on 25 February and two successful candidates are currently being processed by the national recruitment service.  University Hospital Waterford is optimistic that contracts for these posts can be agreed in the coming months.  I will do as much as I can to ensure this is done as speedily as possible.  I do not propose to repeat what the Deputy said in regard to the special arrangement with the South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital, Cork, for urgent dermatological referrals.  The two new posts at UHW, when filled, will have a significant impact on services.  I will do my best to ensure the process, including vetting and so on, is completed as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for raising the issue which I assumed to be in relation to cardiology services in Waterford.  The report on the establishment of hospital groups as a transition to independent hospital trusts noted that the cardiology service at University Hospital Waterford, UHW, should be extended.  The hospital's regional cardiology interventional suite opened in 2008.  In 2012, the suite was identified as the designated primary PCI centre for the region, under the national clinical programme for acute coronary syndrome.  Its services cover Waterford, Kilkenny, south Tipperary and Wexford.  The centre currently has one catheterisation laboratory, which operates five days a week and incorporates a dedicated six-bed cardiac day ward.  Staffing includes three consultant interventional cardiologists based at Waterford and two visiting consultant cardiologists from Wexford and south Tipperary, who work there one day a week.  I understand that a business case, prepared by UHW, for the development of a second catheterisation laboratory and a 24-hour PCI service, is under consideration within the south-south west hospital group.  The development of a second catheterisation laboratory is, I believe, considered a priority within the group. <\/p>  <p>  In regard to the suggested extension of the PCI service to a 24-hour service, for any complex acute hospital service, a key criterion for deciding whether a 24-hour service should be provided is whether there is a sufficient volume of appropriate activity to ensure safe provision of the service to patients.  Without sufficient throughput of patients, staff engaged in the service will not be able to maintain their skill levels.  This could put patients at risk.  lt is my understanding that under the acute coronary syndrome programme to be viable, a 24-7 PCI service must serve a population of 500,000 to 1,000,000 people, which requires at least six interventional cardiologists to staff the necessary roster.  It is worth noting that the acute coronary syndrome programme is of the view that the current population base covered by UHW does not provide for a viable 24-7 service.  I am aware that the consultants currently providing the existing service have indicated their willingness to work extra hours to facilitate the extension of the current nine-to-five service, and I welcome their commitment.  However, this would also require the provision of additional specialist support services provided by radiographers, nurses and cardiac technicians, with considerable additional revenue costs.  I take on board what the Deputy had to say in relation to the extra cost.  A review of PCI services in Dublin is due to be completed shortly.  On completion of that process, PCI capacity and requirements in areas outside Dublin, including Waterford, will be examined.  Any decision on further provision of PCI services in any region will be based on the best interest of patients, evidence on the volume of clinical need, the quality and safety of the service that can be provided, the ability to staff it safely and the resources available.<\/p>  <p>  I know that my response in relation to additional cost is cold comfort to the Deputy.  I will find out exactly what is the additional cost.  It is hoped that following the review of the PCI services we will be able to progress the case highlighted on numerous occasions by the Deputy.  It is not that we are ignoring it.  Patient safety is paramount.  When the Deputy highlights cases of people having died for lack of a service that must also be taken into consideration. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000034#GG00200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1426011000,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.  I take no pleasure in raising this issue time and again.  I represent the people of Waterford, who feel like they are getting a shoddy deal.  We were told at the time of the Higgins' report that one of the main requirements to secure services into the future was an increased population base.  In regard to the case I highlighted of the elderly woman having to attend the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital in Cork for a dermatology service, I was told on numerous occasions by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and current Minister, Deputy Varadkar, that the consultants would travel to Waterford, because that makes more sense than frail sick people having to make a four-hour journey in great discomfort to avail of a service they are entitled to receive on their own doorstep.  We were told that with the birth of these new hospital groups we would be able to attract the calibre of consultant that requires a big population base to ensure his or her skill set is maintained.<\/p><p>We were assured that through the provision of services in Cork, Waterford and in the other hospitals that they would have the necessary throughput of patients to maintain their skill set to a high standard in order that they could give the best service to the people of the south east.  We were promised professorships and academic posts.  Could the Minister of State please indicate the current position in that regard?  I would welcome an update on the partnership between University Hospital Waterford and University College Cork, UCC.  To be honest, the current situation is just not good enough.  The hospital is called \"University Hospital Waterford\", which sounds good but it means nothing.  We do not have what we were promised.  I understand we are in a time of limited resources but as the economy starts to improve, the Labour Party must focus on the provision of public services.  I will fight tooth and nail to ensure the people of Waterford and the south east get what they deserve.  As a party in government we must make real decisions about where we want to provide investment.  I, for one, will support investment in public services.  Currently, nurses, doctors and care assistants are currently working to the pin of their collar to ensure service provision in University Hospital Waterford, but they need the Minister's support and that of his Cabinet colleagues to ensure we get the services that are so badly required in Waterford and the south east.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000034#GG00300","speaker":"1093","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426011600,"counter":460,"content":"<p>The two new consultants will have an impact in terms of dealing with the needs of the elderly lady and the man with the rare complaint.

Deputy Conway is correct in that when the hospital groups were being considered the reason Wexford, Kilkenny and all of the other areas were brought together was to provide the required population base, because it is important that consultants in particular specialties have the required throughput on an ongoing and continuous basis, as that is what makes them expert in their field.  The people delivering the service in Waterford at the moment are doing an incredible job.  The unfortunate difficulty is that they are not there for long enough and they are not there at weekends.

That is a total of nine people.  The general manager outlined in the reply that the waiting lists for spinal surgery is one the priorities of the Saolta University Health Care Group.  He further outlined that a number of arrangements are being put in place to facilitate the level of complexity involved in relation to spinal surgery for patients with scoliosis and that the group is currently reviewing a number of resources in the context of bed availability, access to diagnostics, purchase of specialist spinal equipment and access to theatre.  He stated that when the key elements required are in place, potential surgery dates for the cohort of patients can be identified and scheduled accordingly.<\/p>  <p>  The patients who contacted me have not received any date whatsoever and they are still waiting.  I will not name them although they said it would not be a problem if I wanted to name them.  They live in Mayo and Roscommon.  A surgeon dealing with one of the cases raised a serious situation in September.  He said that the patient in question was one of approximately 40 under his direct care who require major, complex spinal surgery at the Galway University Hospitals.  He said she had been placed on a waiting list for the surgery to take place and that the rods were taken out of her back in September due to infection and she is now waiting to have the rods replaced.  Surgery is required when the curvature level reaches 50% and the curvature of the patient in question is 70%.  The surgeon indicated that in the current context of the allocation to him, he does not envisage the operation taking place for the foreseeable future.  He said it was the case up to approximately two to three years ago that he could perform that type of surgery at Merlin Park University Hospital and had been doing that regularly since 1996.  However, as a result of the withdrawal of support services for this type of surgery, the only place capable of providing it on the western seaboard was in University Hospital Galway.  With the management team he set about trying to structure a pathway that would allow that to happen, but it has not happened in a seamless, safe way to date.  As a result, he could not advise the patient of a definite time or date for the operation to take place.  It seems that operations were to go ahead in University Hospital Galway but the team has not been put in place to carry them out.  It is not good enough for patients to wait so long for urgent surgery, in particular when one patient has a curvature of more than 70%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000035#HH00400","speaker":"1193"},{"type":"speech","time":1426011600,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Collins for raising this matter.  All Members are dealing with at least one or two cases of people with scoliosis who are encountering difficulties.  Waiting times for scoliosis surgery are unacceptably long.  There has been an increase in the number of outpatient spinal review referrals, and a consequent increase in surgical demands.  Hence, waiting times both for outpatients and for those awaiting surgery are indeed challenging.  The Government is determined that this problem will be addressed.  The HSE is examining all options to reduce scoliosis and other waiting lists as soon as possible.  It must be pointed out that Galway University Hospitals do not carry out paediatric scoliosis surgery.  That type of surgery may only be carried out at Crumlin, Temple Street, Tallaght and Cappagh hospitals and is predominantly managed at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.  Approximately 5% of cases, predominantly those with neuromuscular disorders, will require post-operative access to a high dependency unit or paediatric intensive care unit.  Surgery is provided through two full-day theatre sessions per week and ten specialist orthopaedic beds at Crumlin.  Currently, there are two orthopaedic consultants jointly appointed between Crumlin and Tallaght hospitals to provide paediatric spinal surgery in Crumlin and paediatric, adolescent and adult spinal services at Tallaght hospital.<\/p>  <p>  Saolta University Health Care Group has assured the Department of Health that the waiting list for spinal surgery is one of its main priorities.  To facilitate the level of complexity involved in relation to spinal surgery for patients with scoliosis, access to inpatient beds, diagnostics, purchase of specialist spinal equipment and access to theatre for significant periods of time must be considered.  When the key elements required are in place, potential surgery dates for this cohort of patients can be identified and scheduled accordingly.  Funding has been allocated in the 2015 HSE service plan for the appointment of a consultant orthopaedic surgeon with a special interest in spinal surgery at Galway University Hospitals.  Funding has also been allocated for the appointment of an orthopaedic surgeon, anaesthetist and support staff at Crumlin.  This will maximise the use of available theatre sessions in the hospital.  These allocations are part of a total of approximately &euro;5 million available for the overall development of orthopaedic service infrastructure nationally in 2015.  This funding will also allow for the development of a 24-7 spinal theatre and allocation of consultant anaesthetist and additional 5.5 nurse posts at the Mater hospital, the appointment of an orthopaedic surgeon to provide for up to 100 cases of degenerative spinal surgery a year to be undertaken in Tallaght hospital, the appointment of a consultant orthopaedic surgeon with a special interest in paediatrics in Cork, the opening of current closed and under-utilised capacity at Cappagh hospital, and the appointment of an additional orthopaedic consultant as part of improved services for paediatric spina bifida.<\/p><p>The Department will continue to work with the Health Service Executive to ensure service needs and waiting times in this area are addressed, having regard to the overall level of resources available to the HSE. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000035#HH00500","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426012200,"counter":465,"content":"<p>Last year, when I tabled parliamentary questions on Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, I was informed there was a service level arrangement in place, money would be provided and work was being done with the children's hospital group, etc.  Nine people have been waiting for surgery in Galway University Hospital for between three months and more than one year.

The Bill sets out the wording of the thirty-fourth amendment that will be put to the people in a referendum on 22 May 2015.  The referendum will be on the question of marriage equality.  The people will have the opportunity in the referendum to consider whether the Constitution should be amended so as to allow couples to marry without distinction as to their sex.  The referendum is exclusively about civil marriage and the consequences that flow from civil marriage for the two persons choosing to get married to one another.<\/p>  <p>  The Government agreed on 5 November 2013 that a referendum should be held in the first half of 2015 on the question of enabling same-sex couples to marry.  The Government's decision was in response to the report of the Convention on the Constitution.  The convention's third report, Amending the Constitution to Provide for Same-sex Marriage, issued in June 2013, recommended that a change be made to the Constitution to provide for same-sex marriage.  As Deputies will be aware, the convention sought submissions from interested parties and received 1,077 submissions from interest groups, church organisations and private individuals.  It held a plenary debate on this question on 13 and 14 April 2013.  The outcome of its deliberations was that a strong majority of its members recommended that provision be made for same-sex marriage. <\/p>  <p>  The Government noted the third report of the Convention on the Constitution when taking its decision to hold a referendum on this issue.  It also noted the high level of engagement of the members in the process and the strong interest of civil society in this issue, as reflected in the large number of submissions, and the high level of support within the convention for the recommendation to change the Constitution to enable same-sex couples to marry.<\/p>  <p>  The Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Marriage Equality) Bill 2015 was published on 21 January 2015, following Government agreement on the proposed wording that day.  The Government has since agreed, on 3 March 2015, the general scheme of the marriage Bill 2015, which sets out the legislative changes that will be undertaken if the referendum is passed by the people.<\/p>  <p>  The Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Marriage Equality) Bill 2015 provides that, if the referendum is passed, a new section would be inserted after section 3 of Article 41 of the Constitution.  If approved by the people, this section, which would be Article 41.4, would contain the following wording: \"Marriage may be contracted in accordance with law by two persons without distinction as to their sex.\"  No other amendments would arise in respect of Article 41.  The wording is intended to give a right to marry to couples without distinction as to their sex.  If the wording is approved by the people, there would be a corresponding obligation and requirement on the State to respect and vindicate that right in its legislation.  Therefore, it would not be open to the State to maintain in being legislation which prohibits the marriage of same-sex couples.<\/p>  <p>  I propose to outline the rationale behind the wording proposed for the thirty-fourth amendment.  The first element, \"Marriage may be contracted\", draws on the precedent of Article 41, which recognises marriage as an institution.  The proposed wording seeks to convey that marriage is an institution which two persons may enter.  The decision to use the term \"contracted\" was taken for the following reasons.  It is the term already used in Article 41.3 in respect of marriage.  Furthermore, the term confirms that what is at issue is civil marriage, which is a contract between two persons in the eyes of the State.<\/p>  <p>  The phrase \"in accordance with law\" has been included in the proposed wording to confirm that marriage would continue, as at present, to be regulated by statute and common law.  The manner in which marriage ceremonies are registered, for instance, would be regulated by statute. <\/p>  <p>  The phrase \"without distinction as to their sex\" reflects language already used in Article 16 of the Constitution.  Articles 16.1 and 16.2 use the phrase \"without distinction of sex\" with regard to the eligibility of citizens for membership of the D&aacute;il and the right of every citizen to vote for members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The wording proposed for the thirty-fourth amendment builds on the language of that precedent to provide for a couple, regardless of their sex, to be eligible to marry.<\/p>  <p>  There has been some commentary on the decision to use the term \"sex\" in the wording of the proposed amendment.  The reason it has been used is that it is the term already used in the Constitution.  Furthermore, the barriers which prevent persons from marrying under Irish law are impediments relating to a person's sex rather than a person's gender.<\/p>  <p>  If the referendum is passed by the people, the right to marriage equality will be enshrined in the Constitution and Ireland will advance along the path to marriage equality which has already been taken by many countries.  An increasing number of countries are giving same-sex couples the right to marry.  The Netherlands was the first country to pass a law in 2001 enabling same-sex couples to marry.<\/p><p>Since then, Belgium, Spain, Canada, South Africa, Norway, Sweden, Portugal, Iceland, Argentina, Denmark, France, Brazil, Uruguay, New Zealand, Luxembourg, Finland, England, Wales and Scotland have all given same-sex couples the right to marry.  It is possible for same-sex couples to marry in 37 US states.  The US Supreme Court is currently considering whether that right should be extended throughout all US states.  Only last week, the Slovenian Parliament approved a law in favour of marriage equality.  More and more countries of the world are recognising that couples should have the right to marry one another regardless of their sexual orientation.<br\/><br\/>At issue is the question of who should have the right to marry.  The referendum would not, if passed, redefine marriage.  Marriage would not change if same-sex couples were given the right to marry.  Couples would continue to marry in exactly the same way and according to the same conditions as at present.  The manner in which marriages are registered would continue to be regulated by law.  The effects of marriage on property, taxation and succession would be unchanged.  The people will have to decide on a simple question: whether marriage is open to all couples who wish to enter it.<br\/><br\/>Marriage is an institution that we hold dear in Ireland.  It is enshrined in our Constitution as an institution that the State is pledged to guard with special care.  According to census 2011, there were 1,708,604 persons married in Ireland, representing an increase of 143,588 since 2006.  EUROSTAT statistics for 2012 confirm that Ireland has the lowest divorce rate in the EU at 0.6 per 1,000 of the population.  If marriage is so important to us and if it is the means by which we make a profound commitment to the people that we love, why should it be for some and not others?  What right do we have to say to some couples that they cannot participate in an institution that is the bedrock for so many people?  What right do we have to say to taxpayers, neighbours and citizens that they can live among us but cannot share in all that many hold dear?  I believe if we value marriage as significantly as we do, then we should be ready to share it with all who wish to avail of it.  In fact, it is a tribute to the importance of marriage as the expression of a couple's commitment to one another that same-sex couples wish to be able to marry too.  Enabling same-sex couples to marry reflects the solidity of the institution of marriage.<br\/><br\/>One myth often put forward in the debate on marriage equality is that the concept of marriage is eternal and unchanging.  However, history shows us that the legal consequences of marriage have changed repeatedly over the centuries.  For example, let us reflect on what marriage meant for women until the 19th century.  Marriage in the past was often a relationship of inequality.  We expect nowadays that our marriages are founded on equality.  However, modern-day marriage is itself the product of a long journey to equality.  The journey to equality follows a familiar path.  Some are often outraged that others should seek equality.  Some fight firmly to defend the <i>status quo<\/i>.  It is striking that when equality is granted, it becomes inconceivable in the society that it was ever resisted.  Some 43 years ago the marriage bar was still in place, preventing married women in many areas of the public sector from remaining in employment.  It was as late as 1973 when the marriage bar was lifted.<br\/><br\/>I wish to make one thing clear: it is my belief that enabling same-sex couples to get married would not affect the marriages of heterosexual couples.  They would continue to get married in the same way as currently.  Furthermore, the referendum would not change in any way the rights of religious denominations to decide who should get married in their denominations.  There are constitutional guarantees that protect the rights of religious denominations.  Article 44 of the Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of religion.  Article 44.5 enshrines the right of every religious denomination to manage its own affairs.<br\/><br\/>The Government has approved the general scheme of the marriage Bill 2015.  The general scheme outlines the legislative changes that are planned by the Government to give effect to the right to marriage equality anticipated in the constitutional amendment.  I emphasise that the general scheme is conditional on the decision of the electorate on the referendum.  Yesterday, I circulated Members of both Houses with the draft scheme of a marriage Bill which would be introduced by the Government if the referendum is passed by the people.<br\/><br\/>The Irish wording of the amendment has been subject to some comment.  The Oireachtas translation service is confident that these concerns are unfounded and that the wording, as originally published, clearly allows opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples to marry.  However, the Government considers it important that the electorate should have absolute confidence in the wording proposed for the amendment in English and Irish.  As a result, the Government has decided to propose a more literal translation of the English wording.  I will bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage in this regard.  The amendment will propose the following wording for the amendment in Irish: F&eacute;adfaidh beirt, gan beann ar a ngn&eacute;as, conradh p&oacute;sta a dh&eacute;anamh de r&eacute;ir dl&iacute;.  This wording can be essentially translated into English as: Two persons, regardless of their sex, can contract a marriage in accordance with law.<br\/><br\/>Today is a historic day.  Today, the Oireachtas begins the process of debating the legislation that will prepare for the referendum.  The people are getting the opportunity to determine a simple question: do we give a right to marriage equality to all couples who wish to marry in our society?  Do we say that one couple's love is as valid as another's?  Do we say that couples wishing to make a lifelong commitment to one another should have the right to constitutional protection?  I am honoured to introduce this referendum Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000036#JJ01400","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426012800,"counter":479,"content":"<p>Ireland has travelled a long road to reach the point today where legislation can be introduced to allow for a referendum on same-sex marriage.  The proposed legislation represents another step forward for equality in Ireland as a country which is proud to call itself a republic.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il supports this Bill to allow for the marriage equality referendum to take place on 22 May 2015.  The referendum simply proposes to add to the Constitution the declaration: Marriage may be contracted in accordance with law by two persons without distinction as to their sex.<\/p>  <p>  Following a meeting with the Minister for Justice and Equality this afternoon, I understand that the Irish language version of this text must now be changed due to an uncertainty surrounding the wording of the first official language version.  While I welcome the clarity that this will bring, the fact that the Minister was willing to acknowledge the possible uncertainty and to act on that, I believe it is an unfortunate incident.  If it were not for the eminent journalist Bruce Arnold, his writings and his raising this matter with my office and that of my party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, this issue might not have been addressed.  None the less, my party will fully support the amendments on Committee Stage to correct and clarify the first official language version of the text.<\/p>  <p>  For my party the upcoming referendum is a question of equality and the question of whether, as a society, we believe that those in gay relationships should be afforded the same security and respect as those in heterosexual relationships.  Our answer to that question is, \"Yes\" and that all our citizens must be equal before the law.  At my party's Ard-Fheis held in March 2012 our members debated and then voted to pass a resolution supporting equal marriage rights.  The party position is that we support that most basic republican proposition: the entitlement to equality on the part of every citizen.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that Fianna F&aacute;il has played a leading role in legislating for key issues in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community guided by the fundamental principle of equality among citizens.  From the decriminalisation of homosexual acts in 1993 to the Civil Partnership Act of 2010, Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments led the legislative change.  This legislation is a natural outcome of the years of progress which have been made thus far.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the Government and the Minister on finally bringing this matter to the House.  I hope the unity of purpose we see in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann today will be reflected in the campaign to bring about a \"Yes\" vote on 22 May next.<\/p><p> Although this legislation is welcomed by the vast majority of the elected Members of this House, it is important not to take the people's choice in this referendum for granted.  There are serious challenges out there, as there always are in referendums, in convincing 50% plus one to back this proposal.  The polls tell us this referendum is safe but we must not take victory in the campaign for granted.<\/p> <p> One of the first matters which must be clarified is what this referendum is not about.  This referendum is about allowing a couple of the same sex declare their love and commitment to spending the rest of their time together in a civil marriage.  This referendum is not about adoption, it is not about surrogacy and it is not about other family relationships in law.  These issues are being dealt with by the Children and Family Relationships Bill 2015 which is currently passing through the Oireachtas.  The referendum will simply ask whether two adults, regardless of their gender, should be able have a civil marriage.<\/p> <p> It is vital that these facts are communicated to the citizens of this country in an effective and simple manner.  In that regard, I hope the Referendum Commission established for this referendum is given the necessary resources and communicative skills to properly engage with the public.  The \"No\" side in this referendum campaign will thrive on misinformation and scaremongering.  It is important to point out that we must respect alternative views in this referendum but we must also seek to outline the facts as they are.  We must be clear that civil marriage is a legally binding contract which is regulated and recognised by the State.  The proposed amendment deals with civil marriage rather than marriage through a religious ceremony.  Civil marriage is protected by but not defined in the Constitution.  This proposed constitutional change will not force religions of any kind to carry out marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples.  This is a vital distinction which must be made during the campaign.<\/p> <p> Another significant challenge in this referendum campaign will be voter turnout.  In this regard, the Friday voting is welcome as it will give students an opportunity to travel home to vote.  However, there is important work to be done to ensure that people are aware of the date of the referendum well in advance, that a \"register to vote\" campaign is carried out as part of the referendum campaign and that polling booths are open for a significant period of time on the day in question.<\/p> <p> Looking at the specific constitutional amendment, I welcome the simple approach taken by the Minister which will involve the insertion of an extra section into Article 41 of the Constitution.  The section to be, Article 41.4, coming at the end of the provisions on marriage of that article, makes sense.  The fact that no change is proposed to the existing constitutional provisions on marriage is also welcome and reaffirms the importance this State puts on the family unit overall.  In fact, if anything, this referendum shows the strength of the institution of marriage into the 21st century.  It is a welcome development that people are seeking to broaden the ability of our people to enter marriage.  As the Minister has outlined, if the wording and the amended Irish version of the amendment are approved by the people, the establishment of the right of two persons to marry without distinction as to their sex implies a corresponding obligation and requirement on the State to respect and vindicate that right in its legislation.  Therefore, it would not be open to the State to maintain in being legislation which prohibits the marriage of same-sex couples.<\/p> <p> Looking at developments across the world, as of 1 January 2015, some 17 countries - Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Uruguay and the United Kingdom, except for Northern Ireland - and certain sub-national jurisdictions around the world, such as parts of Mexico and most states of the United States, allow same-sex couples to marry.  Ireland's referendum vote is significant as it is the first time any country has held a referendum to permit marriage equality.  There is significant variation across the EU on marriage equality legislation.  Ten EU countries permit marriage equality: Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom, with the exception of Northern Ireland.  Spain became the first predominantly Roman Catholic country to allow same-sex marriage in 2005 when it amended its civil code despite significant opposition from various sectors of society.  Seven EU countries - Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Ireland and Slovenia - have legislated for civil partnerships, while 11 countries - Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania and Slovakia - forbid same-sex unions.<\/p> <p> In general, the past several years have seen great progress in the development of anti-discriminatory laws for LGBT citizens across Europe.  There is a notable East-West divide on the subject of same-sex marriage.  Generally speaking, same-sex marriage is more widely accepted in western Europe than in central and eastern Europe and the candidate countries.  Recent developments reflect this.  Some western European member states have made proposals towards, or brought into existence, legislation legalising same-sex marriage, while some central European countries have actually made moves in the opposite direction.  Ireland can be proud of our record thus far in seeking legislative change and particularly in bringing this matter before the people.  Although we are not outliers in the provision of same-sex marriage, we are confirming our country's status as a tolerant, open and inclusive place where difference does not mean division.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, I want to reiterate my party's full support for this legislation, which will be amended on Committee Stage, and for the subsequent referendum.  We will be campaigning strongly for the passing of this referendum by the people of Ireland.  The work must begin now to win this campaign.  We cannot take anything for granted and we must campaign hard to win.  I hope all of my colleagues here will join with me in committing to running a positive, energetic and informative campaign.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000037#KK00200","speaker":"1057","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426013400,"counter":481,"content":"<p>I am delighted to see this Bill before us today.  It has been a long road and it is much overdue, but it is great to finally have it here before us.  The starting point for Sinn F&eacute;in on all issues of human and civil rights and equality is the Proclamation of 1916.  It may be almost 100 years old but it is the mission statement for every generation of Irish citizens.  As an Irish republican party, equality is at the core of all that Sinn F&eacute;in represents.  All citizens must enjoy full equality of rights and opportunities under law, regardless of their background, including sexual orientation or gender.  Nothing less can be tolerated in a modern, progressive and inclusive society.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in recognises that societal attitudes, the ban on the donation of blood, gender recognition, adoption, transphobic and homophobic bullying, the reporting of domestic and sexual violence, as well as marriage and employment equality, are a few of the areas of life where LGBT people suffer inequality and isolation.  LGBT people suffer higher rates of depression, self-harm and suicide, directly attributable to social conditioning, the stigma and isolation of the historical and, unfortunately, State-led criminalisation, discrimination and harassment.  Of course, that is not unique to Ireland and has, sadly, been the history of states throughout the world.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that, some day, Ireland will stand as a beacon of LGBT equality and that we will cherish, protect and celebrate the diversity of all of our citizens.  The Bill before us today takes us a step closer to that vision.  I am heartened to see Ireland edge closer to ensuring all of its citizens are equal.  In 2015, it is simply unacceptable that the law does not treat each person equally.  However, I am hopeful that we are on our way there.<\/p>  <p>  As a proud republican, I strive for equality every day.<\/p><p>Republicanism is not unique to Sinn F&eacute;in.  It exists across our people and in every political party.  We believe in a real republic where all citizens are equal, regardless of the colour of their skin, religious belief, sexual orientation, where they live and what they do.  To only offer same-sex couples civil partnership is to only offer them a second-class right.  This is absolutely and entirely unacceptable in Ireland in 2015.  <\/p> <p> The time has come for full marriage equality for all.  Put very simply, this is a human rights and equality issue.  Loving, committed relationships between two consenting adults should be treated equally, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.  All couples, same-sex or otherwise, should be allowed to share the same responsibilities, obligations and respect that marriage provides.  This should be enshrined in the Constitution.  Same-sex couples and their children are families just like any other, but these families currently do not have the same legal rights and protection that are available to other families in the State.  This is wrong.<\/p> <p> We now have the chance to ensure that same-sex couples are no longer treated as second class citizens in our State.  It is an exciting opportunity for us to have a chance to change all of this.  What better way to celebrate 1916 than by enshrining rights of equality within the Constitution, which is our primary law and the people's law?  Approaching the centenary of the 1916 Rising, Sinn F&eacute;in aims not only to commemorate the revolution but to achieve one of its most noble aspirations, that of cherishing all the children of the nation equally.<\/p> <p> We are serious about this.  Sinn F&eacute;in has always campaigned on issues that can bring about positive change for all the people living on this island, and for that precise reason we will be actively campaigning for a \"Yes\" vote in the upcoming referendum.  This May the Irish people have an exciting opportunity to say that we value all of our relationships equally.  My party is proud to support this referendum and we ask the Irish people to vote \"Yes\" to civil marriage equality.  A \"Yes\" vote would send a powerful message to couples who have waited their entire lives to legally mark their love for one another.  We also need to make it clear to all young people who are having difficulty coming to terms with their sexuality and struggling to deal with it that we support them and that their choices are as legitimate as the ones that every single person around them, straight or gay, is making.  This referendum was called by the citizens at a Constitutional Convention.  This is the people's referendum.<\/p> <p> Civil marriage equality is about protecting our families, neighbours and friends.  It is about two people making a commitment to share in the ups and the downs of life.  Lesbian and gay people are not alone in their demand for full equality of rights and opportunities, regardless of sexual orientation, gender, ethnicity or background.  My party wants everyone on this island to have the same opportunity no matter who we are, what we look like, where we are from or whom we love.  <\/p> <p> On 22 May we, the Irish people, should take pride in entering the ballot box to extend equality to our neighbours, friends, colleagues or family members.  Irish people are being given a chance to create an Ireland where our citizens are valued equally.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for first-time voters and the established electorate to end the discrimination that many lesbian and gay people living in Ireland continue to experience.<\/p> <p> Marriage is important to Irish society.  It is a secure foundation for committed and loving couples.  Everyone should be free to marry on those terms.  A \"Yes\" in this referendum is a yes to lesbian and gay people being full participants in Irish society and fully equal in the eyes of their fellow citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000038#LL00200","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426014000,"counter":483,"content":"<p>Deputies John Halligan, Catherine Murphy and Finian McGrath wish to share time.

Homosexuality is still a crime in almost 80 countries.  In five of these, and in parts of two others, homosexuality is still punishable by the death penalty.  A further 70 imprison citizens because of their sexual orientation.  Recent years have seen some countries, such as India, strengthening existing penalties.  Even where homosexuality is legal, many countries treat those in same-sex relationships differently, such as having an unequal age of consent or a ban on marriage altogether.  Russia's ban on the promotion of non-traditional sexuality is one example of many.<\/p>  <p>  As many speakers have said, Ireland has come a long way since it decriminalised same-sex relationships in 1993, which encouraged new generations of lesbian and gay people to live their lives more openly.  I would like to pay tribute and give credit to the work of Senator David Norris, who brought respect into this meaningful debate and has been a strong campaigner throughout Europe and the world for the rights of gay people.   <\/p>  <p>  The Bill is a further step on the road towards a more liberal and equal Irish society.  By bringing it forward, the Government is sending out a clear message to the world that we want to eliminate discrimination against thousands of our citizens.<\/p>  <p>  I am disappointed, but not at all surprised, at the attempts to link marriage equality with having children.  Gay parents already exist in this country and neither this Bill nor the ensuing referendum will give them additional parental rights if passed.  What concerns me is that these attempts to frame the \"No\" argument around family rights could be quite upsetting to children in so-called non-traditional families.  No child should be made feel that his or her family is of lesser value than anyone else's.  <\/p>  <p>  As I see it, there is no logical argument against supporting this Bill.  We, as legislators, have no place denying two adults in a loving relationship the right to get married.  The argument about whether people are married in the eyes of the Catholic Church, for example, has no place in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Secular law is not beholden to theological discussion in this country any more, and Deputies must leave their personal beliefs and values at the door.  It is important to state this because the Catholic Church will come out against this and perhaps attempt to influence how people should vote.  <\/p>  <p>  We in the House are not asking the Church to change its position.  Rather, we are attempting to change civil law to give a section of our people civil rights previously denied to them.  We are attempting to give gay people the legal recognition of their relationships and the same dignity and respect that is accorded to opposite-sex couples.  Without that legal recognition, gay partners have been denied hospital visitation rights.  In the event of a partner dying, they have been denied the right to bury their life partners, have been excluded from funerals and have lost their homes because estranged families have come forward to inherit the properties of the deceased.  We cannot allow this to continue.  <\/p>  <p>  There is always a danger that some voters will use a referendum to pursue an anti-Government agenda, regardless of the issue at hand.  I have been getting some feedback, as many of us have, on social media and within my constituency, that there are people who intend to vote \"No\" in the upcoming referendum simply as a protest vote to the Government.  That is a horrific prospect.  This Bill and the upcoming referendum will affect the lives of thousands of gay people, who are our people, in Ireland.  Voters will be doing them a serious injustice if they attempt to use the referendum as an opportunity to vent their anger over austerity policies or because they do not like the Government or some section of it.  In the coming weeks, I would urge every Deputy on the Opposition benches to reiterate the point that this is not an election.  Voters will have their day next year to show the Government what they think of austerity or whatever.  For now, the focus must be on gay people being given the same recognition and protection as everyone else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000039#MM00300","speaker":"1094"},{"type":"speech","time":1426014000,"counter":485,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill and I will support it.  I will vote &quot;Yes&quot; on 22 May.<\/p><p>Most people who will vote in the forthcoming referendum will not be personally impacted by the vote.  However, it is well understood by most people that it collectively has an impact on us in that it is an act of social solidarity that will change the laws in order for us to become more equal and inclusive.  Since the foundation of the State, we have tended to outsource social issues to religious institutions as though we were best guided by such bodies.  Changing that has been hugely problematic, as there was a blurring of lines between church and State which is difficult to untangle.  In this instance, it extends to highlighting the difference between civil and religious marriage.<\/p> <p> Only in recent decades have we got to grips with issues that are more properly located in the area of civic morality.  That is strange, given that we are very proud to declare that we live in a republic.  Civic morality is underpinned by values such as equality, acceptance and freedom, all of which are part of the building blocks towards a better society.  Many of the public debates on the issues surrounding the eighth amendment, for example, or the right to travel and information in this respect, along with the two divorce referendums, were framed by people who took absolute positions on either side.  They were very difficult campaigns.  For example, I remember being in the count centre on the day the first divorce referendum was lost, and the effect it had on those who were directly affected was absolutely awful.  They wanted a second chance and their relationships to be accepted.  It was a personal matter for such people and they were badly bruised by the campaign and its outcome.  Both personal and societal damage was done at that time, and we want to ensure that on 23 May, we will not have a repeat of that.<\/p> <p> The Minister highlighted a difference in this issue in that it emerged from the Constitutional Convention and this referendum was recommended by it.  The civic ownership of the campaign is beginning to emerge, and the Vote with Us campaign, for example, is a manifestation of it.  The campaign facilitates people telling their story as to why people should vote \"Yes\", and already it is evident that it features people from all sectors of society.  Brighid and Paddy are a couple who were highlighted at the weekend and will be married for 50 years in 2015.  They made a point of describing themselves as being Roman Catholic.  They argue that this is a civil right that they want for their children and grandchildren.  Mothers and fathers are talking about sons and daughters.  There are straight and gay people involved with the campaign, which is cross-generational and compelling in its ordinariness.  People who have never engaged with politics have come forward to campaign for a \"Yes\" vote, which is really important.  There is no point in wanting a more equal society but staying at home on 22 May.  It is essential that people come out to vote, and it is essential that ownership of the campaign is portrayed in way that citizens can engage with it.<\/p> <p> Most people want to live and let live and they are not keen on a nanny state.  Nevertheless, they want to develop our laws in a way that allows people maximum freedom to live their lives.  That is what this referendum is seeking to achieve.  Civil partnership has been advanced and it delivered rights but fewer of them.  For example, there has been no recognition of the rights of same-sex couples for many social supports in cases of hardship.  This can quite literally leave loved ones out in the cold.  A home of people in a civil partnership is described as a shared home rather than a family home, and there are implications for the protection of dependant children, for example, living in the home.  There is also a lack of protection for civil partners who are deserted.<\/p> <p> It could not be simpler in the case of a civil marriage vote; if we legalise marriage for gay and lesbian citizens, they will be free to get married, although it will not be compulsory.  For many people, Ireland will simply be a happier place.  In a post-crash Ireland, I cannot think of a better way of building civic morality that is grounded in the long-held Irish values of fairness and compassion than by voting \"Yes\" on 22 May.  Better still, we will become the first country in the world to do this by popular vote.  We will join the 18 nations and 820 million people who have already done it.  The only issue to concern us is complacency, as we all need to get out and be active in this campaign.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000039#MM00400","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426014600,"counter":487,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak to this new legislation, the Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Marriage Equality) Bill 2015.  I welcome the Bill and strongly support it as it is another step towards marriage equality and the construction of a new Ireland built on equality and inclusive politics.  Above all, it is about respecting our citizens.  There can be no ifs or buts and there can be no hint of tolerating discrimination.  One either believes in equality and respect for a person or one does not.  That is the bottom line.  I urge everyone to vote \"Yes\" in the referendum in May.  Before people vote, I urge all involved in the debate to look at the facts and get active in the debate and campaign.  I know there is cross-party support for the legislation, which is very positive.<\/p>  <p>  As I have stated before, we need to examine the facts.  We heard misinformation from bishops today and yesterday, which is disappointing.  We must debate with the people involved and tackle the issues head-on.  A couple of years ago I had the privilege of meeting a same-sex couple and their two daughters in my clinic.  The parents did not make the case at that time but rather the children, and they were very impressive.  They spoke about equality and different sorts of families.  The issue concerned the enjoyment of diversity and difference.  That is the kind of country I want to live in.  There were 4,042 same-sex couples living together in 2011, of which 2,321 or 57.4% were male, with 1,721, or 42.6%, were female.  These numbers increased substantially between 2006 and 2011, when the 4,042 same-sex couples recorded as living together indicated an increase of 93% over a five-year period.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of this legislation is to amend the Constitution so as to provide that persons may marry without distinction as to their sex.  If the amendment is approved at a referendum of the people, same-sex couples will have the right to marry.  Marriage will continue to be regulated by legislation and the common law.  The wording in the legislation states that marriage may be contracted in accordance with law by two persons without distinction as to their sex.  Civil marriage should be open to all citizens, regardless of sex.  Same-sex civil marriage gives equal protection to families with children headed by same-sex couples.  Marriage is not just about having children, and I wish the bishops would recognise that.  If there are no children, a same-sex marriage is no less valid.<\/p>  <p>  Civil partnership is not the same as marriage; that is a separate and unequal relationship only available to same-sex couples.  We need to highlight that as well.  Without marriage, children in same-sex families will not benefit from the same constitutional protection and status as is afforded to other children.  That is another key point in the debate.  There are many family types in contemporary Ireland today, and families with same-sex parents are just one of these.  Civil marriage is not a religious ceremony but rather a contract between two people who decide to spend their lives together.  In jurisdictions where same-sex marriage has been introduced, marriage has not changed or been damaged, and there no fewer marriages taking place than before.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015031000040#NN00200","speaker":"1017"}]
