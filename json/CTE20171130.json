It fits with the crisis in student accommodation throughout the country and low-income households using the one asset they have to get a bit of additional income.

I was in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  I will not elaborate on the amendment in view of the fact the section has already been dealt with.  I tabled the amendment because the working family payment was the Government's big idea.  We were told a lot of work was being done on it.  It was going to replace the family income supplement, which was heavily criticised in the Fine Gael election manifesto for some good reasons.  We now find that what has happened is the family income supplement has been reintroduced but has just been renamed the working family payment.  The Minister recognised in the course of her Second Stage contribution the family income supplement as it stands, or the working family payment if we want to call it that now, needs to be altered because there are obvious poverty traps.  It could be altered in a number of ways which, I would argue, would benefit the Exchequer rather than the Exchequer losing.  The Minister has indicated she will do some work on this anyway.  The purpose of the amendment was for the Minister to come back here with her proposals within the next three months in order that we can discuss them to see how they achieve the objective she no doubt desires for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017113000002#E01000","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1512052200,"counter":55,"content":"<p>We are talking about something we cannot talk about because it is gone, but I do not have a problem coming back.

If and when we do make changes, I would like to be able to bring them back, suggest them and talk about them, and if committee members have enhancements to make to those changes, then let us work on them together.  The plan is to move what was the family income supplement into a new working family payment which gives more flexibility and picks away at the poverty traps identified by the Deputy to ensure they do not stay <i>in situ<\/i>.

I cannot give a definitive answer because it entirely depends on the recovery of the economy.

As I said yesterday, if all we were doing this year was giving a &euro;5 increase and that was it, the likelihood is it could have started much earlier in the year, but because there were a variety of other issues that we needed to address this year, such as lone parent income disregards and the fuel allowance, I could not justify it.  This is why we tried to give as much as possible as early as possible to everybody.  As the economy recovers, I hope I will get more money, assuming I am still here, and if we get more money we will be able to pay people earlier.  The Deputy is right that it should be 1 January.

We would then contact all the different groupings and the Minister on their behalf.  Now that more people have been hit - the figure is approximately 42,000 - it has become more of an issue.

We have given the issue extensive discussion and debate at this committee and in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  We know the impact this measure is having on 42,000 older people.  In fairness to the Minister, she has listened and has said she is prepared to act on it.  I do not question her sincerity in that regard.  I have a fear, however.  There are other reports out there and we have been promised changes on many other issues that unfortunately get held up and delayed elsewhere.  This is why it is essential that an amendment be made with a timeframe to hold the Government to account to produce this report.  Extensive work has gone in to publishing it and in going through all the data, including paper and computerised records.  We need to see that report.  The measure has had an impact across the board for 42,000 older citizens and their entitlements to their contributory pension.  We know it has discriminated more against older women.  It needs to be changed.  This is where I disagree; we need the report and I do not believe we can wait until next years' budget.  Having listened to what has been said I hope it can be implemented sooner than that.<\/p> <p>  My amendment has left out a timeframe, other than it needs to be implemented straight away, but we need the report within a two-month timeframe.  The work has been done on it and we need to see the report but more importantly, we need the changes brought in.  There have been conflicting messages from the Government about this.  I touched on this at a previous committee meeting.  The Taoiseach is saying one thing about moving towards addressing the issue through total contributions in 2021 but the Minister is saying something completely different.  We need the report.  I hope the difference in opinion - real or otherwise - at Government level will not hold back the publication of the report.  It is essential because if there are conflicting thoughts on the issue at Government level, an amendment such as this built into the Social Welfare Bill will hold the Government to producing the report.  Much hope has built up over the last number of months.  The figure of 42,000 people has grown on a yearly basis.  This time last year it was 35,000 or 36,000 older citizens ad now it is up to 42,000.  We have not even touched on the issue of retrospective payment.  The longer this anomaly is left to go on, the more older citizens will be punished because of what I describe as the grotesque changes that were made in 2012 to the changes to the rates and bands.  I will push amendment No. 38 to hold the Government to account to produce this report and, more importantly, to account for what actions will be taken to reverse the 2012 changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017113000002#F00200","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1512052200,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I went out last night to meet the women to whom Deputy Joan Collins referred.

First, it is not a Government report.  It is a Department paper with resolutions to fix the anomaly.

If it is agreed there, which I have no doubt it will be, it will then go to the Cabinet.  The timeline is that it will go to the next Cabinet sub-committee and if that takes place before Christmas it will be then and if it does not happen before Christmas it will be straight afterwards.  As soon as that Cabinet sub-committee meeting has been held, I will bring it to the very next Cabinet meeting.  I cannot put a timeline on that because I do not control the Cabinet sub-committees, except to say they happen exceptionally regularly.  The Cabinet happens every week and the Cabinet sub-committee meetings are held at least once per month.  Without having to put down an amendment, I could probably commit to it definitely going to the next Cabinet sub-committee meeting and once it has been discussed there, it will go to Cabinet.  I must put in a caveat that to reaffirm what I have said all along, in order to not give false hope that we are discussing a resolution to the issue in this Bill - we are not.  To fix this issue is going to cost new money that does not exist in this Bill.  The resolution will come from the Cabinet sub-committee and the Cabinet decision but it will have to be with regard to new money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017113000002#F00500","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512052200,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The Department did not have a budget of &euro;5 million and it was not a case of refusing people if we got to &euro;5 million.  If more people have a need for funeral expenses or any of the costs associated with bereavement, that is what we are there for.  The unexpected and unforeseen fits that category perfectly.

I know they work hard, as does everybody, but the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is supposed to be helping the people who have absolutely no other means but social welfare to help them get through difficult times.

Unfortunately, we cannot propose changes which would have a financial impact on the Exchequer, but we know the issue of fuel poverty is very real and faces many people in our society.  A conservative estimate shows that approximately 28% of the population are currently facing fuel poverty.  Ireland has the highest level of excess winter fatalities in Europe.  Last year it was in the region of 2,800, which is a huge figure.  More than 170,000 of our older citizens rely on the fuel allowance.  Obviously fuel poverty does not only impact on our older citizens and also impacts on people right across the board, but older citizens are certainly more susceptible to the cold.  We all hear horror stories of our older citizens having to sit in public buildings such as libraries and council offices during the winter months to keep warm.  We all know of the changes which were made to the fuel allowance which cut the period for which the allowance was payable from 32 weeks down to 25.  It is back up to 27 weeks now, which is a small but welcome step in the right direction, but the period is still five weeks shorter than it was in 2012 when the cuts were first made.  It is a real issue and a very serious one which faces our citizens right across the board.<\/p><p>It is important that a full report is carried out on the impact, good, bad or indifferent, of cuts implemented to the fuel allowance and on how they affect our older citizens.  It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge and welcome the changes the Minister introduced in respect of the payment of the fuel allowance at this stage.  I put forward a proposal for a bulk payment during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill 2016, a proposal which was being pushed by organisations such as Age Action Ireland among others.  That has now been implemented and there are two payments a year.  That is a welcome step.  I hear good reports from people on that measure.  We are still a long way away from the provisions before the 2012 cuts which, as I have said, are having a real detrimental impact.  Some 28% of our population are facing fuel poverty.<\/p><p>That percentage is growing so we need a report on that issue.

We might consider the potential of having it index-linked to increases, but some progressive measure should be considered that would make a difference to people because that increase will impact on them.

The Minister should give serious consideration to this amendment.  All it asks is that a report be done.

However, if the Deputy presses the amendment and I lose on it today and I have to compile a report, it will not be me or my Department that will compile it.  It will be the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.

There are many reports available but having one carried out by whatever Department - it probably needs to be done across a number of Departments - is putting it on a statutory footing.  The recommendations it would make would put pressure on Government.  I am sure this committee and others will put pressure on Government to do it because the other reports are from agencies.

The changes that were made to social welfare rates amount to age discrimination against young unemployed people.  I have pushed previous Ministers on this and the impact it is having.  In the context of housing and homelessness, the reduced payment is having a serious impact and I know that several agencies have made direct reference to that.  In the view of those working in the area, there is a direct link between the reduction in this payment and the prolonging of homelessness for some young people.  It is discrimination and we must call it for what it is.  I know the Minister will say that anyone who agrees to go onto any scheme will get an increase in his or her payment and that is fine.  However, the Minister's predecessor came out with some ludicrous comments at a committee meeting some time ago.  He said that he could not understand how young foreigners can get off a plane in Ireland and get a job at the drop of a hat and that this raises questions as to what our young unemployed people are doing.  I did not say that.  It was the previous Minister, now Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, who said it, or words to that effect.<\/p> <p>  The reality is that the youth unemployment rate is double the unemployment rate.  Some areas, including Arklow in County Wicklow in my own constituency, are youth unemployment black spots, with levels well above the national average.

We have got the actuarial review to tell us what the state of it is, and we will probably launch a public consultation on pensions and the automatic enrolment provision that we are hoping to go forward with, if not next Tuesday, then the following Tuesday.  The only reason I mention that is that employer contributions will match the employee contributions, and contributions will be taken automatically from both employers and employees once that comes on board.  That is a cost associated with the employers.<\/p> <p>  There is also a wider scoping exercise being done at the moment of social insurance contributions made by all classes, not just those of employees but of employers.  It is in the context of what the European norms are.  I totally agree that, based on European norms, we are much lower, both on employee contributions and employer contributions.  However, we also have to recognise that those in countries who pay more get much more out of it, because this would be a social insurance contribution.  It is not something that could be spent on health or education.  It would have to be spent on the employees.  The review is currently being done.  I indicated at the time of the actuarial review's publication that we would spend the next couple of months conducting that review.  Again, I will do some of what members have asked me to do, but I definitely cannot do it within three months because it just is not physically possible.<\/p> <p>  However, what I cannot agree to, apart from the three-month period specified in the amendment, is the provision requiring me to lay a report before the House on the proposals to increase employers' PRSI, because I do not yet know if we will or not.  I will not know that until we have the full picture of what we can get, what changes we need, and what future funding we need.  That will determine whether one's insurance contribution or one's employer's insurance contribution will be increased.  That piece of work is going to be done.  It has been started off the back of the actuarial review that we received at the end of October.  It will be done in the next couple of months, and once I have that report, I can certainly lay it before the joint Oireachtas committee.  However, it is only when I have that information that I will be able to determine how much everybody pays.
