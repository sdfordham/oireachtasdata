Apologies have been received from Deputy Shane Cassells.<\/p> <p>  We will sign off on the minutes of the recent meeting at next week's meeting.<\/p> <p>  Members have a list of correspondence in front of them.  Before I get into the correspondence, I must say, as Chairman of the committee, that I am very disappointed that one item of correspondence we requested two weeks has not been received.  We were here two weeks ago with the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills dealing specifically with funding for the ETB sector.  The first question he was asked that morning in public session was the amount of funding to the ETB sector.  We sat here at length in what was an unsatisfactory situation whereby that figure could not be reasonably, accurately and promptly provided to us.  We are here a considerable period of time later and we still have not received it in writing.  I am saying now in public that we will contact the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills and tell him that if we do not have it by Tuesday, he will be here in person next Thursday morning to explain why he has not supplied that information.  The simple message I am sending out is that when witnesses appear before the Committee of Public Accounts and are asked questions and when they give commitments to supply information to the committee, it is not the end of the matter when they walk out of the room.  That information must be supplied.  We will be watchful of all such matters to ensure all these commitments are honoured in full, and I know members will agree with me on this.  The Secretary General will be here next Thursday morning at the commencement of the meeting if we have not received the full information requested by next Tuesday.  Is that agreed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#B00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1512032400,"counter":7,"content":"<p>Agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#B00300","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1512032400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>We will now move on to the correspondence received.

Item 956A, correspondence from Niall Cody, chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, is his opening statement.  We will note and publish it.<\/p> <p>  Correspondence category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers and follow-ups to Committee of Public Accounts meetings.  The first item is 933B, correspondence received from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 16 November 2017, regarding the transfer of assets of dissolved companies to the State.  This is held over from last week's meeting, so I suggest we note and publish it.  Members are free to study it and use it as they see fit.<\/p> <p>  The next item is 942B from Mr. David Carson of Deloitte regarding the report carried out by Deloitte entitled Independent Review of the Cost of Care Incurred by a Service Provider.  This relates to the Grace case.  The committee had requested an earlier draft of the report produced in May 2017.  Mr. Carson states that providing such a draft would set a precedent and that a draft report is incomplete and subject to change.  He states that he cannot provide draft reports to a party that is seeking to rely on them for any matter contrary to the basis on which they were prepared.  He does, however, provide explanatory information on the particular issue we spoke about.  We would not want our draft reports circulated until completed so, as Chairman, I understand what he is saying.  There is an item of correspondence there.

I, therefore, propose that we hold off discussing this until we get all of the information, first of all to establish why that has not come yet.

Ordinarily, that makes absolute sense, of course - one wants the finished product and not work in progress - but it is different if a controversy arises or there is a suggestion that something else happened to influence or shape what was in a draft and what was in the finalised document.  Deloitte is right to say that providing us with the draft would set a precedent, but it is not necessarily a bad precedent.  In fact, in some respects for the work of this committee, it might prove a necessary precedent.  It would be the exception, I am sure, and not the rule.  We are not in the market for additional paperwork or additional reports, I can assure the committee, if we can possibly avoid it.  I am just bringing this to the Chairman's attention because, as a rule of thumb, I do not like the committee getting brushed off in that way.  There was a particular reason we made that request.  I agree with my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, and with the Chairman on the course of action here on out, but if we are to correspond with Deloitte I would not like the committee to say that by adopting this stance, draft reports are off limits.  That could hamper future work by this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#B00900","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1512032400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I take the Deputy's point completely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#B01000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1512032400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I wish to make pretty much the same point as Deputy Cullinane's.

We were strung along with regard to the Deloitte report.  We were told we were going to see it and it was imminent.  We were told all of that.  There is a pattern here.  I do not think we can criticise the Department of Education and Skills if exactly the same thing is happening in the HSE.  It is not a huge volume of information that we are looking for.

I agree with what is being said about the background.  It cannot be dismissed as a draft report that cannot be circulated.  It became an issue because of the issues surrounding it.  The point was being made by the service provider that funding had been reduced.  That was its consistent point to this committee and the previous one.  In response to that and in response to pressure from the Committee of Public Accounts, it was agreed that an independent report would be produced.  With regard to that independent report, Deputy Murphy has made the point that the word \"imminent\" took on a new meaning.  Imminent does not mean a year or longer.  The interchanges between the parties and the person procuring the report are of great interest.  That is why we asked for the correspondence but we have not received it.  I agree that if we are going to be very critical of one Department it has to be done across the board when the same issues arise.  There is a statement somewhere that the final report was agreed by both parties.  One of the parties did not see the final report.  It is something for that party to follow up on but it would seem it did not see the final report.  I do not know if it is usual to see the final report.  I agree with Deputy Cullinane that it has to go back and then we will look at it in a more nuanced way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#C00300","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1512032400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>We are unanimous at this stage.  In the meantime, we will note and publish it because it is on the record.  We will make sure it is sent to the persons concerned with the transcript from the last day.  We will send out a copy of that letter.  While we are on that topic, we recently spoke to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding the unit it had set up to deal with the Charleton tribunal.  As a matter of proper procedure we will send a copy of any correspondence we had on that matter and the transcript of that aspect of the meeting to the Charleton inquiry.  Now that I have considered the matter, since we have concluded our report on NAMA and Project Eagle, which is also subject to a commission of investigation, if anything has come through this committee by way of correspondence or discussion that could be relevant to that commission, it is our duty to send it on.  It is up to the commission then.  Is it agreed that with regard to the investigation into the Grace case, we will send on anything that is said or done here?  It is up to them to deal with it then.  Similarly with regard to the Charleton tribunal, we will forward anything that was said or any other information we have.  We will do the same with regard to the commission of investigation into Project Eagle.  We do not want it said we had information we did not pass on.  I think we all know where we are on that issue.  We will await further correspondence.<\/p> <p>  The next item concerns correspondence items Nos. 945B and 953B from Mr. Ray Mitchell.  It is follow-up correspondence in response to our meeting with the HSE and Chapter 19 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on section 38 and 39 organisations.  I want to make a comment on this.  I hope people will appreciate the good spirit in which I make it.  It is in contrast to the remarks I have just made.  The reply we have received from the HSE should be the model for how other Departments reply to us.  We asked questions and it deals with them by replying with exact answers to each numbered question.  It is very thorough and complete.  The HSE has improved its communication with us by replying to each specific issue raised.  For the information of the public, we will note and publish the reply.  We asked for the breakdown of the section 38 organisations required to publish their annual reports.  The HSE gave us a list of the 30 organisations.  There is a list of 14 others that are not incorporated bodies and do not have to lodge accounts with the Companies Registration Office, CRO, but which are published as well.  With regard to section 38 organisations that have received over &euro;3 million in funding, we wanted to ensure that all of the 2016 accounts were received by the HSE.  This letter provides a list of 43 such organisations and only three are outstanding.  They are Cheeverstown House company limited by guarantee, Leopardstown Park Hospital Trust and St. John of God Community Services, company limited by guarantee.  Three out of 43 is very good progress and the HSE is to be commended on getting such a high number.  If only other Departments were so good.  Under the section 39 not-for-profit organisations, there is a list of 65 organisations that are required to supply their 2016 financial statements.  Only five of the 65 have not yet done so.  That is a very high hit rate.  We can discuss the content of the HSE correspondence later but I acknowledge the way it is approaching our questions by systematically answering every one and getting those accounts in on a timely basis.  If the rest of the public service got their accounts in as quickly as the HSE seems to be doing with the section 38 and 39 organisations, there would be improved public accountability.  That is an administrative point rather than the substance of the point.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#C00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1512032400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I commend any section 38 or 39 organisation on the timely presentation of accounts but that was not the issue we were discussing.  It is good that it has happened but we have had a lengthy discussion about the failings in a number of these organisations, which arose from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  While this happened on the back of a targeted auditing, we heard from the internal auditor that he had difficulty with a lot of these failings.  We could refer to the situation of Console; its internal audit report showed the issues were systemic and had raised questions for the HSE nationally.  We then saw a list of more than a dozen organisations over which red flags had been raised.  Some of them were new because others in which there were difficulties came into the public domain after we discussed the issue of Console.  We know there are issues in the sector.  I add a caveat to that by saying I understand many of these organisations are small and such a level of governance and oversight can be quite difficult for them to manage.  Some of these organisations get very significant funding from the State and some of the failings were of real concern.  We have had an exchange with the director general of the HSE.

They are issues which for the most part will need to be dealt with in the Oireachtas through the health committee and on the floor of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  I was struck by the issue of the spending of public money on consultant contracts.  There was a suggestion that some consultants were not fulfilling the hours' requirements and yet were being paid from the public purse with public money.<\/p><p>That particular issue, as opposed to broader policy issues, ought to concern this committee.  I do not need to rehearse for anyone how unacceptable it is if this is a widespread practice or a practice adopted by a small minority within the consultant community.  I am not saying that this is the core reason for the failures of the health system but, given our stewardship, we need to consider and get to the bottom of this issue.  It concerns the spending of public moneys and accountability at every level in that regard.  We are in the midst of a busy programme of work, but I suggest that we carve out time for this.  I emphasise that I am referring to this niche issue, not general issues.

The issue of not honouring contracts is important because it has financial consequences.  If we are exploring it, though, we could also explore a related matter, namely, that of tax avoidance.  We dealt with this.  In a report, the Comptroller and Auditor General brought our attention to a practice whereby consultants established companies and paid corporation tax rather than PAYE, and that they were availing of improper allowances.  I am not saying that every consultant does this, but it was a practice within the health service.  We put questions to Revenue, but we never got the chance to put questions to consultants, a group representing them or the HSE.  If we are examining the issue of consultants, there is a considerable amount involved that is relevant to this committee.<\/p> <p>  Deputy McDonald is right about the governance issues and the financial fallout of consultants being paid to do a job and not doing it, which falls under our remit.  If a practice is being employed by some consultants to avoid paying income tax and there is a loss of revenue to the Exchequer, that also falls under the remit of the committee.  In light of both issues, this is a serious enough matter to put on our work programme.

There can be parallel examinations.  The role of the Committee of Public Accounts is to examine systems, processes and procedures.  We are not in the business of telling the Department what it should do in its examinations.  We can offer opinions, but how the Department puts its processes in place is its responsibility.  If any member of the committee had advised a member of the ETB not to co-operate with Dr. Thorn pending the witness' appearance before us, that would have been inappropriate.  Why, therefore, is it okay for Dr. Thorn to advise members of the ETB not to co-operate with this committee?  I still have a difficulty with that and I was not satisfied with the responses we received from the Secretary General.  At the very least, we should write to Dr. Thorn asking for an explanation and his rationale.  There may be one and I would like to hear it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#D01700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1512032400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Regarding the correspondence that the Chairman stated would be circulated in some form, is there engagement with the correspondents in such a situation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#D01800","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1512032400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I am sorry, I was distracted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#D01900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1512032400,"counter":42,"content":"<p>Is there engagement with the correspondents?

This was the highest level of corporation tax receipts recorded in any year, accounting for 15.3% of net tax and duties receipts.  Receipts in 2016 were 7% up on the previous year and followed an exceptional and unexpected 49% increase in net receipts recorded for 2015.  My examination was carried out to try to gain a better understanding of what factors lay behind the 2015 increase.  Although corporation tax applies to a very broad base of companies, the receipts are highly concentrated among a small number of companies and in a number of key sectors.  In 2016, some 70% of receipts were paid by the top 100 taxpayers or 0.2% of taxpayer companies. By comparison, the top 1% of corporation taxpayer companies in the UK accounted for 54% of corporation tax receipts.<\/p> <p>  Three sectors of the Irish economy accounted for around 70% of the total corporation tax receipts in 2016, namely, financial and insurance activities, manufacturing, including pharmaceutical manufacturing, and information and communications service providers. <\/p> <p>  Members will be aware that the effective rate of corporation tax paid by a company may differ from the statutory or headline rate of corporation tax due to the impact of a range of allowable tax reliefs.  The availability and use of such reliefs complicates international comparisons of corporation tax rates and also impacts on the amount of tax received in Ireland from year to year.  The method used by the Revenue Commissioners defines the effective tax rate as tax due as a proportion of taxable income.  The standard statutory corporation tax rate applicable to most trading income is 12.5%.  Using the Revenue approach, the effective tax rate that applied to all companies in Ireland in 2015 was an estimated 9.8%.  I understand that since the report was finalised in September, Revenue has received more complete data in this regard.  The accounting officer will be able to outline the impact of this. <\/p> <p>  The examination looked at the effective corporation tax rates of the top 100 companies in Ireland ranked by tax due and ranked by taxable income.  For the top 100 companies ranked by tax due in 2015, the average effective tax rate was 12.4%.  The effective tax rate averaged 9.3% when the top 100 companies are ranked on the basis of taxable income.  As indicated in the diagram on screen now, eight of the 100 companies with the highest taxable income had an effective tax rate of zero, including some who had negative rates, that is, instead of paying corporation tax, they received rebates.  A further five had an effective rate of less than 1%.  These very low effective rates reflected the use by the companies of significant tax credits and reliefs, in particular, double taxation relief and research and development tax credits.  However, it should also be noted that 79 of the highest earning companies had effective tax rates of 10% or more and that almost two thirds of the highest earning companies had effective tax rates of 12% or more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1512032400,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy and now invite Mr. Cody to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#H00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512032400,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to make a short opening statement.  I am accompanied by Mr. Liam Gallagher, Ms Jeanette Doonan and Mr. Keith Walsh.  The focus today is on chapter 20 of the 2016 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General which is entitled Corporation Tax Receipts.  While chapter 20 does not contain any recommendations for Revenue, in the time available, I will provide a short briefing on corporation tax receipts.  At the outset I want to draw attention to my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality as provided for in section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which prevents me from commenting on the tax affairs of any individual or entity.<br\/><br\/>The Comptroller and Auditor General's 2016 report and Mr. Seamus Coffey&rsquo;s review of the corporation tax code<i>, <\/i>which was published in September 2017, both contain useful analyses of recent trends in corporation tax receipts.  Both reports also highlight the volatility in corporation tax receipts over the past decade or more.  Over recent years, Revenue has sought to contribute to the analysis of trends in corporation tax receipts by publishing a number of research and analysis papers containing statistical information and aggregate data from corporation tax returns and payments. <br\/><br\/>Since 2015, there has been a significant increase in corporation tax receipts.  In 2015, net receipts increased by 49% to &euro;6.87 billion and this upward trend continued into 2016, when &euro;7.35 billion was collected.  Corporation tax receipts to the end of October 2017 are &euro;5.42 billion, which is 4% ahead of target.  While volatility in this area makes forecasting difficult, the Coffey review points to the level shift in corporation tax receipts since 2015 as being sustainable over the medium term to 2020.<br\/><br\/>In an effort to facilitate better understanding of the recent increases in corporation tax receipts, Revenue has analysed the available statistical information, including corporation tax returns and receipts.  In 2016, Revenue published a paper analysing receipts in 2014 and 2015 based on a review of available tax return and payment data.  In April 2017, coinciding with the publication of our 2016 annual report, Revenue published a research paper containing an analysis of 2015 corporation tax returns and payments made in 2016.  Both papers have been provided to the committee as part of Revenue&rsquo;s briefing on the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.<br\/><br\/>The analysis for 2015 is based on a review of corporation tax returns for accounting periods ending in the calendar year 2015, the majority of which were filed towards the end of 2016.  Revenue&rsquo;s analysis of 2015 returns revealed that the increase in corporation tax receipts in that year was attributable to a number of factors, the main one being an increase in trading profits across nearly all sectors.  In 2015, trading profits increased by 51% to &euro;48 billion.  However, some of that increase was offset by increased claims for reliefs, including capital allowances and research and development tax credits.  There was a significant increase in claims for capital allowances in 2015, with claims relating to intangible assets increasing by over &euro;26 billion.  The number of companies paying corporation tax was another contributor to the increase in receipts in 2015.  In 2015, some 39,900 companies paid corporation tax, as compared to 35,700 companies in 2014.  Companies that paid tax in 2015, but not in 2014, accounted for a &euro;470 million increase in 2015 corporation tax receipts.  Generally speaking, companies newly paying corporation tax are either start-up businesses, or companies returning to a profit-making position.  Over 7,900 companies that carried forward losses into 2014 did not carry any losses into 2015.<\/p><p>While this is evidence that some companies have fully used up their legacy losses from the economic downturn, more than &euro;200 billion of trading losses were carried forward at the end of 2015 and will be available for the relevant companies to use against income of the same trade in future accounting periods.<\/p><p> In April 2017, Revenue published an initial analysis of corporation tax payments in 2016.  The majority of these returns were only recently filed and it will take some time to analyse the data in depth.  Revenue will analyse the returns to provide further details on the factors underlying the payment trends in 2016 and this analysis will be published in April 2018.<\/p><p> I will now address the source of corporation tax payments in 2016.  As has been highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General, by the Coffey review and by Revenue&rsquo;s own published research papers, there continues to be a high concentration of corporation tax receipts from a small number of large multinational enterprises.  Revenue records show that in 2016, more than 80% of total corporation tax receipts came from companies dealt with by Revenue&rsquo;s large cases division and 37% of total corporation tax receipts were paid by the ten largest corporation taxpayers in the State.  This is a lower level of concentration than in 2015, when the top ten tax-paying companies accounted for 41% of total corporation tax payments.<\/p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General's report includes an examination of the effective rate of corporation tax in Ireland.  There is no internationally-agreed standard for calculating effective rates of tax.  In 2014, the Department of Finance published a technical paper on effective rates of corporation tax in Ireland, which identified eight different methodologies that are used to calculate the effective rate of tax, and set out the two most appropriate methods to measure the effective rate of Irish corporation tax.  One of these, the tax due as a proportion of taxable income, is identified as appropriate to measure the effective rate of Irish corporation tax on the total profits that are subject to Irish tax.  Consequently, this is the measure used by Revenue.  The most recent year for which information is available from which to calculate the effective tax rate is 2015.  The effective overall corporation tax rate for 2015 calculated by Revenue is 9.6%.  The figure of 9.8% in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report was based on provisional data available earlier in the year and I can confirm that the final figure is 9.6%.<\/p><p> As noted in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the average effective tax rate for the 100 companies with the highest amounts of taxable income in 2015 was 9.3%.  Of the top 100 companies, 13 had an effective Irish tax rate of less than 1%.  Each of these 13 companies was either in receipt of large amounts of foreign dividends, in respect of which double tax relief was available to offset Irish tax payable, or was a claimant of research and development tax credits.  I will briefly explain the impact that both of these claims have on the effective Irish corporation tax rate.<\/p><p> On foreign dividends, Ireland applies a credit system to ensure that foreign-source income, including foreign dividends, is not doubly taxed.  This means that an Irish-resident company in receipt of foreign dividends is chargeable to Irish tax on that income at either 12.5% or 25%, depending on the country from which it is paid and whether the dividends are paid out of trading profits.  Where certain criteria are met, however, a credit will be available against Irish tax in respect of any foreign withholding taxes applied in the country of payment, as well as in respect of foreign tax suffered on the profits out of which the dividend has been paid.  In certain circumstances, what is called an additional foreign credit may also be due.  This is a credit that Ireland introduced in 2013 in response to a decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union that foreign-source dividends should not be subject to tax at a higher level than nationally-sourced dividends.  In summary, a company in receipt of substantial foreign dividend income will have substantial taxable income. However, the tax due element of the effective rate calculation only takes account of the Irish tax due, as reduced by the credit for foreign tax, and this results in a low effective tax rate for the company in Ireland.  When foreign taxes are factored in, the company will have paid significantly higher rates of tax on its income.  Our records show that if the effective tax rate of the relevant companies with substantial foreign dividend income is calculated before the application of a double tax credit, each company would have an effective tax rate of 12% or more.<\/p><p> The research and development tax credit is a targeted measure designed to encourage companies to undertake high-value added research and development activity in Ireland.  A report published by the Department of Finance with budget 2017 states that the research and development tax credit is responsible for 60% of the research and development being conducted in Ireland.  Research and development tax credits, which are available at the rate of 25% of relevant expenditure on research and development activities, can be offset against Irish corporation tax payable and, in certain circumstances, may give rise to payable credits.  Where claimed, they will reduce a company&rsquo;s corporation tax liability and result in the company having a lower effective tax rate.  As the committee is aware, the Comptroller and Auditor General reported on the operation of the research and development credit in his 2015 report and the committee examined its operation with me at my last appearance before the committee on 1 June last.  In summary, if the effective tax rate of each of the 13 companies is calculated before taking account of double tax relief and the research and development tax credit, each would have an effective tax rate in excess of 12%.<\/p><p> Since the publication of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, and as the committee is aware, certain information and allegations originating from the so-called Paradise Papers, have emerged.  As the committee will be aware, yesterday evening, I addressed these issues in detail before the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, at its invitation.  A copy of my opening statement to that committee is available for members' further information.<\/p><p> I thank the committee and I will answer any questions raised by members on these issues, subject, of course, to taxpayer confidentiality constraints. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512032400,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cody.  I want to ask the Department of Finance a question first about Ireland's arrangement on corporation tax, which is the topic we are discussing today, and about the decision by the European Commission on the illegal state aid arising from our corporation tax arrangements with multinational companies.  It was decided in August 2016 that &euro;13 billion was to be collected by Ireland.  That was 15 months ago.  Ireland was given a number of months to do so and has not met the deadline.  Six months after the deadline expired, the Commission indicated that it may take the case to the European Court of Justice given that Ireland is not complying with the Commission's decision.  We are not here to discuss the case or the merits of what is due or where it is due.  This is not a discussion for the Committee of Public Accounts today.  That will be decided at European level.  Pending that decision Ireland was instructed to collect that money.  I am aware of the complexities involved in that.  I know it is not a simple question of opening up an account in Dublin Castle and sending over the money.  We know this and the Department does not need to tell us this.  I understand that an arrangement has to be put in place for an escrow account to be opened.  I understand the account will have to be managed for the entire duration and that management must be in place for the issue of the interest rates and be responsible for the handling of gain or loss on that investment.  I understand that the account will probably have to be held in bonds instead of cash - or a combination of both.  The Minister has indicated during oral statements in the D&aacute;il Chamber and written answers to parliamentary questions that investment managers would have to be appointed by mid-November.  I also understand that in July 2017 the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, started the procurement process in respect of appointing advisers on this matter.  This was six months after the deadline by which we were told by the European Commission to collect the money.  Perhaps the Department could tell the committee - as we sit here - where the &euro;13 billion is, given that the European Commission decision was for &euro;13 billion to be collected by Ireland arising from our corporation tax arrangements with multinational companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#J00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512032400,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Hogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1512032400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Everything I have said is in the Official Report of D&aacute;il proceedings, so there is no confidentiality issue in any matter I have discussed.

The alleged state aid calculated by the Commission at the time was in the region of &euro;13 billion.  The Chairman asked where we are in that regard.  The Chairman is right that we will not discuss the appeal, which is before the European Court of Justice as, obviously, there are limitations on what we could say on the appeal.  Notwithstanding the appeal, and the difference in view between the Ireland and the Commission on the case, Ireland is committed to respecting the decision of the Commission in this regard.<\/p><p> The Chairman has touched on some of the challenges we have in respect of this case.  It is an unprecedented amount for state aid recovery.  It requires a bespoke solution.  It is complex in terms of the nature of the volume of the alleged aid involved and it is set against the particular backdrop of a negative interest rate environment.  We looked at the options around what could be done on this.  In many cases the idea of an escrow account is a solution but an escrow account in this case would have been a sub-optimal solution because we have a large amount of money that has to be managed in a particular way, as the Chairman have noted.  Given that it is likely to be the subject of management for several years until the final conclusion is reached in the case, we have been careful in terms of how we have put in place infrastructure to manage it.  We have been involved with the Commission on a consistent basis explaining what has been going on in the background and the extensive work done by the Department in partnership with the Office of the Attorney General and the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, as well as our engagements with the company.<\/p><p> Given the nature of the funds involved we need to look at the matter in context.  A sum of &euro;13 billion is twice the size of our existing Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, fund.  It is half the size of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, at its height.  The moneys at issue are market moving moneys.  Therefore, whatever solution we put in place has to be cognisant of that scenario.<\/p><p> We have made a great deal of progress in recent months in reaching agreement with the company involved in terms of the nature of the fund we put in place.  The Chairman is right to say it has taken far longer than we thought or anticipated that it could have taken.  At one stage we were signalling to the Commission that, given the size and scale of what we have, it would be nine to ten months from earlier in this year before we would have a solution in place.  It has taken a little longer than that.  We are at the stage now where we expect that, in the next short while, the arrangements will be endorsed by ourselves and the company involved.  That is our anticipation, against the background of what has been a good deal of work.<\/p><p> In tandem - the Chairman alluded to this &ndash; we issued a RFT for investment managers in the summer of this year to find custodians-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Hogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512032400,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Can you explain that for the listeners?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#K00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512032400,"counter":117,"content":"<p>It is a request for tender.

In terms of whether those who should be paying tax are paying tax, this, in itself, is satisfactory.  The R&amp;D tax credit, introduced in 2013, is a policy matter and therefore does not come under the remit of this committee.  However, it is interesting that if one removes it, there is a 12 percentage point differential which is substantial - sorry, I should say, when one includes double taxation.  One cannot qualify it precisely, or perhaps one can - if Mr. Cody can intercede, he should feel free to do so.

Fifteen hundred and thirty-six companies claimed the R&amp;D credit in 2015.  They claimed a total of &euro;708 million.  Each year, the amount of the R&amp;D credit has gone up.  The policy decisions around R&amp;D has been to broaden the scope of the credit and a number of years ago, a refundable element was brought into the R&amp;D credit.  As I said in my opening remarks, the R&amp;D credit was subject to an examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General in the 2015 accounts and we had a discussion about it here, back in June, on the level of audit that we carry out on the R&amp;D credit.<\/p> <p>  The significant issue around R&amp;D credit is ultimately a policy issue.  Ireland is keen to deepen the involvement higher up the development chain of companies in Ireland and the R&amp;D credit is seen as a support of that process.  The Department of Finance did a review on that and published it last year.  The most significant proportion of the R&amp;D credit is claimed by large multinational companies because they are spending the biggest proportion of the money on the R&amp;D credits, and that just makes sense.<\/p> <p>  In the report we published in April 2017, we gave some significant breakdown of the R&amp;D element, by sector and by multinational, compared to small companies.  On the 13 cases, we could certainly show the number of them that were in receipt of the R&amp;D credit.  Some of them were in receipt of both the double tax and the R&amp;D credit, depending on where they were.  I refer to the impact, if you took out the R&amp;D credit.  Mr. Seamus Coffey gets mentioned a lot when we discuss corporation tax receipts.  One of the things he did was he did a commentary on the chapter and he highlighted the fact that the R&amp;D credit is actually related to expenditure, and it is not like the companies can get a kind of free credit.

The process we use has been adopted by many tax administrations following the work which we have done. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#P02400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512032400,"counter":286,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Cody believe that there are any tax havens?

All I am doing is putting questions to him.  I am reading a statement that Mr. Cody made where he said that Revenue's approach to tackling offshore evasion is recognised by the OECD and that, then, is the benchmark.  I am reading from two reports by the OECD, one from 2000 where it identified seven jurisdictions which it says were tax havens, namely, Andorra, the Principality of Liechtenstein, Liberia, the Principality of Monaco, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Republic of Vanuatu.  In May 2009, the same OECD stated there were no tax havens and that no jurisdiction is currently listed as a tax haven by the committee on fiscal affairs.  The OECD itself is saying - it seems to be a flat earth view of the world - that there are no tax havens operating in the world.  When Mr. Cody, then, as head of the Revenue Commissioners cites the OECD as the benchmark upon which we should judge whether Ireland is facilitating tax avoidance, tax evasion or is a tax haven, it is not something that holds up when one looks at the OECD's own reports.  That is the point I am making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#Q00800","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512032400,"counter":293,"content":"<p>The Deputy is misquoting what I said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#Q00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1512032400,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I have the direct quote here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#Q01000","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512032400,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I am sorry, what I was talking about was the use of offshore accounts and offshore financial instruments by Irish tax residents to avoid Irish tax.

However, it was about the 26% GDP growth rate in 2015, rather than tax.  There are absolutely huge communication challenges around that, and it has caused us some reputational damage.  There is no doubt about that.  Ireland's GDP is perhaps the most volatile of any country in the world.  During the crisis, we fell much more than anybody else, and we have rebounded much faster than anybody else.  Even the components of GDP are incredibly volatile, that is, investment, exports and so forth.  There are lots of these issues.<\/p> <p>  The second part of the Deputy's question may be more for colleagues in the Revenue Commissioners.  We know the total corporate profitability in the economy.   One of the reasons for the surge in corporation tax in 2015, when it went up by &euro;2.3 billion, was a surge in corporate profitability.  However, corporate profitability does not immediately translate into tax liability because of capital allowances, losses carried forward, the &euro;200 billion which, I think, is still outstanding because of trade charges, and so forth.<\/p><p>This means that the walk from profits to taxes is not simple.  When we try to project GDP we base tax yield on corporate profitability.  We run projections in line with that basis.  We also interact with our colleagues in the large cases division, some of whom are sitting in the Gallery, because there will be issues specific to individual firms.  We will never be told what the firm is.  Under the legal arrangements Mr. Cody has talked about, we are not allowed to know.  We will, however, be told that there may be repayments pending or a big payment to be made.

I was appointed to this job on 1 February 2015 and two weeks later there was the first of these leaks - HSB Swiss - and there were significant documents provided.  In March of that year I came into the Committee of Public Accounts at the time to report on our activity in HSB Swiss.  It was very interesting in that any of the entities that had an Irish involvement, a significant number we had already dealt with.  We had already prosecuted four of the people who have used the HSB Swiss structure for serious tax evasion.  We then had the Lux Leaks, the second of the big process in which the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, ICIJ, was involved.  Then we had the Panama Papers.  Each of those sets of leaks we have analysed and we have looked to see if there are cases with an Irish interest.  For example, in the context of the Panama Papers we know that there are a number of jurisdictions that paid for the underlying data to whoever got the information from Mossack Fonseca.  We were not offered the information which, I think, is probably significant and probably underlines the fact that there is not significant Irish tax evasion.  I have to stress the term &quot;tax evasion&quot; because we can only collect tax in accordance with the Irish legislation.<br\/><br\/>We now have the Paradise Papers.  There are 71 entities with an Irish connection.  There are 603 addresses and 802 individuals that the ICIJ say are Irish.  The information that has been provided publicly is essentially a kind of spreadsheet setting out names and addresses.  The underlying data, and the financial data, has not been made publicly available.  We have written to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and we have written to the ICIJ asking them, and this is set out.  I thought because of the Paradise Papers that it was appropriate that we should send the committee the opening statement that I made last night. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#U00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1512032400,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I have read it, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#U00500","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512032400,"counter":391,"content":"<p>We are in a process of looking for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#U00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1512032400,"counter":392,"content":"<p>Is Revenue in the active process of following up on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#U00700","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512032400,"counter":393,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#U00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1512032400,"counter":394,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#U00900","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512032400,"counter":395,"content":"<p>One of the things that is very interesting is that four sets of information, essentially, has come out of various financial institutions or advisers.

The Comptroller in his study of it recommended that we would capture exactly what was the restriction of the credit.  What we have done is we have mandated our officers, when they have the recovery, to raise the assessment and collect it using a specific section of the Act.  That is then recorded in our IT systems and then we will be able to say exactly the restriction was that.

In other words, we tax overseas profits but give credit for the tax paid overseas.  In effect, taxes are paid on profits in Ireland.  The same result could be achieved using a territorial system, whereby we would tax profits in Ireland but would not seek to tax overseas profits as they would be taxed in another jurisdiction.  The latter type of system requires the introduction of a particular type of anti-avoidance rule, which is known as the controlled foreign company, CFC, rule.  This ensures that companies do not artificially stuff their profits in the jurisdiction that has a lower tax rate than their home country.  Under a European directive, this rule has to come into effect in Ireland on 1 January 2019.  Seamus Coffey's view is that given that one of the reasons we have not made this move up to now is because we do not have the CFC rule but we are now required to introduce it, it is timely-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession"},{"type":"speech","time":1512032400,"counter":445,"content":"<p>What is a CFC rule?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017113000002#Y00300","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512032400,"counter":446,"content":"<p>It is the controlled foreign company rule, which is the rule which prevents companies artificially moving profits to a lower tax jurisdiction.

Mr. Coffey has suggested that when introducing this rule, we should also look at the question of whether orienting our system differently to a territorial system would be a worthwhile change.  It may not make that much difference in terms of the overall amount of tax paid here but as so many countries now have a territorial system - the US is now moving to this system - this may become the default design norm in tax systems and, therefore, it may make things easier for us in terms of moving internationally in the years ahead.

Broadly speaking, this is about transactions within a group or in other words, the manner in which related companies transact between themselves.  Under OECD rules this should happen on an arm's-length basis.  In other words, if the Deputy and I are companies in the same group we should transact as if we are on the open market such that we cannot artificially set prices in a way that distorts the tax result.  That is the purpose of the transfer pricing rules.  The OECD sets these rules internationally.  Arising out of the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, project there are new guidelines in place as to how this should be done.  Ireland has committed to importing these rules into its domestic law.  Mr. Seamus Coffey considered this issue in the context of his review.  While this was not an issue that necessarily caught the headlines when the review was published, Mr. Coffey makes very important recommendations on it, including the need to meet the new OECD standards and on the scope of our transfer pricing rules.  There are some areas where the transfer pricing regime in Ireland does not currently apply, for example, in respect of passive-investment income.  It also does not apply to SMEs or to transactions before 2010, which is when transfer pricing was introduced in Ireland for the first time.  Seamus Coffey makes the point that not only do we need to modernise our transfer pricing regime, we need to broaden it and that given the complexities, we should consult on the issue.

If one made a profit of &euro;1,000 in that year, one could write it down by &euro;1,000 because one's car is only worth &euro;9,000 after a year.  The &euro;1,000 is offset against one's profit.  It is an equivalent scenario here where a company buys an intellectual property asset which depreciates and it is written down in the accounts over time.  That depreciation in the form of capital allowances is offset against the income for that asset.<\/p> <p>  One of the changes in the Finance Bill, which came from Seamus Coffey's recommendations, is that one does not have a scenario where capital allowances are written off against income in full and then one has a period where one has a big change in one's corporation tax receipts later on because there are no more capital allowances to use up.  From a sustainability point of view, it is preferable to smooth this over time.

What has been happening over many years is that intellectual property has been held offshore in jurisdictions with low corporation tax and, in some cases, no corporation tax.  One then has royalty flows going out to the jurisdictions where the intellectual property is held.  The OECD has introduced new transfer pricing rules whereby, if there is no substance in those jurisdictions, that sort of tax arrangement does not really work.  What multinationals have to do now is look where they have substantive activities, employment and decision makers and co-locate the intellectual property with that substance.  For some of those that have substantive operations in Ireland, it makes sense to move their intellectual property here.  Once it comes onshore, like any other type of asset, it will be subject to depreciation and that is based on what is in the accounts.  They follow within the accounts.

The refundable credits are paid over a period so an increase is built into the system until things are washed out.  Ultimately, however, the credit is a direct result of the expenditure.

As the Chairman said, I am joined by Ms Geraldine Luddy, head of the bioethics unit at the Department of Health, and our colleague, Ms Aoife O'Brien, who is also from the bioethics unit.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak about the ancillary recommendations contained in the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly&rsquo;s final report and recommendations on the eighth amendment of the Constitution.  The committee received in September the Department&rsquo;s submission on the recommendations, so I will try to summarise them briefly.<\/p> <p>  The first ancillary recommendation which I will address concerns improved access to reproductive health care services, including contraception, sexual health services and termination of pregnancy.  With regard to contraception and family planning services, the Department of Health launched the National Sexual Health Strategy 2015-2020 in October 2015, following Government approval.  The strategy is being implemented under Healthy Ireland, the National Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing.  It is a cross-governmental policy, which is being delivered in partnership by the Department of Health, the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills.  The national sexual health strategy&rsquo;s key aims are to improve sexual health and well-being, and to reduce negative sexual health outcomes.<\/p> <p>  The strategy aims to ensure that everyone in Ireland will receive comprehensive and age-appropriate sexual health education and information, and will have access to appropriate prevention and promotion services.  It also aims to make equitable, accessible and high-quality sexual health services, targeted and tailored according to need, available to everyone.  I will not address the service provision aspects of the national sexual health strategy, as I believe our colleagues from the HSE are in a better position to do so.  They will address it as part of their presentation and will support any questions committee members may have on it.  However, just to note that implementation of the strategy got under way quickly, with an action plan prioritising an initial 18 actions, covering areas such as clinical services, education, communications and governance structures.  All of these actions have commenced, and ten have already been completed, including the appointment of a national clinical lead for sexual health in the HSE, and the reconfiguration of the HSE crisis pregnancy programme to encompass sexual health as the new HSE sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme.  As the Chairman said, this is represented at the meeting.  In terms of achieving good quality outcomes, the Department considers that full implementation of the strategy, together with the measures outlined in the national maternity strategy, which I will address shortly, will significantly advance the good quality outcomes envisaged by the Citizens' Assembly.<\/p> <p>  The second ancillary recommendation which I will address concerns standards of obstetrical care in Ireland.  I want to cover a number of elements of this.  Over recent years, as members are aware, there has been significant focus on the development of a national maternity policy to ensure that our maternity services are developed in a coherent and evidence-based manner.  Last year, we published Ireland&rsquo;s first ever national maternity strategy, Creating a Better Future Together 2016-2026, again following Government approval.  The HSE's standards for bereavement care following pregnancy loss and perinatal death were also published in 2016, and I will speak a little more about these later.  Also, in 2016, at the end of the year, HIQA's national standards for safer better maternity services were launched.  They aim to give a shared voice to the expectations of women using maternity services, service providers and the public.  They are intended to show what safe, high-quality maternity services should look like.<\/p> <p>  Committee members may be aware that each of the 19 maternity units is now required to publish a maternity patient safety statement every month.  The first of these were published in December 2015.  They are published monthly in arrears, and report information on 17 metrics, dealing with clinical activities, major obstetric events, modes of delivery and other clinical incidents.  Taken together, all of these developments are key building blocks which will enable us to provide a consistently safe, patient-centred, high-quality maternity service.  They will also help advance the quality outcomes envisaged by the Citizens' Assembly in its ancillary recommendations.<\/p> <p>  In terms of overall governance structures, a national women and infants health programme has been established within the HSE, the leadership of which is represented here today, to lead the implementation of the national maternity strategy.  It spans obstetrics, aspects of gynaecology and neonatal services across community, primary, and secondary care.  The programme will oversee the establishment of maternity networks across the country, which will formally link all maternity units within each hospital group.  It is recognised that smaller maternity services cannot, and often should not, operate in isolation as stand-alone entities.  Given their size, some of these units cannot sustain the breadth and depth of clinical services required by the populations they serve.  Through the establishment of maternity networks, we will ensure efficiency in the provision of, and access to, specialised services and support smaller units to provide safe and quality services.<\/p> <p>  The Department is aware that a key concern of the Citizens' Assembly in its ancillary recommendation was that all pregnant women, regardless of geographic location or, indeed, ability to pay, should have access to early scanning and testing.  On this point, the maternity strategy is very clear that all women should have equal access to standardised ultrasound services.  We know that there are challenges, but we intend to build capacity in our ultrasound services.  To that end, additional funding will be provided to the national women and infants health programme in 2018, subject to finalisation of the service plan, to develop a more equitable and consistent antenatal screening service.  We will hear more detail on this from colleagues in the HSE in a moment.<\/p> <p>  The recently published maternity strategy implementation plan addresses the current regional inconsistency in service provision.  Pending full implementation of the strategy&rsquo;s recommendations on anomaly scanning, the programme will continue to work with the six hospital groups to ensure increasing access to anomaly scans.  In particular, it will work to ensure that clinical pathways are in place within each network, such that where clinically indicated, a woman can be referred to a larger maternity unit for such a scan.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the ancillary recommendation on improving counselling and support facilities for pregnant women, I do not propose to go into the detail on the service delivery side, given that colleagues from the HSE will address it.  I am aware the committee previously had speakers before it on this from the HSE sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme, which is also represented here today.  I will briefly note that the programme funds the provision of crisis pregnancy and post abortion counselling services, which operate out of more than 40 locations throughout the country..  All services also provide access to post-termination counselling and a number provide free post-termination medical check-ups.<\/p><p>The national maternity strategy pointed to the need to improve access to mental health supports and to that end a number of its recommendations are relevant.  The maternity strategy implementation plan addresses the issue and sets out specific actions to identify women at risk and ensure that they get the necessary support during their pregnancy and postnatally.<\/p><p> Earlier I referred to the national standards for bereavement care following pregnancy loss.  I draw members' attention to the fact that they were published last year.  We anticipate that the standards will drive the development of clinical and counselling services within our maternity services overall.  The standards describe the standardised structures, clinical processes and compassionate responses that should be in place across maternity services for parents who experience a pregnancy loss or a perinatal event.  The standards will also apply in situations where there is a diagnosis of foetal anomaly that may be life limiting or fatal.  The linkages between maternity bereavement care and other hospital and associated services such as primary care, public health nursing and palliative care are also outlined in the standards.  Each hospital will have to have systems in place to ensure that bereavement care and end-of-life care for babies is central to the mission of the hospital and is organised around the needs of babies and their families.  The implementation of the standards has begun and teams are being established in each maternity unit and hospital around the State.<\/p><p> The HSE is today launching a perinatal mental health services model of care for Ireland.  I expect we will hear something more about this from contributions by colleagues in the HSE.  I note that the model of care is closely aligned with the national maternity strategy, and contributes to the implementation of the strategy&rsquo;s actions on mental health.  The model is based on the maternity networks that I spoke of earlier.  This means that specialist perinatal mental health services will be aligned within hospital groups and developed to provide for each of the 19 maternity units.  It is a significant development in addressing the mental health needs of women both during pregnancy and in the year following delivery.<\/p><p> The Citizens&rsquo; Assembly recommended that further consideration should be given as to who will fund and carry out termination of pregnancy in Ireland.  I will preface my remarks here by pointing out that action in this area will be subject to deliberations of this committee and further deliberation by the Oireachtas on recommendation this committee decides to make.  It will also be subject to the outcome of the referendum which the Government has committed to holding next year.<\/p><p> Terminations of pregnancy carried out in Ireland at the moment, under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, are limited to the 19 public hospital obstetric units.  That is to say, they are only done in the public system and are funded by the State.  It was appropriate that terminations in this context took place in obstetric units to ensure all the expertise and facilities appropriate to provide safe medical services, and ancillary services, to pregnant women whose lives were at risk and to the unborn.<\/p><p> Other than in emergency situations, doctors who can certify or permit access to a procedure under the Act must be registered by the Medical Council in its specialist division.  At the moment, a termination of pregnancy may only be carried out by or under the supervision of a consultant obstetrician.  This is irrespective of whether the medical procedure for carrying out the termination is by medical or surgical means.  On the point about medical terminations of pregnancy, I must note that there are currently no medicines indicated for the termination of pregnancy currently authorised for that specific use in Ireland.  In the event of any change to the Constitution and to legislation around access to such services of drugs for medical termination, it would be the responsibility of the manufacturers of such medicines to seek - as they do - a marketing authorisation for such use in Ireland.  This would be in line with the normal procedure for authorising any medicines to the Irish market.   Members are aware that the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, is the competent authority responsible for the regulation of human medicines in Ireland.  It has a structured assessment procedure in place for conducting this assessment process.<\/p><p> If there is a change to the eighth amendment and if the grounds for termination of pregnancy are widened from what is currently provided for, then this will have implications for the health service provision.  Pending a decision on the policy direction, the Department of Health is working with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of the Taoiseach to explore and research the constitutional and policy issues involved so that as much preparation can be done and drawn upon in the context of any recommendations or decisions that are made over the coming months.  Once direction is clear, consideration will be given to the issue of funding and carrying out terminations of pregnancy in Ireland, and to drafting further legislation in order to ensure access to such services and good quality outcomes.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and her fellow committee members for the opportunity to address the committee today and I wish the Chairman well with her work.  I also look forward to the report. I am available to answer any questions that members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017113000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512054000,"counter":666,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Holohan.

I am joined today by Dr. Peter McKenna, Mr. Kilian McGrane and Ms Angela Dunne from the national women and infants health programme and by Ms Janice Donlon, who is with the sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme.<br\/><br\/>In my submission to the committee I have addressed the points raised by the committee in correspondence with the HSE.  With regard to improvements being made to counselling and support facilities for pregnant women both during pregnancy, perinatal mental health features strongly in the national maternity strategy recognising the potential impact it has on the mother, baby and the wider family.  The national women and infants health programme implementation plan sets out a series of actions aimed at identifying at risk women, and ensuring that they get the appropriate support throughout their pregnancy and during the postnatal phase.  These actions include the appointment of clinical midwife specialists in each of the 19 maternity hospitals or units, to support and train midwives in identifying and supporting at risk women and the recruitment of additional perinatal psychiatrists, so that each maternity network has a minimum of one perinatal psychiatrist.  In line with the perinatal mental health model developed by the HSE&rsquo;s mental health directorate, a hub and spoke model will exist within each maternity network, with the psychiatrist based in the tertiary facility accepting referrals from individuals units, and supported as required by local liaison psychiatry.  Another implementation action is the training of all staff working in maternity hospitals or units to identify women at risk at booking appointments, or throughout their maternity journey, and in particular those with a mental health history.<br\/><br\/>While these developments are resource dependent, the implementation process will commence with the launch of the HSE&rsquo;s implementation plan for the national maternity strategy.  Perinatal mental health is a significant priority for the programme.  The actions in the implementation plan will focus on providing the necessary support and counselling to women who are showing signs of stress and anxiety at the lower end of the spectrum, as well as those who have an underlying history of mental illness in the higher risk categories.  The pathway for women will depend on the risk classification from their assessment. The model of care for perinatal mental health is being launched today by the mental health division of the HSE and we will arrange for information to be provided to the committee on its content.  I have copies of the printed document from that session which I will provide to the clerk if that is helpful for committee members.<br\/><br\/>The model of care is based on the maternity networks recommended in the national maternity strategy.  This means the specialist perinatal mental health services will be aligned to hospital groups and developed in a hub and spoke format so all 19 maternity services are included in the model.  An allocation &euro;1 million has been made in 2017 to start three specialist perinatal hubs in Galway, Cork and Limerick hospitals and to expand the small existing teams in the Dublin based maternity hospitals - the Coombe, the National Maternity Hospital and the Rotunda.  A further &euro;2 million has been allocated for 2018 to complete each of these six hub teams.  The model of care recommends the establishment of a national mother and baby unit.  This will require further investment.<br\/><br\/>In August 2016, the HSE launched the national standards for bereavement care following pregnancy loss and perinatal death.  These standards set out the care that families can expect following a maternity related bereavement.  An implementation team has been established and a clinical lead and programme manager have been appointed.  The implementation team are visiting all 19 units to support the implementation of the standards.  In 2016, resources were secured to appoint a clinical midwife specialist in bereavement to all maternity hospitals and units that did not already have one.  Recruitment to fill these important posts is currently under way.<br\/><br\/>The provision of services and supports to women and their families experiencing a crisis pregnancy is part of the remit of the sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme, which is one of a number of national programmes led by the health and well-being division of the HSE.  My colleagues, Janice Donlon and Helen Deely, made a presentation to the committee on the work of the programme on 15 November 2017, and Ms Donlon is here today to provide any further inputs the committee may require.  The programme presented on the current provision of counselling services in Ireland as funded by them and the range of supports available to women both during a crisis pregnancy and following termination.<br\/><br\/>The members will be aware from the presentation that the HSE programme currently funds 15 individual crisis pregnancy counselling services, which operate out of 40 plus locations nationwide to provide free crisis pregnancy counselling.  These services are in a mix of rural and urban locations.  Details of these crisis pregnancy counselling services can be found on <i>www.positiveoptions.ie<\/i>.  Crisis pregnancy counselling and the provision of information on all three options - parenting, adoption and abortion - is provided under the legal framework of Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995.<\/p><p>The Act sets out how information about legal abortion services outside Ireland may be given to individuals or groups in Ireland.<\/p><p> All women should have the same standard of obstetrical care, including early scanning and testing.  That was the subject of the committee's second question to us.  The national maternity strategy, Creating a Better Future Together, sets out the roadmap for ensuring that all women can access standardised high-quality, safe care regardless of location.  The HSE has developed and published an implementation plan for the national maternity strategy which seeks to address the current regional variations in provision of anomaly scanning as part of the overall approach.  The implementation plan will be overseen by the HSE's national women and infants health programme, NWIHP.  The HSE's maternity services will be managed through maternity networks, with larger tertiary centres working collaboratively with smaller regional centres.<\/p><p> The provision of a dating ultrasound in the late first trimester, 12-14 weeks, followed by a detailed foetal anomaly scan at 20-22 weeks is a recognised component of good antenatal care.  Currently only seven maternity hospitals or units offer 100% of women access to anomaly scans, and five units do not offer any access.  As part of the implementation plan for the national maternity strategy, the NWIHP has identified the need for an additional 52 sonographers to support the provision of both dating and anomaly scanning in all 19 maternity hospitals or units.  In 2018 the priority will be on improving access for anomaly scanning, and funding for approximately 40 additional sonographers, subject to the approval of the HSE's national service plan for 2018, will be provided.  Sonographers are a difficult grade to recruit, and if suitably qualified personnel are not available, existing staff will be trained to develop the required capacity.  While this will take time, the recruitment of the additional staff will improve access.  Further consideration should be given to who will fund and carry out terminations of pregnancy in Ireland.  That was the final query.  In the first instance this will be a policy matter for the Department of Health in the event of any changes in the legislation being passed in the future, following which the HSE may be invited to submit additional service proposals for funding through the HSE's annual service plan and Estimates processes.<\/p><p> This concludes my opening statement and with my colleagues we will endeavour to answer any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017113000002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512054000,"counter":669,"content":"<p>There is quite an army of witnesses here today to make the case.

As far as I know there are only three part-time perinatal psychiatrists in the country and all of those are based in Dublin.  There is no mother-and-baby unit for severely depressed mothers or mothers with other perinatal mental health difficulties.  It is difficult to believe that in 2017 we have such poor support for pregnant women.  It is well understood that the consequences of not having proper support for pregnant women and post-natal women can be very serious in the short, medium and long term, even up to fatalities.<\/p> <p>  Why has pregnant women's mental health been largely ignored to date?  We know that mental health services tend to be the poor relation of health services.  Even within mental health services, perinatal mental health support seems to be at the bottom of the list of what has been provided to date.<\/p> <p>  We have A Vision for Change.  We are in year 11 of a ten-year plan with approximately 72% to 75% of it implemented.  What enforcement will be applied to ensure this plan is implemented?  Is there an implementation body?  Who will oversee its implementation?  Will there be quarterly reports to ensure it is implemented and if it is not being implemented will there be accountability for its lack of implementation or certainly explanation as to why it is not implemented?  Is there a step-by-step roadmap for its implementation?<\/p> <p>  Further to what Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith said, how will the HSE recruit and retain the staff?  While plans are great, certainly in mental health there seem to be extreme difficulties in getting staff into place and retaining them.  For example, psychiatric nurses are under huge pressure because of the lack of staff to support them.  They are extremely stretched.  They are coming under severe mental health pressures.<\/p> <p>  If the people vote in a referendum to change the system we have, how will terminations be facilitated?

The Deputy is correct in saying that we are limited to the three part-time Dublin-based posts.  As we said on our opening statement, we have funding to recruit additional psychiatrists.  That will be a challenge.  In the mental health services at large that has been a significant issue.  We have had more success in recruiting psychiatrists in the acute area than we have into the community.  We hope that we can use that to advantage in terms of attracting people back.  I would not underestimate or understate the challenge.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to A Vision for Change, monitoring against a plan, a roadmap for success, timescales, deliverables and reporting against that.  The national women's and infants programme within the HSE service plan is monitoring the implementation of these developments.  Some of them will also fall to be considered within the mental health division of the HSE.  There is a process for that and we report on it.  The Department of Health holds the HSE to account for our implementation of new services when new funding is provided.  That is typically reported on within our published reports that we put online quarterly.  We also report back to the Oireachtas committees and elsewhere.  There is a process in place to monitor implementation and that is clear.  I would not underestimate the challenge.  It is something we have in place and we hope to progress that.<\/p> <p>  Recruiting any consultant is typically a 12-month journey.  A fair amount of effort is required to attract consultants back.  It is about attracting back consultants.  Typically that will happen over 12 months.  There are processes in place for that.  We have increased the overall consultant number.  The number in the acute division is up by about 59 year-on-year at the moment.  We have a process.  We will have to run that and see where it brings us - hopefully it will be successful.<\/p> <p>  Regarding capacity, as I said at the end of the statement, the HSE, as with any service, will respond to legislation in terms of scaling service requirement and costing that and submitting such costing and service requirements to the Department of Health based on a model of care as and when that is required.

One of them mentioned that in his work in the Department he was preparing for various scenarios, depending on what the Government and the Oireachtas eventually proposed.  I ask him to direct his mind to another scenario when a referendum is held and the people decide to uphold the <i>status quo<\/i>to protect both babies and their mothers during pregnancy.  I ask him to consider whether there are changes that will be required in that regard.<\/p><p>According to the figures presented to us many times, our birth rate is approximately one tenth of that in Britain.  Were we to have an abortion rate one tenth of that in Britain, there would be 19,000 or 20,000 abortions per year.  On the best evidence available from British figures for the number of Irish women having abortions in Britain, the very small number who do so in the Netherlands and if one were to allow for 1,000 or 2,000 people importing abortion pills, one is talking about between 3,000 and 5,000 abortions, which is one quarter of the rate in Britain.  Do we have any knowledge of what has contributed to this?  Is there evidence that the provision of State funded counselling, for example, is a contributory factor?  Has it to do with the increased use of contraceptives?  The figure has been declining, on the basis of the information available on the number of women having abortions in Britain.  Has it to do with increased awareness?  The emergence of 4D ultrasound scans has increased awareness of the wonder of life in the womb and its complexity and development from its earliest stages.  Is there a new awareness of it?  Any information in that regard would be helpful.<\/p><p>I wish to ask about non-directive counselling, about which I asked questions on a previous occasion when representatives of the crisis pregnancy programme appeared before the committee.  I am operating from the understanding non-directive counselling is one of the many approaches that can be practised and is respected in the general area of counselling.  Obviously, where one does not give an instruction on how to proceed, non-directive counselling clearly has its limitations.  For example, I cannot imagine that it would be appropriate when counselling a person who is suicidal.<\/p><p>My question is in the context of the Constitution pledging that the State, as far as is practicable, will defend and vindicate the right to life of the unborn and there being a great deal of public messaging on matters such as obesity, drink driving and so forth which is directive in seeking to protect not only oneself but also potential third parties who could be hurt by one's actions.  In addition, I note what the 1995 Act states, as discussed on a previous occasion.  There does not appear to be a definition or a requirement in law that counselling be non-directive.  The 1995 Act states counselling must not take a form or manner which advocates or promotes the termination of pregnancy.  Interestingly, as far as I am aware - I am subject to correction - there does not appear to be a counterbalancing injunction that counselling must not take a form or manner which encourages the protection of the unborn.  Has any consideration being given to whether what clearly appears to be the preferred mode of non-directive counselling, in the context of the provision of State funding, is actually constitutional, having regard to the fact that the Constitution states in law and policy that there are two human beings to be protected?  Has there ever been any discussion about whether the requirement for undefined non-directive counselling in some way offends the spirit of the Constitution?  Having regard to the fact that some State funded pregnancy counselling organisations have a strong stated agenda to promote legalised abortion, it appears to be tilted in the other direction.  On a previous occasion I drew the attention of the committee to how counsellors with the Irish Family Planning Association and other organisations, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>, had been found in some circumstances to have been giving women dangerous advice which included telling them to lie to their doctor if they suffered complications after an abortion and to say they had had a miscarriage.  In some cases women had been given information on how access the abortion pill.  I wonder whether non-directive counselling has been used as a cover, if anything, to push women towards having an abortion.  Clearly, there is a block on counselling to encourage, not coerce, the taking of the life saving option.  Will the delegates tell me if the provision of non-directive counselling has been considered in terms of its constitutionality and whether there are other ways by which it could be done?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017113000002#H00500","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1512054000,"counter":702,"content":"<p>The delegates can answer the questions, but we will have legal advice next week on the point raised by the Senator last week about non-directive counselling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017113000002#H00600","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1512054000,"counter":703,"content":"<p>Have we not received some already?

I am familiar with some of them from many meetings of the health committee.  I am a firm believer in prevention being better than cure. Looking at the report on folic acid as a preventive measure against birth defects in Ireland, for example, I note we actually have an increase in neural tube defects in this country.  Such defects encompass spina bifida, though I do not need to tell Dr. Holohan that, of course, and many other things that might sometimes be classed as fatal foetal abnormalities.  It looks like we are an outlier with regard to European standards and I am quite concerned by that.  From what I have read, the rate seems to be increasing disproportionately in Ireland.  The report contained options for the prevention of neural tube defects in Ireland.  How are we getting on with that?  I would like to see folic acid, a very safe and cheap B vitamin, being more readily available than it is currently on the GMS scheme.  Many pregnancies, though not necessarily a crisis, are unplanned and from my own work as a community pharmacist, I am aware there is a huge amount of ignorance around folic acid.  I have spoken before about people just using up the vitamins that are in the cupboard and then not getting around to buying a packet of folic acid until week 14 or so.  Could the witnesses speak about this and about what we are doing in this area?  If we can try to prevent neural tube defects we will then have healthier babies and ultimately fewer terminations.  That is what we are all about here.<\/p> <p>  My second question arises from a point in Dr. Holohan's presentation about the medical professionals involved in the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 being on the specialist register.  Looking at international examples, my view would be that one would not need to be a specialist in the provision of medical abortion and that some of this could be done through the GP and the pharmacy.  Thinking forward and assuming that the eighth amendment might be repealed, perhaps Dr. Holohan could offer this committee some advice on this matter in order that we do not end in a situation where we need 15 doctors and three psychiatrists for a woman who is six weeks pregnant and looking for a termination.  That would obviously be completely unworkable.  <\/p> <p>  I would also like someone to comment on the current situation.  Professor Veronica O'Keane, a professor of psychiatry, appeared before the committee and she spoke about her concern over patients with complex medical and psychiatric needs travelling abroad without their medical files or without a conversation.  How does Dr. Holohan, as Chief Medical Officer, feel about this?  Is there anything that we can do in the meantime, within our constitutional restrictions, to try to ease some of that pain?  Is there anything we can do in the interim period before there is a referendum in this country?  This is something about which I am quite concerned.<\/p> <p>  I was going to talk about contraception but I know that Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017113000002#J02800","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1512054000,"counter":738,"content":"<p>I am going to allow two answers and then let Deputy O'Connell back in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017113000002#J02900","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1512054000,"counter":739,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017113000002#J03000","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512054000,"counter":740,"content":"<p>In response the first question, I completely agree with the Deputy's points about folic acid, the importance of the lack of an understanding that one would like to think exists and the measures that must taken in this regard.  I know of a variety of different mechanisms in place here, not least the work being done through the women and infants programme, which is led by a number of obstetricians.  Professor Turner, of whom the committee may be aware, is doing work on the development of guidelines on folic acid to deal with the very concerning increase in this country in the incidence of neural tube defects.  There may be other factors to explain why we are seeing this increase but the use of folate is certainly not at the level at which we would wish it to be.  This is a question that we have looked at and will continue to look at at a policy level, particularly in terms of the public health measures that could be taken to deal with this.  I am conscious that I am in the presence of someone who is far more expert than myself in these matters, namely, the former Master of the Rotunda, Dr. McKenna, and he may be in a position to add something to what I have said here.  I will deal with the other questions and then hand over to Dr. McKenna.<\/p><p>Members may be aware that the specialist register is essentially a mechanism through which specialist registration can be recognised in a number of different specialties, which are organised at European level.  General practice is one of those specialties, so a doctor on the specialist register who is a general practitioner is covered.  If the change in law was such as to enable both access to prescription and the dispensing of medicines, the types of services that have been described are well within the sphere of competence of a doctor who is on the specialist register in general practice.<\/p><p> On the question of complexity, in the current situation, a doctor who is in possession of medical records relevant to the care and treatment of a woman who is receiving services elsewhere is allowed to make those records available, if it is wished for.  In a more general sense of course, in the case of anybody who has a medical procedure in one jurisdiction and travels in short order to another jurisdiction, the general concern one would have as a medical practitioner for the person's health and well-being would be significant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017113000002#J03100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512054000,"counter":742,"content":"<p>Many pregnancies are unplanned, which is not to say unwanted, and it is unrealistic to expect people who are not planning to get pregnant to take medication in case they do so.

The Citizens' Assembly asked us to give this serious consideration and we have heard a great deal of evidence in recent weeks to the effect that the biggest, positive news is that the best way to reduce abortion rates is the availability of contraception.  More than any restrictive legislation, this is what will change the situation and address concerns.  What has been done in the way of a cost-benefit analysis of the provision of free universal access to contraception as part of the health service?  The most recent data in this regard come from the Irish Contraception and Crisis Pregnancy Study 2010, or ICCP 2010.  We cannot make policy if we do not have data.  Are we reviewing that?  Are there plans to initiate a new study?

I can check back on the record.<\/p> <p>  I want to know about the recruitment of the 52 sonographers.  We have already heard at this committee extensive evidence on the need to access scans for the purpose of detecting anomalies, dating and so on, so we know it is very important.  I am conscious that Dr. Holohan said some of the work in preparation for a referendum has been done, and that is to be welcomed.  However, on the flip side, none of this will be possible or easy unless we have the staff to do it.<\/p> <p>  Could the witnesses give us a timeline for the 52 sonographers?  The witnesses will know as well as I do that the 20-week scans are screening scans.  I would not ask the witnesses to take my word for it but, as the consultants in this area have told us, it is not necessarily possible to make a decision as to who will need a scan because it is a screening scan and one needs to screen to get the information.  In the meantime, and pending the recruitment of the 52 sonographers, 140 midwives and all the other staff that would probably just bring us up to a fairly basic level of service, how many women access the anomaly scan, how is it decided they will need one, and what percentage of women need it?  Since it is a screening scan, we will take as a given that all pregnant women should have access to it.  What percentage of women are missing out?  This will have serious implications in the event of the repeal of the eighth amendment.<\/p> <p>  I will ask one final question because I do not wish to delay any more than I have to.  My colleague, Deputy O'Brien, asked a question about recording those women who sought access to a termination under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act but who were not granted one and did not engage in the review process.  One of the speakers - it might have been Dr. Holohan - alluded to the need for us to have evidence, and evidence must inform policy.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Health is fairly clear that collection of that information would not come under its remit.  My view is that it clearly would come under the HSE's remit, not Mr. Woods's personal remit, that it would be the HSE's job.  It is quite worrying that the information is not being recorded.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps Mr. Woods could explain to us why he feels it is not important to record that information and who he feels should be recording it.  The Department has given its clear view that it is not a policy matter so it is not for it to record it.  My view is that it clearly comes within the remit of the HSE.  Mr. Woods can correct me if I am wrong on this, but I think we can all agree that the recording of this information is important.  If it is not currently being recorded, and I suspect it is not, perhaps Mr. Woods might be able to tell us who within the HSE will have responsibility for recording it.<\/p> <p>  In the event that the eighth amendment is repealed and expanded access to services is brought in, and in order to be able to develop services further, we will need evidence, and we are starting from a fairly bad place if we are already neglecting to collect some of that evidence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017113000002#N02100","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1512054000,"counter":843,"content":"<p>Who wishes to respond to Deputy O'Reilly's comments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017113000002#N02200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512054000,"counter":844,"content":"<p>We flagged in our opening statement that we have approval on resource to recruit 40 sonographers.

I do not have an exact figure, but we have a number of people in training at present.  However, even once we start to release the additional resource, those who have experience in the training relating to the dating scan will move on and start to receive anomaly scanning training.  We will increase capacity straight away in that respect.  Just getting that dedicated resource ring-fenced, subject to the approval of the service plan, is a big step forward from our perspective.  As the Deputy knows, it has been lobbied for for a long period.<\/p> <p>  Regarding her second question about the percentage of women not currently accessing the scan, our colleagues from Cork University Maternity Hospital in UCC did a study on this and they published the data in July, I believe.  There are currently seven units in which we provide 100% of women with access to a scan, seven units in which there is some access and five units in which there is no access.  In those units in which there is access, it is usually by clinical indication, and I am sure Dr. McKenna can talk to those kinds of clinical indications that may be appropriate for it.<\/p> <p>  I cannot remember the exact figure, but I think approximately 64% of women are offered the scan, so we have quite a distance to travel.  The 52 sonographers also carry out dating scans.  Not all of our 19 units provide every woman with a dating scan, so we have tried to spread the resource as best we can.  We are making anomaly scanning the priority for 2018.

The other is when the review mechanism is triggered.  I recall, in broad terms, the debates that took place when that legislation was passing through.  The policy rationale was that the HSE is obliged to create panels from which people are drawn in order to support the review process and especially to make sure that when individuals lodge review requests they get access to an opinion very quickly.  I believe that three days is the period of time as set out in the legislation, but I am subject to correction on that.  It is, however, a short period of time so the HSE has to have standing panels in place and a range of procedures.

However, there are several maternity strategy information systems in place.  There is a national mechanism through the centre for perinatal medicine in Cork and another through the national perinatal reporting system at a national level that gives us the ability to track and monitor relevant events.  The Irish maternity early warning system, IMEWS, which is a reporting system in regard to obstetric units, facilitates a monthly reporting arrangement.  As I said, patient safety statements are published.  All of those measures are geared towards increasing the transparency of activity and the awareness of risk in the environments in which obstetric practice takes place, with a view to increasing the speed of response.  The delivery of health care is not a risk-free enterprise.  None of the science, people or processes involved are perfect but we have to constantly ensure the systems are capable of learning from and responding to incidents and applying the benefits of that learning.  The delivery of maternity services is an area in which significant improvements are taking place, but none of the witnesses present would say that all of the risks that might exist has been fully and adequately eliminated.

This Supplementary Estimate arises mainly from the fact that this year, there have been more retirements than forecast under the pension scheme for established civil servants.  In addition, balances have been payable to former civil servants who retired in 2009 under the incentivised scheme for early retirement.  The pensions and lump sums that are paid under the pension schemes for established civil servants comprise just under 90% of total gross expenditure on the Superannuation and Retired Allowances Vote.  This means the main driver of the annual cost is the number of established civil servants who retire each year.  For various reasons, it is particularly difficult to estimate the number of retirements from one year to the next.  Most established civil servants may choose to retire within a five-year window between the ages of 60 and 65.  In addition, a number of people under the age of 60 retire each year under cost-neutral early retirement schemes or on grounds of ill health.  Each year, a number of former employees become eligible to claim a preserved pension entitlement.  The average lump sum and pension benefits that fall to be payable to new retirees in any given year vary depending on the grades and years of service of that specific cohort of retirees.<\/p> <p>  This year's gross Estimate for Vote 12 of &euro;539.9 million was based on a forecast of 1,320 retirements from the established scheme.  There have been 1,309 retirements to date this year.  This trend suggests there could be up to 250 more retirements by the end of the year.  The effect of this higher-than-forecast number of retirements has been to put upward pressure on subhead A4, which relates to pension lump sums.  As a general rule, for each person who retires, a once-off lump sum that is three times the size of that person's annual pension is paid.  Increases in retirement levels have a particular effect on subhead A4, which provides for the lump sum payments to established civil servants.  Therefore, subhead A4 is a key driver of variations in expenditure on the Vote in any given year.  So far this year, &euro;85.5 million has been expended from subhead A4, compared to the original full-year Estimate of &euro;90.4 million.  It is estimated that up to &euro;18.6 million will be further expended by the end of the year.  This would result in an overall projected excess of approximately &euro;13.7 million under subhead A4.  It is estimated that total gross expenditure on Vote 12 for 2017 may be approximately &euro;550.4 million, or approximately &euro;10.5 million in excess of the gross Estimate of &euro;539.9 million that was voted previously by the Oireachtas.  The committee should note that the level of the gross Supplementary Estimate being sought will be mitigated by anticipated increased levels of appropriations-in-aid.  It had been estimated that appropriations-in-aid for 2017 would be &euro;180 million and some &euro;159.8 million has been received to date.  Receipts with respect to the single public service pension scheme are ahead of profile so far this year.  Total appropriations-in-aid are now projected at &euro;184 million by the end of the year, or &euro;4 million more than expected.  This excess amount will act to reduce the net effect of the gross Supplementary Estimate.<\/p> <p>  The Supplementary Estimate of &euro;664,000 in respect of Vote 17 - Public Appointments Service - will bring the total 2017 Estimate for that Vote to &euro;12.044 million, which represents an increase of 5.8% on the original Estimate.  This reflects the higher-than-expected levels of activity to meet the recruitment and resourcing needs of the civil and wider public service in the light of the improving economy, the end of the recruitment moratorium, the ongoing process of public service reform and the need to build resource capacity and capability across the public service.  The committee should note that there are supplementary requirements under pay and non-pay costs within this Vote.  An additional &euro;196,000 on the pay side is requested to meet higher staffing costs this year as a direct consequence of the scale of additional recruitment and resourcing that the Public Appointments Service is required to oversee in 2017 in meeting its statutory obligations under the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004.  This funding will enable the Public Appointments Service to assign additional staff to recruitment and selection units and increase support to client Departments and offices.<\/p> <p>  A non-pay additional request of &euro;833,000 is as a direct consequence of increased recruitment costs associated with increased operational activity.  In 2015, the Public Appointments Service received 54,025 applications, interviewed 6,871 candidates and assigned 5,256 people to positions in the civil and public sector.  By the end of October of this year, 75,000 job applications had been processed, 13,000 candidates had been interviewed and over 8,000 people had been assigned to positions across the public service.  The total number of assignments may reach 9,500 by the end of the year.  The Public Appointments Service is legally obliged to undertake this recruitment activity, which results from Departments, offices and the wider public sector restoring capacity after the ending of the recruitment moratorium and preparing for the future challenges presented by a growing economy, rising public expectations, public service reform and demographic trends.  For reasons relating to the increase in the volume of recruitment activity, spending on interview boards, research and advertising and testing has been higher than expected this year.  The additional request of some &euro;1.03 million is offset by lower-than-anticipated capital investment spending this year for the Public Appointments Service of &euro;365,000 due to timing factors.  Therefore, the proposed Supplementary Estimate for the Public Appointments Service is &euro;664,000.<\/p> <p>  I am satisfied that approval of the Supplementary Estimate of &euro;6.5 million net for Vote 12 will confer the necessary legal authority to meet the pension entitlements of civil servants who are expected to retire up to the end of 2017.  I am happy that the approval of the Supplementary Estimate of &euro;664,000 for Vote 17 will enable the wider public service to restore capacity and prepare for the future challenges presented by a growing economy, rising public expectations, demographic trends and public service reform.  I commend both of these Supplementary Estimates to the committee.  I will be happy to answer the committee&rsquo;s questions on these Votes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017113000002#B00500","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1512034200,"counter":966,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

If so, are there any plans to make up for the retirements in that area?<\/p><p> I acknowledge that a substantial amount of work has been done by the Public Appointments Service this year.  It has filled a significant number of positions.  We have had ongoing conversations about human resources practices in the civil and public service that need to change to make it a more attractive place in which to work.  The Minister heard me speaking about this issue last night.  Flexibility is needed in the education and health care sectors to try to keep people in Ireland.  Is the Public Appointments Service investing in new human resources practices that would encourage new ways of looking at recruitment and new forms of contracts?  Pay is an issue, but other issues in public service contracts need to be addressed as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017113000002#B00600","speaker":"1335","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512034200,"counter":968,"content":"<p>I can respond to the Deputy's second point by saying that the work which needs to take place to overhaul and modernise human resources practices within our public and civil services needs to be led by a line Department.  While the Public Appointments Service will be doing various pieces of work in this area, I envisage that it will continue to focus most of its work on appointments and on selecting candidates for State boards.  I believe the work that is under way will deliver against the needs to which the Deputy refers.  The progress we are making in some of these areas is better than is sometimes acknowledged.  The 2017-2020 people strategy for the Civil Service is driven by the anticipation that up to 10,000 civil servants will retire in the coming years.  This feeds into the first question asked by the Deputy, which I will answer in a moment.  We need to look at ways of continuing to improve our efforts to give people structured career paths over which they have visibility.  Perhaps we have not been able to do this up to now.<\/p> <p>  I think we are making progress in two areas.  Figures have been presented to me to show that this is happening.  I can see it happening with my own eyes.  People are moving at different levels of our Civil Service between various Departments and agencies.  I am seeing far more mobility across Departments than I have seen at other times.  I see two other positive developments that are happening.  Higher levels of recruitment are now taking place within our Civil Service.  Over recent years, I have seen a real change in the experience of the people who are coming in.  When I attend engagements with broad groups within the Civil Service, I see a far broader diversity of age and experience than I would have seen in the middle of the previous D&aacute;il and Government.  I think the long-term effects of that will be very positive.<\/p> <p>  I am seeing growing evidence of our ability to meet expertise needs in areas of the Civil Service, such as the topical area of international taxation.  Our Departments and the Revenue Commissioners now have the ability to attract and recruit people who will work in the Civil Service or the Revenue Commissioners for a number of years before deciding to stay on or go back to the private sector.  We should acknowledge that this is a welcome and positive development and we should continue to support it over the coming years.  The important changes that have been made have resulted in higher levels of recruitment, more diversity among those who work in the Civil Service and greater opportunities for mobility from Department to Department.  As I have said, the people strategy for the Civil Service that is in place for the period up to 2020 looks at how we can deal with issues like mentoring and development as a way of reflecting the fact that the private sector is far more competitive than it has been in the past.  In the coming weeks, we will launch the Public Service 2020 plan, which is the next phase of public service reform and in which the Public Appointments Service will play a role.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's first question related to the variance in the number of retirements.  I am satisfied that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is doing everything it can to predict recruitment levels in order that those numbers can feed into the expenditure commitments we have each year.  We have a continual difficulty in anticipating when a group of people will retire.  It is understandable that we have to provide for lump sum payments in the year in which those payments are made.  This means that a small movement in either direction has an effect on our expenditure commitments for that year.  As I have said, there is a five-year window within which the majority of civil servants can choose to retire.  A curve in the demographics within our Civil Service, for want of a better phrase, is approaching us at the moment.  The number of people who are eligible for retirement will increase between now and 2021.  A small movement in the number of people who expect to retire will mean that we have to hand money back to other parts of the Department or to the Exchequer, or that we have to look for additional money from the Exchequer for the year in question.  Having said all of that, the total amount of money we are looking for from the Oireachtas this year is a gross Estimate of &euro;10.5 million from a total subhead of just under &euro;540 million.  I believe the variance is at a level I can stand over at this committee this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017113000002#C00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1512034200,"counter":969,"content":"<p>The Public Appointments Service manages recruitment to State boards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017113000002#C00300","speaker":"1335"},{"type":"speech","time":1512034200,"counter":970,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017113000002#C00400","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1512034200,"counter":971,"content":"<p>How many applications for positions on State boards have been received this year?

I hope this will happen before the end of the year.  Maybe I can come before the committee in January to highlight some of the good work that is under way.  It is understandable, particularly after the week we have had, that we all hear about the difficulties.  I would welcome an opportunity to highlight the significant amount of work of great value that is going on as we seek to continue to modernise what we do with our Civil Service.  I am dealing today with Vote 12, which relates to civil servants only.  I have seen no evidence to suggest that any particular cohort of civil servants in any part of the Civil Service is any different in this regard.<\/p> <p>  If the Deputy is asking about an area across all of Government that would be important to me in terms of how we account for it and plan for it better, I would mention teachers in that context.  In recent days, I have had to go to the Cabinet in quicker than anticipated circumstances to seek agreement to make additional provision for superannuation and pension payments for our teachers.<\/p><p>I have been struck by how the variance in respect of the number of teachers that are looking to retire and how we account for this is different from what I want to see in future.  Although the matter is not covered by this committee, I am keen to indicate the point.  It is something the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, and I will have to work on for next year.  We need to see how we can plan for it better.  We do not want to be in an adverse position.  If a teacher voluntarily decides to retire, then clearly that teacher has a legal commitment and an expectation that we will be in a position to meet his or her expectations.  I am keen to see how we can plan and account for this better in the coming years than we do at present.<\/p><p> The first question I was asked related to trends.  I will read out the details but I might circulate them in tabular format to the secretariat in order that the details can be shared in a better way with the committee.  I will set out the trends.  In 2015, we advertised 304 vacancies on State boards.  For that year, we received 4,699 applications.  Of those 4,699 applications some 916 were submitted to the Minister for consideration and of those in turn 206 led to appointments.  The figures are: 304 advertised, 4,699 applications received, 916 submitted to the Minister and 206 appointed.<\/p><p> I will share the figures for 2016 as well but the 2017 figures are not yet complete.  In 2016, the equivalent figures were: 2,598 applications received, 639 submitted to the Minister and 173 appointed.  The total number of vacancies advertised for that year was 163.  Those are the figures for 2015 and 2016.  I have figures for 2017 as well and I will share them with the committee, but the figures are not for the full year so I am not in a position to draw conclusions.<\/p><p> I was asked about the challenges, what is working well and what I think is not working well.  There has been a dramatic improvement in the diversity of applications.  The diversity of individuals who are being put before Ministers is significantly better than in previous years.  When I was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the work that had to go into identifying a diverse group of candidates to put on boards was significant and took a considerable amount of time.  Now, we have an organisation that will generate these applications.  It can find new ways for us to talk to new people about State board vacancies.  That represents a major improvement.<\/p><p> Something else has changed since then.  There is definitely a growing awareness among people who are looking to apply for these roles regarding their responsibility as well as the potential challenges and pitfalls in doing that work.  The profile of the roles has increased, as has the reputational benefits and consequences of such work going well for individuals or otherwise.  I attended an event recently for the Institute of Directors in Ireland.  I am doing another for the Institute of Public Administration before Christmas.  My role is to reinforce to people the obligations they have if they go on boards.  While it would not be fair to say yet that there is hesitancy in people applying for positions, it is fair to say that there is greater awareness of the responsibilities involved in being on these boards.  That is a good thing but it is something that we need to keep an eye on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017113000002#C00800","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512034200,"counter":976,"content":"<p>I wish to ask the Minister about superannuation and retired allowances.  My question relates to the restoration of the reductions that people took as a consequence of the economic collapse.  People, especially retired people, are extremely confused about how the restoration may affect them.  People may have retired at different times and, as a consequence, the rules are different.  I am seeking a people-friendly thing whereby someone can input the date of retirement and find out the particular scheme under which they retired.<\/p> <p>  It is important that people who retried before a certain date and before the changes took place are told that their situation is straightforward.  In other words, it is important to say that restoration follows the general principle of people who are working in the public service.<\/p> <p>  A situation has arisen whereby there is now evidently a labour shortage.  Large numbers of nurses and teachers opted to retire earlier than they might otherwise have retired because they feared that their pensions would be cut significantly.  At the same time, we have a difficulty in many schools in obtaining substitute teachers, especially in DEIS schools at primary and secondary level.<\/p> <p>  The Minister could have an influence in making the position clear to those who have retired but who may wish to offer themselves from time to time for substitute work, perhaps for a couple of days a week or for a couple of weeks at a time.  The question is how they can go about it.  We need to give the same information to principals.  I realise this is more a matter for the Minister of Education and Skills.  In any event, there is extensive confusion.  Many of those who retired early might well be interested in doing occasional work.  Some may well be interested in doing more than occasional work, were it to become available.  This arises in the context of the shortages now being experienced in different parts of the public services, but it is most evident in teaching and nursing.<\/p> <p>  I am seeking people-friendly information for people who have retired on how restoration will affect them.  In particular, I want the Minister to make clear to people who retired before or as the crisis began that they might have a straightforward situation.  I imagine the Minister has found that people are genuinely confused as well.  We get tables from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but they are extremely difficult to track and explain.  I realise it is a difficult communications issue but it is important for many people.<\/p> <p>  I represent a constituency where approximately 30% of the population were not born in Ireland or their parents were not born in Ireland.  I imagine Dublin Central, the Minister's constituency, is pretty much the same - the figures may not be as high as Dublin West but they are high nevertheless.  I found this question difficult when I was Minister, but the recruitment embargo was in place for most of that time and certainly up to the last year and a half.  At that point, gradually, we were able to get rid of it.  I do not find Polish people working in places in the public service in any significant number.  I do not find people from the Baltic states working there.  I do not find too many people from Africa or Asia working in the public service either.<\/p><p>As the Minister knows, these big population groups have immigrated into Ireland in recent years.  The Minister and everyone else accepts that gender diversity is really important, but I suggest that when the public service is looking at the issue of diversity, it should also focus on the representation of people who have come to live and work in Ireland, many of whom are quite highly qualified.  I know the Public Appointments Service has advertised in some international languages, but I do not know whether it has focused on the people about whom I am talking, many of whom have significant qualifications.  If they are without employment at the moment, with some appropriate training they might be able to make a career in the public service.  I see this being done in other European countries.  I do not see why we would not move towards the same tendency.  There are large numbers of students of international origin in many secondary schools, particularly in Dublin 15.  It is important for young Irish-European, Irish-African and Irish-Asian people who are planning what they might do for a living to have a sense that the public service is open to them as a career.  I suggest there would be merit in the Public Appointments Service offering career guidance information sessions to school-goers from an early stage to advise them on careers that are available and may be of interest to them.<\/p><p> I wish to ask about mobility within the public service.  My personal view is that one of the biggest problems with the HSE is the constant moving around of people in junior to senior executive positions.  Every time one has business to transact with the HSE, one finds that somebody else has moved into the position.  Does the Government have a policy in this regard?  When I served as Minister for Social Protection, I strongly advised against the adoption of a HSE-style constant rotation of officials that means people do not stay in their positions for very long, particularly as they make progress through promotions.  When an official is appointed to a particular area, he or she should be able to serve at least three years in that area.  It can be extremely difficult for clients to use the public service if there is constant rotation of staff.  This kind of rotation may also be difficult for some staff members.  If new people are arriving in and out all the time, it appears as though the place is in a constant state of flux.  This is a difficult issue because I appreciate that mobility is desirable on the one hand, but on the other hand the key thing is the service to the client or customer.  If we cannot stabilise service provision and ensure staff members feel confident they can provide a good service, it can be tricky.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017113000002#D00200","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512034200,"counter":978,"content":"<p>I remind members that the Minister has commitments in the D&aacute;il Chamber shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017113000002#E00200","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speech","time":1512034200,"counter":979,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for recognising that I have to take questions to the Minister for Finance in the Chamber at 10.30 a.m.  I agree with almost everything Deputy Burton has said.

Broadly, three different pension schemes are in operation for those who joined the public service up to 1995, those who joined between 1995 and the end of 2012 and those who have joined since the start of 2013.  The number of people retiring from the public service hit a particular peak across the crisis period.  They retired under a certain set of conditions because they correctly expected that if they stayed on longer into the period of difficulty we experienced, they would leave with lower levels of pension benefits.  It was decided to incentivise retirement as part of the efforts that were under way to deal with the immense difficulties at that time.  The simple answer I can give to the Deputy's questions on this matter is that we will look at how we can address it better.<\/p> <p>  The legislation that is currently in place means that by the time we get to next year, the public service pension reduction will be broadly eliminated in the case of someone who has a pension with a value of less than approximately &euro;34,000.  By the end of the agreement we have negotiated with representatives of employees in our civil and public service, the public service pension reduction will be eliminated in the case of someone who has a pension with an approximate value of &euro;50,000.  I do not have the Bill in front of me now.  I looked at it last night.  Perhaps the figure is closer to &euro;53,000 or &euro;54,000.  I will come back to the committee with all of that information.  By the time we reach that point in 2020, the vast majority of people who are in receipt of a pension will have their public service pension reduction completely eliminated.  We have already had a great deal of contact with the pensioners' representative organisations.  We have given them information to explain our plans.  Maybe we will share that information again after this morning's meeting.  Perhaps I will make a simple table explaining what is actually happening available to all Members of the Oireachtas, starting with the members of this committee, before Christmas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017113000002#E00500","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1512034200,"counter":982,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017113000002#E00600","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1512034200,"counter":983,"content":"<p>While I have explained what will happen by the end of 2020, of course the kind of amelioration a pensioner will get will depend on when he or she retired.  That is where the complication kicks in.  Broadly, by the end of 2020, anybody who has a pension of between &euro;50,000 and &euro;53,000 will have the public service pension reduction eliminated.  By the time we get to next year, anybody who has a pension of approximately &euro;34,500 will see the public service pension reduction eliminated.  I want to make a point about the average pension levels out there.  For reasons we are all familiar with, much of the public focus and debate tends to centre on higher-value pensions.  It is worth knowing that in 2017, the average pension paid to existing pensioners was &euro;23,800.  That is a very valuable pension in the context of the difficulties being experienced in private pension schemes and the status of those schemes, but it is very different from the figures mentioned in public debate, which tends to foster a belief that public sector pensions are worth multiples of that amount.  That is not the case.  It has to be recognised that the pension payments of people who are on the more recently established pension schemes will be co-ordinated.  They will get the non-contributory State pension and their pension payment on top of that.  This approach will be taken to get them to a certain level.  Unlike people who would have been in receipt of pensions up to 1995, they will not get their pension and the non-contributory State pension on top of it.  Both payments are combined to get retirees to a certain point.  When we were negotiating the current agreement, I was very conscious of the need to be aware of the reality of pension payments for people who are retired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017113000002#E00700","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1512034200,"counter":984,"content":"<p>Will the pre-1995 people continue to pay the universal social charge, the payment of which is a quibble for a number of them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017113000002#E00800","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1512034200,"counter":985,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017113000002#E00900","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1512034200,"counter":986,"content":"<p>How many of them are there approximately?

To address the two other points which the Deputy put to me, in respect of mobility I made the point earlier that I think it is improving.  It is not that I think that.  It is improving.  There must be a trade-off however.  We have to allow people to stay in a job long enough to build up the expertise needed to do that job before moving onto another assignment.  Each Government Department must put together a workforce plan to deal with matters like that.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the Deputy's point on our diverse population, only yesterday the Public Appointments Service gave a presentation in Trinity College on new ways in which we might recruit people from the new communities which form part of modern Ireland.  As we speak, the Public Appointments Service is seeking to change its website to make it more appropriate and understandable for those from the new communities to which the Deputy referred.  We have now started an outreach programme in secondary schools which will be implemented by PAS through career guidance teachers.  It focuses on the value and diversity of careers within the Civil Service.  All that is under way.  <\/p> <p>  I take a very positive view of the impact the diversity in our community is having and what it will mean for our economy in the future.  It is wonderful to think that in a few years' time we will have people working in the Civil Service whose mams and dads were born outside of our country, or who were themselves.  I can see it now at entry level.  I am beginning to see a change.  If one looks at the programme which will be on in schools in west Dublin and central Dublin, in a few year's time when the diversity we now have in our classrooms and colleges passes into employers, including our Civil Service, it will be a huge source of strength for Ireland.  I take a different view on that kind of diversity to that others in politics at the moment might take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017113000002#F00600","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Message to D\u00e1il","time":1512034200,"counter":992,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017113000002#F00650"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1512034200,"counter":993,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for assisting the committee in its consideration of the Supplementary Estimates.<br\/><br\/>In accordance with Standing Order 90, the following message will be sent to the D&aacute;il:<\/p><blockquote>The Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach has completed its consideration of the following Supplementary Estimates for public services for the year ending 31 December 2017: Vote 12 - Superannuation and Retired Allowances, and Vote 17 - Public Appointments Service.<\/blockquote> <p>Under Standing Order 89(2), the message is deemed to be the report of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017113000002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Acting Chairman"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1512034200,"counter":994,"content":"<p>The select committee adjourned at 10.25 a.m. sine die.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Select Committee on Justice and Equality","time":1512032400,"counter":995},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>The Select Committee met at 09:00<\/p><p>MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Deputy Colm Brophy, Deputy Charles Flanagan (Minister for Justice and Equality), Deputy Jack Chambers, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, Deputy Clare Daly, Deputy Mick Wallace.<\/p><p>In attendance: Deputy Donnchadh \u00d3 Laoghaire.<\/p><p>DEPUTY CAOIMHGH\u00cdN \u00d3 CAOL\u00c1IN IN THE CHAIR.<\/p>","time":1512032400,"counter":996,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017113000002"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Estimates for Public Services 2017<br \/>Vote 20 - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Supplementary)","time":1512032400,"counter":998,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017113000002#A00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1512032400,"counter":999,"content":"<p>I ask members to turn off their phones for the reasons that are often stated.

I thank the committee for making time available to consider the important Supplementary Estimate for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Vote.  A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;44.2 million is required in respect of the Garda Vote in 2017.  It is projected that there will be an underspend of at least &euro;25.5 million in the remaining seven Votes in the Justice and Equality group.  This will reduce the net additional Exchequer funding requirement to approximately &euro;18.7 million.<\/p> <p>  An additional &euro;50.4 million is being made available to meet payroll and overtime costs.  The additional requirement in respect of pay and allowances is &euro;8 million and the additional requirement in respect of overtime is &euro;42.4 million.  The increased overtime requirement relates directly to the measures taken to combat organised crime and other serious crime.  The costs associated with the implementation of the Labour Court agreement on Garda pay are also a contributory factor.  The partial offsetting of the additional requirement by underspends in other votes reflects the commitment given by the Department in meeting the partial cost of the Labour Court agreement for 2017.  It is expected that total expenditure on Garda overtime in 2017 will exceed &euro;130 million, which is unprecedented.  This compares with overtime expenditure of &euro;91 million in 2016, &euro;56 million in 2015 and &euro;37.7 million in 2014.  Budget 2018 provides for almost &euro;100 million in overtime next year.  Overtime worked in December will be paid from the 2018 budget rather than the 2017 Estimate, which we are discussing this morning.<\/p> <p>  There are additional requirements in a number of other administrative subheads, including travel and subsistence, expenses associated with road traffic policing, training and other expenses, maintenance of Garda premises and certain other station services.  These costs amount to almost &euro;12 million when offsetting underspends in other areas such as telecommunications services are taken into consideration.\u00a0 A further additional requirement of almost &euro;2.7 million arises under the communications and other equipment subhead.  This relates primarily to increased costs in respect of operational equipment, mainly in specialist areas such as the armed response units.<\/p> <p>  There are offsetting underspends in other areas within the Garda Vote, such as superannuation.  The underspend in this area can be attributed to a smaller than expected number of retirements.  In addition, there are surplus receipts\u00a0of approximately &euro;14 million.  The largest proportion of these receipts, by far, relates to a greater than envisaged number of pension-related deductions as a direct result of increased expenditure on pay and overtime.  This Supplementary Estimate will make these additional receipts available to offset a proportion of the overtime and payroll cost.<\/p> <p>  A further aspect of this process is the reallocation of an underspend of &euro;8 million in capital expenditure from the buildings subhead.  Some &euro;6.7 million is being reallocated to the area of information and communications technology, ICT, and a further &euro;1.3 million is being reallocated to the transport area.  The underspend relates to the timing of the completion of new Garda divisional and regional headquarters in the Kevin Street area of Dublin and in Galway.  These buildings will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2018, following the completion of the new divisional headquarters in Wexford in September of this year.  The additional budget allocated to ICT will ensure a total capital spend of over &euro;40 million in this area in 2017, including expenditure on a number of key systems such as rosters and duty management, investigations management and enterprise content management.  These projects are key components of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na modernisation and renewal programme.<\/p> <p>  The additional &euro;1.3 million for transport will bring expenditure on the Garda fleet to over &euro;5 million in 2017.  This follows expenditure of &euro;10 million in 2016, which allowed for the purchase of 462 vehicles.  I am pleased to say the Government's capital plan for the period from 2018 to 2021 provides for a further &euro;31 million for direct investment in the Garda fleet.  The additional amounts made available to ICT and transport in 2017 are bringing expenditure in these areas forward, in effect, with the corresponding budget being reassigned in 2018 to complete the building projects.  The utilisation of the capital budget in this manner ensures prudent use of available resources on a multi&ndash;year basis.<\/p> <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.\u00a0 The substantial increase in Garda numbers is a demonstration of tangible progress in achieving the Government's vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians working in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This continued high level of investment in the Garda workforce will ensure the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  A further 800 new Garda recruits will enter the Garda College in 2018.  An additional 500 civilians will be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and facilitate the redeployment of garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased to say this investment is yielding results in a number of successful Garda operations, such as Operation Hybrid, which will continue apace throughout 2018.  As of 31 October last, 71 arrests and 11 charges - three for related offences - have been brought in connection with gangland-related shootings.  In addition, 30 firearms have been seized and over 14,260 lines of inquiry have been conducted.<\/p><p>In the region of 44,500 high-visibility checkpoints have been implemented with significant support from the armed support units.  A significant amount of closed-circuit television footage, mobile phone traffic and forensic evidence is being examined.<\/p><p> Concentrated Garda actions against criminal gangs have been illustrated by a number of notable successes this year, with a series of very significant drug seizures, valued at over &euro;79.5 million.  This includes the huge haul of illegal cannabis valued at &euro;37.5 million seized at Dublin Port in January this year and, more recently, a significant seizure on 15 November valued at &euro;7 million.  Rural communities are also benefitting from the significant injection of policing resources provided by the Government and the concentrated initiatives, such as Operation Thor.  As part of the Garda approach, special targeted patrols are carried out with the assistance of the Garda national support services against criminals committing crime inter-regionally, including a focus on the use of the motorway network by criminal gangs, to disrupt and arrest those involved.  These initiatives have provided a most beneficial return in the Government's investment in resources and we will continue to back that up by strengthening the necessary legislative provisions where required to ensure the multifaceted response to crime in all its forms is maintained.<\/p><p> The underspends across the other seven Votes in the justice group has reduced the net additional Exchequer requirement for the Supplementary Estimate to approximately &euro;18.7 million.  The savings mainly arise in the Justice and Equality Vote, largely accounted for by payroll savings.  The full-year cost of additional recruitment during 2017 will not materialise until 2018.  There are underspends in a number of programme areas, including the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS.  I recommend this Supplementary Estimate for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Vote to the committee and I am happy to address queries that members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2017113000002#A00400","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512032400,"counter":1002,"content":"<p>I reiterate that we only have use of this committee room until 9.45 a.m.  As there are six members present, I propose a two-minute limit on every contribution.

Thankfully, we are gone beyond that and since the Garda College reopened, we have seen a total of 1,400 new Garda recruits, all of whom are now working across the country as fully fledged members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

It fits with the crisis in student accommodation throughout the country and low-income households using the one asset they have to get a bit of additional income.

I was in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  I will not elaborate on the amendment in view of the fact the section has already been dealt with.  I tabled the amendment because the working family payment was the Government's big idea.  We were told a lot of work was being done on it.  It was going to replace the family income supplement, which was heavily criticised in the Fine Gael election manifesto for some good reasons.  We now find that what has happened is the family income supplement has been reintroduced but has just been renamed the working family payment.  The Minister recognised in the course of her Second Stage contribution the family income supplement as it stands, or the working family payment if we want to call it that now, needs to be altered because there are obvious poverty traps.  It could be altered in a number of ways which, I would argue, would benefit the Exchequer rather than the Exchequer losing.  The Minister has indicated she will do some work on this anyway.  The purpose of the amendment was for the Minister to come back here with her proposals within the next three months in order that we can discuss them to see how they achieve the objective she no doubt desires for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017113000002#E01000","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1512052200,"counter":1103,"content":"<p>We are talking about something we cannot talk about because it is gone, but I do not have a problem coming back.

If and when we do make changes, I would like to be able to bring them back, suggest them and talk about them, and if committee members have enhancements to make to those changes, then let us work on them together.

I cannot give a definitive answer because it entirely depends on the recovery of the economy.

As I said yesterday, if all we were doing this year was giving a &euro;5 increase and that was it, the likelihood is it could have started much earlier in the year, but because there were a variety of other issues that we needed to address this year, such as lone parent income disregards and the fuel allowance, I could not justify it.  This is why we tried to give as much as possible as early as possible to everybody.  As the economy recovers, I hope I will get more money, assuming I am still here, and if we get more money we will be able to pay people earlier.  The Deputy is right that it should be 1 January.

This is why it is essential that an amendment be made with a timeframe to hold the Government to account to produce this report.  Extensive work has gone in to publishing it and in going through all the data, including paper and computerised records.  We need to see that report.  The measure has had an impact across the board for 42,000 older citizens and their entitlements to their contributory pension.  We know it has discriminated more against older women.  It needs to be changed.  This is where I disagree; we need the report and I do not believe we can wait until next years' budget.  Having listened to what has been said I hope it can be implemented sooner than that.<\/p> <p>  My amendment has left out a timeframe, other than it needs to be implemented straight away, but we need the report within a two-month timeframe.  The work has been done on it and we need to see the report but more importantly, we need the changes brought in.  There have been conflicting messages from the Government about this.  I touched on this at a previous committee meeting.  The Taoiseach is saying one thing about moving towards addressing the issue through total contributions in 2021 but the Minister is saying something completely different.  We need the report.  I hope the difference in opinion - real or otherwise - at Government level will not hold back the publication of the report.  It is essential because if there are conflicting thoughts on the issue at Government level, an amendment such as this built into the Social Welfare Bill will hold the Government to producing the report.  Much hope has built up over the last number of months.  The figure of 42,000 people has grown on a yearly basis.  This time last year it was 35,000 or 36,000 older citizens ad now it is up to 42,000.  We have not even touched on the issue of retrospective payment.  The longer this anomaly is left to go on, the more older citizens will be punished because of what I describe as the grotesque changes that were made in 2012 to the changes to the rates and bands.  I will push amendment No. 38 to hold the Government to account to produce this report and, more importantly, to account for what actions will be taken to reverse the 2012 changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017113000002#F00200","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1512052200,"counter":1114,"content":"<p>I went out last night to meet the women to whom Deputy Joan Collins referred.

If it is agreed there, which I have no doubt it will be, it will then go to the Cabinet.  The timeline is that it will go to the next Cabinet sub-committee and if that takes place before Christmas it will be then and if it does not happen before Christmas it will be straight afterwards.  As soon as that Cabinet sub-committee meeting has been held, I will bring it to the very next Cabinet meeting.  I cannot put a timeline on that because I do not control the Cabinet sub-committees, except to say they happen exceptionally regularly.  The Cabinet happens every week and the Cabinet sub-committee meetings are held at least once per month.  Without having to put down an amendment, I could probably commit to it definitely going to the next Cabinet sub-committee meeting and once it has been discussed there, it will go to Cabinet.  I must put in a caveat that to reaffirm what I have said all along, in order to not give false hope that we are discussing a resolution to the issue in this Bill - we are not.  To fix this issue is going to cost new money that does not exist in this Bill.

The Department did not have a budget of &euro;5 million and it was not a case of refusing people if we got to &euro;5 million.  If more people have a need for funeral expenses or any of the costs associated with bereavement, that is what we are there for.  The unexpected and unforeseen fits that category perfectly.  If we need some sort of campaign to let people the Deputy is dealing with know it is available to them, I am very happy to do that.<\/p> <p>  However, I am not happy to spend &euro;25 million or &euro;30 million to reintroduce it in the way it was, paying it to people who do not need it, thereby reducing the amount of money I have to spend on the people the Deputy is talking about.  I do not mean to be disrespectful to them.  I know they work hard, as does everybody, but the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is supposed to be helping the people who have absolutely no other means but social welfare to help them get through difficult times.  People who do not need it do not need the State to give them &euro;850.  That is my first gut feeling.<\/p> <p>  On the amendment, I am not even sure how I could compile the report the Deputy is requesting.  He seems to be asking me to go back to all the people who would have got the &euro;850 and ascertain how not getting it impacted them.  I am genuinely not sure how I would do that, irrespective of whether it is bound by a timeline.  I am not sure what I would be asking.  I ask the Deputy to consider withdrawing the amendment.  I would be happy for him to put in a suggestion that we should advertise in some way the supports that are genuinely available and to assure people there is no cap.<\/p> <p>  I believe Deputy Brady suggested that different criteria were being used in different areas.  That is the case because Deputy Brady's needs will not be the same as Deputy Collins's needs.  It is based on the individual's particular circumstances.  There is not a cap of &euro;100.  I do not want to sound shallow, but it is about the individual person or family and we address it on the basis of their requirements.

That is absurd.<\/p> <p>  I am afraid a campaign will not do the business.  There is no point in having a campaign.  The people I am talking about are already aware of the burial grant.

Unfortunately, we cannot propose changes which would have a financial impact on the Exchequer, but we know the issue of fuel poverty is very real and faces many people in our society.  A conservative estimate shows that approximately 28% of the population are currently facing fuel poverty.  Ireland has the highest level of excess winter fatalities in Europe.  Last year it was in the region of 2,800, which is a huge figure.  More than 170,000 of our older citizens rely on the fuel allowance.  Obviously fuel poverty does not only impact on our older citizens and also impacts on people right across the board, but older citizens are certainly more susceptible to the cold.  We all hear horror stories of our older citizens having to sit in public buildings such as libraries and council offices during the winter months to keep warm.  We all know of the changes which were made to the fuel allowance which cut the period for which the allowance was payable from 32 weeks down to 25.  It is back up to 27 weeks now, which is a small but welcome step in the right direction, but the period is still five weeks shorter than it was in 2012 when the cuts were first made.  It is a real issue and a very serious one which faces our citizens right across the board.<\/p><p>It is important that a full report is carried out on the impact, good, bad or indifferent, of cuts implemented to the fuel allowance and on how they affect our older citizens.  It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge and welcome the changes the Minister introduced in respect of the payment of the fuel allowance at this stage.  I put forward a proposal for a bulk payment during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill 2016, a proposal which was being pushed by organisations such as Age Action Ireland among others.  That has now been implemented and there are two payments a year.  That is a welcome step.  I hear good reports from people on that measure.  We are still a long way away from the provisions before the 2012 cuts which, as I have said, are having a real detrimental impact.  Some 28% of our population are facing fuel poverty.<\/p><p>That percentage is growing so we need a report on that issue.  I will be pressing the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017113000002#J00700","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1512052200,"counter":1177,"content":"<p>I support this amendment.  The cut, from six weeks initially to five weeks now, has put huge pressure on people.  Fuel poverty exists and it should be acknowledged and recorded for posterity, particularly when the big companies are talking about fuel increases in February or March next year, which will put further pressure on people.  We might consider the potential of having it index-linked to increases, but some progressive measure should be considered that would make a difference to people because that increase will impact on them.

I do not know if doing a report on the matter will bring any immediate improvements but I do not see any reason a report would not be done.  The Minister should give serious consideration to this amendment.  All it asks is that a report be done.  I know the Civil Service and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection are very busy but it is an issue that will have to be tackled across Departments.

The commitment I will give the Deputies is that if I am here next year, it will go up further.  I will probably have the legs cut off me, so to speak, for saying that because next year is next year but I say that because I cannot commit to doing a report as it does not fall within my remit.<\/p> <p>  However, a report entitled A Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty was released only last year.  Apparently, it covers ambitions and recommendations to follow through from 2016 to 2020.  It is a very comprehensive report and I can get the Deputies a copy of it if it would be helpful, not to be smart.  However, if the Deputy presses the amendment and I lose on it today and I have to compile a report, it will not be me or my Department that will compile it.  It will be the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  I then fall into a difficulty of the Deputy saying I have to have something done within three months when it will not be me who will be doing it but somebody else who will be doing it.  I ask that between now and Report Stage the Deputy might read the other report to see if he is happy with the suggestions and recommendations in it.

There are many reports available but having one carried out by whatever Department - it probably needs to be done across a number of Departments - is putting it on a statutory footing.  The recommendations it would make would put pressure on Government.  I am sure this committee and others will put pressure on Government to do it because the other reports are from agencies.  They are not actionable by Government.  It puts some pressure on but while we have had one week's restoration in the fuel allowance, it is staying at &euro;22.50 a week.  That has been static for many years.  We are still way behind where we should be because we see the cost of electricity, gas and solid fuel increasing.

The changes that were made to social welfare rates amount to age discrimination against young unemployed people.  I have pushed previous Ministers on this and the impact it is having.  In the context of housing and homelessness, the reduced payment is having a serious impact and I know that several agencies have made direct reference to that.  In the view of those working in the area, there is a direct link between the reduction in this payment and the prolonging of homelessness for some young people.  It is discrimination and we must call it for what it is.  I know the Minister will say that anyone who agrees to go onto any scheme will get an increase in his or her payment and that is fine.  However, the Minister's predecessor came out with some ludicrous comments at a committee meeting some time ago.  He said that he could not understand how young foreigners can get off a plane in Ireland and get a job at the drop of a hat and that this raises questions as to what our young unemployed people are doing.  I did not say that.  It was the previous Minister, now Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, who said it, or words to that effect.<\/p> <p>  The reality is that the youth unemployment rate is double the unemployment rate.  Some areas, including Arklow in County Wicklow in my own constituency, are youth unemployment black spots, with levels well above the national average.  Not only are we forcing people to continue living at home with their parents, we are also forcing them to live on buttons.  How someone has not taken a legal challenge to this is beyond me.  I believe it should be challenged and that such a challenge would be successful.  <\/p> <p>  I will certainly be supporting this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017113000002#L00700","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1512052200,"counter":1200,"content":"<p>I cannot accept this amendment, mainly because of the timescale involved.

Across the board, we are way behind on the level at which employers pay PRSI contributions.  If we came up to the EU average, it would be worth an extra &euro;8 billion a year.  There are huge issues facing us, including, obviously, the ticking time bomb in our pension system.  There are serious issues that we have to face up to here, so I will be supporting this amendment.  An extensive and very thorough piece of work needs to be done on all of this.  Hopefully, this will be the start, and I support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017113000002#N00200","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1512052200,"counter":1244,"content":"<p>Just a point of clarification, is the Deputy making a comparison of our rates of employer PRSI as opposed to those in other countries across the EU?  To make that comparison, would we not need a similar comparison of workers' rates of PRSI?  The employer and the employee pay PRSI.  What is important is the combined amount.  That comparison would be useful but we would need a comparison of both and not just the employer.  Employers' PRSI is low here by international standards, about which there is no doubt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017113000002#N00300","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1512052200,"counter":1245,"content":"<p>What is meant is the relative contributions of workers and employers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017113000002#N00400","speaker":"1299"},{"type":"speech","time":1512052200,"counter":1246,"content":"<p>I would be the first to support it if it was both.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017113000002#N00500","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1512052200,"counter":1247,"content":"<p>I am quite sure that members are going to make sure I have no Christmas given everything they want within three months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017113000002#N00600","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1512052200,"counter":1248,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1512052200,"counter":1249,"content":"<p>I will not be able to go for a pint.<\/p> <p>  We are currently conducting a review of the Social Insurance Fund.  We have got the actuarial review to tell us what the state of it is, and we will probably launch a public consultation on pensions and the automatic enrolment provision that we are hoping to go forward with, if not next Tuesday, then the following Tuesday.  The only reason I mention that is that employer contributions will match the employee contributions, and contributions will be taken automatically from both employers and employees once that comes on board.  That is a cost associated with the employers.<\/p> <p>  There is also a wider scoping exercise being done at the moment of social insurance contributions made by all classes, not just those of employees but of employers.  It is in the context of what the European norms are.  I totally agree that, based on European norms, we are much lower, both on employee contributions and employer contributions.  However, we also have to recognise that those in countries who pay more get much more out of it, because this would be a social insurance contribution.  It is not something that could be spent on health or education.  It would have to be spent on the employees.  The review is currently being done.  I indicated at the time of the actuarial review's publication that we would spend the next couple of months conducting that review.  Again, I will do some of what members have asked me to do, but I definitely cannot do it within three months because it just is not physically possible.<\/p> <p>  However, what I cannot agree to, apart from the three-month period specified in the amendment, is the provision requiring me to lay a report before the House on the proposals to increase employers' PRSI, because I do not yet know if we will or not.  I will not know that until we have the full picture of what we can get, what changes we need, and what future funding we need.  That will determine whether one's insurance contribution or one's employer's insurance contribution will be increased.  That piece of work is going to be done.  It has been started off the back of the actuarial review that we received at the end of October.  It will be done in the next couple of months, and once I have that report, I can certainly lay it before the joint Oireachtas committee.  However, it is only when I have that information that I will be able to determine how much everybody pays.  What will determine that is the amount that we will need to have a sustainable pension fund going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017113000002#N00800","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"vote","time":1512052200,"counter":1250,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 3; N\u00edl, 5.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p><\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017113000002#N00850","aye":["1252","1306","1299"],"nay":["1273","1298","1338","1331","1227"],"abs":[]},{"type":"speech","time":1512052200,"counter":1251,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 46, in the names of Deputies Br&iacute;d Smith, Gino Kenny and Richard Boyd Barrett, has been ruled out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017113000002#O00100","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1512052200,"counter":1252,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 46 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1512052200,"counter":1253,"content":"<p>Schedules 1 to 3, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1512052200,"counter":1254,"content":"<p>Title agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1512052200,"counter":1255,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and her officials for attending today's proceedings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017113000002#O00600","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1512052200,"counter":1256,"content":"<p>May I ask a question?
