This includes the Curlew, which has declined by 97% in Ireland since the late 1980s and needs substantial effort if it is to be saved from extinction as a breeding species here.  One of the main reasons for the declines of Curlew and other ground-nesting birds is excessive predation rates, including by members of the crow family, in particular Grey Crows and Magpies.  It is estimated that there are more than half a million of both species in Ireland, and that their population is artificially high.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of the conservation work carried out by my Department&rsquo;s National Parks and Wildlife Service, Magpies and Grey Crows are legally and humanely controlled, in a managed and localised way, to help protect rare and threatened species and to help them to rear their young.  Larsen traps are used as part of this effort for Curlew, Red-throated Diver, Red Grouse, Lapwing, Redshank, Snipe, Corncrake and other species where predation is judged to be a significant factor in their decline.  Traps can be used throughout the year, as appropriate, in response to threats to vulnerable ground-nesting species.<\/p>  <p>  The use of Larsen Traps complies with the provisions of the Wildlife Act 1976 (Approved Traps, Snares and Nets) Regulations 2003 (SI No. 620\/2003).  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700070#WRB03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts Council Funding","counter":107,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700070#WRB03800"},{"type":"question","counter":108,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[40729\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700070#WRB03900","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if her Department will support the Arts Council to move to a longer term funding model for smaller arts organisations as recently discussed in the media.","asker":"1271","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":109,"content":"<p>I understand that the Deputy may be referring to the new funding framework<i>(Making Great Art Work Funding Framework)<\/i>as recently announced by the Arts Council.

Speech and Language Therapy services are provided to these classes by the Health Service Executive (HSE). <\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), which is an independent statutory agency, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of additional special classes in various geographical areas, where a need has been identified.  The NCSE operates within the Department's criteria in allocating such support and applications meeting the criteria are approved by the NCSE.  Applications meeting the criteria are approved by the NCSE.  <\/p><p>The criteria for enrolment in a Special Class for pupils with SSLD are set out in my Department's Circular 0038\/2007.  A full-time teacher is assigned to each class, and classes operate with a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 7:1.  A minimum number of five eligible pupils is required for a school to retain a SSLD class.  Eligible pupils may spend up to two years in such classes.  An enhanced capitation grant is provided to schools operating special classes for pupils with SSLD.  In general, children who meet the criteria for enrolment in Special Classes for pupils with SSLD are eligible for free transport to the SSLD class nearest to his or her place of residence, subject to the terms of the school transport scheme.  <\/p><p>The NCSE continues to monitor and review the requirement for special class places in particular areas and has capacity to establish such new special classes where necessary, subject to the willingness of schools to open classes.  The NCSE welcomes expressions of interest from schools in opening special classes to meet the demand for special class provision.  In deciding on the location of a special class SENOs take into account both the present and the future potential need for special class provision and they must be satisfied that the special class is sustainable and appropriately located.  SENOs liaise with relevant professionals in their area to arrive at an informed decision.  The opening of a Speech and Language class is, however, contingent on the HSE being in a position to provide Speech and Language therapy to the students in the class.<\/p><p>The Report of the Special Education Review Committee, also known as the SERC Report, provides the basis on which my Department sets the criteria for special education supports for children with special educational needs including children with specific speech and language disorder (SSLD).  It is stated in the SERC Report that &lsquo;  <i>Pupils with specific speech and language disorders are those whose non-verbal ability is in the average range band or higher and whose skill in understanding or expressing themselves through the medium of spoken language is severely impaired.  Their disability is not attributable, however, to factors such as defective hearing, emotional or behavioural disorders or a physical condition.  The disorders may involve difficulty with one or more of the main components of communication through spoken language, receptive and\/or expressive, such as the patterning and production of speech sounds, the message content, the syntax and grammar, or the use of speech in interacting with other people.&rsquo;  <\/i><\/p><p>The criteria for specific speech and language disorder are set out in my Department in Circulars 08\/99, 08\/02 and 02\/05 and these criteria are consistent with the recommendations in the SERC Report.  Appendix 1 of Circular 02\/05 Organisation of Teaching Resources for Pupils who need additional Support in Mainstream Primary Schools states the following in relation to specific speech and language disorder:<\/p><p><i>- Such pupils should meet each of the following criteria:<\/i><\/p><p><i>- The pupil has been assessed by a psychologist on a standardised test of intelligence that places non-verbal or performance ability within the average range or above.<\/i><\/p><p><i>- The pupil has been assessed by a speech therapist on a standardised test of language development that places performance in one or more of the main areas of speech and language development at two standard deviations or more below the mean, or at agenerally equivalent level.<\/i><\/p><p><i>- The pupil&rsquo;s difficulties are not attributable to hearing impairment; where the pupil is affected to some degree by hearing impairment, the hearing threshold for the speech-related frequencies should be 40Db;<\/i><\/p><p><i>- Emotional and behavioural disorders or a physical disability are not considered to be primary causes.<\/i><\/p><p><i>- Pupils with speech and language delays and difficulties are not to be considered under this category.<\/i><\/p><p><i>- In the case of specific speech and language disorder it is a pupil's non-verbal or performance ability that must be within the average range or above. (i.e. non-verbal or performance IQ of 90, or above).<\/i><\/p><p><i>- The pupil must also have been assessed by a speech and language therapist and found to be at two or more standard deviations (S.D.) below the mean, or at a generally equivalent level (i.e. - 2 S.D. or below, at or below a standard score of 70) in one or more of the main areas of speech and language development.<\/i><\/p><p><i>Two assessments, a psychological assessment and a speech and language assessment are necessary in this case.&rdquo;<\/i><\/p><p>The enrolment of pupils in an SSLD special class is managed locally by an Admissions &amp;amp; Discharges Committee, comprising the Speech and Language Therapy Manager, Speech and Language Therapist, Class Teacher and Principal.<\/p><p>It should be noted that pupils who are not enrolled in a special class for SSLD and who meet the criteria for Specific Speech and Language Disorder, as outlined in Circular 0038\/2007, may qualify for additional teaching support under the School's Special Education Teaching Support provision, where he\/she is enrolled in a mainstream school.  <\/p><p>A new model for allocating support to pupils with special educational needs has been implemented from September 2017.  Circular 0013\/2017 for primary schools which was published on 7 March 2017 sets out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools.  The revised allocation model replaces the generalised allocation process at primary and post primary school level for learning support and high incidence special educational needs, and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocation process which provided additional resource teaching supports to schools, to support pupils assessed as having Low Incidence disabilities.  Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers have also been published; .  One of the benefits of this new approach is that schools will have greater flexibility as to how they will deploy their resources.<\/p><p>Pupils with Specific Speech and Language Disorder (SSLD) may, therefore, attend a special class for pupils with SSLD with speech and language therapy services provided in class by the HSE or attend a mainstream school with additional teaching supports and speech and language therapy through the primary care service.  <\/p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government states that a new model of In-School Speech and Language Therapy will be established.  It also contains a commitment to examine the adequacy of the present policies and provision, and their scope for improvement, particularly in relation to speech and language difficulties and early intervention.<\/p><p>A joint working group, made up of the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills, the Health Service Executive and the National Council for Special Education, has been established to develop the proposed model.  When finalised, the proposed model will represent a significant change in the way in which services are delivered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700071#WRC05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":181,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700071#WRC05600"},{"type":"question","counter":182,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[40879\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700071#WRC05700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the cost of improving the staffing schedule in primary schools to reduce class sizes by one point each year in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1353","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":183,"content":"<p>Budget 2017 represented the start of a major reinvestment in education, and the first phase of implementation of the Action Plan for Education, aimed at becoming the best education system in Europe within a decade.

Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school.  These students have the option, where appropriate, of full\/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.   <\/p>  <p>  My Department, therefore, provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools, which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs, in order to ensure that wherever a child is enrolled, s\/he will have access to an appropriate education.    <\/p>  <p>  My Department's SNA scheme is designed to provide recognised schools with additional adult support staff to cater for the care needs of pupils with disabilities in an educational context, where the nature of these care needs have been outlined in professional reports as being so significant that a pupil will require adult assistance in order to be able to attend school and to participate in education and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.  <\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE which is an independent statutory body) of which, its functions include planning and co-ordinating the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs in conjunction with schools and the Health Service Executive (HSE). The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports as required, including Special Need Assistance support as required.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support as set out in accordance with Circular 30 of 2014. <\/p>  <p>  Responsibility for deciding on the quantum of educational supports and resources to be allocated to schools to support individual pupils rests with the NCSE.  In making allocations to schools, the NCSE takes into account the assessed individual needs of all children with identified needs in the school.  It should be noted that SNA allocations are not made to individual children, but are made to schools to support the care needs of children with assessed special educational needs in the school.  <\/p>  <p>  An additional 975 SNA posts have been made available for allocation to schools from September 2017 which is a 7.5% increase to meet the demands for the new school year.  A total of 13,990 SNA posts are now available at a gross annual cost of &euro;458 million.  This is more SNAs than we have ever had previously and will ensure that all children who qualify for SNA support can continue to receive access to such support.  In total, the number of SNAs available has increased by over 32% since 2011, when 10,575 posts were available.  <\/p>  <p>  Details of SNA allocations which have been made to schools have been published by the NCSE on their website at www.ncse.ie.<\/p>  <p>  The organisation of supports within schools is a matter for each individual school to manage, taking into account each child's individual needs.

My Department will spend approximately &euro;232 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 430,000 customers.  <\/p>  <p>  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen significantly each year, as the number of eligible customers grew.  At the end of September 2013 there were almost 396,000 receiving the telephone allowance compared to approximately 316,000 people in 2007.  This was an increase of 25%, or an average increase of nearly 4% per annum. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is keenly aware of the impact of Budget decisions on the Department&rsquo;s clients, and strives to ensure that the money available is targeted in the most effective way.  In Budget 2016, the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years was given.  This increased the personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;222, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;233.30.  There was also a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.  <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, there was a further increase in the rate of State pensions by &euro;5, which has increased the maximum personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;227, and of the maximum rate of the contributory pension to &euro;238.30.  <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, over the past two Budgets, the maximum weekly rate for State Pensions has increased by &euro;8 per week, along with pro-rata increases for Increases for Qualified Adults.
