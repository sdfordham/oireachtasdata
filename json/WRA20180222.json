I have travelled throughout the country to meet childcare providers within their own services, to meet City and County Childcare Committees and to speak first hand to childcare providers, parents and to children. <\/p>  <p>  On becoming Minister I established the National Early Years Forum, at which issues arising in the sector can be raised and discussed face to face. This helps\u00a0better communication and engagement and fosters improved policy and decision making. The Early Years Forum\u00a0consists\u00a0of representatives of childcare providers and staff, academic experts in early years care and education and advocacy groups\u00a0from across the sector. The Forum met before and after Budget 2018 and is due to meet again on March 7th. <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of measures\u00a0last September to make childcare more affordable were preceded by a national road show of information sessions. These events were attended by more than 1,000 childcare practitioners and offered information to the sector, as well as providing an opportunity for feedback to my Department. I intend to arrange similar events again in the future. <\/p>  <p>  Focused working groups, made up of\u00a0representatives from the early years sector, are a regular feature of\u00a0my Department's work. Notably, the development of the Affordable Childcare Scheme is being informed by both\u00a0a Business and Systems Working Group and a Communications Consultative Group. Both groups\u00a0have met on numerous occasions to discuss aspects of how the scheme will operate when launched and offer the sector an opportunity to shape the scheme's design and its roll-out. <\/p>  <p>  I have met with representatives of most, if not\u00a0all, of the national\u00a0childcare representative bodies in the country to hear first hand the issues they are experiencing and their proposals for improvement. I also established and have met with an Expert Group tasked with reporting on the future of child-minding\u00a0in Ireland.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Childcare providers are represented on\u00a0my Department's\u00a0Steering Group for the implementation of the Access and Inclusion Model, or AIM as it is known,\u00a0which supports children with disabilities in the ECCE scheme and the early years service they attend.<\/p>  <p>  I am delighted that my Departmental childcare team\u00a0has been strengthened by the secondment of\u00a0four staff from various childcare organisations around the country to assist us with our work. The expertise and experience of these\u00a0staff complements the work of officials in considering policy and operational matters.<\/p>  <p>  A plan to address the communications needs associated with the forthcoming\u00a0Affordable Childcare Scheme has been finalised and work is underway for similar strategies to be developed for the Early Years Division of my department.

The grading is carried out by a high-level independent panel, comprising some of Ireland's leading experts in children's rights, child law, education, early years and from the trade union sector.

The 2018 report acknowledges progress made and the Government&rsquo;s efforts to improve the lives of children in Ireland.  The report rightly highlights the continuing impact of the homelessness crisis on the lives of children.  I absolutely acknowledge that homelessness is an extremely distressing experience, and that any medium to long-term period living in a hotel or other emergency accommodation seriously impacts on normal family life and is particularly detrimental to children. <\/p>  <p>  While the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has the ultimate responsibility for managing homelessness, my Department is working closely with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, to provide ongoing supports for families in emergency accommodation in order to mitigate the challenges faced by parents and children in this situation. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, works together with other statutory and voluntary agencies to provide services and supports to children, young people and families experiencing homelessness.  In my own Department, I have introduced free childcare for the children of families experiencing homelessness.  I am happy to say that the families of an additional 196 children are currently availing of childcare under this scheme, while some families were already eligible under existing schemes.  As part of the scheme a daily meal is provided for each child. <\/p>  <p>  Actions taken by Tusla include the provision of funding for child support workers and the appointment of a Homelessness Liaison Officer.<\/p>  <p>  Family Resource Centres, part funded by Tusla, are working with families who are experiencing homelessness and many have developed local responses to the needs of children and families in emergency accommodation.  These include, by way of example, family fun days, homework support, after school programmes, play therapy and transport services. <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the difficulties associated with homelessness and school attendance, Tusla&rsquo;s Educational Welfare Service offers a number of supports to children (and families) experiencing homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s joint protocol with the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) covers child welfare and protection matters for children in emergency accommodation.  It is fully operational in the DRHE areas and it is intended to replicate this protocol across the State. A Joint Working Protocol has been signed between Tusla and Galway City Council. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the DRHE is coordinating the development of a comprehensive National Quality Standards Framework for homeless services on behalf of all housing authorities.\u00a0 Consultation with service users and key stakeholders, including Tusla, has been undertaken and the draft standards have been piloted in selected services.\u00a0 These standards, including a child safety element which will provide homeless services with a framework for continuous quality improvement, will be implemented nationally. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that Tusla only intervenes in family life in exceptional circumstances. Children who are with their families in emergency accommodation remain in the care of their parents or guardians.  Where Tusla has concerns regarding the welfare and development of any child they will provide family supports to assist that family and child.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, my concern is that we minimise and then eliminate the problem of homelessness. In the meantime, I will continue to support measures to help those affected, to the greatest degree possible within my area of responsibility.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200049#WRA04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":51,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200049#WRA05000"},{"type":"question","counter":52,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[9005\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200049#WRA05100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to make funding available to individual electoral areas for the purposes of playground provision instead of general allocation to local authorities which may overlook areas that have yet to secure funding for such investment.","asker":"1276","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":53,"content":"<p>The DCYA capital grant funding scheme for play and recreation provides capital funding to support new and existing play and recreation facilities for children and young people.

CCS is a childcare programme targeted to support parents on a low income to avail of reduced childcare costs. ASCC is designed to support parents on eligible training courses, as well as certain categories of parents returning to work, by providing subsidised childcare places. Eligible children must be under 15 years of age to avail of these supports. Last September, I increased significantly the subsidy paid under CCS to make it more attractive for low income families. <\/p>  <p>  An annual survey conducted by Pobal on my Department's behalf suggests that supply of childcare places currently broadly matches demand. My Department is committed to keeping capacity in the sector under review and Pobal will commence this year's survey in the coming months. Staff from thirty City and County Childcare Committees are available across the country to assist parents who may have difficulty in meeting their childcare needs.<\/p>  <p>  In May 2016 the Programme for a Partnership Government committed my Department to &ldquo;introduce a new system to support and expand quality afterschool care for school-aged children&rdquo; . Section 8 of the Programme for a Partnership Government also committed to &ldquo;utilise our primary school buildings for afterschool care provision for school age children to offer more options and flexibility to parents. We will link additional capitation to the provision of buildings for afterschool care, where demand exists. Community groups and private providers will be invited to tender to use school facilities (outside school hours).&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  In Section 10, there is another relevant commitment. &ldquo;Schools buildings must be utilised out of hours if they are to remain at the centre of communities into the future, both throughout the day and throughout the year, including better utilisation of information technology.\u00a0 Afterschool care, homework clubs and other community activities should be permissible.\u00a0 Additional capitation funding will be linked to the availability of afterschool care options, where demand exists.&rdquo; \u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My Department chaired a group with the Department of\u00a0Education and Skills to progress those commitments in a coherent way and to align relevant bodies of work under our respective areas of responsibility.

The Department of Education and Skills has published guidelines to assist school authorities consider how their premises might be utilised for SAC and other activities where it can be facilitated by the school patron\/trustees. My Department has provided capital grants for the development of Early Years and School-Age Childcare services and uptake has been very high. <\/p>  <p>  Youth Groups might well decide to provide school-age childcare or other services, although to date evidence of this is limited.

The Taoiseach and I met with Sinn F&eacute;in on Monday and we are also keeping in contact with the other parties.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s firm position is that the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent Agreements must be implemented in full, and in this context the Taoiseach and I have been clear that the Government does not want to see the introduction of direct rule in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, the British and Irish Governments have an obligation to uphold and protect the letter and spirit of that Agreement, and we will also be considering how best to do so in the current situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200050#WRB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":95,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200050#WRB01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Medical Certificates Eligibility","counter":94,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200050#WRB01100"},{"type":"question","counter":95,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[9204\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200050#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to improve the criteria for persons wishing to avail of the primary medical certificate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":96,"content":"<p>The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme provides relief from VAT and VRT\u00a0on the purchase of an adapted car for transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities, payment of a fuel grant, and an exemption from Motor Tax. <\/p><p>To qualify for the Scheme an applicant must be in possession of a Primary Medical Certificate.

By contrast, inflation in the euro area as a whole, on a HICP basis, averaged 1.5 per cent last year.<\/p>  <p>  Inflation is not, therefore, a short-term risk at present.

Further, price pressures in Ireland remain subdued, with overall annual inflation as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) averaging just 0.3 per cent last year, the fifth consecutive year of inflation below 1 per cent. <\/p>  <p>  Forecasts published with Budget 2018 envisage the HICP reaching 2 per cent per year by the end of the forecast horizon in 2021, broadly consistent with the ECB&rsquo;s target. The Budget 2018 forecasts do not extend beyond 2021. However, the National Development Plan 2018 &ndash; 2027 (NDP 2018 - 2027) assumed 2 per cent inflation (GNI* deflator) over the period 2018 &ndash; 2027 which is consistent with long term growth forecasts\u00a0 for the Irish economy produced by international organisations.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the current slack in the economy, with the labour market approaching full employment, stronger than assumed growth could lead to overheating pressures. While increased public investment through the NDP 2018 - 2027 could potentially contribute to this, it is important to recognise that the plan is focused on rectifying the relatively low levels of public capital investment in Ireland following the recent recession. <\/p>  <p>  In fact, the NDP 2018 - 2027 is targeted at reducing overheating risks by increasing the economy&rsquo;s potential growth rate and alleviating capacity constraints. Notwithstanding this, the NDP 2018 &ndash; 2027 recognises the dangers that increased public investment could contribute to overheating if the pace of implementation was inappropriate for the cyclical position of the economy. However, the NDP 2018 &ndash; 2027 adopts a prudent and measured approach to increasing public capital spending. Under the NDP 2018 &ndash; 2027 it is projected that public capital investment will reach 3.8% of national income (GNI*) in 2021 and 4% by 2024, with sustained investment averaging 4% on an annual basis over the period 2022 to 2027.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there are a number of other steps that will be taken to mitigate overheating risks and negate the possible need to defer major capital projects owing to overheating risks:<\/p>  <p>  - The increase in public capital spending will be consistent with overall fiscal objectives.<\/p>  <p>  - The growth in public capital spending will be at a planned and moderate rate which does not outstrip the pace of the supply response feasible from the broad construction sector.<\/p>  <p>  - Increased public capital spending will be aligned with sustainable growth in public expenditure overall by ensuring the continuation of moderate and prudent growth in current spending.<\/p>  <p>  - There will be a renewed strategic focus on supporting the strengthening of the capacity, capability and degree of competition of the domestic construction sector in Ireland as well as on encouraging and promoting market entry from abroad by confirming and highlighting the planned scale of Ireland&rsquo;s public capital investment plans.<\/p>  <p>  - As detailed in the National Development Plan, a Construction Sector Working Group will be established to ensure regular and open dialogue between Government and the construction sector.<\/p>  <p>  The NDP 2018-2027 will be implemented in the context of broader government fiscal policy, which is to maintain a fiscal stance which is appropriate to the cyclical position of the economy, while targeting a continuing reduction in our debt burden. <\/p>  <p>  I have emphasised on a number of occasions the importance of ensuring that Budgetary policy does not contribute to overheating pressures in the economy and that the pro-cyclical polices of the past are not repeated and this is reflected in the NDP 2018 &ndash; 2027. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200050#WRB04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Stability and Growth Pact","counter":123,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200050#WRB04200"},{"type":"question","counter":124,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[9090\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200050#WRB04300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the expectation of the structural balance under the stability and growth pact for 2018 in view of the announcement of the national development plan 2018 to 2027;

Since 1 January 2016, section 43 of the 1997 Act\u00a0provides that the Central Bank may prescribe investments in which a credit union may invest its funds.<\/p>  <p>  Following engagement with the credit union sector on proposals for credit unions to provide funding for the provision of social housing, the Central Bank undertook a review of the investment framework for credit unions in 2017. This review resulted in the publication of Consultation Paper 109 (CP109) which consulted on potential changes to the investment framework for credit unions. One of the proposals in CP109 was that credit unions be permitted to provide funding for the provision of social housing to Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). <\/p>  <p>  Submissions to CP109 were broadly supportive of credit unions providing funding to Tier 3 AHBs with a significant number of those in favour citing the alignment of the social goals of both the credit union movement and the AHB sector as the principal rationale for permitting this type of investment. <\/p>  <p>  Taking account of the feedback provided to CP109, on 1 February 2018 the Central Bank outlined that it intends to proceed with the addition of investment in Tier 3 AHBs as a permitted investment class for credit unions. Regulations giving effect to this change, will be commenced on 1 March 2018. From this date, credit unions will be permitted to provide funding to Tier 3 AHBs for the provision of social housing. The maximum permitted investment amount per credit union is 50% of regulatory reserves where a credit union has total assets of at least &euro;100 million and 25% of regulatory reserves for all other credit unions. These limits may facilitate a combined sector investment in Tier 3 AHBs of close to &euro;700 million. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank is open to considering further investment proposals. As was the case with proposals around credit unions investing in social housing, where the Central Bank receives detailed proposals which can demonstrate that an investment could fall within the appropriate risk profile for credit union investments, it will consider further amendments to the investment regulations to facilitate such investments in the future. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has committed to undertaking and publishing analysis of credit union sector investments, two years post commencement of the amending investment regulations for credit unions, to assess and analyse the actual impact which the changes to the investment regulations have had.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200050#WRB04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cycle to Work Scheme","counter":130,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200050#WRB05000"},{"type":"question","counter":131,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[9103\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200050#WRB05100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to extend the cycle to work scheme to self employed persons and those that self-assess their taxes; the estimated cost of such an extension; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":132,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[9104\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200050#WRB05200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to increase the allowance under the cycle to work scheme for those purchasing e-bikes; the estimated cost of such an extension; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":133,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 57 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Cycle to Work Scheme exempts (from income tax, employee PRSI and USC) the benefit-in-kind (BIK) arising from the provision of a bicycle \/ cycle safety equipment by an employer to an employee (or director), where the bicycle is used by the employee to cycle to and from work or between workplaces. <\/p>  <p>  I have no plans to amend the Scheme as suggested since the concept of BIK does not arise in the case of the self-employed.

Much of this portfolio is secured by low-value, granular assets and realisation of its full market value over the next three years will require patient and extensive work on the part of NAMA. It is through the successful completion of its deleveraging, Docklands and residential funding programmes that NAMA currently projects a surplus in the region of &euro;3bn to be returned to the State once it completes it work. As per section 60(2) of the NAMA Act 2009, NAMA may use surplus funds to redeem and cancel its senior and subordinated debt. Surplus funds may only be returned to the Central Fund once NAMA's debt has been redeemed in full.<\/p><p>Any NAMA surplus paid, while Exchequer positive, will not impact the general government balance, in line with Eurostat rules. It will be a decision for the Government as to how any surplus returned by NAMA will be utilised within the framework of the fiscal rules.<\/p><p>NAMA was mandated in late 2009 to deal expeditiously with its acquired loan portfolio and to extract best value from that portfolio. NAMA has been extremely successful in achieving this mandate and has now entered into the final phase of this work which involves completing its remaining deleveraging activity and implementing its residential delivery programme and Dublin Docklands SDZ programme. <\/p><p>As such I do not intend to extend the current remit of NAMA beyond its expected completion in 2020 and in line with its original approval from the EU Commission I February 2010.

ten National Strategic Outcomes (NSOs) detailed in the\u00a0NPF which are critical to long-term economic, social and environmental sustainability in the period to 2040.\u00a0 Investment in urban and rural regeneration and development, drawing on two new Funds\u00a0with total resources of &euro;3 billion established for this purpose have the potential to have a transformative impact on\u00a0both urban and rural areas and communities countrywide.\u00a0 The sharp focus in the NDP on measures to strengthen the all-island\u00a0economy have a vital role\u00a0to play in mitigating the risks and realising the opportunities created by the UK's exit from the EU.\u00a0 A core priority under the NPF which is supported by the investment plans in the NDP is the essential requirement to enhance and upgrade accessibility between urban centres of population and their regions, particularly in relation to road linkages to the North-West from Dublin which, the NDP notes, have been comparatively neglected until recently.\u00a0 Total funding of &euro;8.8 billion is allocated to the NSO of strengthened rural economies and communities which is a cornerstone of NDP, including in relation to the delivery of the National Broadband Plan and significant investment in regional and local roads.\u00a0 The NDP also contains, as a priority, increased investment in public transport including train fleets.\u00a0 Chapter 5 of the\u00a0NDP details\u00a0as a\u00a0fundamental objective of the Plan the investment planned in enhancing regional growth potential through an integrated programme of measures including, for example, regional sectoral clustering and the promotion of\u00a0entrepreneurship on a regional basis.\u00a0 The Plan also highlights the importance of strengthening Ireland's international connectivity through continued investment in ports and airports, including under the Regional Airports Programme.\u00a0 It sets out the major programme of investment planned in the heritage area including\u00a0in\u00a0national parks and nature reserves.\u00a0 Continued investment over the ten years of the Plan to ensure the\u00a0sustainable management of water resources is a further investment priority which is clearly relevant to all regions and counties.\u00a0 Finally the Plan sets out the investments planned in the areas of quality childcare, education and health services which are a defining characteristic of attractive, successful and competitive places. <\/p>  <p>  Under the NPF and as set out in section 6.3 of the NDP\u00a0the three Regional\u00a0Assemblies are\u00a0now tasked with\u00a0co-ordinating, promoting and supporting the strategic planning and sustainable development of their regions, consistent with the objectives of

The 2% real growth assumption for 2022 to 2027 is supplemented with the conventional assumption that inflation will average 2% in line with the upper limit of the ECB&rsquo;s inflation target yielding a 4% nominal growth projection over the period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200051#WRC04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Development Plan","counter":183,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200051#WRC04700"},{"type":"question","counter":184,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[9088\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200051#WRC04800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council was consulted in relation to the &euro;116 billion announced in the national development plan 2018 to 2027; if so, the details of the consultation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":185,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[9225\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200051#WRC04900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if the National Treasury Management Agency was consulted in relation to the &euro;116 billion announced in the national development plan 2018 to 2027; if so, the details of the consultations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":186,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[9226\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200051#WRC05000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if the European Commission Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs was consulted in relation to the &euro;116 billion announced in the national development plan 2018 to 2027; if so, the details of the consultations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":187,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74, 79 and 80 together.<\/p><p>The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC) is an independent statutory body whose purpose is to provide an independent assessment of official budgetary forecasts and proposed fiscal policy objectives. While my Department did not consult with the IFAC in relation to the National Development Plan, IFAC's broad support for the Government's proposed approach to increased public capital investment, in its November 2017 Fiscal Assessment Report, was noted, as follows: <\/p><p><i>&quot;Having been scaled back to a low base, public investment levels are expected to ramp up quite rapidly again, rising to levels that are among the highest in the EU under current plans. For instance, by 2021, public investment is planned to rise to 9.8 per cent of primary spending; 8.9 per cent of total revenue; and 3.5 per cent of GNI*. Across all measures, this would be higher than present levels for countries such as France, the Netherlands, Germany and the UK as well as for the EU and Euro Area aggregates. Importantly, this is possible while still complying with the fiscal rules in later years. &quot; <\/i><\/p><p><i>&quot;A commitment to stick to a specified level of public investment as a share of GNI* would be a sensible basis for fiscal policy over the medium term.If adhered to, this approach could help to prevent forced cuts to public investment in downturns and excessive expansions in investment during booms the preparation of the National Development Plan.&quot;<\/i><\/p><p>My Department consulted with the National Treasury Management Agency in connection with a number of the roles performed by that Agency, including:<\/p><p>- NewERA, in relation to the commercial State sector element of the National Development Plan;<\/p><p>- the National Development Finance Agency, as a member of the Expert Group reviewing the potential role for PPPs in helping to deliver elements of the Plan; and<\/p><p>- the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, in relation to the role that the Fund could play in leveraging additional private investment to complement State-backed investment under the Plan.<\/p><p>In addition, of course, acting as the National Development Finance Agency, the National Treasury Management Agency is the statutory financial advisor to State authorities in respect of all public investment projects with a capital value over &euro;20 million.  The Agency will therefore continue to be consulted by the relevant Departments and Agencies in relation to all projects of this value that have been included in the National Development Plan, as required in accordance with the Public Spending Code.<\/p><p>With regard to the question of consultation with the European Commission Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, the position is that the Government engages with that Directorate General on a regular basis, through the framework as established by the European Semester. This engagement has dealt with issues related to capital expenditure on a number of occasions in recent times:<\/p><p>- In July 2016 the European Commission made the Country Specific Recommendation that Ireland should prioritise government capital expenditure in public infrastructure, in particular transport, water services and housing.<\/p><p>- In February 2017 the European Commission subsequently commented in the Country Report for Ireland that some progress had been made in prioritising government capital expenditure.<\/p><p>- In July 2017 the European Commission made the following Country Specific Recommendation:<\/p><p><i>&quot;Better target government expenditure, by prioritising public investment in transport, water services, and innovation in particular in support of SMEs. Enhance social infrastructure, including social housing and quality childcare; deliver an integrated package of activation policies to increase employment prospects of low-skilled people and to address low work intensity of households.&quot;<\/i><\/p><p>The National Development Plan seeks to address these issues by increasing investment levels in Ireland at a sustainable rate to amongst the highest in Europe and, very importantly, by ensuring that our infrastructure investment will be strictly guided by the National Planning Framework and its 10 National Strategic Outcomes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200051#WRC05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works Projects","counter":188,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200051#WRC05113"},{"type":"question","counter":189,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[9133\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200051#WRC05125","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the timeframe for the planned extension to Longford town Garda station.

It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to assess that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process.<\/p>  <p>  Public bodies are required to reject a tender where it can be established that it is abnormally low because it does not meet with the obligations imposed by environmental, social and labour law. <\/p>  <p>  Once awarded, the conditions of the public works contracts require the contractor to certify compliance with employment law, to maintain records of all those employed on the site, regardless of whether they are employees of the contractor or their subcontractors, and the hours worked by them.  Where requested, the contractor must also provide details of the payments made to those employed on the site. Where the contractor fails to comply with their obligations under the contract or employment law, deductions may be made from payments due under the contract until the situation is rectified.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that employment law and its enforcement, in both public and private contracts, is a matter for the relevant State authorities, including the Workplace Relations Commission and the Departments of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Employment Affairs and Social Protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200052#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":227,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200052#WRD02300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Establishment","counter":226,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200052#WRD02200"},{"type":"question","counter":227,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[9044\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200052#WRD02300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to progress the opening of a school (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":228,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, I have\u00a0announced\u00a0new plans aimed at accelerating the provision of multi-denominational and non-denominational schools across the country, in line with the choices of parents, families and school communities and the Programme for Government commitment to reach 400 such schools by 2030.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I would point out that the previous model of divestment yielded only a very limited number of schools for transfer to multi-denominational patrons (10 since 2013).\u00a0 I believe that the new schools reconfiguration for diversity process has the potential to significantly increase patron diversity in our school system. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While these new structures are being introduced, my Department will continue to work with the main stakeholders to progress delivery of diversity in areas already identified (of which Killarney is one), in 2018 and beyond.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200052#WRD02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Eligibility","counter":229,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200052#WRD02500"},{"type":"question","counter":230,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[9100\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200052#WRD02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the period of time which a person can receive a SUSI grant as a postgraduate (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":231,"content":"<p>Under the Student Grant Scheme grant aid for postgraduate study is limited to a maximum of four years in total.

In that regard, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to publish new school admissions legislation taking into account current draft proposals. <\/p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill includes a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school's arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction.  I believe this is an important measure which will help ensure transparency from the outset as to how a school will uphold the rights of parents in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore another crucial way of dealing with this issue is to provide additional choice to parents and in this regard the Programme for Government includes a commitment to increasing the rate of provision of multi-denominational schools reaching 400 by 2030.<\/p>  <p>  This is not to say that schools are currently doing nothing when they receive such requests from parents or that there is no advice for schools available.

This work is also informed by ongoing stakeholder engagement.  Separately, a new preparedness unit in the Commission is considering EU-level responses. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  All this work provides a baseline scenario for the policies and sectors impacted, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations.  In this regard, it is welcome that the direction of travel is now firmly towards achieving a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition period.\u00a0 Agreement on a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition will provide certainty to individuals and businesses while also aiming to avoid any cliff edge effects between the UK leaving the EU and a future relationship agreement coming into force.  The period will provide time for businesses and citizenship, as well as Government agencies, to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU based on the outcome of the negotiations on the framework for the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK.  In this respect, the expectation is that the European Council will adopt additional Guidelines at its meeting on 22-23 March 2018 on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.  These guidelines &ndash; as well as further clarity on the UK position, which has been sought by the European Council - will provide a clearer picture of the direction of travel in the negotiations.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the question of the border, the Common Travel Area is an important feature of the close relationship between Ireland and the UK with long-established benefits for trade and tourism between our two countries.  Both the Irish and UK Governments have publicly declared their commitment to maintaining the CTA and to ensuring no return to a so-called 'hard border' on the island of Ireland.\u00a0 The UK&rsquo;s commitment to avoiding a hard border was restated as part of the agreement to move to phase 2 of the Brexit negotiations in December.\u00a0 The Government&rsquo;s commitment to that outcome could not be clearer.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  An extensive programme of engagement has been put in place to support this strategic objective.  The importance of the CTA has been highlighted through political and diplomatic engagement with other Member States.  There is ongoing engagement with EU institutions and there is regular contact with the European Commission negotiating team on the UK exit from the EU, including in relation to the specific question of the Common Travel Area. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The practical impact of Brexit on the operation of the CTA is being considered between officials of\u00a0my Department and the UK Home Office, including at meetings of the Common Travel Area Forum jointly chaired by the Director General of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and his UK counterpart.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is represented at a senior level at these meetings.  There is a shared understanding that the maintenance of the CTA and the avoidance of a hard border is a priority strategic objective for both countries.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s contingency planning continues to be firmly grounded in the extensive work and outreach that has already been undertaken by individual Departments and agencies, as well as by stakeholder organisations, academics and others.\u00a0 This includes ongoing engagement by my Department with the Garda authorities in relation to the implications of UK exit.\u00a0 I want to emphasise that it is the Government&rsquo;s intention that the same border arrangements as currently apply on the island of Ireland will continue in the future.  There\u00a0is already a clear consensus that the Common Travel Area would continue so that the movement of people, a matter of primary concern for my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, should not be affected.\u00a0 As would be the case for any changes in policy or practice across any public policy area, in the event that the final shape of Brexit requires changes in the deployment of policing resources then those changes will be implemented by the appropriate authorities and any budgetary provision made in the context of the Estimates process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200053#WRE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Vetting","counter":273,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200053#WRE01400"},{"type":"question","counter":274,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[9121\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200053#WRE01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if all convictions, including driving offences, are included in the offences reported on in circumstances in which Garda clearance is sought for working with children and the elderly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":275,"content":"<p>Employment vetting is carried out by Garda National Vetting Bureau primarily in accordance with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016, the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions and Certain Disclosures) Act 2016 and other applicable law.

It was clearly communicated to GSOC that the provision of further staff\u00a0could be considered in the context of the 2018 Budget by which time the impact of the establishment of the unit and the adequacy of the 5 staff could be assessed.\u00a0\u00a0There was a clear commitment on the part of my Department at all times, that GSOC could re-engage on the issue as the situation developed and that the door was open to more resources being made available for the new unit based on further information being provided and experience of the operation of the new unit.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, it has taken far longer than my Department envisaged at the time, for the 5 staff to be recruited and as of now,\u00a0GSOC has not yet succeeded in recruiting all the staff sanctioned in May 2017.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may be interested to know that I met with the Chair of GSOC last September and discussed with her, among other things, the resourcing of GSOC.\u00a0 I invited her to set out for me her best assessment of the overall resource requirements to provide the level of service that complainants, and all those interested in the effective and efficient investigation of complaints against members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, expect and deserve.\u00a0 I am pleased to say that I have, this week, received a detailed business case for additional resources from GSOC and I will ensure that it is dealt with expeditiously.\u00a0 It is in no-one's interest that there is any perception that GSOC cannot fulfil its statutory mandate for want of resources and I will continue to do everything in my power to ensure that GSOC has the resources it requires.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200053#WRE03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alcohol Sales","counter":295,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200053#WRE03700"},{"type":"question","counter":296,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[9231\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200053#WRE03800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of full and part public alcohol licences issued to private members clubs in the past three years; the establishments (details supplied) in receipt of a licence to sell alcohol; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":297,"content":"<p>I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s question to relate to private members clubs that operate on the basis of the Registration of Clubs Acts 1904 to 2008.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service. However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and  sustainable manner. Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decison-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.<\/p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for the localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults. This is the only licensed use for the patch in Ireland. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010. <\/p><p>When the plasters were first introduced, the budget impact was low, because of the specific indication for which they are licensed. It was therefore a cause of clinical concern that, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where, as a nation, we were using more plasters than the entire UK National Health Service, with ten times our population. <\/p><p>When a treatment is intended for a small group of patients, and evidence suggests that it is being  used for many times that number, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review its use. In 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme reviewed the use of the plasters. The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing had been for the licensed indication. <\/p><p>Following the clinical review, and in the interest of ensuring appropriate patient care, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches from 1 September 2017. This process supports their appropriate use, ensuring that post-shingles patients continue to receive this treatment.<\/p><p>Under the new arrangements, all patients receiving lidocaine plasters for the licensed indication, shingles, were automatically approved on the HSE system. All of these patients continue to receive the treatment under the community schemes. <\/p><p>Non-shingles patients were given a three month grace period, in which their GP could move them to other treatments or apply for continued reimbursement.  However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients were no longer automatically reimbursed under the community drugs schemes.<\/p><p>In order for non-shingles patients to receive the patch through the community schemes, their GP must apply online for continued reimbursement approval.  If an application is refused, the GP may appeal, making a clinical case for the patient.  The HSE advises that the turnaround time for applications is three working days and for appeals it is five days.<\/p><p>As of 16 February, approximately 1,500 post-shingles patients have been approved, and the plaster is being provided to those patients in the normal manner.  <\/p><p>Another 4784 non-shingles patients were registered by their GP, and 14% of these patients, 670 people, have been approved.  In addition, 284 online appeals have been made, including patients who were never registered, and over 65% of these patients have been approved. <\/p><p>Over 2300 patients are now approved for the plaster in the drug schemes, with more than 850, over one third, approved for use other than post-shingles pain, based on the clinical case made by the GP.<\/p><p>It is clear that this new process supports appropriate use and prescribing and both post-shingles patients and other appropriate cases can continue to be treated with lidocaine plasters. <\/p><p>The introduction of the new approval system was flagged in August 2017, when details of the proposed changes were circulated by the HSE to prescribers and pharmacies. This advice has been re-issued in the last week, and information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE Medicines Management Programme website. ().<\/p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200054#WRF05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Emergency Departments","counter":370,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200054#WRF05600"},{"type":"question","counter":371,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[9083\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200054#WRF05700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a new emergency department will be provided at Beaumont hospital, Dublin 9 (details supplied); when construction of this new building will commence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":372,"content":"<p>The National Development Plan provides for a large number of Health developments across the country, including both national programmes and individual projects, across acute, primary and social care.

An EIA is mandatory for initial afforestation involving an area of 50 hectares or more, and for forest road works involving a length of 2,000 metres or more.  Applications for such projects must be accompanied by an environmental impact statement (EIS), to enable my Department to undertake the EIA.  An EIS is an environmental impact assessment report satisfying the requirements of Article 5.1 of the EU Directive and prepared by competent experts.  The information to be contained in an EIS is set out in Schedule 4 of the Regulations.<\/p><p>In addition, the Forestry Regulations 2017 provide that all proposed afforestation and forest road works below the mandatory thresholds must be screened for EIA, to consider whether or not significant effects on the environment are likely.  This consideration must take into account criteria involving the characteristic of the project, its location, and the type and characteristics of the potential impact, as set out in Schedule 3 of the Regulations.  Where it is considered that a proposed sub-threshold development is likely to have significant effects on the environment and should therefore be subject to an EIA, my Department requires the applicant to submit an EIS to enable the EIA to be undertaken. <\/p><p>EIA screening is an assessment undertaken by my Department as part of the normal procedure for evaluating the silvicultural and environmental suitability of a proposed development.  The District Forestry Inspector undertakes EIA screening by responding to questions under the various headings: project description; existing land use; cumulative effect and extent of the project; water; soil; protection of Freshwater Pearl Mussel; archaeology; landscape; designated habitats; non-designated habitats; social; accidents; trans-frontier; public participation and NGO participation.  This is supported by spatial analysis concerning the area of forest within various hinterlands of the proposed development.  In undertaking the EIA screening, the Inspector uses information gained from their scrutiny of aerial photographs and various Geographic Information System (GIS) layers available in the IFORIS mapping system, combined with their knowledge gained through (<i>inter alia<\/i>) field inspection (if required) and a review of referral responses (if any) received from consulted bodies, and submissions from third parties. <\/p><p>My Department has various options to address individual environmental concerns that arise in relation to a proposed forest development.  For example, specific conditions, such as increased setbacks or exclusions, can be added to the licence, to avoid any impact.  My Department may also seek further information in the form of an expert report in relation to, e.g. archaeology; potential Annex 1 habitats; concerns regarding groundwater; and address any potential impacts identified thorough licence conditions.  Furthermore, my Department has incorporated several protocols into the assessment process, designed to avoid impact concerning particular sensitivities, e.g. surface water acidification; Hen Harrier; Curlew; Freshwater Pearl Mussel; and Small White Orchid. <\/p><p>Therefore, while the EIA screening process may identify potential environmental impacts, these can often be addressed on an individual basis and do not culminate in a significant environmental impact, which would otherwise trigger an EIA.  <\/p><p>Since the introduction in 2015 of the Forestry Programme 2014-2020, to the end of December 2017, my Department has received 5,097 applications received under the Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme, none of which was greater than 50 hectares.  All of these applications underwent a sub-threshold EIA screening as a matter of course, and while various environmental issues were identified (and later resolved, as above), none of these represented a significant environmental impact. Therefore, no EIAs were triggered during this period.

My Department ensures compliance on the part of SWS applicants by way of on-farm inspections and administrative control checks.  The rate of on-farm inspection under the Sheep Welfare Scheme is 5%. These checks are undertaken to confirm that the requisite number of breeding ewes have been retained and to verify that the two scheme actions have been completed.  <\/p>  <p>  Every effort is made by Department officials to minimise disruption as much as possible to both the farmer and livestock on the holding in both the timing and undertaking of inspections.  Insofar as possible inspections are integrated, to this effect over two-thirds of the SWS on-farm inspections are carried out in conjunction with Ovine Identification &amp;amp; Registration (IDR) inspections under Cross Compliance requirements, which normally take place between the months of April and December.  In these circumstances a second farm visit is required towards the end of the scheme year in order to verify that the scheme actions have been satisfactorily completed.  The inspecting officer checks that the Scheme Action Record Book has been completed and checks any supporting documentation provided by the applicant.  As the ewe count has been previously completed it is not necessary for the inspecting officer to pen and count the ewes again. <\/p>  <p>  The remaining one-third of SWS inspections take place towards the end of the SWS scheme year.  The breeding ewe count and the verification of the two scheme actions are completed in one farm visit. Department officials, who are very conscious of all of the animal welfare considerations, endeavour to minimise and avoid stress to livestock on the holding when conducting sheep inspections.  When carrying out inspections during the lambing season Department officials adhere to previously agreed protocols, between the Department and the Farming Organisations, aimed at minimising animal stress and preventing the mis-mothering\/smothering or injuring of lambs.  <\/p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that I and officials in my Department are very aware of the concerns being expressed.

Farming\u00a0is an essential part of the social, cultural and economic fabric of the country and it is also part of a wider EU dispensation that values a Common Agriculture Policy built on family farming,\u00a0food security, high standards of food safety and environmental sustainability.\u00a0These are values that we hold dear, and so it is critically important when we consider the impact of Brexit that\u00a0the positive contribution of\u00a0agriculture to the rural and national economy, and to society in Ireland, and indeed elsewhere in the European Union, is to the forefront in our deliberations. <\/p>  <p>  I and my Department have been very focused over the last 18 months on mitigating the short-term impacts arising from Brexit through practical actions aimed in particular at reducing costs for beef and other farmers. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the &euro;150 million low-cost loan scheme I introduced under Budget 2017, I announced a further series of dedicated measures, amounting to over &euro;50 million in total, in\u00a0Budget 2018. I am also working with my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, on the introduction of the new &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme, in respect of which food businesses will have access to 40 per cent of the funding.<\/p>  <p>  Market diversification is another key component of the Government response to the challenges posed by Brexit, as we seek to reduce our exposure to the UK market and develop alternative markets for our exports. So, for example, market prioritisation research commissioned by my Department and carried out by Bord Bia is informing the selection of Trade Mission destinations as well as my Department&rsquo;s input to the Government&rsquo;s Global Footprint Initiative.<\/p>  <p>  Indeed, I\u00a0will be leaving this weekend on a trade mission to the US and Canada, and will undertake further missions over the remainder of 2018, with a focus in particular on emerging markets that provide opportunities for further growth in agri-food exports.<\/p>  <p>  Referring specifically to the beef sector, I fully acknowledge the contribution that Irish beef farmers are making to the agri economy, with beef accounting for &euro;2.4bn, or almost 18%, of our agri food exports in 2017. The fact that it is founded on\u00a0a predominantly pasture-based production system gives us a unique marketing advantage throughout the world in opening up new markets for Irish beef. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to increasing markets\u00a0for processed beef, I have, since I took office, made it a priority to increase the levels of live exports. The results of these efforts are being seen in\u00a0an increase of 45,000 head, or 30%,in the number of live animals exported in 2017 compared to 2016. Two key elements of this increase were further additional exports of suckler bred animals to Turkey, and an increase in the export of dairy male calves which will have a positive consequence for the market for slaughtered cattle in 2018 and 2019. I see a vibrant live export trade as an important source of income for suckler farmers especially,and will continue my efforts in this area in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and our agencies will continue to work with the\u00a0sector to help mitigate the impacts of Brexit, particularly those\u00a0affecting beef and other farmers, and we will continue to seek a negotiated outcome that will ensure that the trading relationship between the EU and the UK in its entirety post-Brexit will remain as close as possible to the current arrangements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200055#WRG05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sheep Welfare Scheme Funding","counter":431,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200055#WRG05600"},{"type":"question","counter":432,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[9106\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200055#WRG05700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the source from which funds for the sheep welfare scheme in 2017 and 2018 were reallocated; and the value for money criteria used when assessing the allocation of such funds.

Responsibility for the ratification of the Istanbul Convention falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p>  <p>  The Istanbul\u00a0Convention is a significant legal instrument in tackling violence against women and domestic violence.  Many of the actions required by provisions in the Istanbul Convention are being implemented on a daily basis under current legislation and administrative practice.  The actions necessary to ratify the Istanbul Convention are contained in the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021, published in January, 2016. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The implementation of most of these actions is underway including public sector training\/education by a range of State agencies, the development of a Risk Assessment Matrix by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, commissioning of national helpline services to respond to issues of domestic and sexual violence and support for child witnesses. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The remaining outstanding actions are legislative and require delivery of\u00a0two pieces of legislation:<\/p>  <p>  - The Domestic Violence Bill, which was published on 3rd February, 2017. The Bill has passed all stages in the Seanad and Second Stage in the D&aacute;il. Committee stage is expected to commence shortly in the D&aacute;il. It is hoped that this Bill will be enacted early this year. The enactment of this legislation is\u00a0key to advancing the ratification of\u00a0the Istanbul Convention as its enactment will deliver four of the actions required under the Istanbul Convention.<\/p>  <p>  - The one remaining legislative action is the enactment of legislation for extraterritorial jurisdiction. Work on this action is underway and it is anticipated that this legislation will be published in the first half of 2018.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  - When the required legislative actions are implemented, Ireland will be in a position to ratify the\u00a0 Istanbul Convention. <\/p>  <p>  - Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has statutory responsibility for the provision of care and protection to victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based\u00a0violence (DSGBV).<\/p>  <p>  - In 2017, additional funding of &euro;1.5m was allocated to Tusla to support the development of services. I was pleased to secure a further increase\u00a0of &euro;1.7m\u00a0for 2018, bringing the total level of funding for DSGBV services to &euro;23.8m. This includes funding for some 60 services throughout the country, including emergency refuge and support services.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The provision of domestic violence refuge spaces nationally in 2017 was 155 family units, comprising 147 emergency refuge family units and 8 emergency non-refuge family units. Guidance from the Council of Europe in relation to the provision of family places in a refuge indicates that &ldquo;In member states where shelters form part of a community strategy with intervention projects, there should be one family place per 10,000 women&rdquo;. Using the methodology set out by the Council of Europe, based on average family size and overall bed capacity, where a \"family place should cater for a woman and the number of children based on the average family size for the country\", current provision in Ireland is one family place per 7,765 adult women thus exceeding the recommendation for minimum refuge provision. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  However, given the variations in configurations of unit size and type, the emergency basis of provision and geographical distribution of demand, it is impossible to ensure a direct match between available units and family size and there have been geographical disparities in provision across the country. Tusla recognises the need to assure that the complement of emergency refuge services nationally matches as best as possible within available resources, demands for services and the needs of service users.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Services for victims of domestic abuse in the North East region, namely counties Louth, Meath, Cavan, and Monaghan, received approximately &euro;1.4m in funding from Tusla in 2017. Services to victims of domestic violence in counties Cavan and Monaghan are provided by Tearmann Domestic Violence Services, which received funding of approximately &euro;192,000 from Tusla in 2017 for the provision of support and advocacy services to victims. Individuals based in West Cavan can avail of the services of the Domestic Violence Advocacy Service for Sligo, Leitrim and West Cavan, which also provides support and advocacy services. This service received approximately &euro;317,000 in funding in 2017. Subject to the availability of spaces, women from counties Cavan and Monaghan\u00a0may also avail of refuge services in Dublin or other parts of the country in line with availability of spaces and safety needs.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Tusla has no immediate\u00a0plans to provide a refuge in the Cavan\/Monaghan area. There are three refuges situated in Drogheda, Co. Louth; Dundalk, Co. Louth; and Navan, Co. Meath, which\u00a0provide emergency domestic violence accommodation to women based in the North East region. This includes 21 family units of emergency refuge accommodation. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As part of its commissioning approach to developing services, Tusla carried out a number of needs analyses projects in 2017 to identify gaps in service provision and to prioritise service developments. All future service developments, whether based in the North East region or elsewhere, will be informed by Tusla&rsquo;s commissioning approach. In 2017, Tearmann Domestic Violence Services completed a Strategic Plan as a means of improving and developing services in counties Cavan and Monaghan. Tusla will meet Tearmann Domestic Violence Services and other partners shortly with a view to supporting these developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200057#WRJ02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Homelessness Strategy","counter":516,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200057#WRJ02400"},{"type":"question","counter":517,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[9201\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022200057#WRJ02500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 525 of 27 June 2017, the steps she has taken to ascertain the levels of youth homelessness amongst the LGBTI+ community; the further steps she is taking to address this issue; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":518,"content":"<p>Under the Child Care Act, 1991 and the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, Tusla has a duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care or protection, including children who present as\u00a0\u00a0homeless, and are not in the care of their parents.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Tusla provides assessment \u00a0and care\u00a0to children\u00a0in this situation, understanding that there is always an underlying reason for a child to\u00a0present as \u00a0homeless.

Children, depending on their identified needs, may be placed by in foster care either with relatives or general foster carers, in residential care, high support or special care or other placement types.  The majority of children are placed in long term stable placements and currently over 92% of children are placed in foster care.  A key part of the social worker role is to ensure the quality and safety of the child's placement, and to meet with the child on a one to one basis on all visits.

Under the Child Care Act, 1991 and the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has a duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care or protection.  Tusla provides support  for these children for as long as their welfare requires it.<\/p>  <p>  Children First National Guidance (2011) gives advice for notifying Tusla of situations where abuse is suspected.  A range of professionals including teachers, nurses, early years educators, Garda&iacute; and other health professionals, who see children regularly, are in a <\/p>  <p>  good position to identify children at risk.  Where someone has reasonable grounds for suspecting a child is being, or has been, abused, they are expected to immediately contact Tusla.<\/p>  <p>  The Children First Act, 2015 places a statutory obligation on key professionals (mandated persons) to report concerns of harm above a defined threshold to Tusla without delay.  These provisions were commenced on December 11th, last year. <\/p>  <p>  When a child who is undocumented, and is living with his or her parent or guardian, is taken into care, their needs are given priority.  A social worker is assigned to the child and prepares a care plan, in consultation with the child.  The plan should be dynamic and <\/p>  <p>  formally reviewed regularly.  Intrinsic to this process is ensuring that the voice and best interest of the child are central.  When outlined in the care plan, Tusla will  assist the child with the process of establishing residency.<\/p>  <p>  Unaccompanied asylum seeking children who seek the assistance of the State are placed in the statutory care of Tusla.  Their needs are assessed by an allocated a social worker from a specialist team who work exclusively with unaccompanied minors.

That protection will remain if the legislative proposal is adopted. <\/p>  <p>  As the law currently stands, even if a card holder volunteers their PSC, a private sector organisation would be committing an offence by accepting it as they are not a &ldquo;specified body&rdquo;.  Customer feedback is that they should be allowed to volunteer the card to non-specified bodies if it suits them to do so, for the purposes of ID verification such as when signing up to a utility company contract or opening an account with a financial institution.  Customers often report that private companies insist on a State-issued photographic ID such as a Passport or Driver&rsquo;s License which they might not have and which are costly.  In contrast, the PSC is free of charge.  <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the legislative proposal is that non-specified bodies that accept a PSC that is offered to them voluntarily by the holder should not be prosecuted or be at risk of prosecution.  At the same time, such non-specified organisations should not be able to request or force a person to use their PSC - that would remain an offence.  In other words, the volunteering of the card is the critical issue.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, and for the sake of absolute clarity, this proposal in no way allows a private sector body to access the customer data on the card chip or on any government database - it would simply allow them to view\/accept the card as a form of identity and to stop it being an offence for them to accept it.<\/p>  <p>  This measure will be beneficial to holders of the PSC, most especially those who do not hold a driving licence or a passport.

The review involved discussions with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, the representative body of the group water sector.  Discussions concluded in December, when I approved revised subsidy levels.  The new subsidy arrangements, endorsed by a special delegate conference of the Federation on 13 December 2017, came into effect on 1 January 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The changes implement the recommendation contained in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services (JOCFFDWS), endorsed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in April 2017, that there be equity of treatment and equivalent financial support between households using public water services and those availing of private water services.  <\/p>  <p>  The revised subsidy levels are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  1) For the annual subsidy towards the operation and maintenance costs of group water schemes providing a supply of water for domestic purposes (knows as &lsquo;Subsidy A&rsquo;): <\/p>  <p>  The maximum subsidy per house in private group water schemes has increased from &euro;140 per household to &euro;231.  An increased maximum subsidy of &euro;281 per household is available for small schemes of less than 100 houses that are willing, in the interests of providing in the long-term a more sustainable water supply to their members, to progress towards rationalisation or amalgamation with other schemes.<\/p>  <p>  The maximum subsidy per house for public group water schemes has increased from &euro;70 per household to &euro;115.  These are schemes that supply their members with water that is provided by Irish Water.<\/p>  <p>  The portion of costs than can be recouped by group water schemes has also increased.  Typically up to 60% of costs have been covered by the subsidy payments.  This has increased to 85%.  There are also changes and simplifications to how these costs are assessed.<\/p>  <p>  2) For the additional subsidy that is paid towards the costs of group water schemes that have long-term Operation and Maintenance Contracts (for example, as part of a Design Build Operate project) for the delivery of water (known as &lsquo;Subsidy B)&rsquo;: <\/p>  <p>  There has been an increase in the level of volumetric costs incurred by group water schemes operating under these contracts that is recoupable, from 60% to 85%.

My Department may recoup housing authorities up to 90% of payments reasonably made.  Under funding arrangements that are in place between my Department and housing authorities, exchequer funding is provided on a regional basis, whereby payments are made to a designated lead-authority which is responsible for the disbursement of this exchequer funding, within the region.
