I did not realise the garda&iacute; were out for us.  I am Chris Gordon and I am here to represent the Irish Social Enterprise Network, which is the largest open and inclusive network for social enterprises, social entrepreneurs and social innovators in Ireland.  I am also able to speak as chairman and founder of the Irish Export Co-operative.  I will make submissions about co-operatives and community interest companies today.  The Irish Export Co-operative is a large group of small, medium and micro enterprises that have come together to reduce the cost of their exports.  In many cases, this is the only opportunity they have to export.  I want to present two main company types.<\/p><p>  The first one is co-operatives.  Speaking today on behalf of members of the Irish Social Enterprise Network, there are certain things I would like to see.  The first is the inclusion of co-operatives as a section in the companies Bill to reflect the co-operatives that exist currently in Ireland.  While there is co-operative law in Ireland with a<\/p><p>promise for further legislation to be introduced, there are already examples of Irish limited companies that have co-operative rules.  It is important to define this distinction<\/p><p>as many of these organisations do not get the recognition they deserve.  Co-operatives such as the Irish Export Co-operative trade as limited companies with co-operative rules.  The organisation has reduced the cost of exports greatly for all our members.  That would be the first submission.  There are other examples.  I can think of roughly 100 enterprises that are limited companies with co-operatives rules that do not get the recognition under the companies Bill.  <\/p><p>  The second suggestion is for the inclusion of community interest companies.  A community interest company, CIC, is a limited company with special additional features created for the use of people who want to conduct a business or other activity for community benefit, that is, a social mission.  CICs can be limited by shares or by guarantee and have a unique statutory \"asset lock\" to prevent the assets and profits being distributed except as permitted by legislation.  This ensures the assets and profits are retained within the CIC for community purposes or transferred to another asset-locked organisation such as another CIC or charity.  This social purpose model means staff can be directors and board members.  Some of the members here who are already members of charitable organisations understand the frustration caused when people set up a limited company and apply for charitable status only to find that they cannot be a director and a manager at the same time.  Perhaps we need to be a bit more aware of the fact that there are companies set up with a social mission that can trade as social enterprises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013101500004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Gordon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381838100,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I welcome the representatives from both organisations, particularly today - budget day.

The standards we set in regard to educational attainment and continuing professional development and competency are controlled by IAASA.  It is not possible for a body to lower its standards significantly or raise them unrealistically in order to exclude certain individuals.  It is not a question of any one body acting as a monopoly or otherwise trying to force people to take one or two options.  A number of the bodies also operate in other jurisdictions, in which case they are supervised by regulators in respect of their standards and competencies.  This is a well-established area.<\/p><p>  It is impossible to estimate the scale of the problem of unregistered practitioners.  I get the sense from meeting our own members that it is a significant problem.  It has come to the fore in recent years as circumstances became more testing for clients and the advice more focused on difficult areas that previously had fallen into disuse, such as insolvency.  IAASA has told us it regularly receives inquiries about unregistered accountants but it finds it difficult to collate information on them because they are outside its scope.  As I noted in my presentation, even if the number is very small, there ought to be a principle that somebody who holds him or herself out as an accountant should be supervised by the State regulator.

Trading companies are established as companies limited by guarantee or by share capital and they subsequently apply for charitable status.  The difficulty with that approach is that it is subject to a number of constraints.  Double taxation issues arise when it comes to trading services and products.<\/p><p>  Many co-operatives exist under co-operative legislation such as the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1893 and the Friendly Societies Act 1936.  I understand these Acts are under review.  Most companies that are set up to trade as co-operatives are advised to become limited companies and use co-operative rules.  What we mean by the word \"co-operative\" is that every person has one vote regardless of share capital or money invested.  In the Irish Export Co-operative, members join for &euro;30 per year and the membership elects a board of directors of the limited company.  This allows for oversight from the Companies Acts and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.<\/p><p>  The Forf&aacute;s report estimates there are 1,400 social enterprises employing 25,000 to 33,000 people.  We believe there are many more that do not subscribe to the label \"social enterprise\" and, for the most part, trade as companies limited by guarantee or share capital.  However, given that the potential for this sector is in the region of 65,000 people, we are falling behind in social enterprise largely because the mechanisms are not available.  I hope we do not fall further behind because we can lead in this area.  Social enterprise could be a part of our DNA.  We already have strong co-operatives.  Everybody is a member of a credit union and other organisations.  However, aside from credit unions, agricultural co-operatives and water schemes, co-operatives are not common in Ireland compared with the UK, which has a variety of member owned organisations that offer stability to their members, as opposed to a small number of directors or shareholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013101500005#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Gordon"},{"type":"speech","time":1381838700,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gordon.

The CARB does a fine job, but it is a different model than pertains elsewhere in the world.  In other countries, the big four are supervised by a public regulator.  This is the point that everyone, including Government policy, agrees we must reach.  We are nearly there.  Last week, there was a commitment to put the last legislative pieces in place.

There is a wealth of small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, or members of the public who are availing of limited company status under company law and applying co-operative rules.  I am glad to hear that the Deputy was a member of one.  I am sure that most other committee members are likewise, although they might not even know it, which is quite interesting.<\/p><p>  The question of whether it should have its own section is entirely up to Members.  I would love to be able to give a professional legal opinion.  I would say \"Yes\".  We struggled to set up the Irish Export Co-operative.  We should not have had to struggle.  We were a group of SMEs that were simply trying to combine our volume to reduce costs.  A member of our co-operative might ship out 40 items per year while I might ship out 20 items.  If our volumes are combined, I can help to negotiate better deals.<\/p><p>  Besides the League of Ireland, another example is Medisec Ireland Limited, which was set up by former Deputy Jim Glennon some decades ago, which provides indemnity insurance for doctors and undercut the best available quote of the time by 50%.  The majority of doctors are members.  In our case, we are able to reduce costs.  Exporting more creates more work, which creates more jobs.  One should be able to go to a county enterprise board, new local enterprise office or Enterprise Ireland and not just pick a limited company up off the shelf.  As a group, one should be able to point to the co-operatives section in the Bill, pick a co-operative up off a shelf and apply co-operative rules.  It is ready made.  We should encourage these types of organisation.<\/p><p>  My gut feeling is that this matter should constitute a section.  It could be simple.  It would outline the co-operative rules to be applied and give co-operatives limited company status.  The latter provision would not create a difference, as we could refer to the first 15 sections of the new companies Bill.  A section would recognise the fantastic work of co-operatives that already exist and provide encouragement to reduce the cost of, for example, payment plans for bank charges or whatever the next issue is that needs a co-operative to make it work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013101500006#E00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Gordon"},{"type":"speech","time":1381838700,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I am a great advocate of the proposal.

Tax in this area came into force following abuse of the provision by commercial companies which formed co-operatives in order to avoid paying tax.

It is just a grandfather that many of the co-operatives in Ireland exist as limited companies under company law and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  However, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement has no control over co-operatives.  It would only be aware of the problems or challenges faced by co-operatives.  For example, it would not be able to intervene in AGMs and so on.  This can only be done under IPS and Friendly Societies law.  I am aware of the proposed changes.  The current 100 or so co-operatives currently in existence should be granted standing and recognition within company law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013101500007#F01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Gordon"},{"type":"speech","time":1381839300,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Is Mr. Gordon speaking about companies limited by guarantee?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013101500007#F01100","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381839300,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Yes, companies limited by guarantee or share capital, as provided for in the companies Bill as drafted, who use the title \"co-operative\".  I am also seeking protection of the word \"co-operative\".  It is important that those that are co-operatives are regulated as such.  It should not be possible for any group to simply declare itself a co-operative.  There must be a process by which a co-operative can be such, in particular if the social business initiative to be introduced in 2014 is to going to mandate against that.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Kyne's question regarding CICs, there are currently 8,000 social enterprises in the UK using the CIC model.  Other models being used in the USA include Bcorps and so on.  They sit between for-profit companies that are limited and make lots of money and charitable organisations which generate money through fund-raising or other initiatives.  Social enterprises generate trading services and have a social mission.  Abroad they have different governing types.  On CICs, I hope the committee will incorporate into this Bill the first change in this regard in UK company law for 100 years.  The reason for this is the wealth of knowledge and information of the past 20 years which indicates that there is no appropriate mechanism for social enterprise to exist in the UK.  This has now gone to Canada and will also go to Chile.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013101500007#F01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Gordon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381839900,"counter":43,"content":"<p>People used to abuse the concept of co-operatives because the latter were not obliged to pay tax.

As I pointed out, that model is very different to those which obtain elsewhere.  The then Minister of State, former Deputy Michael Ahern, gave a commitment that the issue would be considered and that a properly structured consultation process would take place.  In fairness, the then Minister of State delivered in this regard.  IAASA engaged in a consultation on the matter and recommended that it be addressed.  It then went to the Company Law Review Group, which examined the position and endorsed the recommendation that it should be addressed.  The 2003 Act introduced an entirely new structure and this has - albeit ten years later - been the subject of the consultation process to which I refer.  At this point, the matter really ought to be addressed.<\/p><p>  In the context of Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins' question, there is a need to highlight to the Ministers for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputies Bruton and Howlin, respectively, and their Departments the importance of implementing the measures immediately.

At the beginning of our existence we were given a charter.  Clearly, there were accountants in place before that charter was bestowed upon us and these individuals were unregistered and unregulated.  Our charter is important and the Government of the day stated in respect of it that the business with which we deal is difficult and important and should, therefore, be properly organised.  Some 125 years later, we are at a different stage but the issue remains the same.  What we do is difficult enough and important enough and should be properly regulated, structured and organised as a result.  We wanted to highlight these matters for the committee because we are faced with a number of very pressing public interest issues.  Our organisation was established 125 years ago not for the individual or collective benefit of accountants but rather in the public interest in order to ensure the economy had a supply of people to do what is important and difficult.  Now we have the supply, there are issues relating to properly structuring, describing and regulating those people which must be dealt with.  We have all the machinery but there is a need for legislative change in order to ensure that everyone will be supervised in an appropriate manner.<\/p><p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to make a presentation to it.
