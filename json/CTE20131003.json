This issue has been ongoing for some time.  On the work programme there is publicity about Bord na gCon, which is due to come before the committee.  Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon get funding.  In the article Mr. Treacy supplied to us from The Irish Field, there are allegations that &euro;750,000 was lost due to a cost savings plan delay.  The journalist who wrote the article said the loss was due to a delay in implementing cost saving measures agreed by the Turf Club and Horse Racing Ireland.  We must invite both of those organisations to the committee to find out why there was such a delay and to discuss their financial situation.  The organisations get large sums of money from the taxpayer.  We have already agreed to bring in Bord na gCon which is the dog side of the fund allocated compared with the horse version of the fund.  The vast majority of the overall fund goes on Horse Racing Ireland and a small amount goes to Bord na gCon.  I do not say the organisations should come on the same day but they should both appear before the committee.  I would send them the article, of which they are probably aware as it is in the public media.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013100300003#D00200","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1380790800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

No. 3B.5 is correspondence dated 30 September 2013 from Mr. Alan Smith regarding the Committee of Public Accounts investigation of the HSE SKILL programme.  It is to be noted.  Mr. Smith was the former general manager of SKILL and he has been referred to at a number of hearings of the committee in the context of the operation of the unofficial SIPTU account.  In that regard he has been fully informed of his rights to give evidence to the committee and, indeed, the committee has invited him to do so.  He has so far declined this opportunity.  His position that he has co-operated fully with the HSE is therefore noted.  We have found it extremely difficult to deal with the issue.  We have applied to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for compellability powers under the new Act and we await the outcome of the application.<\/p><p>  No. 3C.1 is correspondence dated 27 September 2013 from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

A meeting has been scheduled with Paul Maloney, former CEO of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, on 28 November 2013 to examine the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s special report No. 77.  A meeting has been scheduled with the HSE and the Department of Health on 14 November 2013 to examine chapter 22, eligibility for medical cards in the 2012 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We will follow up early in the new year with another meeting when we will examine chapter 21, which deals with budgetary controls.  At that stage the outturn for 2013 will be known.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  As we now have the Comptroller and Auditor General annual report for 2012, we will revise the work programme for the remainder of 2013 and circulate it next week.  If members have proposals on the work programme, they should contact the secretariat.  We will note the decision already made on the commissioner and see whether we can have an early hearing.<\/p><p>  No. 6 is other business.  Do members have any other business?  Can we agree the agenda for next week, Thursday, 10 October 2013?  The agenda for the meeting will consist of resumed consideration of the Comptroller and Auditor General special report No. 78 on matters arising out of education audits.  The Department of Education and Skills, Waterford Institute of Technology and the Higher Education Authority will be in attendance.  If the work programme is agreed, is it agreeable that we will call the witnesses into the room?

The Department was established on 5 July 2011 following the enactment of legislation to separate the functions of the then Department of Finance.  The expenditure-focused functions transferred to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and are reflected in the programmes under which the Vote expenditure is accounted for.<\/p><p>  While the Department was not established until mid-year, the Vote Estimate was for the full year, 2011.  Accordingly, the appropriation account was presented on that basis also.  The appropriation account recorded gross expenditure of &euro;35 million in 2011.  The equivalent figure for 2012 was &euro;42.6 million.<\/p><p>  The Vote for superannuation and retired allowances provides mainly for the payment of pensions, retirement lump sums and death gratuities for civil servants and their dependants.  The appropriation account for 2011 recorded gross expenditure of &euro;433 million.  The corresponding expenditure in 2012 was &euro;520 million.  The payment of Civil Service pensions is administered by the finance branch of the Department of Finance, and the associated costs are reflected in the Vote for that Department.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has responsibility for policy matters in relation to public sector pensions, and the related costs are borne on the Vote for that Department.<\/p><p>  The committee may wish to note that significant expenditure is also incurred on other accounts regarding the pensions of other public servants.  This includes pension related payments to teachers, health service staff and security services personnel borne on the Votes of the relevant Departments.  The pensions of former Ministers, judges and other officeholders are paid out of the Central Fund of the Exchequer and accounted for in the finance accounts.<\/p><p>  Most of the accounts out of which current public sector pensions are paid do not include estimates of the present value of pension entitlements already earned and that are expected to be paid over future years.  At the end of 2009, the accrued liability was estimated to be of the order of &euro;116 billion.  There have been significant changes in public sector pay and pension arrangements since then, including increased employee pension contribution rates and accelerated retirements.  However, updated estimates of liability to reflect the impacts of those developments have not been prepared.<\/p><p>  I recommended that actuarial reviews and projections of public service pension outflows should be carried out regularly to ensure the State is aware of the long-term cost impact of pensions and the timing of pension outflows.  Such assessments are an important element in public sector pension policy formation.  The Accounting Officer has agreed to implement the recommendation, and my office has met officials from his Department about this.<\/p><p>  Chapter 6 deals with the State&rsquo;s financial commitments arising from public private partnership, PPP, contracts.  Aspects of this chapter have been considered in the context of the committee&rsquo;s examinations of other bodies, including the National Development Finance Agency.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s role regarding PPPs involves setting the general policy framework and providing guidance on appraisal, procurement and evaluation of projects.  The Department has a dedicated PPP website which contains information and guidance on the PPP process.  It also presents a listing of all PPP projects with a capital value of more than &euro;20 million.<\/p><p>  As chapter 6 indicates, central government expenditure to the end of 2011 on major PPP projects totalled just over &euro;2 billion and there are future commitments in regard to those projects of around &euro;4 billion.  Further projects are planned as part of the capital stimulus package announced in July 2012, and these will increase the level of commitments as new contracts are signed.  An update on each project is given in the 2012 report.<\/p><p>  A project should only proceed as a PPP if it can be shown to deliver better value for money than if delivered through conventional procurement.  The Department&rsquo;s guidelines stipulate that the cost of PPP delivery should be appraised against the estimated cost of conventional procurement, which is referred to as the public sector benchmark.  The chapter recommended publication of these appraisals, including in cases where a project fails the test to proceed as a PPP, in order to help improve understanding of the factors affecting the achievement of value for money in public projects.<\/p><p>  Post-implementation review of projects, once they have been in operation for a number of years, can not only establish whether good value has been achieved but can also identify lessons for future projects, including those that proceed as more traditional capital projects.  Even though some projects had been in operation for up to ten years, no such reviews had been carried out when I reported.  This was despite a requirement in the Department&rsquo;s guidance that such reviews should be conducted.<\/p><p>  Chapter 12 summarises the expenditure and receipts of all Votes for 2011.  Relative to a peak level of &euro;53.8 billion in 2008, there had been a cumulative reduction of 7.6% in gross voted expenditure by the end of 2011.  This had reduced further to a cumulative drop of almost 9% by the end of 2012.<\/p><p>  The basic principle underlying public procurement rules is that there should be an open, competitive process, both to achieve good value in procurement and to ensure fairness between competing suppliers.  However, the rules also recognise that there are exceptional situations where a competition may not be possible or appropriate.  Accounting Officers for each Vote are required to submit annual returns to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and to my office, setting out details of contracts worth &euro;25,000 or more that have been awarded without a competitive process.  Based on the information in those returns, chapter 13 sets out the extent of non-competitive procurement.<\/p><p>  In 2011, as in earlier years, there were substantial reported levels of procurement without the use of a competitive process.  The returns show that there were 555 such contracts awarded with a total value of &euro;266 million.  However, there is evidence that some returns are not complete.  As reported previously, the HSE does not yet have a system capable for compiling a complete return.  In other cases, additional non-competitive contracts were reported after submission of the annual returns.  Our sample-based audit work also identifies some contracts which have been omitted from the returns.  This under-reporting occurs because contracts are recorded on an exception basis.  The report recommends, therefore, that all Departments and offices should maintain a single register of all procurement contracts awarded.  That register should contain key data on each contract, including supplier name and the nature of the procurement, and indicate whether the contract was awarded using a competitive process.  This would help ensure all non-competitive contracts would be identified and reported in a timely way.  It would also enable better analysis of overall procurement expenditure, which is a basic requirement for effective management and control of procurement spend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013100300004#E00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1380791400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Watt to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013100300004#E00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380791400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to make a short statement.

I would like to express my appreciation of the staff of the Department.  Appended to this statement is a list of some of our achievements since the Department was established.  Those have been delivered thanks to the hard work and commitment of those officials.  I would also like to thank colleagues in the Department of Finance with whom we work closely across a range of budget and financial issues.<\/p><p>  Previously, there were some issues with delays in responding to Committee of Public Accounts recommendations, but these have now been addressed.  The Department makes every effort to provide the committee with an early response to its reports and will continue to do so.  Currently, I am happy to say there are no minutes of the Minister outstanding, and we have made strides to ensure we are prompt in that regard.  I hope the members are happy with the progress we made in that respect.<\/p><p>  I will refer briefly to some of the work of the Department.  One of our key goals is to reduce spending and continue the progress in reducing the fiscal deficit.  In 2011 and 2012, departmental spending has been managed tightly.  In 2011, gross departmental spending was &euro;57.4 billion, at variance of 0.3% with profile.  In 2012, gross spending was 0.2% at variance.<\/p><p>  Gross voted spending, and Mr. McCarthy touched on this, has been reduced from its peak of &euro;63.1 billion in 2009 to &euro;55.8 billion last year.  Estimated gross expenditure for this year is &euro;54.6 billion, and as members would have seen from the returns issued yesterday, the two Ministers were below spending profile for 2013.  In net terms that is &euro;800 million, &euro;300 million on the capital side and &euro;500 million on the current side.  Overall, from 2009 to the most recent year, this represents a reduction of 13.5% in spending, an 8% reduction in current spending and a 50% reduction in capital spending.<\/p><p>  Even these headline figures do not show the full extent of the fiscal effort that has been engaged in.  The reduction in overall departmental spending comes against a background of increasing expenditure pressures, particularly in the areas of social protection, health and education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013100300004#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380792600,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Can we publish your statement, Mr. Watt?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013100300006#G00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380792600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013100300006#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1380792600,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Watt and his colleagues.  He has given a broad-ranging summary of the activities of his Department, which was set up approximately two years ago.  I want to deal with some of the financial side of it.<\/p><p>  I will start with Chapter 12 - Vote Accounting, the overall Vote for the entire Government.  I have a few topics but I will deal with this one first.  Gross voted expenditure in 2011 was &euro;49.7 billion.  Mr. Watt mentioned the net figure of &euro;45.6 billion.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is a new Department and people would see it as having an overall role in monitoring and managing Government expenditure across all Departments.  In the year in question, the gross expenditure was approximately &euro;49.7 billion.<\/p><p>  In September of last year, just over 12 months ago, the Comptroller and Auditor General issued his report on all the Votes and his annual report on various matters in Departments.  That report for the year we are talking about - I do not refer to the one announced this week - would have highlighted various items, such as loss of income to the taxpayer in some Departments, waste of taxpayers' money in other chapters, money spent where there was no or little return - what the technocrats call nugatory expenditure - overpayments and issues of non-tendering.  Now that there is a new Department, can Mr. Watt outline, out of that &euro;50 billion, how much the Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted in this report for the year in question would fall into that area of loss of income to the taxpayer, waste of money and money spent for bad value?  Given that he is the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, what is his summary?  The Comptroller and Auditor General issues an annual report.  I presume Mr. Watt digests it thoroughly.  Can he give me the summary of figures in that report?

I am a bit surprised that the Department has not done that.<\/p><p>  Leaving aside the Committee of Public Accounts, I am shocked that Mr. Watt does not have a figure from the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report.  He said it is not totted up.  Is it possible, in due course, to run through the chapters quickly and identify a loss of income of X million euro through money not collected or X million euro wasted on projects that never proceeded?  The Comptroller and Auditor General might have identified a matter that did not go through proper tendering but which might not have incurred a cost.  It may be a procedural issue.  Mr. Watt will not mind my saying that he did a lot of talking about how good the Department is.  People would have thought the Department was specifically associated with public expenditure.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has produced a report on its first year in operation.  One could say the same about the report issued last year, for 2012.  We will come to that on another day.  I suggest that Mr. Watt carry out an exercise to see where the losses were.<\/p><p>  Let me proceed to the real part of my question.  If the figure has not been totted up and if something is not counted, expenditure is not being managed to the extent that it could be.  Was there any sanction for any Department that did something wrong?  If owing to poor management a Department makes a decision and blows &euro;20 million that it should not blow, will it just carry on with its Estimate next year without any sanction?  Who is responsible?  I would have believed that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is.  Mr. Watt should be asking secretaries general what happened.  If &euro;20 million has been blown, he should be questioning whether the relevant Secretary General should be coming in to talk about next year's Estimate as if the &euro;20 million were not blown at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013100300007#H00200","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380793200,"counter":33,"content":"<p>We absolutely have those conversations, every week.

In respect of each of the areas identified in the report, we engage with the relevant Department and ask how and why a certain occurrence might have happened.  We ask what changes can be made to ensure it will not happen again.  We ask how it will be reflected in the Estimates for the next year.  That happens in terms of every single area of spending and every single one of the recommendations.  Perhaps somebody in the Department has done a tot; I do not have one to hand myself.  Perhaps Mr. McCarthy has done so himself.  The key point is that, in relation to each area of spending where there are areas of inefficiency or bad practice identified, we follow it up.  For example, the report on procurement sets out that there is &euro;250 million in procurement undertaken without competitive competition.  We have gone through that in detail.

He states he has enhanced the amount of output information provided in the annual Estimates for the D&aacute;il.  One page 14, he states each Vote stayed within the allocation appropriate to the Department for 2011.  On the issue of Estimates and the budgeting, I do not accept any of what Mr. Watt said.  I will ask him to give me the date for when the Estimates for 2013, not to mind 2011, were approved by the Oireachtas.  He knows it was in June, at least.  Half way through the year, we discussed the Estimates for the current year in the Oireachtas, at which point half the money had already been spent.  The overwhelming majority of the balance had been irrevocably committed.  All the Departments come in with their Estimates half way through the year so I do not accept Mr. Watt&rsquo;s point that there was good budgeting.<\/p><p>  Mr. Watt will recall that in December of last year, the Department&rsquo;s first full year in operation, there were Supplementary Estimates of over &euro;1 billion.

There are variants across some subheads, with underestimates and overestimates.  The point I was making was that overall gross spending was managed tightly and aligned with the budget profile.  This is a consistent performance of the system.  Every year we are spending in line with budget, meeting the troika&rsquo;s targets and the deficit is coming down.  We have even exceeded our reduction targets.  Yesterday we came out with numbers for the first three quarters of this year.

I know there are EU regulations for tendering processes but most other EU member states are able to ensure their tenders go to domestic providers through how they construct their tendering contracts.  France, Germany and the others do it, but Ireland has been weaker in this area.  Some tendering can get the lowest price for the taxpayer, but it can have a knock-on effect, with local businesses losing out.  While the Department might show a cash saving on a tender, Ireland Inc. could show job losses in the wider economy.  Is there a system in place to take this into account?

We have looked at this in detail over a number of years and tried to everything we can to ensure that SMEs and local suppliers have access to the contracts.  I will talk about those in a moment.<\/p><p>  There is an enormous challenge for the system to make savings in a way which mitigates the impact on suppliers and employment in particular areas.  There is no easy answer here.  There are difficult trade-offs.  If we are to reduce our spend, which we must do, it has a knock-on effect on the rest of economy which, unfortunately, has a knock-on effect on demand and jobs.  It is the same in any other area of spending by the Government.  In terms of what we have done, we issued Circular 10\/10 in August 2010 which looked at the administrative burden SMEs face.  We had incredibly high turnover and insurance thresholds that made it very difficult for many small companies to compete for contracts so we issued a circular that made a real push to ensure that the administrative requirements part of a tender were commensurate with the value of the contract.  We went out of our way to ensure that as large a number of participants as possible were able to be involved in the contract.  We have done much in terms of standardising documents and reducing the burden.  We work with Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland in identifying opportunities for procurement and providing whatever assistance we can to ensure Irish companies are in a position to compete with others.  We are engaging with IBEC and the business groups all the time in terms of the procurement process, how we can structure contracts in a sensible way and how we can ensure Irish companies are in a position to compete. <\/p><p>  We have a tendency to aggregate contracts because we as a system want to benefit from the market power we have.  Within that, we try to break it up into lots which give an opportunity for SMEs because if contracts are too large, they are obviously excluded.  We have done much in this space.  Mr. Quinn and his team continue to monitor how we are performing.  The Minister gets representations from companies on a frequent basis.  There is an element in the contracts.  People lose contracts.  The Deputy knows how it works.  We tender for a school and \"X\" number of people apply to build the school but only one contractor will be happy.  It is inevitable that there will be noise in the system but we try to set up a system that gives as many suppliers as possible the opportunity to compete.  Our sense of it is that Irish suppliers do quite well but we can get the updated figures for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013100300009#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1380794400,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Could Mr. Watt send them on to me?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013100300009#K00400","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380794400,"counter":63,"content":"<p>The recent figure was 90% plus.

If another 5% was added to that, it would be another &euro;700 million out of that figure of &euro;13 billion going into the Irish economy just for making the effort.  It is as simple as that and I do not mean to make light of it but somebody must drive this because every other country drives it for its own businesses.<\/p><p>  I will make one suggestion that perhaps Mr. Watt should deal with.  It relates to savings on drugs in respect of the HSE.  There was a remarkable situation with the HSE.  Perhaps Mr. Watt did not pick it up fully.  He would not have been watching the discussion.  I am pleased to hear Mr. Quinn is talking to all the people and the Department is trying to talk to businesses.  A few months ago, I asked the head of the HSE to tell me what happens because the HSE was paying hundreds of millions of euro to some of these companies.  I asked about the engagement with people from some of the biggest pharmaceutical manufacturers in Ireland which get hundreds of millions of euro from the Irish taxpayer for the products we need to purchase from them.  He told me that they never met the companies.  They just met a federation representing the group.  That was shocking.  It comes under Mr. Watt's remit even though it specifically relates to the Department of Health.  Reining in health is a problem.  That is where all the Supplementary Estimates come from.  The Minister once asked me on the floor of the Chamber whether I could do anything to rein him in because he is difficult in that way.  Even the troika has not fully succeeded in reining him in.  It would be easier for Mr. Watt to phone up his counterpart in the National Health Service and ask them to buy an extra 10% at the price they are getting, which is much cheaper, so we can take them off them.  One could do it that way.  I would make that suggestion because somebody has to get a handle on it.  <\/p><p>  My last topic is the public-private partnerships, PPPs.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013100300009#K00600","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380794400,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Fleming want me to address the drugs issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013100300009#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1380794400,"counter":66,"content":"<p>Yes.

The generic issue is an obvious one.  I know colleagues in the Department of Health and the HSE are working on this.  There is the question of the reference pricing and the deal we did with manufacturers.  We have a fairly simple view on this.  The State has monopoly in this market as in others.  We have buyer power because of our size.  We are the largest purchaser of many goods including drugs so our view is that we need to use that market power.  We would press our colleagues in the Department of Health and the HSE all the time.  If one looks at the difficulties within the health system, one can see they are taking cost out all the time and demand is going up right across.  There are enormous increases in productivity.

Two or three months after people sat in a room through tortuous negotiations to reach an agreement, the HSE is already stating it signed up to achieve &euro;150 million in savings but that it cannot deliver &euro;50 million of them.

People can discuss that issue because these notions can be subjective.  We said we would have the agreement in place by 1 July and we achieved this.  We set out targets and our colleagues in the HSE and the Department of Health were with us all the way.  This was not something Ms Buckley and Mr. Reid did on their own.  They did it with the sectoral managers across the system.  We are happy with the agreement in the health service which has the measures that needed to be included.

I would like to understand the criteria applied by the Department when granting permission to fill a post.  According to media reports, the Department of Finance has had every request it made approved.  Perhaps Mr. Watt will explain the rationale behind that because it was probably quite good and I am interested in it.

I presume if I am lying on a bed waiting for a cardiac bypass, I would like one of these people to operate a machine beside me but that post was not granted while ten judges were given approval for law clerks, posts that should not even exist according to an bord snip nua.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013100300013#O00500","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380796800,"counter":116,"content":"<p>With regard to the moratorium, in effect the Departments decide themselves.  They have demands for more staff so the first filter is the Departments to say \"No\" because they are closest to what is going on, service needs and they know their activities better than we do.  Then it comes to us and we have to make an adjudication.  They make a case and it is decided.  This part is subject to negotiation as well as the Deputy will appreciate.  If somebody is looking for ten staff, he or she will ask for 30.  There is an element of gaming but that is the way it is.  It is a negotiation.  They know we do not have the resources or money and we are trying to stay within the ECF so there is a process of negotiation.  The front-line staff are key vacancies based on the criteria set out by the Department.  It is not perfect.  There has to be an arbitrary element to this naturally as to how can we make judgments about recruiting a person in the justice sector and the value  of that person compared to the value of the a person in the health system, as mentioned by the Deputy.  It is difficult to make those judgments across different sectors.

The Department was looking for a higher number but I cannot remember the exact details.  There was a discussion between myself and Mr. John Moran, the Secretary General at the Department and the Minister for Finance made his views known.  The Department had to respond to a number of reports that were critical of performance, including the Nyberg and Wright reports.  Part of the changes in that Department and in my Department reflect implementation of those recommendations.  It is not to say that all of it is happening.  The reality is that the policy in terms of numbers will be tight for a  good few years.  We are going to be living with this situation where we cannot satisfy all the demands and we will have to make difficult decisions and difficult trade-offs.  There is no perfect way of dealing with this.

The lump-sum payments are about &euro;80 million, &euro;100 million or thereabouts.  They are a significant part.  For this year, I think retirements will be less than we anticipated.  One can speculate about why this is.  A lot of people who would have been coming up to retirement age have gone already - a lot of people have left.  Colleagues may be holding on until the end of August next year because that is when the new arrangements come in.  The payments will be based then on the post-Haddington Road cut salaries for colleagues on over &euro;65,000, so there might be an element of either those people who wanted to retire having gone or people who are planning to retire going to hang on up to that date.  In effect, retirements are lower for this year and the lump sums will be lower.  The Estimate will be under the &euro;520 million.  We are only three quarters in so we will see for the year.

On how we will approach the spend in each of these areas, we look at how the markets are structured and what, in the first instance, we can do to control our demand.  Obviously, the easiest way to save money is to not spend it in the first instance.  We will seek to reduce demand across various areas and review specifications in how we buy services.  Professional services are often bought by the hour.  In terms of legal fees, there may be arrangements we can put in place whereby we can move to fixed price engagements for particular pieces of work, for example, conveyancing.  We will also seek to drive competition in the marketplace.

The committee has already discussed this issue with officials from the Departments of Finance and the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Valuation Office.  It is one that has been raised in committee approximately eight or nine times at this stage.  I inform the committee that I have spoken to and met Mr. Watt on a number of occasions on this issue in the past few months.  I do not wish to patronise him, but he is probably the only civil servant who has an appreciation of the impact of the increased commercial rate bills on businesses around the country.  I left this meeting approximately half an hour ago to attend another committee meeting at which the Simon Community was making its pre-budget submission.  When I informed the group that I did not have much time to engage with it because I had to return to this committee to discuss commercial rate values, I was told commercial rates for the Simon Community had increased from &euro;4,500 to &euro;6,000 and that while it had a waiver of 50% of its rates, its income was approximately &euro;20,000 per annum.  No one is safe from the Valuation Office and what is going on.  When a group such as the Simon Community is expressing that view, it tells its own story.  <\/p><p>  Where are we in this process?  For me, it all comes back to one thing.  From talking to local authority officials I believe they are out of kilter with officials of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The local authority officials with whom I deal are extremely concerned about a diminishing rates base.  They believe hiking rates will result in more businesses going to the wall.  They are adamant about this.  When I make this argument to officials of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, they do not seem to get it, which is a real difficulty.  That is exactly what will happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013100300017#S01400","speaker":"1091","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380799800,"counter":225,"content":"<p>As has been noted, we have spoken about this and the Valuation Office is aware of the position.  This arises from the fact that we have not had a revaluation for so long - it has not happened since 1988 - and much has changed since.  Relative values have altered and, in the likes of Waterford and Dungarvan, there has been significant change.  Some sectors are benefitting but some will face a very significant increase in rates based on current policy and what is happening with the Valuation Office.  These are policy questions so I must be careful about what I can say.  As Deputies know, the Valuation Office is independent and we do not interfere with it.  There is the question of how, once the Valuation Office does its job and we see an impact, the policy options are laid out to deal with consequences.  We have spoken about this before and it is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan.<\/p><p>  In the retail sector there will be significant change in demand.  We have spoken about different options and these issues must be taken up by the relevant Minister.  Whatever option is taken will have difficulties.  For example, those who would benefit from a change in rates will not be happy if changes are phased in over time, although those who face the increase would be happy.  There is a policy question that must consider where we are and whether there is any room to phase in the process over time or ameliorate some effects.  There is also a wider policy question about the time it has taken to do this and how to ensure, in future, that we have regular revaluation.  The Valuation (Amendment) Bill is working its way through the House and it stipulates that it should be done every five years, with self-assessment to speed up the process.  It is very important that in future we do not have such a long gap in revaluation and sudden changes.  The policy options are not great but there is a need to consider the impact on particular sectors to see if the system can formulate an option that could, over time, phase in changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013100300018#T00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1380799800,"counter":226,"content":"<p>The lack of foresight in policymakers concerns me.

I do not want to get into what could be a policy question but there is a different approach taken when rates must be merged, as will happen in Waterford, where there is ten years to do so, as opposed to a revaluation, as no such provision exists.

When the Department was split after the new Government took office and decided to change it, one of the decisions we made very quickly was that we would stay in the same building.  That is very important to ensure co-ordination.  The Department of Finance has control of one side of the budget and we have control of the other side, so our people talk all the time.  We need to work together on the budget, particularly at this time of the year.<\/p><p>  The costs of setting up the Department were negligible.  When the new Government was formed we had to accommodate two Ministers as opposed to one Minister, so that involved reconfiguring some offices and putting in place an appropriate change in the accommodation for the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  That did not cost much.  We had to get new signage for the Department, but those things did not cost much.  In terms of the overall numbers, we have 315 in the core Department and the Department of Finance has approximately the same number.  Between us, there has been some increase in numbers since the old Department of Finance, but it is not significant.  That reflects not necessarily the fact that we split but that the concerns reflected in the various reports about the capacity at the centre and the capacity of the Department meant we needed to increase resourcing.

That recommendation was made.  Basically, it relates to some of the recruitment you mentioned - you need to have professionals.

It deals with the relationships between Ministers and senior civil servants, with delegation and having accountability throughout the system.

This is a policy matter, which I will not discuss.  However, I will state that it is ridiculous that although we have one set of auditors in one location and another set somewhere else, it took action on the part of the Comptroller and Auditor General to reveal information on the cost of waste and issues relating to dumps.  Some &euro;119 million in taxpayers' money is at stake here.  We received the report in question and we are also aware of the &euro;80 million to &euro;90 million that the Poolbeg project has cost to date.  We are now being informed that we cannot investigate matters relating to the other big expenditure in the Department.  There is no public discussion about waste in local government or in respect of the figures relating to road and other projects.  The figure of &euro;119 million to which I refer came out of the blue.  This is a cost to the State for complete inefficiency on the part of local government.<\/p><p>  Something must be done in order to establish a relationship between this committee, local government and the Department in the context of its work.  I acknowledge that all of those before us play a very important role.  I also acknowledge the good things that have come about.  However, there is a stubbornness within the system which allows these overspends or inefficiencies to occur.  Issues of this nature have been highlighted in successive reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I can provide examples.  Mr. Watt referred to bringing in a paper and dealing with it.  This committee deals with specifics, with the fallout from the system.  If that did not happen, there would be less tax to pay and, perhaps, more money to spend.<\/p><p>  Some weeks ago representatives from the Valuation Office came before us.  I inquired about the valuation tribunal - something about which I previously knew nothing - and was informed that it costs &euro;650,000 to run.  The chairman of that tribunal is paid &euro;555 per day and the vice chairman receives &euro;450 per day.  A day in this context might be for a sitting or however else they might describe it.  Members of this tribunal are each paid &euro;359 per day.  If there is a second sitting, the rate drops to &euro;154, &euro;133 and &euro;107 per day for the chairman, vice chairman and members, respectively.  Those are handy old rates of pay.  I asked the representatives from the Valuation Office why the individuals are being paid these amounts.  I inquired whether it is because they are so well qualified and because it is so difficult to find others with their level of expertise that they must be paid at these rates.  In response, I was referred to Mr. Watts's Department.  When I asked the question I was informed that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform agrees these matters and that perhaps I should put my concerns to it.

I would also be perfectly happy to listen to criticisms of the system.  I have done this before and I have no difficulty doing it again.  With regard to local government, I am in favour of merging the committees and of the Comptroller and Auditor General taking on the role to which the Chairman referred.  I have no problem with that - it is a policy issue - but it is my view that it should happen.  I do not know why we do not have a single audit service for the system.  However, there are 1,700 councillors throughout the country and is it not also their job to ensure that the local authorities on which they sit expend money in an appropriate way?  They are responsible for setting rates and local authorities are half funded by means of commercial rates.  There is a role here for officials from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and for an audit service.  However, 1,700 councillors also have a role to play.  It is the job of the latter to ensure that money is spent correctly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013100300022#X00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1380802200,"counter":313,"content":"<p>It is our job to investigate when we see money being spent poorly, regardless of the number of councillors.

I made reference to the Poolbeg project, the cost of which is running at &euro;80 million to &euro;90 million, and the matter we are currently discussing, the cost of which stands at &euro;119 million.

It is important, however, to acknowledge what has been done and to note the progress which has taken place, which I have done and which we are happy to hear.  I also think it is a very unfair representation of the public sector and what goes on within it to take a report produced by the Comptroller and Auditor General and identify issues in ten, 12 or 15 chapters.  Where waste is identified, details must be set out and we must learn lessons.  Waste is not acceptable.  However, it must be put in the context of the overall system and the scale thereof.  No matter what the committee, the Department or the Comptroller and Auditor General do, there are going to be mistakes.  There will also be projects that will not work because we are dealing with uncertainty and underperformance.  We must learn all the time and do the best we can.  We must also, however, place all this in the context of the scale of the system.<\/p><p>  I referred earlier to procurement.  Perhaps the Chairman does not like the fact, but a particular report was compiled that shows that 99.9% of goods, services, etc., were procured in line with procedures and in the context of the rules relating to competition.  Alongside the criticism relating to the &euro;80 million that was not procured in line with that to which I refer, there should have been a comment to the effect that 99.9% of the remainder of spending was within the guidelines.  I am of the view it is very important to say that.  If we say that taxes are not being collected in a certain area or that fraud is occurring in another, it is very important to contextualise and to explain what is the position of the relevant body or Department.  It is also important to place any incident in the context of the overall spend or the overall revenue being collected.  It is important to make that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013100300022#X01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1380802200,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I am sure the Comptroller and Auditor General can answer that criticism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013100300022#X01300","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380802200,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I was going to come in on this point at the end in any event.  In the context of the element of procurement that is reported and in respect of which I identified a difficulty, it is not correct to say that the other 99.9% is clear.  What I pointed out in my report and again in my opening statement is that there is actually under-reporting by Departments.  That is the first problem.  There is a particular difficulty with the HSE in this regard and we have reported on that matter previously.  However, there is a much more serious problem that is not fully accounted for in the figures.  In addition, many agencies are not included within the terms of Circular 40\/02.

That is the whole point of having the system set up in the way it is.  However, I simply do not agree with the idea, for example, in this case, that there is material non-compliance with procurement.  If that is the case, it has not been demonstrated in the report that I have read, because what I have read shows that, excluding the An Post contract, there is &euro;80 million out of an overall amount.  While the Comptroller and Auditor General might state his office did not look at the entire &euro;9 billion and that it is less than that, based on what I have seen, it cannot be established that there is material non-compliance in procurement.<\/p><p>  I will be perfectly blunt with the Chairman about my worry in this regard.  The coverage of these issues and of the report published this week outlined a litany of waste and of abuse and a system that is malfunctioning and dysfunctional, which I do not think is a fair reading of the report.  I am not criticising, because neither the committee nor the Comptroller and Auditor General are responsible for the media coverage, but people must develop a sense of balance and perspective.  While absolutely every single issue of waste must be identified and we must act on such an issue, it must be put in the context of the overall spend that is under review and the size of that overall spend.  This is the point I am making because people have a sense of confidence, or a lack thereof, in the system based on how a report is reported and, in my view, that is not fair.  It is not what the Comptroller and Auditor General is saying and it gives a distorted view of the performance of the system.  Let us have a report alongside this report that talks about all the successes, all the achievements all the improvements, all the productivity grains and all the examples of where money is properly spent.

I went to the bother of driving down to County Tipperary to see a particular project because, like Mr. Watt, I am hands on and like to see what is going on.  The taxpayer, through different Departments, has invested &euro;4 million in that particular project, which now is locked up.  The fine timber floors for which the taxpayer paid are now popping up and bending all over the place.  The response of the State is to ignore the &euro;4 million and to investigate &euro;150,000.  My request to Mr. Watt's official on that day was to come back to tell the committee what could be done to save the &euro;4 million already invested by the taxpayer.  The taxpayer does not understand the reason the &euro;3.3 million for the State Pathologist's office was written off and the site's development not completed.<\/p><p>  Mr. Watt can suggest that one puts together all the nice things and he gave himself a glowing report this morning.  While I do not disagree with some of it, I do disagree with other parts of it.  However, this is the issue with regard to the system and it just continues.  On the simple matter of paying a person, a State agency paid a person for six years at a cost of &euro;300,000 in spite of that person declaring he should not be paid as he was with another agency.  The work of this committee may dwell on the negatives in the system but unless members understand the complexities of these negatives and the costs to the State, one will never get the positive side of the balance sheet correct.  No one here suggests that positive things are not happening, because of course they are and officials do a good job.  However, one must look at this and conclude there is something wrong with our system that allows this to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013100300023#Y00500","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380802800,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I am delighted the Chairman acknowledges there are positives in the system, because that is the reality of what is happening.

I must state straight up that Mr. Watt is being overly sensitive and I will tell him the reason his actions prove this.  Mr. Watt spoke of the &euro;50 billion that is expended by the State and the good work that is done.  That will be debated in the Chamber during the budget and Estimates debates.  In the case of each line Department, a Minister will come in for as long as it takes to explain to everyone in the Oireachtas all the good work being done in his or her Department.  Members have had terrible discussions on the Croke Park or Haddington Road agreements over the years on the good work that is being done.  That is all being done.  One element of the overall work of Members of the Oireachtas is to consider the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Consequently, the context with which Mr. Watt is concerned is being set on every other day of the year in the course of Oireachtas business, at Oireachtas committees and by Oireachtas chairs.  Members come to this and Mr. Watt should give credit to the people on this side of the House.<\/p><p>  Interestingly, I refer to the reason I believe Mr. Watt is overly sensitive on this particular issue.  Chapter 13 in this report concerns procurement without a competitive process.  I was the first speaker up today and did not mention it.

I did not mention it because I could see the merits of what Mr. McCarthy was trying to point out.  I did not need to quiz him on it because no more needed to be said.  However, Mr. Watt has mounted up as an issue my first statement this morning because he appears to be somewhat sensitive about it.  He brought it up a little while ago and then brought up with the Comptroller and Auditor General by questioning the reason there is a report on this issue.  Mr. Watt is the only person to have brought up this issue today.  He has done so three times and it might get coverage solely because he is a bit sensitive.  I was happy to see the context in which this took place, to accept that context and to accept that it involved small sums of money.  There is not even a suggestion that the money was lost.  There are just reasons that it was not competitive.

I wish to raise the issue of public private partnerships, PPP.  I may have to ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to help me on this issue also.  I am a little confused by a footnote in his report.  It refers to future commitments in respect of public private partnerships which are estimated at about &euro;4 billion as follows: &euro;1 billion for education, &euro;500 million for court services; &euro;658 million for the OPW; almost &euro;1.7 billion for national roads; and a small amount for environment projects.  The footnote indicates that the amounts shown for projects sanctioned by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government such as water services reflect the upfront payments, but they do not include expenditure under the contracts by the relevant local authority or the outstanding commitments that have to be met by the local authorities from their own budgets.  The report produced by the Comptroller and Auditor General outlines the commitments up to a figure of &euro;4 billion and everybody reading the report will take it at face value.  I look at the amounts for outstanding commitments in all of the Departments I have just mentioned and the ballpark figure is that &euro;2.5 billion has been paid, but there are outstanding commitments of &euro;4.5 billion.  In rough terms, there is almost twice as much outstanding in the next 20 to 30 years as has been paid to date, but when we look at the figure the Comptroller and Auditor General has supplied and because he is not the local government auditor, he has shown that &euro;594 million has been committed for water services.  That leads me to believe the relevant local authorities have at least &euro;1 billion of future commitments.  I am quite sure of this because I know from my own local authority the scale of what is involved which is included in the projects list.  This is definitely a figure of &euro;1 billion of commitments in public private partnerships that is not reflected in the figure of &euro;4 billion included in the Comptroller and Auditor General's accounts.  Some effort must be made by the Secretary General or the Comptroller and Auditor General to give the committee a proper report by getting the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to get the figures from local authorities.  It would have been helpful to have had the round figure.  The figure should be closer to &euro;5.5 billion.

The local authority water projects are design-build-operate as opposed to design-build-operate-finance.  If I understand them correctly, the capital costs of projects are funded from the Exchequer and the operating contract is for 20 years.  It is the contract for the operating part that is not reflected in the numbers.  It is not of the order of &euro;1 billion; it is less than this, but we will find out the figure for the Deputy and come back to him with it.  These contracts, design-build-operate, are different from the classic PPP contracts, in which the capital and operating costs are funded by a unitary payment over 20 to 25 years such as in the case of a school.  There are questions as to whether they are PPP contracts.  The operating element of the contract is a commitment, a liability.  I will check the amount for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013100300024#Z00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1380803400,"counter":338,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Watt.
