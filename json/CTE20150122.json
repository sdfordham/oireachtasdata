It has been incorporated with a number of other awards bodies into a single body called Quality and Qualifications Authority of Ireland.  When FETAC existed, it had a premises in the East Point Business Park which was rationalised when the amalgamation happened.  As it had a lease that ran until 2017, FETAC was tied into the payment commitment.  At the point where the bodies amalgamated, it sub-let the property but did not get the full value back.  As such, under accounting standards, it was required to recognise at an earlier date the loss that will accrue over the four years to 2017 in its financial statements.  This has resulted in the provision of &euro;1.6 million in respect of the loss.  FETAC had also made repairs and improvements to the property which it was depreciating over the life of the lease, but because it will no longer get the benefit of that, it must also accelerate the depreciation.

It is the funding authority for the universities, teacher training colleges, institutes of technology and a number of other designated education bodies and carries out a related oversight and regulatory role.  It also has wide advisory powers throughout the third level education sector.  The HEA disbursed over &euro;1.2 billion in grants to third level institutions in 2013.  Most of its income comes directly from Vote 26 for Education and Skills.<\/p>  <p>  I have issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the HEA's 2013 financial statements.  However, as in prior years, the audit opinion draws attention to the HEA practice of funding certain universities for notional employer pension contributions in respect of members of pay-as-you-go model pension schemes, and also allows those universities to retain the related employee pension contributions.  The universities account for the accumulated funds on their balance sheets as sums due to the HEA.  The balances held in the five universities concerned stood at &euro;125 million at 30 September 2013 &mdash; up from &euro;94 million at end September 2012.  The HEA intends that the funds will be used by the universities to pay certain pension liabilities in the future, and thus they reduce the level of Exchequer grant funding that it will have to provide in the future.  The HEA does not recognise the funds as assets on its own balance sheet.<\/p>  <p>  The National College of Art and Design is one of the colleges that fall within the funding and oversight remit of the HEA.  The college has existed in various forms for over 250 years.  Its current structure was established under the National College of Art and Design Act 1971 and it is governed by a board appointed by the Minister for Education and Skills.  Since 2011, it has been a recognised college of University College Dublin, UCD, which now validates the college's degrees.<\/p>  <p>  In the 2012-13 academic year, the college had almost a thousand full-time students, and a significant programme of part-time continuing education courses.  It has an annual turnover currently in the region of &euro;20 million.  In recent years, the college has received annual grant funding of around &euro;10 million from the Higher Education Authority.<\/p>  <p>  The timely presentation of independently-audited annual financial statements is a key mechanism in ensuring effective public accountability in respect of State funding.  Section 15 of the 1971 Act that reconstituted the college requires the board to prepare annual financial statements and to present them to me for audit.  The Act also requires the college to report to the Minister on an annual basis on its proceedings during the previous academic year.<\/p>  <p>  Significant delays have occurred in the presentation by the board of draft financial statements for audit.  In addition, there have been delays by the college in the provision of adequate explanations and information to allow audits to be completed.  The result has been the elapse of up to 39 months between the end of the period of account and the audit certification of financial statements, as indicated in the figure now on screen.<\/p>  <p>  My Office has also repeatedly raised with the college our concerns about the adequacy of controls and governance arrangements arising in the course of successive audits.  These included no evidence of competitive tendering for almost all goods and services procured by the college; no evidence over many years that the board had carried out required annual reviews on the effectiveness of the system of internal financial control; and a minimal role for the college's audit committee and an inadequate internal audit function.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, it was evident during the 2009 and 2010 audits that the college's senior management and board were not addressing the accounting and governance deficiencies or taking adequate mitigating actions in a timely way.  As a result, I decided to report formally to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann my concerns about the ongoing accountability and governance deficiencies at the college.  This has resulted in the special report that is before the committee today.<\/p>  <p>  In parallel with the drafting of the report, and in order not to allow a further build-up of audit arrears, we sought to proceed with the audit of the college's financial statements for the academic year ended 30 September 2011.  Having received the draft financial statements in December 2013, we started the audit fieldwork in February 2014 but had to suspend the audit because we found that the draft financial statements contained material errors, and not all the information and explanations required for the audit could be provided to us.  The audit recommenced in July 2014 but significant issues remained to be resolved.  <\/p>  <p>         This required additional audit testing and the provision of advice to the college to assist it in finalising the financial statements.  I eventually signed off on the audit on 28 December 2014.  Significant weaknesses in the college's accounting system, compounded by the departure from the college of experienced accounting staff, resulted in considerable challenges during the audit of the 2011 financial statements.  By carrying out substantial additional testing, the audit was able to gain reasonable assurance in respect of areas such as State grant income, student fee income, expenses, debtors, creditors and cash and bank balances.  However, in the end, the books and records of the college did not enable the financial statements to be readily and properly audited in all material respects.  Specifically, I qualified my opinion on the financial statements because the audit was unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the amounts recognised in respect of staff pension liabilities, or to support fully the breakdown of certain income and expenditure classifications.<\/p> <p> The accounting and governance weaknesses have been acknowledged by the board and, as explained in the 2011 statement on internal financial control, comprehensive steps are now being taken by the college to address them.  Progress in implementing the required improvements will be monitored by my office in future audits.  I welcome the formal commitment expressed by the board in that regard and my office has undertaken to work constructively with the college to help it to bring its financial accounting up to date as speedily as possible.  The special report also examines the response of the HEA to the ongoing delay in the presentation of audited financial statements and other governance issues in the college.  Annual governance statements were submitted to the HEA by the college each year from 2009 to 2013.  These disclosed the college's ongoing accounting delays and were not fully compliant with the HEA's requirements for such governance statements, but there is no evidence that concerns about the college's governance were highlighted to the board of the HEA.  While the HEA has stated that it did ask college staff from time to time about the delays in accounts production, in my view, the HEA should have been more active in requiring the college to remedy the situation.  It seems that it was only after my office formally sought the views of the HEA on the matter that it escalated the issue to the appropriate level with the college.  More generally, my office has commenced an examination of oversight by the HEA of higher education institutions.  This looks at the oversight framework the HEA has in place and how well the higher education institutions are adhering to it.  We are also examining how the HEA processes the information it receives from the institutions and the action it takes on foot of that analysis.  I expect to prepare a special report on the results of that examination in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015012200002#J01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421920800,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

The Department of Education and Skills is very concerned with a number of issues arising from this report.  The Department is concerned at the failure of the college to comply with the code of governance for third level institutions issued to them in 2009.  The college has been informed of the seriousness of the Department&rsquo;s concerns.  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General has highlighted the level of non-compliance across a range of areas such as the role of the audit committee and the absence of annual reviews of the effectiveness of the systems of internal financial control and procurement.  This level of non-compliance is not acceptable, regardless of the financial constraints on NCAD, which are no different from those experienced by all other third level institutions.  In carrying out their duties, the governing authority and the executive of the college must place a high priority on financial and governance accountability.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that NCAD has educated many students down through the years and continues to do so, in this specialised field, through what have been challenging times for all areas including the education sector.  Notwithstanding that, the college is in receipt of substantial State funding and, as a State body, is required to operate in line with relevant Government procedures in relation to governance and accountability.  The Department has instructed the HEA to continue to work closely with NCAD and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General to ensure the implementation of the recommendations in the special report.  The Department of Education and Skills, in conjunction with the HEA, will put in place a robust mechanism to continuously review the implementation of these recommendations. <\/p>  <p>  The report has shown up significant weaknesses in the processes employed by the HEA in this case to oversee the operation of the NCAD.  These weaknesses are also a cause of concern to the Department.  They build upon weaknesses already identified in processes within the HEA following reviews by the Comptroller and Auditor General and meetings of the Public Accounts Committee and subsequent recommendations, which were made in October 2014.  Subsequent to these reviews, meetings and recommendations, the Department of Education and Skills has been reviewing with the HEA the oversight arrangements in place within the sector on these and a range of other issues. Some initial amendments in oversight arrangements have been initiated by the HEA and the Department.  The HEA has recently set out a governance and regulatory framework for the sector which is to be agreed and implemented commencing in April of this year.  This includes the strengthening of the HEA&rsquo;s executive processes in relation to oversight on governance and internal controls in the institutions. <\/p>  <p>  My own Department is in the process of strengthening its role in relation to governance and accountability oversight of all institutions and bodies right across the education sector, not just at third level. We will continue to work with all stakeholders, including the Comptroller and Auditor General, to strive for improvements in processes so that the utilisation of public funds is done within a framework of high standards of accountability, compliance and oversight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015012200002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;"},{"type":"speech","time":1421920800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;.

The weaknesses identified in the report, although specific to NCAD, serve to alert the HEA and the higher education system to the need for constant vigilance to ensure that processes designed for accountability are fit for purpose and operating as intended.<\/p>  <p>  It is well established internationally that higher education institutions are most effective when they have high levels of autonomy over their internal affairs.  This is well established policy and practice in Ireland, with statutory backing, and was most recently endorsed by the national strategy for higher education.  The counterbalance to autonomy, however, has to be an effective system of accountability for outcomes from the sector and for funding.  The HEA has a key role in this as a part of a system of accountability for public funding and expenditure, which also includes the institutions themselves with primary responsibility and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. <\/p>  <p>  The principles of good governance and accountability have been well established for many years in the higher education sector in primary legislation such as the Universities Act 1997 and the Institutes of Technology Act 2006.  These have been supported by the publication and adoption of a code of governance for Irish universities and a code of governance for the institutes of technology sector.  The principles of governance that apply to these groups of institutions also apply to all higher education institutions funded by the HEA, including NCAD. <\/p>  <p>  I do not want to sound blas&eacute;, but no system of accountability will guarantees success at all times and for all institutions, and the report shows up flaws in the HEA's processes, both in our examination of audited accounts from a governance perspective and in an over-reliance by us, at the very least, on the accuracy of governance reports received from higher education institutions.  In response to the new mandate given to the HEA under the national strategy, the HEA board has, since earlier last year, been considering our governance and regulatory role and the measures necessary to enhance it and to reflect our new mandate.  The agreed measures, which are at present the subject of consultation with the sector - as the Secretary General says, we hope to implement them in April this year - will go some way towards addressing the weakness identified in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  They include: the submission of annual statements of governance and internal control no later than six months after the end of each financial year; expansion of the format for required returns; more detailed analysis by us of institutional responses and appropriate follow-up; and the introduction of a programme of rolling reviews by the HEA, which would cover specific elements of governance processes to provide assurance that they are operating effectively and to assist in the development of best practice approaches. <\/p>  <p>  It should be also noted that the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is currently carrying out a review of the HEA&rsquo;s general governance and regulatory role.  This is a most welcome development and is opportune as we undertake our expanded mandate under the national strategy.  <\/p>  <p>         However, we need to consider if we should go further than the measures about which we are in consultation with the sector, given the findings relating to NCAD.  In particular, we will now consider with the Department of Education and Skills - and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General to an appropriate extent - whether we should exercise a formal audit function, either generally or on a spot-check basis.  This will be a significant extension to our current role and if it were to proceed, it would be desirable to underpin it in legislation and it would have some resource implications.<\/p> <p> More immediately, however, the impact will be achieved arising from the recent reform of the HEA&rsquo;s funding role to include a performance-related element.  As part of this development, performance funding will take into account institutional compliance with governance requirements and procedures and other statutory requirements.  For example, if an institution was found to be in serious breach of governance requirements and was considered to have made inadequate efforts to correct such breaches, funding could be withheld and will be withheld in the future. <\/p> <p> The HEA is greatly concerned with the issues identified in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, both as they relate to NCAD and as they relate to the HEA.  Higher education institutions make a very significant economic, social and cultural contribution to Irish life, but in order to do so and, most important, to retain public confidence, it is essential that they have effective systems of governance and accountability in place.  I acknowledge that the college is now actively addressing the issues identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General and is taking action to bring its processes for the production of accounts, as well as its procurement and internal audit policies, up to best practice.  However, given the significance of the findings in this special report and the fact that the HEA has previously relied on assurances from the college which were subsequently found to be inaccurate, the HEA will conduct a full review of the implementation by NCAD of the full range of measures now under way to address the findings and recommendations in this report and to assure ourselves that the governance and accountability procedures in the college are in line with best practice.  That review will have to dovetail with whatever review the Comptroller and Auditor General is carrying out.<\/p> <p> I am also available to discuss any matters of interest or concern in respect of the HEA accounts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015012200002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Boland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421920800,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Boland.

We accept the recommendations in the report and the failings are now being comprehensively addressed by management and the board.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note the backdrop to this report.  The college was going through a period of substantial change in the education sector, resulting in significant challenges and new pressures for a college of our scale and capacity.  From 2008 and 2009 onwards, at a time when the continued existence of the college was under question, the college focused on sustaining its provision of excellence in art and design education for increasing numbers of students in Ireland.  This focus was successful and our student numbers increased by 33% over that period.  Funding was used for the purposes intended.  However, sufficient attention was not paid to reform of procedures and compliance issues over the same period.<\/p>  <p>  In responding to the Comptroller and Auditor General, NCAD&rsquo;s management and current board which was appointed 2012, have worked to transform how the college does business while maintaining, of necessity, in a changing landscape, a focus on the positioning and the development of the college as a national institution working to stated national objectives.<\/p>  <p>  Specific steps that we have taken in response to this report include: the introduction of new policies and procedures for procurement; reconfiguration of our entire audit process; and the completion of new tenders for a range of goods and services.

We inherited a set of customs and practices which I think needed reform.  The new board, with my appointment, had indicated that a change agenda was what it was interested in, led by academic change for the institution in terms of how the education landscape operated and how NCAD worked within that landscape.  That focus became the dominant issue in that period.  The year 2009 was a very significant one because it was the first year of the beginning of the cuts in the sector and a very substantial cut to the NCAD.  We also had to negotiate new validation for the courses we were offering students because the threat of abolition was hanging over the National University of Ireland, our validating body.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the brief given to me by the board we embarked on a process of developing a new internal course structure, moving from a four-year to a three-year degree.

They were as follows: to sustain the ongoing education of the students who were enrolled; the policy issues on the future of the college; and the fundamental issue of the validation of degrees.

The other members of the committee have dealt with that.  I do not want to stick with that.  I am going to get into the merger between the institutes of technology in Waterford and Carlow.  The historic governance issues within Waterford Institute of Technology, which have been very well publicised over the past few years, have been dealt with by this committee for a number of years.  We had recommendations issued to us a few months ago with regard to the institute.  It is fair to say - we can ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to comment on this - that governance issues in the institute which have been going on for a couple of years have been dealt with, most recently last year.  It seems to me that this being is the case - it is well known, documented and publicised - the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education and Skills would have paid particular attention to a merger process that has amounted to &euro;380,000 or &euro;400,000.  I was struck by the fact that the merger process involving Cork Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology, Tralee has cost significantly less than that.  By all accounts, the merger process in the Cork and Tralee case is more successful and is continuing.<\/p>  <p>  We have a remit.  We have absolute jurisdiction to ask what happened with regard to this merger process.  What went wrong?  Mr. Boland has characterised the case of the National College of Art and Design as \"certainly not an attractive picture\".  I suggest there is more than one unattractive picture here.  I am thinking of the now failed attempt to merge the institutes of technology in Waterford and Carlow.  I will ask Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; and Mr. Boland about that merger process.  I want them to start by bringing us through it from point to point.  Can they set out their personal, professional and organisational involvement?  How did it begin?  How did their involvement proceed?  Why did it break down?  It is particularly interesting for me because if I am correct - maybe the Comptroller and Auditor General can back me up - it was mentioned in a recommendation that the involvement of the Higher Education Authority was lacking in the case of previous issues, including financial issues, when it came to Waterford Institute of Technology.

There is still scope and it is still a feasible project.<\/p>  <p>  I will try to sketch out the history.  We go back to the publication of the Hunt report on the national strategy for higher education that recommended the establishment of technological universities as a positive way to allow institutes of technology develop to university level.  One of the other objectives of that policy approach was to consolidate the institute of technology sector because there were several small institutions, in the interests of quality and scale.  Moving on, and over a period of time, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, published a landscape for the higher education sector which included the potential for a number of technological universities to be formed, including a university of the south east encompassing Waterford and Carlow.  That was accepted as ministerial and Government policy and therefore passed to the institutions for implementation.<\/p>  <p>  One of the very important aspects of mergers of institutions, and it forms part of national policy, is that forced mergers of institutions do not work.  We have seen how it does work.  It is extremely important that the institutions themselves quickly develop a shared interest and vision for what the institution will ultimately be.

We cannot be part of the development of a technological university because we have to review, make a decision and advise the Minister as to whether any particular entity should be a technological university.  There would be a conflict of interest.<\/p>  <p>  We have a very direct and lively interest in ensuring in the first instance that the merger of any of the institutes is done successfully.  To that extent the HEA has allocated some funding, by no means the amount sought or required, for merger activity but in the context of the financial difficulties generally it cannot be and never will be enough.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of Waterford-Carlow, as with all the other mergers, and not just the technological university but also the important merger of Dublin City University, St. Patrick's and Mater Dei, we have kept in close touch with the institutions to assess progress.

We have increased our undergraduate student numbers from 780 to 1,033, representing a 33% increase.  We have increased our first year intake by approximately 40% in the past two years.  We are responding to the review processes that took place between 2009 and 2012 or 2013 by transitioning the college to a new level of academic and learning activity.  One feature of this was the instigation of a development process in 2011 and 2012.  The increased commercialisation opportunities that resulted from this has, in the past year, spun out two small companies for the first time in the college's history, which the Deputy referenced.  A further embryonic company is emerging in an incubator unit that we have developed.<\/p>  <p>  The college has been in a transformative mode for several years.

Understandably, when there was a tsunami of issues facing the board, as the director pointed out, it takes some time to see where are the fundamentals.  I would have been aware of the inadequacy of the infrastructure for reporting at a very early stage.  I am also aware that this has taken time.  In fairness, in any contact I have had with Mr. Boland, the HEA or the Department of Education and Skills in general, there has been an understanding that there are issues.

I was going to let this matter go because time was running out and people had gone into a lot of detail.  However, I cannot let it go.<\/p>  <p>  I have sat on the board of the governing body of an institute of technology.  Therefore, I know of the dealings that board had with the HEA.  I also know how conscientious the board and staff of that institute are in terms of governance, minding the books and looking after the college.  Any third level institute that could state it had a 33% increase would be delighted with itself because that is what colleges want to do.  For the NCAD to state insufficient attention was paid to the reform of procedures and compliance is, to my mind, not good enough.  It does not tell me why it is in this position.  Did somebody just not bother?  Did someone think that because the problem was too big and growing we should wait?  Why did we have to wait for the Comptroller and Auditor General to bring the matter to attention?  It was after this that the HEA came on board.  I know from my dealings with it that it was on top of the matter in its dealings with the institute to which I referred and that it was in contact with it on a regular basis.  Therefore, why did matters have to reach this stage with the college?  The committee acts as a watchdog, but it is not good enough for the college to state procedures are now in place and that everything will be wonderful.  We are here to examine why this issue arose and learn specific details.  Why did the college get into this mess in the first place?  Did someone just not bother doing his or her job?  For the most part, members of governing bodies work very hard on a voluntary basis.  The management and staff of an institute deal with these matters too; therefore, somebody is responsible.

This matter has to do with sequencing.  As discussed, these problems emerged in the records for the early 2000s and continued until 2008-09.  In particular, the accounting issues were referred to in the terms of reference for the past five years.  This is a period in which the matter could have been addressed.  As our chairman attested, there was a raft of issues to do with strategic reviews on the college's agenda with which we had to deal.  They had to do with fundamental issues such as validation, academic alliances and amalgamation.  Cuts took place at the same time and there was a brief from the new board to create an enhanced academic profile for the college.  All of these matters absorbed everybody's energy at the time.  What we thought would help to address the issue, coming out of 2011 and heading into 2012, would be a move from discussions with UCD about an academic alliance to discussions about a merger.  There was the identification in the memorandum of understanding on an academic alliance that back office synergy would extend to issues to do with procurement and audits.  This did not include HR functions because of data protection issues but did include other back office functions.  That did not happen, however, because we moved to discussions about a merger.  Of course, in a merger all of these issues are contained within a larger institutional model.  In terms of a merger, we ran out of time because the previous president of UCD had reached the end of his tenure.  The new president waited until he had put in place his own strategic plan, which he did last autumn.  That meant that we had lost between 12 and 18 months.  When issues were raised in 2012 by the Comptroller and Auditor General, specifically these issues, we thought we would address them strategically as part of the process with UCD.  Clearly, that methodology was inadequate.  That is why the sequencing led to the current circumstances with which we are dealing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015012200002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Declan McGonagle"},{"type":"speech","time":1421920800,"counter":432,"content":"<p>I accept what has been said.

Therefore, I know that one does not move on to the next item until a matter has been sorted out.  I cannot understand how the college moved on, it stated it had a lot of things on its plate, that it was overwhelmed and could not sort the matter out.  From my experience, that would not have been the case.  In the case of the board of which I was a member, one could not leave until a matter being discussed had been dealt with.  It is shocking that this problem has lasted so long.  It has been said there are assurances and that things have been put in place.  We received assurances before and obviously they did not work out.  What is the penalty if a matter is not dealt with properly within a proper period?  Will funding be withdrawn?  If that is the case, it is inappropriate because withdrawal will not affect the board, staff and management but the students, which is not right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015012200002#W00400","speaker":"1194"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421920800,"counter":433,"content":"<p>First, I will respond to the Deputy's question about what went wrong.  From the point of view of HEA, we have to be honest and say the Deputy's question must be addressed to us also.  In general terms, there was over-confidence and over-reliance on assurances given to us.  That confidence was based on respect - some might say the respect was excessive - for the autonomy of institutions.  It was also based on our experience of the conscientiousness with which, in general, higher institutions responded to their governance obligations.  What is to be done about it in the future?  The Secretary General discussed the matter earlier.<\/p>  <p>  We have to use our funding in a sensible way to ensure that not alone do institutions achieve the objectives they are required to achieve but also that they abide by the requirements of governance.  We would be talking in the most extreme situation about up to 10% of funding being removed from an institution.  In that context, one would have to make judgments about the impact of any such reduction in funding.  Certainly, a message does need to be sent - such a message has been sent to the sector many times - that it is legitimate for the Government to use the instrument of funding in ensuring institutions do what they have signed up to do, in both academic and administrative terms.  There is legislative provision, particularly for institutes of technology, where there is a failure of governance involving the removal of governing boards and putting in place commissions to run them.  The legislation was operated on one occasion many years ago.  I have every expectation and some confidence that the NCAD will do what is necessary in a timely way.  Regardless of what the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General chooses to do, the HEA will conduct a review in the very near future - we have to assess when the time is right to do so - to make sure everything is in order.  We will report to the Department on that matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015012200002#W00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Boland"},{"type":"speech","time":1421920800,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Boland and wish him well in achieving that aim, but red warning lights should be flashing.

Mr. Boland is at the helm for 11 years and the lessons should have been learned a long time ago with regard to Waterford.  I am from Waterford and I like wearing the jersey but there comes a point where one has to ask some questions about how places are being run, whether they are in one's constituency or not.  I get the strong impression that the two entities involved in this merger did not have a clue as to what was going on.  There was form here with regard to governance, as the Chairman said, and there should have been a heightened sense of activity or scrutiny when it came to the merger process.  The mistake that has been made, to a certain extent, in my opinion, is that it is now being dished off to Mr. Kelly.  Good luck to him with his work.  This should have resided with both organisations at a very senior level until a resolution or solution to this had been put together.  Once again it is being dished off and reports forthcoming.

By way of introduction, the NTMA is designated as the State Claims Agency, SCA, when performing the claims management and risk management functions delegated to it under the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000.  The SCA's principal objectives are to ensure that the State's liabilities in respect of personal injury and property damage claims and the expenses of the SCA in respect of their management are contained at the lowest achievable level and to implement targeted personal injury and property damage risk work programmes to mitigate litigation risk in State authorities and health care enterprises to reduce the cost of future litigation against the State.  The SCA's remit covers personal injury and third-party property damage risks and claims relating to certain State authorities, including the State itself, Ministers, the Attorney General, health care enterprises, the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, prison governors, community and comprehensive schools and various bodies.<\/p> <p>  In October 2013, the Government delegated to the SCA the management of personal injury claims concerning the ingestion of the medicinal products Celvapan and Pandemrix.  In April 2014, the SCA's remit was further extended with the delegation to it by Government of the management of personal injury and third-party property damage claims in respect of an additional 61 public bodies, bringing the total number with the SCA's remit from 56 to 117.<\/p> <p>  We have 2,840 current clinical claims under management.  The estimated contingent liability in respect of those claims is &euro;1.159 billion.  Clinical claims are managed under a number of separate schemes by the SCA.  Under the main scheme, the clinical indemnity scheme, the State has assumed responsibility for the indemnification and management of clinical negligence claims arising from the diagnosis, treatment and care of patients in public health care enterprises.  The SCA resolved 487 clinical claims during 2014 at a cost of &euro;70 million.  The SCA achieved significant savings in the management of personal injury claims in 2014.  An independent actuarial assessment projected that &euro;202 million would be required during the year to cover both the cost of resolving claims and managing ongoing active claims.  The net cost, taking account of successful recoveries from third parties, was &euro;104.6 million, which was a saving of roughly 48% compared with the actuarial projection.  We received 609 new clinical claims in 2014.  Maternity services related claims, which are largely obstetric claims, accounted for 23% of all new claims and 61% of the estimated liability of all new claims due to the high values associated with these types of claims.<\/p> <p>  On the number of claims received by specialty and cost and the cost of claims resolved, the average cost of personal injury clinical claims resolved in 2014, which includes awards, settlements and related legal and other costs, was on average &euro;140,000 compared with &euro;67,000 in 2009.  We point out that this increase is mainly due to the lag effect of 2,500 consultants whose claims were previously handled by medical defence organisations joining the clinical indemnity scheme from February 2004.  Inevitably, this has resulted in a significant increase in the number and severity of claims.  In maternity services cases, particularly those involving brain injury to infants, there is typically a period of five to seven years between the date of the adverse event which gives rise to a claim and the date of resolution of the claim.  An additional factor in the higher average cost per claim was the High Court decision in a 2009 precedent case to increase by 38.5% the level of general damages in catastrophic injuries cases from &euro;325,000 to &euro;450,000.  Legal fee costs have increased in conjunction with award settlement costs.  The table with my presentation sets out the detail in the years 2008 to 2014 of all the claims that have been resolved.<\/p> <p>  Under the clinical indemnity scheme, the SCA has responsibility for indemnifying consultants in full-time and off-site private practice, by reference to the caps arrangements, in respect of clinical claims which exceed certain limits or caps.  The caps arrangements and their cost to date to the clinical indemnity scheme are more fully described in the submission we gave with this opening address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012200002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciaran Breen"},{"type":"speech","time":1421919000,"counter":681,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Breen.

I thank the committee for the opportunity to present to it today.  We absolutely appreciate the difficulty that our subscription rates may cause some consultants.  The subscription increases that we felt it necessary to apply over recent years have certainly made the rates significant and difficult for some consultants to afford.  We appreciate that this may be causing them concern and potentially driving them away from practice, which may put more pressure on the State.  We feel we have to charge the subscription rates we believe are necessary to cover the costs we are incurring on behalf of our members.  We have to be financially secure as we are providing an indemnity to them for many years into the future.<\/p><p>It can be five, ten, 15 or even 20 years, in extreme cases, between an incident and the payment of compensation.  MPS, the Medical Protection Society, is a not-for-profit organisation that does not have shareholders but is a mutual company owned by its members.  All moneys paid by them are retained in the organisation for their benefit.  It has been operating for 123 years, providing membership in Ireland for 100 years.  It is the world&rsquo;s leading protection organisation for doctors, dentists and health care professionals, protecting and supporting the professional interests of more than 290,000 members around the world and more than 16,000 in Ireland.  MPS is committed to Ireland and will stay for as long as its members wish.  It is not an insurance company, and all benefits of membership are discretionary.<\/p><p> MPS provides indemnity for clinical negligence claims, a range of additional supports for our members who may be subject to regulatory matters, complaints or inquests, and a range of risk management and education courses.  The indemnity provided is occurrence-based protection, while that of insurance companies is on a claims-made basis.  Occurrence-based indemnity means that if a practitioner is a member at the time an adverse incident occurs, he or she can ask for assistance years later even if he or she is no longer a member or has ceased practising.  Claims-made cover, as provided by insurance companies, means the member must pay continuously.<\/p><p> There has been a deterioration in the claims environment for GPs, dentists and consultants.  The latter has been more extreme as a combination of both the number of claims reported and their severity.  We provided a graph in our submission comparing the experience in Ireland to that in other countries, in which one will see a rapid increase over the past several years in Ireland.  I must point out that these are actuarial estimates of the cost of indemnity for claims per member for the year in question.  The impact of the deteriorating claims environment is felt differently by MPS than the State Claims Agency because MPS has to fund itself on a prospective or pre-funded basis, collecting money now for incidents which occur this year but for which claims may not arise for many years in the future.<\/p><p> How are we dealing with this deterioration of claims?  Before we put up our subscriptions in the middle of 2014, we delayed for three months while we communicated with stakeholders, including the Department of Health, the Irish Hospital Consultants' Association, IHCA, the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, and our members.  This was to educate and communicate to them what was going on and to see whether there was any short-term relief that could be applied, particularly through a reduction in the indemnity caps.  Subsequently, we developed a campaign highlighting the effects that the reform of tort law and the legal process would have on the future costs of clinical indemnity.<\/p><p> We do not believe indemnity costs have increased because of a deterioration in professional standards.  The economic climate that has pertained may have given rise to some issues.  There is growing evidence, not only in Ireland but other countries, that a poor economic climate encourages patients to sue.  Lawyers who might previously have earned income through commercial work that has dried up may turn their attention to personal injury claims.  These problems are further compounded by the lack of an efficient and predictable legal process.  General damages, special damages and the legal costs associated with resolving claims tend to be higher in Ireland than we experience elsewhere.<\/p><p> We have launched a campaign for procedural and tort law reform.  There is a need for urgent introduction of a pre-action protocol, recommended by the working group on medical negligence and periodic payments, as well as judge-led case management.<\/p><p> Following a review of the US and Australian experience of similar deterioration in the claims environment and their responses to this, we have put forward several significant recommendations which we believe could begin to tackle these concerns, such as a tariff of general damages, a limit on general damages and making legal fees more proportionate to the size of claims.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012200002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon Kayll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421919000,"counter":684,"content":"<p>I call on Mr. Martin Varley of the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012200002#D00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421919000,"counter":685,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and other members of the committee for the opportunity to address them on this important issue.<br\/><br\/>Acute surgical and medical services are provided through 50 public and 20 independent acute hospitals.  There are approximately 2,600 approved public contract consultant posts in public hospitals, of which more than 200 posts are vacant or filled through temporary <i>ad hoc<\/i>arrangements, more than 400 are consultants who practise exclusively in independent hospitals, and up to 600 are consultants who may practise on a part-time basis in independent hospitals.  Independent hospitals carry out about 250,000 theatre procedures annually, accounting for about 40% of the total number of procedures requiring anaesthesia in acute hospitals.  Consultants in private practice also provide care for medical patients and are responsible for a significant proportion of outpatient consultations.<br\/><br\/>All hospital consultants in public and independent hospitals are required to be indemnified against claims for medical negligence as a condition of their employment or practice rights.  This will soon become a statutory requirement.  The cost of clinical indemnity for private practice consultants has doubled for certain specialties in the past two years.  In the past year alone, clinical indemnification charges payable by consultants in private practice increased on average by around 40%.  Charges for those in high-risk categories, which include most surgical specialties and obstetrics, increased by between 54% and 68%.  These increases in 2014 were on top of increases of between 49% and 67% implemented since 2008, including increases of up to one third in 2013 alone.  The effect of the foregoing is that indemnity charges have increased to unaffordable levels for consultants in private practice, as highlighted by the following approximate annual charges.  These are &euro;337,000 for obstetrics; &euro;104,000 for neurosurgery and spinal surgery; &euro;97,500 for bariatric surgery, gynaecology, orthopaedics, excluding spinal surgery, plastic surgery and refractive laser surgery; &euro;77,000 for cardiothoracic surgery, general surgery, ophthalmology, otorhinolaryngology, urology and vascular surgery.<br\/><br\/>Substantially increased indemnity charges have become increasingly unaffordable in the light of cuts in health insurer procedure fees of 20% or more since 2008.  The ongoing uncertainty with regard to future indemnity costs is exacerbating the situation.  The indemnification increases have been attributed to a higher frequency of claims in Ireland, increased awards in the courts and lack of progress in reforming the law in medical negligence claims.<br\/><br\/>The need to reform the law in this area was identified as an urgent requirement when the State Claims Agency&rsquo;s clinical indemnity scheme was established over a decade ago.  At the time, caps were introduced so that the cost of indemnity would be affordable.  It was recognised at the time that &euro;100,000 was regarded as the limit of affordability for obstetrics and the annual charge for surgery was about &euro;30,000 at the same time.  Today&rsquo;s costs are around three times those levels, highlighting the extent of the problem that has arisen in the interim.<br\/><br\/>The cost of indemnification for consultants in Ireland is a multiple of that charged in the UK and other jurisdictions.  This is primarily due to the fact that the UK reformed the law over a decade ago to address the issues which were driving up their costs and similar actions have been taken in other jurisdictions.  In contrast, no reforms have been implemented here.  If the law were eventually reformed, it would take several years to affect costs.<\/p><p> The net effect of the escalating costs of indemnity charges is that an increasing number of consultants have ceased private practice.  An estimated 20 consultants ceased private practice in 2014 because the cost of clinical indemnity has become unaffordable, and more are planning to cease in 2015 if the unaffordable costs are not addressed.  This includes cessations in general surgery, ENT, orthopaedics, pain medicine, neurology, gynaecology, urology and other specialties.  Full-time private practice obstetrics is no longer viable in the State.  It seems highly likely that many private practice vacancies will remain unfilled unless the escalating indemnity costs are addressed.  If they are not addressed, the current crisis will result in fewer patients being treated in private hospitals, which currently treat around 40% of surgical patients requiring anaesthesia and a significant number of medical patients as well as being responsible for a high proportion of outpatient consultations.  As a result, more patients will be forced to seek surgical and medical care in public hospitals, which had approximately 60,000 patients on their elective surgery waiting lists in October, an increase of 20% on October 2013.  In addition, as we all know, 377,502 patients were awaiting outpatient appointments in public hospitals as of October 2014.<\/p><p> The working group on medical negligence, chaired formerly by Mr. Justice John Quirke and now by Ms Justice Mary Irvine, has submitted a report to the President of the High Court and the Minister for Justice and Equality with recommendations for the introduction of pre-action protocols, including the related draft legislation as outlined by Mr. Simon Kayll.  The protocols, if introduced, would assist in reducing uncertainty and the costs associated with medical negligence claims, as has occurred in the UK.  The working group has submitted an additional report on proposed rules of court for more intensive case management of medical negligence cases, including a requirement for the exchange of information within defined time periods, as applies in the Commercial Court, in order to reduce delays and costs.<\/p><p> In November 2014, MPS published a paper entitled Challenging the Cost of Clinical Negligence: The Case for Reform, which the IHCA supports.  Mr. Kayll has outlined the details of that report to the committee.  The association has written to the Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice and Equality requesting urgent reform of the law and implementation of the recommendations of the working group on medical negligence.  I stress that reform of the law in this area represents the fundamental solution to the problem, but it will take time to implement and take effect.  Separately, for that reason, the association has been in regular contact with the Minister for Health and his senior officials in the Department of Health and also with the State Claims Agency on proposals that could address the crisis in the interim, because reforming the law will take time and we are concerned about a significant exodus of consultants from private practice.<\/p><p> The Department has analysed the potential benefit of reducing the caps under three scenarios.  Reductions in the caps would deliver lower indemnity charges for consultants, and this is one of the potential solutions that needs to be considered.  The potential benefit of the State Claims Agency offering indemnity cover for consultants in private practice has also been discussed.  It is the view of private practice consultants that this option should be assessed further in a committee with members from the Department of Health, the State Claims Agency and the IHCA.  The establishment of the proposed committee is essential to advance the assessment of the most effective solutions to address the unaffordable cost of clinical indemnity.<\/p><p> While we understand that work has been advanced to assess a number of potential solutions in conjunction with the State Claims Agency, the unfolding crisis is expanding at a rapid pace.  In the absence of an effective solution, a growing number of consultants are considering ceasing private practice or either retiring early or emigrating to where they can practise with affordable indemnity.  Unfortunately, such developments will result in greater delays in treating patients and longer waiting lists in already extremely overstretched public hospitals.  The association welcomes the opportunity to discuss these critically important issues with the committee and we look forward to answering questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Varley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421919000,"counter":687,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Varley and I welcome Professor Trevor Duffy, the president of the Irish Medical Organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012200002#E00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421919000,"counter":688,"content":"<p>The IMO would like to thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to present our views today on how to tackle the rising cost of professional medical indemnity insurance.  I will not rehearse the increases outlined by both the State Claims Agency and the MPS, nor the impact this is having on current private practice as outlined by Mr. Varley.  While we recognise that there has been an increase in both the quantity and size of settlements in recent years, an inefficient and lengthy legal process has been blamed for the rise in claims costs.  Recommendations to make the litigation process more efficient and less costly are welcome and necessary in the immediate term; however, the IMO is of the view that in order to reduce the cost of claims, litigation should be a last resort after all other avenues have been explored.  We firmly believe that any system of negligence should have the primary aim of improving the quality and safety of clinical care.  In our view, litigation is not good for the patient, the doctor or the State.  Patients have often experienced significant trauma or injury as a result of an adverse event.  For many patients, lengthy and expensive court proceedings are often the only recourse available to them in order to receive an explanation and compensation for what happened and to ensure appropriate long-term care and support.  This process can subject the patient to a considerable level of emotional stress and may serve to aggravate the patient's condition.<\/p> <p>  Doctors are often the second victims of an adverse event.  The majority of doctors undergo a significant level of emotional stress as a result of litigation and fitness to practise procedures that accompany litigation.  Fear of damage to their reputation and loss of livelihood can impact on a doctor's psychological and physical health, resulting in anxiety, depression and an exacerbation of existing health problems. <\/p> <p>  In addition to the growing cost of claims experienced by the State Claims Agency, the consequence of an adversarial litigious system is that doctors will often practise defensively, such as ordering more diagnostics or treatment than necessary, or they may avoid treating certain high-risk patients.  For some it may lead to early retirement, or they may discourage others from entering the profession.<\/p> <p>  The majority of health care professionals aim to provide the best care for their patients.  Rarely is harm due to wilful misconduct.  Most often, harm is due to systems failure or unintentional human error.  Alternatives to legal proceedings should be explored.  Court proceedings can often be avoided if there is full and open disclosure, including an apology, following an adverse event.  Fear of litigation is a major barrier to frank apology and communication with patients following an adverse event, and health care staff are often the second victims of such events.  We have been awaiting the publication of the health information Bill since 2006, which was intended to provide protection to a health professional from admitting liability when apologising. This would be a major step towards promoting open disclosure and changing the culture of adversarial litigation following an adverse event.  Rather than focusing on apportioning blame, open disclosure policies should support patients and doctors and focus more on learning from adverse events in order to reduce harm and improve patient safety.<\/p> <p>  The Government could consider the introduction of a no-fault claims system for certain cases.  While the UK rejected a no-fault claims system for fear it would increase the number of claims, other countries such as New Zealand and the Scandinavian countries have had no-fault systems in place since the 1980s.  Under no-fault claims systems it is no longer necessary to prove clinical negligence but patients must prove that the treatment or medical process caused harm.  There is generally some guidance on compensation payments and in some countries the system is limited to certain types of injury.  Since introducing a no-fault claims system in 2004, court proceedings for clinical negligence in France have been reduced to one third.<\/p> <p>  There is a need to promote alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation, arbitration or collaborative practice.  Collaborative practice requires the patient and his or her family, health care professionals, solicitors and insurers, to commit to an open and transparent resolution of the dispute without going to court.  In the event that clinical negligence cases end up in the courts, a number of organisations and groups have recommended changes to tort law and the litigation process in order to speed up the process and reduce the cost of litigation.  The working group on medical negligence, litigation and periodic payment orders, chaired by Mr. Justice John Quirke and subsequently by Ms Justice Mary Irvine, has made recommendations to the Government on periodic payment orders, pre-action protocols and case management rules.  The Law Reform Commission recommended that tighter limitation periods for commencing legal proceedings could reduce the cost of insurance.  In addition to these measures, MPS has recommended that the tort of clinical negligence should be more clearly defined; that limits are placed on damages awarded; that a certificate of merit should be introduced to ensure only meritorious cases are brought forward; and that a cap is placed on lawyers' fees for smaller-value cases.<\/p><p>Furthermore, we believe that health services in Ireland have been subject to unprecedented budget cuts over the past six years with no measurement of the impact of these cuts on patient safety.  Between 2008 and 2014, health service funding has been reduced by 27%, or approximately &euro;4 billion, while staffing levels have been reduced by 11%, or nearly 13,000 whole-time equivalents, since peak levels in 2007.  In the same period, the number of acute hospital beds in the system has decreased by 1,631, or 13%.  In the meantime, demand on the hospital system has risen, with emergency department, inpatient, outpatient and day-case activity increasing steadily.  Under-resourcing and understaffing are regularly cited as contributing to major adverse events.  A study from Germany found a tipping point estimated at 92.5% bed occupancy whereby clinical staff become more prone to error due to rationing of resources and elevated stress levels.  The impact of political financial decisions on patient safety must be recognised and financing and staffing levels must be restored to stabilise the hospital system.<\/p><p> We believe in an automatic entitlement to health and social services for people with disabilities.  People with disabilities should have automatic entitlement to health care and social supports, including access to community therapy services afforded by a medical card in order that patients and their carers are not required to sue to ensure appropriate long-term care and support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Trevor Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421919000,"counter":690,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses to the committee.  There is obviously an issue with the impact on the staffing of our health services in terms of consultants but equally in terms of the last point made by the IMO on the broader issue of the impact of cuts on our health service.  We hear week in and week out of the pressures on front-line service providers in our emergency departments and of the impact that can have on the acute hospital setting.  It is an area we should delve into to determine whether there is a tipping point beyond which negligence becomes a consequence the more we keep paring back on staff and supports for them in our hospitals and health services in general.  It is something we should look at as a committee.  Health care professional advocacy groups and trade unions have raised that point.  Very often, we might take the jaundiced view that it is raised for the purpose of looking for more resources for their members.  Equally, one must take into account that they are professionals trying to provide a service to the public and when they say there are risks to patient safety, we should take that on board and investigate.  We should note that their comments are not always about self-interest and that they always have patient safety foremost in their minds.<\/p> <p>  The more I listened to the contribution, the more I realised that the State Claims Agency is paying out, indemnity costs are going up, more people are leaving private medical practice and more patients are ending up in the public health system, which puts more pressure on that system.  The common denominator is that it costs the State a great deal of money.  While the State is there to pick up the tab, the merry-go-round must stop at some stage.  One cannot have a situation where the State is consistently the one that ends up funding everything while also failing to bring forward legislation, the latter being a failing on the part of the Oireachtas.  That impacts on the recruitment of consultants, their retention in the private sector and the public health system coming under further pressure.<\/p> <p>  Somebody said that litigation is not good for patients, but I assure the witnesses that medical negligence is not good for them either.  We must try to get the balance right between a litigation-conscious society and our barristers and solicitors moving from other areas of the economy into personal injuries when there is a downturn.  While it is accepted internationally that personal injuries increase when there is a downturn in the economy, the question one must ask is whether the cause is cutbacks in our health services leading to a higher incidence of medical negligence or legal professionals moving into personal injuries practice.  We might have to do a bit of work on that.  The patient is the person who is damaged by medical negligence and he or she has an entitlement to seek redress.  We should ensure that there is a seamless, streamlined way for a person to vindicate his or her rights in the most cost-effective way while ensuring that we limit the cost to the State.<\/p> <p>  What other countries can the witnesses point to that may have a similar type of common law system and a similar type of medical system?  What comparative countries could the committee look at to see where things have been done properly and a lower cost of professional indemnity achieved?  Where are there high medical and enforcement standards with a legal system that allows people to seek redress?  Are we really that far out of kilter with other similar countries in terms of our legal structures and, if so, how far out is that?  The capping that was set years ago was breached and then we had court cases where the courts increased the awards by up to 40% in the area of obstetrics.  While we tried this before, it has drifted again.  We set the caps and it worked for a while, but it seems we have moved back to where we were.<\/p> <p>  We also have to listen to other groups.  Barristers and solicitors should be brought in so that we can discuss the matter with them.  In respect of the State Claims Agency and discussions around indemnifying medical professionals, how far down the road has that process gone?  Where do witnesses see the benefit in that or is it a matter of transferring the problem from one area of the State to another?<\/p> <p>  Is there a particular age profile among the consultants who are leaving the country or dropping out of private practice?  Are they younger consultants or are consultants in all age cohorts beginning to drift from private practice and to leave the country?  I would be very concerned if we were losing the best and our brightest younger people as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012200002#F00200","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1421919000,"counter":691,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses to the committee.  It strikes me that the medical negligence claims system in the State serves neither patient nor practitioner well.  While I have no doubt that there will be a significant concentration in our toing and froing on the cost, there is without question the fact that there is huge stress and distress involved for all parties, including patients, their dependants and their loved ones, and practitioners.<\/p> <p>  It is important to share that, in advance of this meeting, we received a significant correspondence from people from throughout the country who had been through this process.  The word \"inundated\" is probably a little strong, but it was significant.  Their stories are absolutely harrowing and they have a common experience apart from the tragic incident that changed their lives in almost all cases, which is that it took years to get to a resolution.  I can empathise with their cry and their pain and I consider that this is the issue that must addressed.  I had, in reading some of the correspondence, images of our television screens through the years.<\/p><p>We would also have seen it in the print media.  One would see a family coming out of a court experience following a decision or an award, whatever the case might be.  We would all have forgotten what their story was; it may have happened years before.  Heaven only knows what such a family will have been through over the intervening time.  It is most unsatisfactory.<\/p><p> We are all human beings and it is not only the patient and his or her loved ones who are affected.  No practitioner sets out to do some wrong or harm.  The protracted process must also take its toll on them.  None of us is an automaton.  I am deeply concerned that there is a disposition on the part of the State Claims Agency and the Medical Protection Society to approach almost all of the cases that present from a deny-and-defend perspective.  There is something very amiss in all of this because we are compounding hurt and pain by that approach.<\/p><p> I am conscious that the British system introduced legislation on the legal duty of candour last November.  I recall that the Minister for Health, after the expos&eacute; of the series of stillbirths in Portlaoise some 12 months ago or thereabouts, commented that he would commit to the introduction of a statutory legal duty of candour.  We met the families involved.  They were misled, misinformed and left in the dark, which is unacceptable.<\/p><p> I would like to ask the State Claims Agency and the Medical Protection Society a question.  Is it the case that, following an adverse incident in any of our hospital sites, medical practitioners and nurses are obliged to advise the respective organisations of said incidents?  Is it the case that they are not obliged to, and generally do not, advise patients and their families?  Is it the case that the organisations, in turn, do not advise the parties concerned and do not encourage those whom they may represent to act in an open and forthright way?<\/p><p> I return to my first point, namely, that we are all human beings after all.  People put into a position whereby they have to defend their case and know the tragedy of their experience, due to the fact they are challenged, are being put in a very difficult position.  The trajectory is one of open conflict.  That can be changed through openness, honesty and advising the patient of anything that may not have happened as it should have done or as intended.  With that approach, a significant cost factor - protracted legal battles - would be addressed.  There are substantial savings to be made in that area.  The savings would be not only in terms of the cost of the ultimate settlement and the legal costs associated with years of direct engagement, but also in human, psychological and other related terms by the absence of stress over long years of embattlement.  I ask the State Claims Agency and the Medical Protection Society to address with candour at this committee the question of whether they would favour the introduction of a duty of candour for all practitioners and would honour and respect said legislation if it were to be introduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012200002#F00300","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421919000,"counter":693,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for the presentations.  It is quite clear that the system that deals with medical negligence is not fit for purpose.  I welcome, in particular, the presentation from the Irish Medical Organisation because it reflects, to a large extent, something I have said for quite some time.  As late as last week I mentioned the cuts of &euro;4 billion to the health service, the reduction in staff of 13,000 and the 2,000 beds taken out of the system, while during the same period there was a significant increase in activity.  Staff are under pressure every hour of every day.  My local hospital is working at something like 120% capacity on an ongoing basis.  That is the background which feeds into this area.<\/p> <p>  I also welcome the reference by the IMO to open disclosure and apologies to patients and their families arising from adverse incidents.  Does that represent, from the IMO's point of view, an acceptance of a legal duty of candour?  Would it support such a requirement in the future?  Would the other organisations present support the introduction of a legal duty of candour?  The nub of the question is the adversarial nature of the process from the very outset.  Patients and their families are kept in the dark, misinformed and misled.  Openness, apology, immediate action and a legal duty of candour are key to making some attempt to solve this problem.<\/p> <p>  Many patients who have been involved in medical negligence are frustrated from the outset by the nature of the procedures and the lack of timeliness and openness in the process.  If there was more openness and disclosure, and apologies were issued where necessary, that would be very important to the patients who have suffered adverse effects.  It would be effective from the point of view of the clinicians, hospitals and institutions involved.  I ask the witnesses to address the questions of openness, candour and speedy action.<\/p><p>That some of these cases can go on for years is very difficult for the patients involved.  I believe it also gives rise to significantly increased financial costs eventually.  Will the various witnesses address that area which I believe is key to beginning to solve this problem?

Over what period is that likely to be paid out?  Is it a short period or would it be over the next five years?  Will the witnesses outline the amount per annum the State Claims Agency expects to pay out over the next five years?<\/p> <p>  At the moment in obstetrics and orthopaedics the first &euro;590,000 is covered by the private indemnifiers and in all other categories I believe &euro;1.18 million is covered by the private indemnifiers.  If that capping level were reduced, for example from &euro;500,000 to &euro;250,000 and from &euro;1.18 million to &euro;500,000, what would be the additional cost to the State per annum?  Have the witnesses calculated the effect of reducing the capping levels?  That is one of the issues that need to be dealt with.<\/p> <p>  Has the State Claims Agency considered the possibility of taking over the management of all personal injury claims, both public and private?  What additional cost would this be to the State?  Obviously people in private practice would still have to pay premiums to the State Claims Agency at that stage.  Would the State Claims Agency have the capacity to take on such a role at this stage?<\/p> <p>  My next question is directed to the Medical Protection Society.  According to the submissions from the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and from the Medical Protection Society, premiums have risen by up to 68% in the past two years.  In some cases the insurance premium for a private practice is now in excess of &euro;104,000 per annum.  Are similar increases likely over the next two years?  If that happens, will the Medical Protection Society remain in the Irish market?  Previously the Medical Defence Union pulled out of the Irish market.  Does the Medical Protection Society envisage being in the Irish market in five years time?  The Medical Protection Society witnesses have made a very strong case about the level of claims increasing.  If there is no change, do they envisage the Medical Protection Society being in the Irish market in five years time?<\/p> <p>  I wish to follow up on a point Deputy Kelleher made.  The Medical Protection Society is involved in a large number of jurisdictions around the world.  If Mr. Kayll became Minister for Health in the morning, what jurisdiction does he believe would be most appropriate for us to follow in order to have fairness for the patient and at the same time have a system in place that deals with all of the issues mentioned this morning?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012200002#H00300","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1421919000,"counter":697,"content":"<p>We hear a lot about fraudulent claims.

It was a real shock for me when I came back in 1993 from New York, which is often considered the medical litigation capital of the world, to find that Ireland, where we had a certain set of prejudices about the perception of doctors in our society and a non-confrontational nature, was at the time third in the world for medical claims, and I believe we are now second.  People do not really understand this.  This is a uniquely dangerous environment in which to practise medicine in terms of the risk of litigation.<\/p> <p>  A major contributory reason is that the medicine is not that good.  It is not that the doctors are not that good but there are far too few of them and they are given incredibly unrealistic workloads.  The eyes of my colleagues in this committee start to glaze over when they hear me say this.  For most specialties we have approximately one fifth or one sixth the number of specialists per head of population when compared with countries in continental Europe.  We tend to have about 70% of the number that the UK has and the UK is pretty much second worst in the world for the number of doctors per head of population for most specialties as well.  As a result we have people who are seeing vastly larger numbers of patients than doctors will in other countries.  As a result, even with all things being equal and even if the quality of the care, systems and backup were exactly the same, statistically an Irish doctor is more likely to be sued because he or she has far more interactions.<\/p> <p>  Of course, there is another factor.  If doctors are having far more interactions, the chances are that the quality of those interactions is suffering.  They have a real problem, given that they are practising in an environment with a unique set of risks, such as a tiny number of CT scanners, an inadequate number of operating theatres, and waiting lists which would be hilarious if they were not so tragic and are only surpassed in the OECD countries by the UK.  The British must thank God every day that the Irish health system exists because we keep them off the bottom of the charts for international public systems.  This was the problem I came back to 20 years ago and it is not a whole lot better now.  We can then throw in the perfect storm of the economic meltdown which meant that suddenly there were cutbacks to an already constrained system.  There is a failure to appoint replacements in positions that were already desperately overworked and underprovided for.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to put too much of the blame for this on lawyers, but certainly a contributory factor was that a lot of lawyers had a lot of free time on their hands and were suddenly looking for other opportunities when conveyancing became no longer possible.<\/p> <p>  When I came back to Ireland I took a lot of criticism for saying this.  The system was so poor, the way the health system was structured so poor and the outcomes were so poor, there was the potential that medical litigation could be in some senses creative.  It could help to fix problems and highlight problems.  However, I do not think that is the primary reason for having it.<\/p> <p>  We desperately need to fix the health system if we want to reduce the risky environment in which doctors practise.  I believe the cohort of doctors and nurses we have is unsurpassed.  I can obviously speak with a greater degree of expertise on oncology than I can on other areas.  The kind of training Irish doctors get, because so many of them train abroad in unbelievable centres of excellence, tends to mean that we have people of extraordinary quality in posts here being asked to do impossible jobs, and we need to fix that.<\/p> <p>  I will not talk about specifics.  However, obviously in the aftermath of the Galway obstetrical tragedy a few years ago, there was much discussion about the possibility of individual liability.  The central problem in Galway and elsewhere is that Galway is at the bottom of the charts for the number of obstetricians per head of population in Ireland and Ireland is at the bottom of the charts for the number of obstetricians per head of population in the world.  Until we fix those problems we will not fix the crisis.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about the culture of transparency.  I have got two minutes.

Part of the problem of the culture of secrecy in Irish medicine is that when Irish doctors, whose instinct is to be honest when something happens, try to be honest, they are immediately advised by the administrators in the hospital and by the lawyers to shut up.  That is what happens.  Therefore, the problem regarding the lack of transparency when accidents happen is usually caused by the administration.<\/p> <p>  I have some specific questions for the Medical Protection Society, MPS.  I would like to pay tribute to the MPS.

First, what is the justification for increasing the premium of somebody who has worked all of their career with a mixed public-private practice, but then, perhaps in order to take early retirement, becomes a full-time private practitioner, and only sees private patients in the same place as they always saw patients?  What is the justification of increasing it not by a couple of per cent but fivefold?  This is happening.  People who were paying &euro;10,000 per year for medical malpractice cover from MPS when they had large private practices as part of a mixed practice, suddenly find when they become full-time private practitioners that their premium is increased.  Can it be backed up by actuaries that their risk increases fivefold or are they in fact cross-subsidising some other part of the medical risk pie?

The policy of MPS is absolutely not to deny and defend.  We believe a speedy resolution of claims is in the best interest of the patient, the doctor and our financial fund and we are keen to settle claims as quickly as possible.  In our submission, we gave an example of a case where we admitted liability within six weeks of notification.  However, because of the legal system, the plaintiff's solicitors, did not engage in an early settlement and the case ran on and on.  We believe there is an element within the system that does not allow easy and quick resolution.<\/p> <p>  A number of committee members alluded to the point made by Professor Duffy that litigation is not the best way to go.  However, in Ireland, there is a lack of a process of complaint to which patients could take their lesser concerns and complaints rather than pursue a legal complaint.  We fully support honesty and open disclosure.  We have supported the duty of candour in the United Kingdom and have worked with the HSE and the State Claims Agency here on a communication model we call \"Assist\".  We have worked extensively on this communication model, which supports open and honest disclosure.  On the dental side, we have worked with the Irish Dental Association to introduce a dental complaints resolution scheme.  Again, we are trying to encourage, within the community in which we work, ways of resolving concerns of patients with their clinicians that do not necessarily result in litigation.  I have no experience of fraudulent claims.  It takes a lot to bring a fraudulent claim for medical negligence and our experience is pretty much nil in that respect.  <\/p> <p>  A question was asked regarding which countries we might look to as examples.  It is very difficult to do this because of the nature of health care and because the split between primary and secondary care and between private and state medicine change all over the world.  However, pre-action protocols seem to have made a significant difference, as does judge-led case management, in the United Kingdom since they were introduced.  Hence the reason we are building on that experience and making that recommendation here in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure I have answered all of the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012200002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon Kayll"},{"type":"speech","time":1421919000,"counter":709,"content":"<p>We will come back to this again if we have time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012200002#J00600","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1421919000,"counter":710,"content":"<p>What about my question about the increase in fees - do they parallel the payouts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012200002#J00700","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1421919000,"counter":711,"content":"<p>Sorry.

Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in queried whether the State Claims Agency has a disposition to approach cases on a deny and defend basis.  I can understand why he might have that view.  We see tragic pictures of catastrophically injured children before our courts and we read the reports in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and other media, which make it look like we exist always to deny, defend and delay.  I do not ever forget there is a badly injured child in these cases or the tragedy for the family involved.  Deny and defend is not what we are about.<br\/><br\/>Some of these cases are very complex from the point of view of causation.  All Deputies and Senators would understand that where we are paying out sums of up to &euro;30 million, it would be remiss of us if we did not forensically examine those claims and the complex issues that lie at the heart of them.  Often, one of the real difficulties in these cases is that while the length of time from when the child was born to the date the claim is resolved is an extraordinary period of time, it does not correspond with the period from when the claim was made to the claim resolution.  However, I accept these cases take too long and this is why we have advocated reform in the form of the pre-action protocols. I and others have worked hard in the medical negligence working group to try to get these on the Statute Book so they can guide our behaviour in our engagement on these cases in a more meaningful way.<br\/><br\/>In regard to notification of adverse events, there is a statutory duty on all hospitals to notify their adverse advents to the State Claims Agency and we analyse those events.  Where issues are arising from the adverse events, we try to feed back to the enterprises in the form of risk management solutions.  On the question of open disclosure and the legal duty of candour, unequivocally, we support open disclosure and the duty of candour.  In fact, we led with the HSE and the Medical Protection Society on a project which originally began at two sites, in the Mater and Cork University Hospital.  This is being rolled out to many hospitals and is an ongoing issue for us.  In this context, a significant issue that needs to be dealt with concerns how we protect the apology in terms of any legal battle that might ultimately ensue.  This needs to be sorted.  If it was sorted in the form of a statutory measure, open disclosure would become much more a feature of hospitals than it is currently.<br\/><br\/>Senator Burke asked about the 2,840 claims and the &euro;1.159 billion and over what period these moneys would be paid out.  These claims are in a cycle evolution, from recent ones to older ones, and will be paid out over a number of years.  The average payout we have had over the past number of years in a single year has been in the order of between &euro;100 million to &euro;125 million.  We expect the figure next year to increase significantly.  One of the reasons we expect this gross increase is because of the absence of periodic payment order legislation.  We worked hard in the medical negligence working group on this, but it has not come onto the Statute Book.  The courts are indicating the temporary arrangement we had, where we were paying periodic payments to families and where families had to come back to court, is a cause of stress which is not good for families.  They have said they are going to revert those periodic payments into lump sum payments, which will certainly affect our cashflow in the years ahead.<\/p><p> Senator Colm Burke asked about the possibility of the State Claims Agency taking over indemnity insurance claims for private consultants from what we might call the ground up.  I expect it is his intention that they would pay a premium to the agency.  It is a policy issue for the Department in the first instance as to whether it should take on such a responsibility.  Once the decision was made, I can assure the committee that we would do so, as we have done in the past in the case of any business the Government decided to delegate to us to handle.  We always have capacity to take on what we believe to be new work on behalf of the State.<\/p><p> I assure Deputy Mary Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor that on a look-back basis, in terms of the clinical negligence profile from 2002 until now, as distinct from the non-clinical negligence profile, we never had a case in which we would have said it was fraudulent.<\/p><p> In response to Senator John Crown, specifically on the question of whether we are seeing a greater number of claims, from 2008 we had 426 claims in one year; in 2009 there were 400; in 2010, 457; in 2011, 544 and in 2012, 772.

There are several systems in the developed world to address the problem, all of which are of varying complexity in terms of medical and law systems that are not necessarily comparable.  We firmly believe we now have an opportunity and a responsibility to examine the matter in a constructive manner for the future, not to waste another ten years, as has happened since the clinical indemnity scheme was set up.<\/p> <p>  The profile of consultants dropping out of private practice is mixed and multifactorial, but, in particular, this issue is affecting procedural specialists.  It is also affecting young specialists.  Older specialists might choose to retire completely, whereas young specialists are choosing to leave the country or not to come back.  That would be a major decision factor in making that choice.<\/p> <p>  More tellingly, as an organisation, we strongly support the concept of open disclosure.  It is something that is being pushed strongly through the Health Service Executive.  We have great concerns that legal or statutory responsibility or a duty of candour should be supported in the sense that it does not equate to an admission of liability on the part of the practitioner.<\/p> <p>  One member stated the system of medical negligence was primarily about redress for patients.  Our experience is that generally patients are not looking for an adversarial or punitive process of redress; rather, they are looking to learn about and understand what happened to them and to ensure it will not happen in the future.  In that context, the alternative mechanisms we have discussed and proposed are being examined as they offer a much better system that would be fit for purpose and fit with the values of the medical profession, namely, care and compassion and the culture of learning, which is at complete variance with the current adversarial system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012200002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Trevor Duffy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421919000,"counter":717,"content":"<p>I will deal with a number of the questions asked.  First, in response to the specific question asked by Deputy Seamus Healy on whether we supported a duty of candour, yes, we do support open disclosure and communication and honesty at all stages of the clinical process.  In that regard, we highly commend the support and education provided by the Medical Protection Society which are very useful for our members in that respect.  It has been shown that open disclosure and good honest communication reduce the likelihood of litigation.  However, we echo the comments of other speakers that a legal duty of candour should be backed by appropriate protection and that an admission of untoward events should not in itself be used as evidence of culpability.  This should be included in legislation, probably the promised health information Bill.<\/p> <p>  We also support the development of the various alternatives to litigation that have been mentioned and also, in so far as cases will continue to go through the legal system, the procedural reform and tort law reform to which reference have been made.  However, we emphasise that all of these will take time to result in any change on the curve in terms of the cost of claims and the projected future cost of claims and, therefore, subscriptions to the Medical Protection Society.  We emphasise that there is also a need for urgent action to deal with what is an unfolding crisis in terms of consultants who when their next premium falls due, may cease to practise and leave the country.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about the age profile of those who were leaving.  It is across the age spectrum.  Some are older and approaching retirement, but those who do not show up in the statistics are those who have not commenced to practise in this country; whatever about someone with a mature practice with borrowings paid off being able to support the payment of such high premia, it is untenable for many that they commence to practise in a private hospital in this country.  They are commencing to practise abroad and do not appear in the Irish statistics.  As a result, it will be very difficult and perhaps impossible to replace those who have left and the provision of services in specialties in certain private hospitals may cease entirely.  The major concern is the transfer of the workload to public hospitals which are already overburdened. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012200002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gerard Crotty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421919000,"counter":718,"content":"<p>I have a lot of experience of this issue.  I was appointed as a consultant in public practice under a type II Buckley contract in 2005.  I resigned in 2012 and have been engaged full-time in private practice since; therefore, I have seen both sides of the argument.  If things continue the way they are going, in the future the people who will be discommoded will be all patients.  The reason I say that is I am already seeing patients who do not have health insurance attending my clinic with members of their family saying they will club together to pay for their mother to have a hip or knee replacement operation.  These are patients who have served the community.  They have paid their taxes throughout their lifetime and now when they need treatment, they cannot access it and have to pay for it themselves.

We are close to our bigger neighbours even though we have different opportunities, practices and experiences as nations.  We are also mostly a Catholic country but there are other religions, as in France.  A great number of Lithuanians live in Ireland.  One of the most famous pop stars in Lithuania is Irish and sang for us in the Eurovision Song Contest.  We are very happy to have such an excellent Irish singer.  Last but not least, our two countries have shaped the policy of the EU during our Presidencies in 2013.  Today, I would like to say thanks for Ireland's support.  When Ireland, Lithuania and Greece worked together we followed Ireland's good advice.  Ireland was our coach and we studied its experiences, learned from it and followed its steps.  For example, on tobacco issues we were successful only because we worked together.<\/p><p> However, I am here to speak about an issue that is central to the future of all EU citizens, that is, the issue of health.  I am well aware that the formulation of national health policies is for each of the 28 EU member states to decide.  The Union's role is to complement national actions where possible and add value where it is appropriate and beneficial to do so.  The EU has also a decisive role to play in the field of public health and food safety.<\/p><p> Member states share many similar health challenges.  We know them well.  They include tobacco, alcohol, nutrition, physical inactivity, infectious diseases, antimicrobial resistance, suicide rates and children's health.  In my presentation, there is a slide on life expectancy in the European Union and how significant are the differences between the central and eastern part of the European Union and the western part.  Of course, Ireland is green.  My job, as European Commissioner, is to follow good examples and make more green this part of European Union.  I have only five years in office.  I ask the committee to join our forces to see our continent become more Irish, more green.<\/p><p> We can clearly see the inequalities in health status, both across and within countries.  The slide portraying life expectancy in the EU shows social determinants in health, both within and between countries.  There are 29 million European Union citizens in poverty, which means they have less possibilities to be healthier and less possibilities to have better access to health, and, of course, they suffer more.  My job is to make this map greener.<\/p><p> I want to ensure that the European Union instruments help member states close the gaps in the area of health.  President Junker presented his investment plan.  I would like to present an investment plan for health.  The logic behind this is clear &ndash; economic benefits arise from having a healthy society.  Evidence-based prevention results in increased productivity and improved quality of life.  A great deal can be achieved through increased co-operation between all 28 states.<\/p><p> Ireland has a few good examples of initiatives that could inspire other member states, and I will mention a few.  I would like to start with tobacco and alcohol.  As the committee will be aware, there is a specific line in Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union referring to \"the measures which have as their direct objective the protection of public health regarding tobacco and the abuse of alcohol\".  We need to work together to put this part of the treaty into action.<\/p><p> A slide in the presentation shows the country best in alcohol consumption in the first position.  Ireland is fifth.  On tobacco consumption, one sees the same picture in which we must act together.  My job is to support member states to introduce measures which are more effective at reducing the use of both tobacco and alcohol.  Smoking rates in Ireland are slightly higher than the EU average but Ireland responds with a strong and committed policy and has even introduced as a goal a tobacco-free Ireland by 2025.  This is excellent.  I congratulate Ireland-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012200002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Vytenis Andriukaitis","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421919000,"counter":737,"content":"<p>May I stop Dr. Andriukaitis for one moment?

I welcome the good news last night that in the United Kingdom the Secretary of State for Health pronounced officially that the United Kingdom will follow Ireland's example and implement plain packaging.  It is excellent.<\/p> <p>  Let me say a word about alcohol.  Alcohol consumption in Ireland, compared with other countries, is relatively high.  However, in 2013, the Irish Government approved ambitious measures aimed at improving health, including minimum pricing, regulation of advertising and marketing and health labelling of alcohol products.  I share Ireland's commitment to strengthen action to promote good health.  If we invest in prevention today, we will save on the money we spend on the consequences of alcohol abuse tomorrow.  Today we discussed those issues with the Irish Ministers.  They raised sensitive questions about possibilities, and how to act on a European level, especially with regard to different prices in different countries, and excise.  Advertising, especially through the Internet, is a significant challenge because we cannot regulate advertising through the Internet at national level.  We must seek common actions.<\/p> <p>  I want to touch upon obesity.  Ireland has the third highest prevalence of obesity among adults in the EU.  Daily fruit eating among adults is the third lowest in the EU and as for daily vegetable eating, it is the lowest.  The slide shows that this is so important.  It looks very challenging.  Speaking about the younger generation, which lives under considerable pressure on the market side, one can see from the beginning in all the supermarkets how many market instruments are used to encourage consumers to buy sweets, especially if one has small children.  If one sees tendencies and behaviour, such as use of the Internet and low physical activity, of course, we have the picture, but our activities on obesity must be long term.  We will all be ready to say we will have a long-term strategy around 28 countries.  It is not a five-year job.  It is a job for ten years or 15 years.  In continuity, along the way, we must always be implementing different measures using different instruments in different structures.  This is why are we ready to propose health in all political sectors.<\/p><p>We must encourage and reward all stakeholders to speak about such huge challenges.  If we do not speak about cancer, mental disease, cardiovascular diseases, about all evidence-based diseases, we must look at this picture and see how it is important to encourage our governments, our national parliaments, our European Parliament and our Commission to be interactive.  We must go through different sectors and have a multi-sectoral approach to agree on and implement concrete instruments, and to monitor and have some indicators, some targets.  We must go step by step every day looking at the results.  For example, in my term of office in five years, I want to see the results of working together accurately, of course, at national levels.  We must see those pictures and keep them in our eyes.  <\/p><p> The Commission's proposals about introducing a milk scheme and fruit and vegetables in schools are so important.  Today we see different tendencies and interpretations but all operating on evidence-based arguments.  Of course, we must promote milk schemes and encourage our member states to support open access to fruit and vegetables, especially for our younger generation, because we have the possibility to act and to be effective.  I would like to say that together with my colleague, Commissioner Phil Hogan - we are currently on the same floor - I am thinking about possibilities to introduce agricultural food safety plans, not only food safety but also food health, because safe food is not the same as healthy food.  <\/p><p> We must discuss possibilities to raise those questions, and of course it is all so sensitive - nutrition profiles, labelling, cultural traditions, salt, sugar - but we must continue in our dialogues, trialogues, multi-dialogues and polylogues, going in the same vein to solve those issues.  I see considerable benefits of such possibilities to improve access to the milk scheme, to vegetables, but I would like to see more member states taking part in these actions together.  The numbers I see on these slides are the facts - nobody can dispute them.  We work towards change.  Five years will pass by very quickly.<\/p><p> Health must be considered in all policies as well as disease prevention.  I would like to see Commissioners Hogan, Hahn, Bienkowska and Timmermans, Commissioners responsible for health.  We all have our competencies in different areas.  It it not just for health ministers or health specialists.  It is for all parts of government and for all policy-makers.  Let us consider article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  It says, \"a high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities\".  It is my job.  I must act in this way.  Therefore my approach can be simply summarised as health in all policies.  Let me repeat the mantra - the more health systems focus on health promotion and disease prevention now, the less they will spend on treatment in years to come.  Such a basic mantra needs to be applied in everyday activities and in result-oriented steps.  Fostering healthier lifestyles, screening for cancer, providing vaccination are just a few examples of actions contributing to prevention of diseases which would cost several thousand times more to treat than to detect.  Co-operation with the health system is a huge area.  <\/p><p> I used to serve my country as a Minister of health.  Drawing from my experience to date, I see scope for closer co-operation among member states in the field of health.  I would like to mention Article 4 of the Treaty on European Union, which states, \"Pursuant to the principle of sincere co-operation, the Union and the Member States shall, in full mutual respect, assist each other in carrying out tasks which flow from the Treaties\".  I hear at Council level, please do not touch questions about so-called harmonisation of health systems.  Of course, it is a misperception, a misunderstanding.  Do not speak about harmonisation.  However, we look at criticism and assist each other in carrying out tasks which flow from the treaties in full mutual respect, in co-operation.  There is a lot that member states can learn from each other by co-operating more closely.  <\/p><p> Among other things, President Junker asked me to look at developing expertise on the assessment of the performance of health systems.  A new expert group on health system performance assessment, chaired jointly by Sweden and the Commission, started work in November.  We are confident that the group can and will develop effective tools and methods, having agreed on some indicators, to assess and ultimately improve the performance of our health systems.  Many member states are taking part in this group and I have just discussed with the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar the possibility for Ireland to join this group.  We agreed on the situation.  <\/p><p> The European Commission and President Junker are determined to see new legislation deliver real results to citizens.  For me, health is a way to bring the EU closer to its citizens.  We will seek to ensure the directive on patients' rights in cross-border health care truly results in better citizens' access to quality healthcare through our European Union.  The directive introduces several areas of co-operation among member states, for instance the creation of European reference networks of highly-specialised health care providers from different EU countries to share knowledge and pool expertise.  I want these networks to become fully operational by 2016.  I also want to promote and expand co-operation among member states on e-health and health technology assessment.  The latter could help member states avoid duplication in their assessments and enable an effective exchange of information among national authorities.  Moreover, member states and MEPs seem to be getting more interested in exchanging information on medicine pricing policies and the impact they have on patient access to medicine.  <\/p><p> I would like to touch on the question of the Ebola virus.  In addition to health systems, emergency preparation is another crucial area to which I will dedicate  my energy and attention.  Communicable diseases and other health threats know no borders.  Therefore, European co-operation is vital.  Recurrent Ebola virus epidemics in west Africa show the importance of EU collaboration to prevent and respond to such epidemics.  Ireland is making an important contribution for which I am thankful, in terms of its collaboration with other member states and international organisations and its financial support, but its most telling contribution is the work of brave volunteers from Ireland on the ground.<\/p><p>I was in those countries two months ago and saw the real situation on the ground in Sierra Leone and Liberia.  I met those volunteers.<br\/><br\/>Today the situation is manageable.  Our effort produced results and we can now start speaking about control.  In March, a high-level conference will be devoted to Ebola to discuss the long-term strategies in the affected countries.  Over a year ago, a new European Union law on serious cross-border threats to health came into force.  This law requires member states to share information on serious cross-border threats to health and on the measures they take to prepare for and respond to health threats.  This law is in place thanks largely to the Irish Presidency and its extensive efforts to find a political compromise.<br\/><br\/>My priorities for health can be summed up in three simple words: promotion, prevention and protection.  Thanks to my young followers on Twitter I would also like to add an additional &quot;P&quot;, participation in the other three &quot;P&quot;s.  This participation must involve all stakeholders, and my job is to encourage, communicate, discuss and see possibilities for participating in democracy.  We all need to play our part in full, be it in Brussels or in the European capitals, regions, towns or villages.  I will therefore be open to dialogue and I invite the committee to communicate with me.  My work is driven by the values of<i><\/i>equity and solidarity.  I truly believe in health for all.  I thank the committee for its attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012200002#O00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Vytenis Andriukaitis","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421919000,"counter":746,"content":"<p>I thank Commissioner Andriukaitis for his very challenging presentation of priorities for the year.

At the end of our meeting I will present to the Commissioner a copy of a related report dealing with the issue of concussion in sport.  It is a growing concern across our continent.  It is important that the committee welcomes feedback from the Commissioner on the issue of concussion in sport, and I hope he finds it merits action by the European Union.<\/p> <p>  The committee has been very proactive about many of the issues raised by the Commissioner.  For example, recent meetings have included discussion on the area of rare diseases and their prevention, coeliac disease, food labelling issues, the response to Ebola, legislation to ban smoking in cars with children present and regulation of the cosmetic industry.

I hope his name is being pronounced properly, as people sometimes have difficulty pronouncing my name here at home.<\/p> <p>  I listened to the Commissioner very carefully and he spoke about identifying another \"P\" in the form of \"participation\".  I give him credit, as another \"P\" has struck me that applies to his presentation and what I believe is a sincere and genuine personal commitment: it is \"passion\".  He demonstrated a passion this morning in his presentation and the briefing notes, and his very sincerely held interest in health protection measures is something which we welcome and on which we commend him.  We wish him continued success in his endeavours across the European Union in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Prior to our meeting this morning, we agreed to apportion responsibility to particular areas.  It falls to me to be the first the speak, and I am anxious to address two matters briefly that are not part of his presentation.  I do not expect a detailed answer today but I wonder if the Commissioner and his colleagues could revert at some point about these two areas of particular concern to us with a European dimension.  The first relates to medical devices and the sector which develops medical technology.  It is a very important sector in Ireland.  The genesis of our concern goes back to 2012 and the advent of breast implant prostheses by Poly Implant Proth&egrave;se, PIP.  The Commissioner might be aware of this.  They were manufactured in and supplied from the Continent, and although the consequences were not unique to Ireland, there were adverse effects.  We know that subsequently two draft Bills were presented.  It is of great concern to women in this country as to why there has been a delay.  We are now in 2015.  Is the Commissioner in a position to share with us at what point the draft legislation is?  We need to see the sector properly regulated and we want to ensure that every measure is employed to avoid a recurrence at any point in future.  Is the Commissioner able to shed any light as to the current status of the proposals contained therein?  The committee is kept informed of developments in the European Union across the health sector and we are anxiously awaiting greater evidence of movement in this respect.  This question is not only in the interest of Irish women but the Irish population in general.  Not only does it take in medical implants for female use, but there are issues across the board relating to medical devices.  It must be seen in the round and holistically.<\/p> <p>  My second issue relates to what we unfortunately refer to as \"legal highs\" or substances that are mind-altering.  In 2010, we introduced legislation - it is unique among all member states of the European Union - banning the import, distribution and sale of mind-altering substances.  There had been a proliferation of what were described as head shops in towns across this country.  As a result of the introduction of that legislation, they have, by and large, been closed.  However, access to these substances continues through the Internet and we are anxious to encourage the addressing of this issue across the European Union.  There is no way we can domestically address the use of the Internet.  We must tackle the issue on a shared basis at the very least, and even a European basis may not be enough.  If the European Union gave the lead in this respect, the positive consequences would be significant.  Will the Commissioner comment on that during the course of today's visit?  I thank him for his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012200002#Q00300","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1421919000,"counter":748,"content":"<p>I welcome the Commissioner to Ireland and thank him for today's presentation.  The committee would endorse many of the proposals put forward.  I wish to raise the issue of childhood obesity, which was highlighted in the presentation.  Children today will form the first generation whose life expectancy may be less than that of their parents because of childhood obesity.  It is a strong criticism of all of us.  We must take action and we cannot let that statement stand.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, one in four children is overweight or obese.<\/p><p>A total of four out of five children do not meet the physical activity guidelines.  We know the issues and the problems.  The Commissioner rightly focused on the areas of prevention and early intervention.  Is the Commission willing to consider a sugar tax or a way to incentivise healthier eating, with the money derived from such a tax going towards healthier foods, as the Commissioner mentioned in his presentation?  In Ireland, one in eight children lives in consistent poverty.  There has been an increase in poverty during these tough economic times.  We also know food poverty is a real issue and we must find a way to have policies which support healthy eating and healthier lifestyles.<\/p><p> In the overall budgetary process of the Commission, how do we ensure prevention and early intervention?  With the deficit targets, governments are very focused on the immediacy of actions, and the committee sees this with regard to our budgets for health and children.  We must focus on the year-to-year, so there is no incentive for the Government.  We all know what will happen to the population in ten and 20 years' time with regard to alcohol, tobacco and childhood obesity.  Where will the EU do to incentivise us to take actions today in our budgets and make investments now which will reap rewards in ten or 20 years' time?  With the deficit targets, there are no incentives for the Government to do this.  What does the Commissioner plan to do, and does he plan to set aside money for prevention and early intervention programmes?  Everybody agrees on their importance, but we need to see action and leadership from the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012200002#Q00400","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421919000,"counter":750,"content":"<p>I welcome the Commissioner and wish him every success in his role in the coming five years.  I thank him for his presentation.  I will focus on the issue of tobacco and the changes required throughout Europe.  The tobacco products directive went through on 20 May 2014 and member states have two years to transpose the new rules.  What additional changes to existing directives and what new directives does the Commissioner believe he can bring forward in the coming five years which will help to reduce the purchase and use of tobacco and tobacco products?  We have a particular problem in Ireland, as the age profile of those starting to smoke here is the lowest in the European Union.  We have a major challenge, which is why we have followed Australia in introducing standardised packaging.  A number of submissions have been received from member states.  Does the Commissioner see the changes which have occurred in Australia and what we are trying to do in Ireland being introduced throughout Europe in the coming five years?  Does he believe individual member states will resist it?  The use of tobacco products results in a huge cost to our health services and it must be given priority.<\/p> <p>  I had the privilege of being in the European Parliament from 2007 to 2009.  I was involved in the internal market committee and worked on the cross-border health care directive, which I believe is extremely important.  What initiatives need to be taken by the Commission and member states to encourage and increase the level of co-operation in providing health care?  Ireland is a small country with a population of 4.6 million, and as such there is no way we can afford to have sub-specialisation in medical care.  Therefore, there is a need for much more co-operation between member states.  What new initiatives will the Commissioner introduce in the coming five years to encourage and increase co-operation between member states, particularly with regard to rare diseases, which the Chairman mentioned, and unusual medical conditions?  Does the Commissioner have measures he could introduce which would help co-operation?  My biggest criticism is that although the cross-border health care directive was passed in February 2011, Ireland has not yet transposed it.  It is something we need to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015012200002#R00200","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421919000,"counter":751,"content":"<p>All of the questions raised are on issues which I believe are important.  Yesterday I discussed with the acting director general, Ladislav Miko, how we must act together.  My bible is the book <i>Everything You Always Wanted to Know About European Union Health Policies but Were Afraid to Ask<\/i>.  It is written by prominent authors and makes excellent recommendations and suggestions.  When I read it, I want to act on its recommendations and ideas, beginning with medical devices.  Today a very important file went from my portfolio to that of the Commissioner for the Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, Elbieta Biekowska, but we have joint responsibility.<br\/><br\/>Very sensitive questions have been raised.  I am a cardiac surgeon and I cannot imagine cardiac surgery without medical devices and technology.  Such devices and technology must be assessed and controlled and the relevant notified bodies must be informed.  We must keep an eye on the medical devices directive.  The Latvian Presidency is ready to act and we will work together.  Ireland submitted huge technical files on medical devices covering many topics in detail.  Such information is important to be more effective and comprehensive with regard to clinical trials data, because we must know the positive and negative aspects.  We must have transparency in clinical trials.  Not all 28 member states have the capacity to have a notified body for everything, so we must have a European network and mechanisms.  I am ready to ask my colleagues for more detailed answers if committee members wish.<br\/><br\/>The issue of the Internet was raised.  I have been asked by Finland to help stop the advertising of alcohol on the Internet because it is impossible to regulate it at member state level.  At this meeting we have discussed excise issues relating to Northern Ireland and Ireland, as the price of alcohol is different in both states.  It is impossible to deal with these issues in one member state, but if minimum pricing and VAT are raised at EU level various countries and stakeholders will resist it.  I agree that we must keep our eye on it.<\/p><p>Young people buy many things, from electronic cigarettes to contraceptives and drink.  The difference is that we must all act together.  Let us act to together and look at the possibility of change because the situation is so dangerous.  I would like to check Ireland's position.<\/p><p> On obesity and budgets, it is always difficult to say how much money should be allocated to public health promotion initiatives, but after one year I know enough to ask questions.  I would like to present to the committee the common picture and to send this study to my government and ask that the strategic committee follow my statement to say which approach is more effective.  <\/p><p> My final slide is on statistics for demographic, mortality, unemployment and abortion rates.  In 1989 we had 3.6 million inhabitants; today we have 3 million, indicating a loss of population.  Every year some 35,000 to 36,000 people die, deaths due to alcohol, tobacco and accidents, deaths which are avoidable.  I view this loss of life in economic terms, noting how much money is wasted every year by not paying attention to these deaths.  Now that I am speaking about the European Union, I have an idea about the investment package proposal.  I propose that we call together our specialists to discuss the possibility of making additional investment of about &euro;180 million to &euro;200 million to introduce and co-ordinate the instruments on the table to reduce alcohol and tobacco consumption and promote public health initiatives.  We must control in a co-operative manner health risks and set yearly targets.  This will have implications for investment in terms of growth and employment.  I would like to raise with my colleagues the possibility of calculating the proposed expenditure and agreeing on how the money should be spent.  For example, we could have instruments to reduce alcohol and tobacco consumption and the level of obesity.  All member states should be profiled and we should establish the instruments on which they will co-operate at European Union level.  That is the route I would like to follow.  I ask the committee to raise these questions in Parliament and present the outcome to the European Parliament.  This message should be sent to all stakeholders because together we can improve our capacity.  Today, around 1.2% of total budgets is allocated for prevention measures.  Let us not discuss the need for additional moneys but discuss the possibility of using effective instruments in year one.  In the second year we must be more active and encourage member states to draw attention to the need for greater investment.  <\/p><p> I think about the budget question a lot and see a very different picture today.  There are different strategies - the cancer strategy, the alcohol strategy and the tobacco strategy.  My aim is to try to join all of them together.  I would like to see neighbouring countries, for example, Ireland and the United Kingdom, discussing instruments.  We must co-operate and adopt a coherent approach to resolving these common issues and questions and use the instruments agreed to by all member states.  I have resolved to present indicators and instruments to my colleagues.  Having lost three months, I have only five years and would like all of us to move forward together.  <\/p><p> I have been asked about budgets for measures to tackle obesity and the lack of physical activity.  In some countries it is mandatory to have two lessons in physical education each week.  We must see the possibilities to encourage children to be more physically active.

Unfortunately, as it did not succeed, essentially we are in a new political environment.  The Parliament has adopted its position on the proposals, but the Council has yet to decide.  It is a difficult issue which involves the approval of medical devices at member state level.  Under the new proposals, we propose a hybrid model.  Approval would rest with individual member states, but in the case of more sensitive medical devices, there would be opportunities to review the position at European level.  It is a huge industry which is hugely important.  First and foremost, everybody agrees that medical devices must be safe.  Secondary to this is the huge economic significance of the sector, of which Ireland is well aware, as it has a huge medical devices sector.  It has a well functioning medical products regulatory agency which is world renowned and making an important input.<\/p> <p>  It is important to highlight the fact that we are not doing nothing while the legislation is being discussed.  In parallel with the legislative procedures, we have put in place a range of measures to strengthen national procedures.  A so-called joint action plan was agreed between the Commission and member states in recognition of the fact that we could not simply sit and wait for the new legislation to take effect.  We must do something in the interim.  For example, we now carry out audits in all member states to review the performance of the notified bodies referred to by the Commissioner to see that they are working to the appropriate standards.

I have specific questions about alcohol, one of which relates to the EU alcohol strategy.  Despite the work undertaken on the EU action plan, there has been no EU-wide alcohol strategy in place since the end of 2012.  Why is this and when can we expect one to be implemented?  Alcohol harm is a serious issue across Europe, particularly in Ireland where the Government is taking proactive steps to address the burden in the forthcoming public health (alcohol) Bill.  Why is this not a priority issue for the European Union?  The EU action plan to tackle youth drinking and heavy episode drinking primarily focuses on the targeting of alcohol abuse by young people.  How exactly will it limit the accessibility of alcoholic drinks?<\/p> <p>  Last week in the European Parliament the Commissioner welcomed the fact that member states could now decide to grow their own GM vegetables and produce.  I am told that Spain already grows 150,000 hectares of GM maize.  The United States has in recent times approved the production of a new modified potato and we know that the production of GM crops and vegetables is spreading throughout the rest of the world.  Does the Commissioner anticipate that allowing national governments to take decisions in this area will lead to a surge in GM crop cultivation throughout the European Union?<\/p> <p>  One of the Commissioner's first actions following his appointment was to visit some of the countries affected by Ebola in west Africa.

I am a fellow doctor.  I was reading his interesting career history and commend him for his many professional and personal achievements.  I also serve on the public affairs committee of the European Society of Medical Oncology, the group that regulates medical oncology.  With other groups with a strong research focus, we are concerned about the potential implications of the EU data protection regulation and the chilling effect it could have on medical research in Europe.  The regulation is being discussed at the Council and a trialogue is set to begin once the Council reaches agreement on its approach.  Since the proposals were introduced in 2012, the European Society of Medical Oncology has been trying very hard to raise awareness of the potentially negative impact of the regulation on health research.  However, the European Parliament's position on this topic has been very strict and limited.  It has not fully appreciated the potentially negative effect the regulation could have on the conduct of research on cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular and other diseases.  That we are having a regulation, as well as a clinical trials regulation, gives us a unique opportunity to ensure this will not happen and that there will be a harmonised interpretation of articles and recitals pertaining to health research across the European Union.  I request that the Commissioner try to ensure the final outcome of the regulation will create an environment that will foster, instead of restricting, health research, especially via a harmonised interpretation of the text across member states.  I have been asked by my society to give the Commissioner a confidential briefing document which outlines the possibility of securing this from other national representatives in the European Society of Medical Oncology.<\/p> <p>  I became involved in the issue of producing anti-tobacco legislation and was shocked to discover the scope of the lobbying effort on behalf of the tobacco industry in Brussels.

There is no hiding from the fact that obesity is a problem in Ireland.  The joint committee recognises that much has been written in recent years about the long-term dangers of childhood obesity.  We all know the underlying causes: a sedentary lifestyle, poor diet and lack of education.  We have had many sectors represented before the committee, including food production, health, sport and fitness, as we want to be better informed and reflect on and identify the key issues involved.  One of the elements of dealing with a complex and multi-faceted problem such as the obesity epidemic is a willing and co-ordinated response from the Government at both a political level and Departments.<\/p><p>The response should be imaginative, forward thinking and courageous.  We need ministerial consensus with regard to the facts that whatever strategies are agreed must be implemented regardless of the short-term cost because the cost of the future failure would be both high and potentially unsustainable.  <\/p><p> Some of the key issues are education and public awareness.  We must create an environment where an effective education policy in relation to healthy nutrition is promoted and funded by the Government on an ongoing basis.  An environment should be created so that young entrepreneurs aged between 17 and 23 years old who wish to enter the health and fitness sector are not penalised by commercial rates.  Supermarkets should be encouraged and given an objective of ensuring that at least as much food and shelf space is given to whole food, unprocessed fresh meat, fruit and vegetables as given to crisps, pizzas, confectionary, desserts, chocolate and alcohol, etc.  The excessive consumption of junk food not only adds high levels of fat, salt and sugar but also strips constituent ingredients of vitamins, iron and fibre.<\/p><p> This is an opportune time to use tax incentives in a positive way to promote healthy living.  By offering tax breaks, commercial rate exemptions and VAT exemptions to businesses such as juice bars, gyms, tennis clubs, farm shops, cookery schools, yoga, aerobic and dance classes, hill walking, aqua sports, paintball and other sports activity, we can stimulate economic activity, create jobs and build a long-term positive social infrastructure.  As a sports fanatic I believe we need to promote a healthy lifestyle and to encourage our children to get out and about from the start.<\/p><p> I am very grateful to my colleagues for nominating me as rapporteur of the child obesity study.  These are only some of the key issues.  I would also like to present the Commissioner with a copy of the report on childhood obesity.

In regard to dealing with GMO, I will ask my colleagues to add to my comments.<\/p> <p>  The alcohol strategy was raised.  The way to deal with alcohol and tobacco products will not be in a five year but a 20 year strategy.  It will be adopted at European Parliament and European Council levels and agreed with member states.  The vast number of evidence based articles and studies have provided what we need to know.  Some 75 of my friends worked on the risk factors of non-communicable diseases at  the WHO in Geneva and Copenhagen.  In our universities, we established a public health faculty.  However, there are always opponents who raise questions and pose riddles on how we deal with issues.  We must introduce agreed instruments which are effective based on the evidence.  The most effective measure to deal with alcohol is education but education is a long-term measure.  However, there is evidence of its effectiveness.  It is one plus.  Effectiveness comprises a number of elements.  Firs, there is long-term political law; second there is pricing; third, there is advertising; fourth is the necessity to reduce accessibility to buy alcohol an to regulate the rules in supermarkets about buying alcohol; and fifth, there is the necessity not to use alcohol in cars.  There are many effective measures that reduce the use of alcohol but they in turn reduce business and lower profits.  There are always those who will want to veto such initiatives.  We are medical doctors.  We know from the evidence-based studies about the problems caused by alcohol.<\/p> <p>  My vision is to create a concrete plan of measures every year.  I made a presentation to my government on concrete coherent measures that must be implemented together and must be implemented over the current and following five year terms of the Parliament.  We have a ten year action plan to work together and step by step we hope to see the result of reducing the consumption of alcohol.<\/p> <p>  There is a pattern of binge drinking among young people.  There is a need to build an architecture, a programme of streamlined measures to reduce alcohol use.  The scientist Robert Brown describes zigzag, irregular motion known as Brownian motion.  We need to establish common goals and then look at the common results.  I want to emphasise not only strategy but the complexity of combining all risk factors and seeing the possibilities to implement our findings.  We must use the results of broad and chronic diseases and must prevent early deaths.  We must avoid the harm that is caused by alcohol.

It should be well understood that the use of GMOs is not a tool that would allow member states to decide on what they would like to plant in their fields that is the opposite from what is assessed as safe.  At European level, countries can decide to opt out of using GMOs in their country or region.<\/p><p>It remains still be to be assessed and safety-confirmed at the European level.  It is clearly specified in the proposed text that if something other than a safety consideration is relevant for a particular country or region - it may relate to a cultural issue, a public order matter or a certain system of agriculture - the country or region can opt out of using the particular variety to be planted.  It is important to understand that we recognise that a member state may decide, for reasons unconnected to safety , that it does not want to cultivate the variety in question.  That is the logic of the proposal.  I do not foresee any increase in cultivation in Europe based on that.  I would rather say the opposite - we will have clean information about the real reasons.  If it is a question of safety, we will simply ban it at European level.  We will not allow unsafe varieties to be produced or cultivated.  If the safety issue is resolved, at least we will know it is not wanted for this reason or that reason.

They have no water, no sanitation, no toilets and no electricity.  Millions of people have no possibilities to wash their hands.  Can the members of the committee imagine such an environment?  The Ebola virus is transmitted through direct contact rather than through the air.  All the human figures must make contact as they go around because of the way the sinks are on the ground.
