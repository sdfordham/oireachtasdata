The conclusion of his opinion is that he is aware the Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill is currently on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and that it seems to him to that the present lacuna in the registration system can only be cured by a statutory amendment to the definition of \"stillborn child\" to expressly include an unborn child of a given weight and age who dies in the womb of the mother as a result of the mother's death or, alternatively, that such an unborn child in such circumstances must be provided for in a separate category.<\/p><p>  I know the Minister of State has received the advice of the Attorney General but this is the advice of a very respected senior counsel who practises extensively in this particular area of law and which runs directly counter to it.

However, I will not hold up the passage of the Bill.<\/p><p>  Given the substantial change, it is interesting that those who would normally lobby us in terms of human rights and changes to the law, such as the Law Society of Ireland, have not been in contact on this.  There is a degree of compulsion, albeit in some ways welcome because in a small society in Ireland there are elements of genetics, elements of the rights of a child to know his or her father and a range of issues on which everybody is exercised, but there are also the rights of the mother on occasion as well, for instance, in the case of rape.  Will there be a compulsion, if the woman has not reported it?<\/p><p>  In the case of young people, for instance, there is a consequence, if a 15 year old who got pregnant declares on the birth certificate of the child a 15 or 16 year old father, that the father could be charged.  We had this debate not so long ago where one is dealing with a child in one sense, but also with a criminal offence which now is reportable.  In such a case, any official, doctor, nurse or registrar would have to report it immediately to social services and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and rightly so, but it is in some ways the unknown consequence.  I am not saying that we necessarily create a loophole, but we must be aware that sometimes when we try to do right there can be instances where the outcome is not favourable.  Perhaps that is covered in part of the Bill which allows the Registrar not to register if there is compelling reason and in that case, it might be that the Registrar would say to leave it a few years.  The problem is that if the Registrar said that, he would be breaking the law.<\/p><p>  There are many instances where the mother will not register the father, maybe because at the time of birth he is abusive or for one or more of a range of issues, and there is a retrospective registering of the father.  Similar to Deputy O'Dea's last request, in a case where a father challenges this and says \"No\", will the State pay for the DNA tests at that stage if he refuses to acknowledge or be named on a birth certificate if he has no role in the life of the mother or child?  I ask this because it will be a challenge.  There are a lot of fathers who are aware of their responsibilities, have denied them for years and will not take it easily that they are being named on birth certificates.  Somebody must foot the bill to ensure, if they are the father, that such is recognised through a DNA test or some mechanism.  In that instance one is getting into compulsion.<\/p><p>  I am not opposed to the section but am striking a note of caution.  The system has worked quite well up until now.  For many years there has been a problem where for beneficial financial reasons some might have signed the birth certificate with the father's name on it.  I might come back to the matter to see whether I can tighten it up a little at Report Stage or I might leave it to the Minister.  We have at least raised those concerns.  Perhaps the Registrar, when this is passed, can have a detailed note on what to do in specific instances, but I would be interested in those complex cases involving the teenage years of 15 and 16.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014110500005#D01100","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1415193300,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.

On the child safety element of not including the father's name, on receipt of a statutory declaration from the mother that it would not be in the best interests of the child to have the name of the father included, the Registrar, taking into account the evidence available to him or her, may decide not to include the father's name on the birth record.

I appreciate that this does not fall under the remit of the Minister of State or the Department of Social Protection.  The corresponding rights should be given to the fathers.  Obviously, fathers have rights and responsibilities.  As far as I am aware, in Scotland and the other jurisdictions in the UK, if one's name is on the birth certificate one gets automatic guardianship rights.  I am sure that is qualified in a manner like that outlined by the Minister of State, for example, when issues arise regarding the best interests of the child.  The proposal made by the Department of Justice and Equality in a forthcoming Bill does not nearly go far enough.  It continues the discrimination against unmarried fathers.  To be honest, it does this in a kind of moral or judgmental way.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said things have worked well, but I do not think they really have.  In addition to my anecdotal knowledge of cases, I have some family law experience from my time as an apprentice solicitor.  I was not involved in this area when I worked as a solicitor.  When I was dealing with cases, I felt that many unmarried fathers, or even fathers who were married, were pushed away from playing a part in their children's lives.  It is the law that does that as much as anything else.  I suggest that if they were given more rights, they would take more responsibility.  As I recall it, a finding along these lines was contained in a study that was carried out at one stage by an academic at Waterford Institute of Technology.  The study basically suggested that the rules and regulations of our society, and the manner in which things operate, are pushing unmarried fathers away from playing an active part as parents.  While I welcome this legislation as a start, I think the corresponding legislation should be used to follow the example of other jurisdictions that give full guardianship rights to unmarried fathers whose names are on birth certificates.  I just wanted to make that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014110500006#E00700","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1415193900,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her contribution.

That full participation is often blocked by legislation.  There is quite a campaign in this regard.  I would have great sympathy for it.  A children and family relationships Bill, the general scheme of which was published last month, is currently being drafted by the Department of Justice and Equality.  I think the ideas expressed in the Deputy's comments would fit very well into that legislation.  I am not sure whether that Bill will come before this committee.  On a personal basis, I will be very interested in the progress of that Bill through the Oireachtas.  I am sure every Deputy who is present has encountered on many occasions the scenario outlined by Deputy Tuffy.  It is not just the father who is affected - there is also an impact on the grandparents and the wider family.  I hope the forthcoming children and family relationships Bill can capture this in some way.  When one is drafting legislation, it is very difficult to use it as a blunt instrument where families are concerned.

What is the relevant level here?  The major change we are being asked to agree will make it quite difficult for non-EU citizens to marry.  At the very least, it will make them jump through an extra loop through which Irish citizens do not have to jump.  Due to the level of emigration in recent years, many young Irish citizens have travelled abroad.  In the coming years, some of them might come back to Ireland with a fianc&eacute; in order to marry here.  We need to be careful to ensure what we provide for here does not restrict a loving couple in any way.  Is the problem of marriages of convenience of such a scale that it requires a substantial change in law?  We have heard about it in the newspapers, especially in the tabloids that love to run with stories suggesting that problems like this are rampant.  The number of marriages involving EU or non-EU citizens in Ireland is not that high.  I think it was higher in 2009.  Some of the criteria that will be considered are quite interesting.  They show how much we have moved.  One of the factors to be considered is whether \"the parties to the intended marriage have lived together in the past or if they currently live together\".  I can imagine Archbishop McQuaid looking at that many moons ago.<\/p> <p>The questions on where they have lived are interesting, particularly if it was abroad.  There is always the test with regard to how they know each other.  Many years ago I was on a television programme similar to \"Mr &amp;amp; Mrs\" on Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge when it was in its infancy; that is how far back it was.

In advance of the meeting questions were gathered from committee members and submitted to the Bank of Ireland.  I thank Mr. Boucher and his staff for responding in writing to these questions and the responses have been distributed to committee members.  These responses, together with the input of the witnesses today, should mean all of the key topics will be covered but, nonetheless, a question and answer session will follow to clarify matters.<br\/>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to switch off all mobile telephones.  I advise the witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are further directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br\/>Before I ask Mr. Boucher to begin I want us to agree on some ground rules to ensure everyone has an opportunity to ask questions as this will allow for the best meeting possible.

The clerk to the committee and I will be keeping an eye on the clock and I will advise members when a minute is remaining of their time to allow them to wrap up because I will be keeping them within their allotted time.  If members have further questions I will be happy, time permitting, to allow them to speak again once I have given everyone a fair opportunity to put their questions.  It would not serve the purpose of the meeting if the time is used to make statements because witnesses would not have the opportunity to respond properly.  I ask members and witnesses to keep their questions and answers short and to the point to facilitate the best interaction possible.  I ask members' co-operation to assist in the smooth running of the meeting.  Is that agreed? Agreed.

As members will be aware, Bank of Ireland received an investment of &euro;4.8 billion from the taxpayer.  The bank has repaid that in full.  We paid in excess of &euro;6 billion in cash to the taxpayer and the taxpayer retains a valuable 14% discretionary shareholding in the bank.  There are ongoing developments in the regulatory landscape at European level which relate to our sector, including the single supervisory mechanism for banks which officially came into being yesterday, 4 November 2014.  As part of these reforms, the European Central Bank recently announced the results of its comprehensive assessment of 130 banks, including Bank of Ireland group.  The overall result for Bank of Ireland confirmed that the group has passed the ECB comprehensive assessment with substantial capital buffers.  With regard to the wider economy, we see a strengthening of the economic recovery.  The latest Bank of Ireland economic outlook, which was published last month, projects growth of 4.2% for 2015, up from our forecast earlier this year of approximately 3.4%.  The economy is, therefore, recovering more quickly than we anticipated.  Our meeting is timely in that context.<\/p><p>  We provided a comprehensive presentation to members in advance of our meeting, including an overview of the bank; a guide to our strategic objectives, an update on issues relating to the comprehensive assessment; our interim management statement, which issued on Friday and is the latest information we have provided to the market on our performance and prospects; and an overview of our main businesses as they relate to our Irish operations.  We have also returned to the committee the answers to a range of questions.  We have given as much detail as we can in answering these questions and we have also provided guidance on where the relevant information is listed in our annual reports.  We have also supplied additional documentation in the form of various public announcements.<\/p><p>  As a public company we make extensive disclosures on a wide range of issues through various formats and media.  Given that we are 86% owned by the private sector, certain information is in our judgment commercially sensitive and due to our responsibilities to all shareholders and my duties as director, we have to signal that we strive to ensure members have the necessary and appropriate opportunity to understand our strategy.  As a public company quoted in the London and New York stock exchanges, all information we have provided has been verified.  As this is a public discussion and we have issued a public document on the bank's trading performance, I am obliged to say on record this is not a guide to future performance of the bank and is not a solicitation for people to buy stock in the bank.<\/p><p>  The State's 14% discretionary shareholding in the bank is a matter for the Minister for the Finance.  Under our approved EU restructuring plan, with all State aid having been repaid, the relationship between the Minister and the bank is governed by our relationship framework agreement, which recognises the bank as a separate economic entity managed on a commercial basis and engaging with the Minister in accordance with best institutional practice.  Our goal for this meeting is to present to and discuss with the committee our performance and strategy based on the best institutional shareholder practice.<\/p><p>  Slides 5 and 6 of our presentation summarises an extensive document and refers to a number of issues.  Bank of Ireland has made considerable progress over the past 12 months, and certainly since we appeared before the committee 12 months ago.  This has been assisted by the fact that the economic environment in our core markets of Ireland and the United Kingdom has continued to improve.  We have completed the repayment of the taxpayers' investment and the taxpayers have made a profit.  On today's market capitalisation of &euro;9.7 billion, the 14% shareholding that the taxpayers have in the bank has a notional value of approximately &euro;1.3 billion.  It is a significant milestone on top of our repayment to the taxpayers that we are now profitable and generating capital.  We have passed the ECB's comprehensive assessment with significant buffers.  We have robust funding and capital ratios which provide both security and support for our strategic growth objectives.  Our defaulted loans have decreased by &euro;1.9 billion between June 2013 and September 2014, and our new lending is on target.  Our Irish consumer, business and corporate banking target in our financial plan for 2013-17 is new lending into the economy of &euro;33 billion.<\/p><p>  In terms of the economy as a whole, our view is that it is going through the classic phases of an economic recovery in a restructured economy.  The main feature that has emerged over the past 12 months has been that internal demand and consumption are complementing the growth in exports.  Bank of Ireland is the largest lender into the Irish economy.  We are the No. 1 bank for SMEs.  Based on our information and verified analysis of Central Bank information, we have provided over 50% of new non-property lending to SMEs in 2014 to date.  We have enjoyed particularly strong performance in our agriculture, motor finance and commercial finance businesses.  We provide more than 50% of new lending to the agriculture sector.  Bank of Ireland's corporate bank has a market share of more than 30% and well over 50% of foreign direct investment companies bank with us.  We have a market share of approximately 25% of savings products.  Our mortgage business in Ireland is providing one in every three new mortgages.  Our life assurance business, New Ireland, is the No. 2 overall provider of life pensions and investments in Ireland.  In Northern Ireland we have a universal bank offering.  We have been through a significant cost restructuring programme to position ourselves in that market.  We are determined to remain in Northern Ireland and to position ourselves to reflect the particular dynamics of that market.  In Great Britain, through our partnership model with the post office we are one of the largest challenger consumer banking franchises.  With 3 million customers, we have more customers in Great Britain than we do in our Irish businesses.  In addition, we have a very profitable acquisition finance business which operates in the US and continental Europe and which has negotiated its way through a number of credit cycles utilising its cash flow lending expertise.<\/p><p>  Slides 14 and 15 deal with the components of the new banking union.  Members will have noted the results for Bank of Ireland, which confirm we have significant buffers.  Slides 17 to 20 are directly extracted from the market announcement we made last Friday.  I will not go through them other than to highlight that our revenue has continued to go up and our new lending is on target.  The group has remained focused on tight cost control while we continue to invest in our people, businesses and infrastructure.  We confirmed in our announcement that we are in the process of a ballot by IBOA represented staff on a comprehensive new career and reward framework which was recommended by an independent arbitrator.  Our asset quality trends have continued to improve in line with our expectations.  We believe this reflects the work we are doing and the overall improvement in the economy.  The figure for total defaulted loans has decreased by &euro;1.9 billion since June 2013 to &euro;16.4 billion on 30 September 2014.  We continue to generate capital at a significant pace and have seen an increase of 180 basis points in our common equity tier 1 ratio from 12.3% at the end of January to 14.1% at the end of September.<\/p><p>  Slide 24 provides some information on our new lending in Ireland.  It is not up-to-date to the end of September but in our September update we indicated that lending growth had continued at roughly the same pace.  We can see where our lending growth has gone, particularly in our Irish business, in our SME business, in our corporate banking and our mortgage business.<\/p> <p>Slide 26 shows a confirmation of the group's balance sheet at the end of September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014110500004#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richie Boucher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415196900,"counter":150,"content":"<p>On what page is that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014110500005#F00200","speaker":"1048"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415196900,"counter":151,"content":"<p>Page 26.

A mortgage is a 20 to 25-year instrument and we take liquidity risk in the provision of mortgages.  We look at those as they operate elsewhere.  Yesterday the Irish Government, which is, in effect, the base risk-free investment, issued a 15-year bond at just under 2.5%.  Our fixed rate offering is 4.99% and that is a 2.5% margin.  For our margin, and, in particular, for our capital allocation models and the capital allocation the Central Bank requires to hold against our different books, we must take into consideration our loss experience.  Our loss experience on our Irish mortgage books has been different from what it has been in Europe.  Another comparator I would note is that we have a business in the UK and our mortgage business in the UK is roughly the same size as our Irish mortgage business.  It is a very similar type of market structure and I will return to why that is the case.  The spreads and margins in the UK in which we operate are the same.<br\/>Some reference has been made to a comparison between Irish rates and European rates.  A couple of features I would note in that respect is that the loss experience is different, so the capital allocation is different.  However, a very significant feature of a number of the European markets is tax-based subsidies for bond markets.  An example is the <i>Pfandbriefe <\/i>market in Germany where banks operate as originators and issuers and they sell their mortgages on to bond markets.  If we take into account that there is tax-based or taxpayers' subsidy for those bond markets, it is not comparable.  The more comparable market in terms of market structure and access to bond markets is the UK market against the Irish market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014110500005#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richie Boucher"},{"type":"speech","time":1415196900,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Boucher.

As my time is limited, I can only cover some of the key issues.  I want to continue with the issue the Chairman raised, in particular about the pricing strategy for standard variable rate mortgages.  The bank is currently charging in the region of 4.5% for a new mortgage if the loan-to-value is over 80%.  How can Mr. Boucher justify that when his stated cost of funds is 1.15%, which have come down by about 30% in the past 12 to 18 months?  The bank's margin has increased very substantially.  Most people would regard a variable rate product as one where if the market conditions are bad, the rate is going to go up, but when the market conditions are good, people expect the variable rate to come down, but that has not happened.  When was the last standard variable rate reduction by Bank of Ireland in respect of mortgage products?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014110500005#F00900","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415196900,"counter":158,"content":"<p>The last reduction would have been in 2008 or 2009.  There has been no significant interest rate cycle in that period.  The group's net interest margin has improved in the 12 month period from 1.65% to 2.08%.  That is progress but is certainly not an exorbitant margin.  We have to get 98% of our credit decisions right before we can make any money or cover our costs at that particular margin.  As I was trying to identify in my answer to the Chairman's question, the structure and liquidity risk one takes against mortgages are important.  We are providing a mortgage which has a significant liquidity risk.  We have a repricing opportunity but we are giving a 25-year commitment of money to the customer.  We cannot raise that money so it is not necessarily comparable to look at our overall cost of funds.  For example, if we issue a covered bond or unsecured debt in the markets, we are issuing it at about 2% to 3%.  The Irish Government in raising 15-year money in the market at 250 basis points.  One has to take account of the nature of the product one provides, the liquidity risks, the historic credit losses one has taken and the capital one applies.  There are a range of factors in that.  We have to enhance our margin but we try to ensure our products are competitive on an ongoing basis.  We are a commercial business, we operate in a competitive market and we must ensure our products are sustainably competitive, that we can continue in the market, attract customers and do business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014110500005#F01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richie Boucher"},{"type":"speech","time":1415196900,"counter":159,"content":"<p>The bank's margin has increased very substantially.  Its cost of funds has reduced very substantially by about one third in the past 12 to 18 months and yet Mr. Boucher is telling me it is about six years since Bank of Ireland has reduced the standard variable rate being charged.  One of the bank's main competitors, AIB, has stolen a march on it in the market and has reduced its rate.  I presume Bank of Ireland will have to follow suit.  Mr. Boucher will not confirm that today but, ultimately, the market will dictate the bank's reaction.  I submit to Mr. Boucher that the bank is taking advantage of variable rate customers.  They are being exploited.  It will come as a surprise to nobody that a bank seeks to maximise profits, but this bank is profiteering on the backs of variable rate customers.

There is a more competitive environment in the North.  If, after two years, Bank of Ireland does not keep the rate low for a customer, he or she can switch to another bank.

They are trying to make a start in life again and Bank of Ireland is putting them on the hook until they pay everything.  If I was a banking analyst, I would recommend buying Bank of Ireland shares at one level because I think it is screwing everybody to the point that it is getting every last penny it is owed out of them.  As the State is a shareholder, we have an obligation to see the bank do well, but I think it has gone over the top on it.  I think it is doing damage to the brand of Bank of Ireland.  People in this country talk.  Bank of Ireland is an outlier in the way it is treating people.  My key point is that it is too harsh.<\/p><p>  Accountants and financial consultants throughout the country will say that Bank of Ireland is the last institution people want to deal with on mortgages and debt.  The witnesses are potentially damaging the brand.  As a shareholder, I say that is not good enough.  AIB stands in much better stead with the public because it is writing down money and restructuring debts.  It is not coming after people to screw every last penny from them or forcing them to give up their personal homes.<\/p><p>  I have a fundamental problem with much of this.  At one level Bank of Ireland has a licence provided by the Central Bank.  The State bailed it out.  I do not want to get personal and I wish the witnesses all the very best in what they are trying to do.  However, their line of tack is wrong.  Bank of Ireland is given a licence by the institutions of the country to do the best thing by the people.  I believe the witnesses need to re-evaluate.  I will be writing to the Minister for Finance, as the custodian of the 14% stakeholding.  I will be writing to the public interest directors.  I think the brand of Bank of Ireland is potentially damaged at the moment, largely due to the policy it pursuing.  It needs to ease off a little.

Moreover, in the North, Bank of Ireland is giving absolutely identical customers a fixed rate for two years that is half the rate it would give to them in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014110500010#L03900","speaker":"1060","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415200500,"counter":362,"content":"<p>There is one minute in this slot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014110500011#M00200","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415200500,"counter":363,"content":"<p>First, I do not think we can compare the customer and our loss experience is quite different, so the capital required is different.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014110500011#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richie Boucher"},{"type":"speech","time":1415200500,"counter":364,"content":"<p>With due respect to Mr. Boucher, Bank of Ireland is, more or less, charging the same variable rate.

The question of how the defaulted loans come down is a key criterion on which as a company we are judged by everyone.  The first factor that is a contributor to this is to ensure - in so far as we can and the economy is a function of this - that the number of customers defaulting reduces.  In each of our portfolios, the number of customers defaulted has reduced.  Then, there is the absolute quantum of defaulted loans and what is one's provisional coverage.  What is one's best estimate of one's loss against that?  We hold provisional coverage of just under 50% of coverage against our estimate of potential loss, taking account of the collateral and so on that we hold.  Then, we look at the defaulted loans and whether they themselves are reducing.  Are the arrears coming down, are we holding sufficient coverage ratios and are there defaulted loans?

It is hard to be definitive as to who would not have qualified.  We make an offer to the customers, who state they would like this or that.  When we assess customers, the primary assessment we make is on income capacity.  We see the mortgage as security but as my colleague pointed out in response to an earlier question, we are looking at loans to individuals based on their assessment of their income capacity.  If we look at the multiple in particular, there are two features to that.  We look at the income multiples and the income multiple is the primary criterion under which we assess someone.  If the income multiple does not meet our assessment of a person's ability to repay a mortgage, the loan to value is not a deciding factor.  We start with the income capacity and then consider the potential drags on people's income.  We also then assume that interest rates will not stay the same forever.  We will assume in a sensitivity test that we will add approximately 250 to 300 basis points to make sure that if interest rates rise, a customer's repayment capacity, everything else being equal, still remains sufficient for the customer to service the mortgage.  Thereafter, the loan to value comes into play.

It has improved, but if it had remained below 200 basis points, we would not be in profit.  That is an important factor.  We are obliged to consider different products in terms of their maturity profiles.  It is important for us to bear in mind the fact that in the context of a mortgage, we are taking deposits short in the market and making a commitment to the customer that we will lend to him or her.  Therefore, we have a liquidity risk.  In our asset classes, mortgages drive the single biggest liquidity risk.  In the context of the UK market, one of the biggest strategic mistakes the bank made and our largest single issue was related to the liquidity risk it faced with its mortgage book there.

At present, the margin is 3.25%.  I understand the bank is obliged to make a profit, but I want to know if a review is required of the current level of profit.  When Mr. Boucher appeared before the committee previously, we dealt with the issue of split mortgages and the manner in which Bank of Ireland was dealing with them.  At the time it was retaining the interest on the warehouse portion of mortgages to the full extent.  Mr. Boucher went away and reviewed the position and the bank then reduced the margin of profit on the split side of mortgages.

In that context, the 80:20 ratio announced by the Governor of the Central Bank presents a difficulty.  In the past people ignored the regulator and the Central Bank and we know to where that led.  There is a great deal of merit in what the Governor of the Central Bank is saying.

This is key for today's setting and conversation because we can all get lost in the micro-management of the balance sheets, funding and arrears and so on.  On page 62 of Mr. Boucher's submission today, look at the court of directors at the top of that pyramid and see what their key responsibilities are.  I am suggesting that Mr. Boucher should have had the governor and a couple of non-executive directors here with him today.  I am going to go through them with him and ask him to see the point that is being made.<\/p><p>  On top of the risk pyramid of a &euro;125 billion or &euro;130 billion balance sheet, the board has the ultimate oversight and accountability for the risk and related control environment in the group. It is responsible for reviewing and approving risk appetites, risk framework and policies.  All the detail in here this afternoon has been about the execution of those policies.  Mr. Boucher has hesitated and ultimately refused to answer Deputy Doherty's question as to whether there are no write-offs in cases where the loan had originally been secured but the security is insufficient.  The loan has had full examination and stretching in order to be repaid by the customer and there are no write-offs.  That is a credit policy.  <\/p><p>  We will go through the members of the court of directors. Governor Archie Kane has been a year and a half in the Bank of Ireland and he comes from England,  from Lloyd's Bank.  Kent Atkinson, director number two, comes from England again, and has also been at Lloyd's.  Mr. Boucher himself is the longest-serving member of the court at seven and a half years.  Next is Pat Butler, who has previously worked mainly with McKinsey and abroad, and has been on the court of directors for two years.  There is only one lady and she is English.  I would say that there are very few Irish experienced people on that board in terms of understanding the effects on the people of Ireland of all the bank's algebra and accountancy.  <\/p><p>  I will go back to that day in March 2009, when Bank of Ireland got &euro;3.5 billion of preference share injections to keep the group alive.  That was the right thing to do.  But it is not acceptable to be insensitive to the customers of the bank.  In Ireland we have &euro;20 billion or so in mortgage loans on residences.

They might have a tracker mortgage rate.  Bank of Ireland introduced a product in April 2013 for people on tracker mortgages who wish to move so that if they qualify for a mortgage they can keep the tracker rate plus 1% for five years on that original portion of the mortgage and any additional mortgage is at the variable rate.  The uptake seems to be quite poor.  Bank of Ireland has approved about 400 cases and about one third have been drawn down.  Would Bank of Ireland be willing to review that product to see if it could be made more attractive?  Surely from the bank's point of view, if it is lending additional money to creditworthy customers that money will be at a variable rate, so it will be making a profit on that and clearly it would be transformative for many people in that situation.  Could he comment on that and a related issue of people in negative equity who may be trapped in apartments with two or three children, a completely unsuitable environment for such families?

This was raised earlier but I was not present, and I apologise for that.  The evidence from the briefing we were given is that the bank is engaged in serious profiteering in respect of the interest rates being charged, compared to what banks in the rest of Europe are doing.

Our net interest margin is 2.08% across the group.  If one compares that with banks in Britain, the US and many European banks, it is a low net interest margin.  Relative to that, it is a recovering net interest margin, but it would not be construed as an exceptional net interest margin.  That is a fact.  There are different funding structures, different loss experiences and a range of things that impact on banks' pricing models.  We compete for our business in Ireland and for our business in the UK, continental Europe and in the US in different parts of our businesses.  We compete on the basis that we want our customers for the long term.<\/p><p>  We must have products that are sustainable.  We have seen entrants into markets, including this market, who have had unsustainable business models.  They come in with pricing structures or business models that just do not work and they leave or collapse.  Some of our competitors have collapsed.<\/p><p>  As to the Irish taxpayer, one of the key focuses of this bank, perhaps distinguishing it from other banks, is the absolute focus we had on repaying the State aid and to bring the taxpayers a profit.  The taxpayers have it.<\/p> <p>What we have returned to taxpayers is cash that can be used for other purposes.  Banks should never have been supported by or needed support from taxpayers.  We must ensure we put structures in place to make sure that will never happen again.

I put two and two together and it seems all of this property has been made vacant as receivers move in and that commercial property is being bought up by others who are presumably financed by banks like Mr. Boucher's.

The outcome of the stress tests did not come as a big surprise to Bank of Ireland because it had its own internal capital models; therefore, the availability of capital and funding for at least the past two years had not been an impediment to our lending desires.  We had put out to the market that our strategic plan, our own internal stress testing, would have us lending approximately &euro;33 billion in new money into the economy in the period from 2013 to 2017.

They expect us to deploy that capital; that capital can only be constructively deployed by us in lending new money safely.  A significant pressure on us as a management team is to safely deploy our shareholders' capital because if we do not deploy it appropriately, they will sell their shares and put the money where better opportunities can be found.  That is how the private sector works.  There is a significant strategic requirement on us to lend into the economy.

We account for over 50% of new lending into the economy.  A feature has been the fact that a lot of our new to bank lending would have involved a refinancing of people from other banks.  A particular feature we have noticed since March 2014, particularly in the SME business that comes within Mr. McLoughlin's remit, is that over 50% of our new lending involves customers who are doing new things rather than refinancing or rearranging their finances with banks exiting or where they are uncomfortable, etc.  That is an important component of the recovery.  Bank lending tends to track behind economic recovery and then to go a little beyond GDP.  Our ambition is to beat GDP.  We hope we have competitive propositions and that we are extremely focused on the market.  We lend to all sectors and have particular features.  We are lending over 50% of new money to the economy.

We will provide 65% or 70% of the finance, but if we end up with equity in a business, things have gone badly wrong for us and the customer.  We are not equity providers.  I will set out a simple sum.  If we provide &euro;1 in equity capital, that deprives us of &euro;10 worth of lending capacity because it is like for like on capital; there is that multiplier impact.  In addition and to be quite frank, we do not have the skills set.  We hope we have a better skills set in lending, but it is quite a different skills set in the case of equity.  We are seeing funds coming in with mezzanine debt, which is higher coupon and a more risky form of debt; therefore, if we provide a figure of 70%, one will have a mezzanine provider who will have a much higher debt and provide 15% but one still needs equity of 15%.

The officials are here to give overview of the banking sector in Ireland.  That is their calling card and they have kindly given us a great deal of material - financial details and percentages, etc. - running to over 80 pages.  I have tried to bring everyone back to our core responsibility of who devises the policies and strategies of the Bank of Ireland group.  I have made the point that most of the court of directors are unrepresentative of Irish households and short on experience of Ireland, in terms of its finance, economy and demographics and everything that accompanied the collapse of the economy.  It is easy to be remote and distant and not to see the impact of what happens when one is in a boardroom and how it translates in people's homes.  The figures show that for every household or customer mortgage in distress, the lives of at least three people are being ripped apart.  That is the average, but sometimes four or more are affected.  It is a serious matter and up to those who understand the machinery of balance sheets, portfolios and ledgers and how it happened to deal with it.  I applaud them for getting the group's loan-to-deposit ratio down to 111%, which is the right figure for the group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014110500020#V03200","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415205300,"counter":631,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014110500020#V03300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richie Boucher"},{"type":"speech","time":1415205300,"counter":632,"content":"<p>I think it was between 158% and 161% between March 2008 and March 2009, which was shocking.  If we take a 160% figure and measure it against the surplus using the 90% figure, the prudential, steady-Eddie bank balance sheet management amount, we will see that the average is 70%.  That figure - 70% - is the keel that should have been obtained if things had not gone out of control over seven years up to 2008 and represents measurable culpability of 75% on the part of the partial creators of the asset price bubble which had developed on the back of the credit pyramid bubble.  That is simple.  Ann and Barry readers could explain it and we do not need a banking inquiry to tell us that.  The banks, particularly the court of directors at the top of the pyramid, were culpable in those seven years.  The auditors were also culpable.  They should have been saying, &quot;Guys, stop expanding your balance sheet at this unsustainable rate.&quot;  I will explain why.  <br\/>I am sure the delegates have read Tim Geithner's book <i>Stress Test<\/i>, which is a good name and has been out for a couple of months.  In it Mr. Geithner writes about the size of the domestic banking sector in the United States, which is just over 100% of GDP, or $12 trillion.  In Ireland the culpability of the boards of banks collectively and AIB specifically is measurable because the weighted average loan to deposit figure was 173% across the Irish-owned banks.  The banking system went from three times to over five times the size of national income.  That is the credit pyramid and that is what the banks did.  We know what they are now saying to the people whose asset prices collapsed.  By the way, the 23% figure is illusory, as I said.  It is not true because the prices of these transactions do not represent the volume of transactions.  In the same way, Bank of Ireland share price today - 30 cent - when multiplied by the shares outstanding does not equal the market value of Bank of Ireland.  Similarly, the 23% figure that is based on a few transactions in Dublin does not apply to the whole property market and the banks have a responsibility to tell the Government that, as they are at the coal face of the experience, as Mr. Boucher knows.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014110500020#V03400","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1415205300,"counter":633,"content":"<p>That is great, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014110500020#V03500","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1415205300,"counter":634,"content":"<p>I would like to say one last thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014110500020#V03600","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415205300,"counter":635,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy have a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014110500020#V03700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richie Boucher"},{"type":"speech","time":1415205300,"counter":636,"content":"<p>There is no question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014110500020#V03800","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1415205300,"counter":637,"content":"<p>The guarantee that the bank-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014110500020#V03900","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1415205300,"counter":638,"content":"<p>The Deputy must stop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014110500020#V04000","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1415205300,"counter":639,"content":"<p>I ask the Chair to give me one more minute to say one last thing.

I understand the committee wishes me to address it on three matters today: extending the remit of the Ombudsman Act and recommendations on the extension of powers of all ombudsmen; two particular issues which have been the subject of petitions that have already been dealt with in closed session; and the number and nature of reports being produced by my office in the context of annual and special reports issued.<br\/>I will commence by saying that the legislation underpinning the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004 as well as section 114 of the Defence Act 1954.  In my address today I will refer to the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004 as the 2004 Act and I will refer to the Defence Act 1954 as the Defence Act. <br\/>My office was established by order of the Minister for Defence on 1 December 2005.  My office provides military personnel with an independent and impartial external statutory complaint investigation authority.  It is entirely separate and distinct from both the military chain of command and the Department of Defence.  I believe we are fully compliant with the generally recognised principles of ombudsmanship.<br\/>The ombudsman provides an appeal from the formal internal military redress of wrongs procedure, a new direct referral complaints system for former service personnel, and a new system for complaints by serving or former service personnel against the actions of a civil servant of the Department of Defence.  The outcome of investigations generally are that the ombudsman makes non-binding recommendations to the Minister.<br\/>My office produces an annual report on its activities.  The most recent such report is 2012 which was published last June.  The delay in the publication of that report was due to ongoing High Court proceedings which were entirely outside the control of my office.  The annual report for 2013 is at an advanced stage of preparation.  I intend to publish it before the end of this year.  My office has not published any special reports pursuant to section 7 of the 2004 Act.  I will inform the committee later on the activities during 2013 and 2014.<br\/>The ombudsman is appointed by the President on the recommendations of the Government.  Open competitions were held by the Public Appointments Service in 2005 and 2012.  I was appointed to the office in November 2012 for a term of three years.  The Ombudsman Association, which is an international umbrella organisation for ombudsmen, has recommended consideration of a minimum term of five years for all ombudsmen.  I would commend that recommendation to the committee for its consideration.<br\/>I wish to say a brief word about the internal military complaints system.  A formal redress of wrongs-complaints system is provided for in the Defence Act for serving members of the Defence Forces.  This has been in existence since the foundation of the State under earlier legislation.  It reflects the unique circumstances of members of the Defence Forces in society.  Soldiers are citizens who have volunteered to serve.  They retain all their constitutional rights.  By joining the Defence Forces, however, they voluntarily submit themselves to a uniquely strict code of military law and discipline.  The formal complaints system provides a key component of personal rights protection for soldiers.<br\/>Complaints should be resolved at the earliest possible opportunity.  Every complaint under the redress of wrongs system is notified to my office as an oversight body and recorded on our case management system.  The Minister agreed earlier this year to provide me with additional information regarding the nature of each such complaint, and this will improve my oversight of the internal military system.  I have also proposed a strengthening of the independence of military investigation officers appointed to investigate and report on complaints under the redress of wrongs system.  I received a copy last week of draft proposals for the revision and amendment of the redress of wrongs system on which I will respond to the Department of Defence shortly.  The Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces was created as a result of protracted lobbying by PDFORRA and as an acknowledgment of the need for a transparent, external, independent and rigorous procedure to deal with complaints across the Defence Forces.  In the case of complaints against a civil servant, I believe that there ought to be established an internal, time-limited departmental complaints resolution procedure or process with an appeal for unresolved complaints to be sent to my office.<br\/>I will say a few words about my jurisdiction.  I have jurisdiction under section 6 of the 2004 Act to hear complaints from serving and former members of the Defence Forces.  The complaints must concern actions taken by either a serving or former member of the Defence Forces while serving in the Defence Forces, or by a civil servant in the Department of Defence.  Interestingly, the word &quot;action&quot; is defined in the Act as including &quot;a failure to carry out an act or make a decision&quot;.  Complaints must be made not later than 12 months from the date of the action concerned or the date on which the complainant became aware of the action, whichever is the later.  There are no exclusions to complaints under the internal redress of wrongs system except a small provision with regard to military justice decisions.<br\/>I am inclined to suggest to the committee that consideration should be given to adding some such restrictions to the redress of wrongs system to limit multiple jurisdictions dealing with the same matters.  As ombudsman, for example, I am precluded from considering complaints on a list of matters included in section 5 of the 2004 Act.  There is also provision in legislation to ensure complaints referred to me are not also referred to the national ombudsman and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  I recommend to the committee that section 5 exclusions should be reviewed.  A simpler unified system could be provided with a greater degree of consistency between the provisions of the Defence Act and the 2004 Act.  Complaints regarding matters which are clearly administrative actions in some of the excluded areas could and should be included within my jurisdiction.<\/p> <p>On a comparative basis, I should tell the joint committee there are three models for military ombudsmen throughout the world.  The first one is where the ombudsman is integrated within the armed forces, which sometimes is referred to as an inspector general.  This probably is the oldest form of military ombudsman extant and it still is operational in some countries.  Indeed, the Defence Act in Ireland contains a provision for the appointment of an inspector general.  The second such model is one in which the ombudsman has exclusive jurisdiction over the armed forces and the third is where oversight of the armed forces is subsumed into the functions of a general ombudsman.  In 2004, Ireland opted for the appointment of a civilian ombudsman, entirely independent of the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence, with exclusive jurisdiction over the Defence Forces, that is, the second of the three models I mentioned.  We share this arrangement with Austria, Canada, Germany, Norway, South Africa, the United Kingdom and, more recently, Bosnia-Herzegovina, all of which have similar-type military ombudsmen.  Independence is of critical importance for an ombudsman.  International standards show that the primary indicators of independence for ombudsmen are being independent of government and of those they are appointed to oversee.  I am satisfied the 2004 Act contains appropriate statutory provisions providing for the independence of my office along those lines.<br\/>I now wish to turn to some statistical data.  Since 2010, a total of 372 complaints have been notified to my office and since my appointment as ombudsman, more than 200 complaints have been notified to me and more than 70 cases have been appealed to me for detailed review and investigation by my office.  I should state that the ongoing High Court proceedings throughout 2013 had an impact on the number of cases that could be dealt with by my office during that time.  In November 2012, the aforementioned High Court proceedings were initiated, challenging my appointment as ombudsman and on 21 November 2013, Mr. Justice Hedigan delivered his judgment in the High Court.  His judgment ran to quite a long number of pages but I will summarise it under three aspects.  First, he stated that nothing precludes a former member of the Defence Forces from holding the post of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.  Second, he stated the appointment of a former member of the Defence Forces does not give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.  Third, he held the Minister for Defence did not act <i>ultra vires<\/i>in deciding that the office of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces should be part-time.  I should advise the joint committee that this decision is under appeal to the Supreme Court.<br\/>I already have made some recommendations to the joint committee with regard to the powers of ombudsmen in general.  I have noted the proposal of the national Ombudsman to the joint committee that his appointment be made a constitutional one and I would support such a development in his case.  As for the extension of the powers of ombudsmen generally, I have three further recommendations I could make to members if they so wish.  This concludes my presentation to the joint committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014110500004#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony McCourt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415204700,"counter":668,"content":"<p>I thank the ombudsman and will open up proceedings to members for questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014110500005#J00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1415204700,"counter":669,"content":"<p>I have a number of questions.

However, the legislation as it stands also provides that if a person had been appointed as ombudsman for the maximum term of seven years, he or she may be eligible to be reappointed.  I do not have a personal view but the International Ombudsman Association sometimes is exercised by the fact that an ombudsman who is doing a good job and is not causing too much difficulty to the powers that be may be reappointed.  The connection of a reappointment to the manner in which the ombudsman had performed his or her duties as the case may be always is a delicate balance.  Consequently, as I stated, the appointing authorities may or may not wish to extend the term of somebody on conclusion.  I do not have a personal view on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014110500005#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony McCourt"},{"type":"speech","time":1415204700,"counter":675,"content":"<p>Another issue was that the ombudsman explained that members might re-examine the exclusions in the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act.

The first thing the ombudsman must do is to consider whether it is within his or her jurisdiction and sometimes it arises that it actually is outside my jurisdiction because it is excluded by the provisions of section 5 of the Act.  I believe that if we have a complaint system that has been in place since 1922 and that if a provision for an ombudsman to be inserted between the Chief of Staff's decision and the Minister's final decision was introduced almost nine years ago, there should be the minimum of restrictions on the powers and jurisdictions of the ombudsman to deal with such complaints.  Moreover, I believe that complainants may be dissatisfied, having processed a complaint all the way up to the ombudsman's office, to find that the ombudsman is not empowered to deal with it.  There may be reasons he or she is not allowed to so do that are valid under the provisions of section 5 of the Act but sometimes - I refer to matters that can be perceived clearly to be administrative in nature - there should be scope for those to be dealt with, even in the areas that are excluded from the jurisdiction of the ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014110500005#J01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony McCourt"},{"type":"speech","time":1415204700,"counter":677,"content":"<p>I thank the ombudsman for his presentation.

That might be an area that needs to be further strengthened.<\/p><p>  We have an excellent system in the redress of wrongs system within the Defence Forces.  It has been there since 1922.  However, we should explore the possibility of the ombudsman having some involvement in that at an earlier stage rather than the final appeal stage.  I would be glad to see the good offices of my office being made available to assist at a much earlier stage so that complaints could be resolved more swiftly than they are at the moment.  That would be possible, in a review of the two systems; the redress of wrongs system under the Defence Act and the ombudsman regime under the 2004 Act.  There are possibilities there to bring a more unified system of complaint investigation.  There would be a lot interest groups who would need to have an input and agree on that before it could be implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014110500007#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony McCourt"},{"type":"speech","time":1415205900,"counter":700,"content":"<p>To finalise the matter, after today, in terms of your experience to date and in terms of your team, we would appreciate a follow-up submission from the ombudsman identifying areas where it would be very useful to have strengthened powers to strengthen the role of the office and to ensure it can fulfil as much as possible its responsibilities.

I would suggest my Office should have a discretionary authority to undertake in exceptional circumstances own-initiative investigations.  This, of course, could be subject to prior agreement with the Minister, on a case-by-case basis.  Such investigations should also be allowed to include historic matters and not be subject to the 12 months rule applicable in the Act at the moment.<\/p><p>  Second, I would suggest that section 8 of the 2004 Act should be amended in line with the provisions of section 10 of the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012 together with any future amendment to the Ombudsman Act to provide my office with improved procedures for compelling the production of documents and information.

Postcodes are a difficult technical issue, which we will try to keep as simple as possible.  Ireland needs a postcode but not any code.  A postcode is a key part of a country's soft infrastructure and is an indicator of a nation's social imagination and ingenuity.  A national postcode lasts for a long time and the postcode that Ireland introduces next year will outlive everyone in this room.  Eircode is an excellent address database for direct mail, for utilities, for the Revenue and for local property tax but it is a bad postcode.  Eircode will assign a unique identifier to every address in the country but two adjacent properties will have different randomly-assigned Eircodes.  The joint committee's briefing notes provided by FTA Ireland give some of the places that will not have a postcode and I will read into the report some of the types of places that will not have an allocated Eircode.  These include workshops, farm buildings, windmills, piers, jetties, fields, large fixed assets, lay-bys, points of interest, lanes, archaeological sites, roads, natural features, intersections, accident black spots, pylons, parks, motorways, antennae, wells, graveyards, pumping stations, viewing points, manholes or utility access points, car parks, beaches, level crossings, transformers, bridges, forests, bogs, lakes, playing pitches, cycle tracks, picnic areas, public toilets or places along walkways such as the Wild Atlantic Way.  None of these can have an Eircode unless they also have an allocated postal address.<\/p><p>  In our opinion, Eircode departs substantially from the requirements for a postcode set out by members' predecessors in the last D&aacute;il, which we have set out in annexe 2 of our submission, as well as in the postcode tender, the requirements of which are set out in annexe 3.  In annexes 4 and 5, we compare Eircode with modern Irish and international alternatives, as well as with the United Kingdom postcode, which is almost 60 years old this year.  We give a simple example of the address of our sister trade association in Belfast in annexe 5.  Unlike any of these codes, an Eircode does not recognise when two addresses are adjacent to each other.  We have picked three local addresses in Kildare Street to show this issue to members in annexe 4.<\/p><p>  Eircode will impose a significant cost on small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, in Ireland for no tangible benefit.<\/p> <p>The companies here today span the freight, parcel and energy sectors.  Delivery to Irish homes and businesses is their day job.  They know what they are talking about and they estimate that savings in the order of tens of millions of euro annually can be passed to the public via an efficient postcode system.  As a national postcode, however, Eircode lacks vision, imagination, ambition and, most of all, practicality.  Ireland needs a modern, open, location-based postcode with a useable structure and sequence.  We here today ask the communications committee to use its influence with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, to forestall Eircode's introduction as a national postcode before it is too late.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014110500003#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415180100,"counter":711,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Donnell for that direct and strong presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014110500004#G00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1415180100,"counter":712,"content":"<p>I share many of the concerns Mr. McDonnell has outlined and many of the concerns outlined in the report.

Other than getting vague statements such as \"It would be the most up-to-date postcode system in the world\", I cannot get an answer to that simple question: what problem is this postcode system attempting to solve?

It is not just a question of IT, it relates to the decision making capacity of individual drivers and they do not derive any benefit from Eircode in terms of decision making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014110500005#H01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andy Smith"},{"type":"speech","time":1415180700,"counter":739,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  Would it be fair to say that Eircode is based on a geodirectory system, a unique identifier for every address in the country?  The UK companies say the geodirectory part of it is based on a random number and that is causing them the biggest trouble.  Are there not benefits in a geodirectory system that identifies an individual address over a clustered address in terms of accuracy of delivery, leaving aside the sequential aspect of it?  One still has random numbers but because one has a unique identifier to an address, in addition to either a name, a business name, street name or house number, one has an individual code identifying a precise individual address for deliveries.  I refer to post, including commercial deliveries or parcels delivered by courier or other method.  Irrespective of the random nature of the numbering, that should be a positive development.  If the numbers were not random, would it give rise to data protection issues on the basis that one could identify who lives next door and so on?  Significant issues arise for the address owner.  Among the people who supported a geodirectory-based code are the emergency services, for example.  Given the advantages of an individual address, how does one deal with potential data protection issues?  Is that the crux of the problem?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014110500005#H01500","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415180700,"counter":740,"content":"<p>Not at all.  A unique identifier presents data protection issues that do not arise with a less granular structure.  We do not believe there are fundamental data protection issues with a unique identifier.  In the previous D&aacute;il, a similar committee dealt with the issue robustly.  Eircode is an An Post geodirectory solution.  The geodirectory has been bought out as part of the process by Capita plc, a UK company which is buying the database from An Post.  Effectively, all that is happening is that a unique, random seven character string is being added to postal and business addresses in the geodirectory.  That is the nub of the issue.  If the geodirectory was a good solution for getting parcels, freight or energy to one&rsquo;s premises, the delivery companies would be using it now.  Although geodirectory gives a longitude and latitude, that is insufficient data to route because if we go back to simple maths, a longitude and latitude gives a point and what these people want to buy are lines.<\/p> <p>I hope that makes sense.  They need to join the dots.  A random selection of dots around the country is no good to them from a routing point of view.  This is a GeoDirectory mark 2 solution and the GeoDirectory has been with us for decades.  It is not a solution now and therefore it will not be a solution if it is presented as a random post code.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014110500005#H01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415181300,"counter":742,"content":"<p>I welcome our visitors and thank them for the publication, which is most useful.  I have a couple of perspectives.  The university constituencies operate on both sides of the Border and I find it is far easier for me to send a message to a constituent in Clones than it is in Newtownbutler.  It is only eight or nine miles away but one must remember all the details.  There is, therefore, a cost involved in this.  I cannot see, as a user of the post office, that there is any benefit, as I gather that the technology can recognise addresses anyway.  It can read that it is Clones.  Adding seven numbers on to Clones to send a letter under this system accomplishes nothing.<\/p><p>  Is it true that even in the UK after 30 years there is only about 80% use of post codes but the machines recognise the rest of the mail and it goes through with no delays?  When I read that Ireland is the last country in Europe to do this, it might actually be quite sensible not to implement an unnecessary technology that is about 150 years old, going back to the first post codes in London.<\/p><p>  Taking up Deputy Colreavy's point, how much money is involved in this, and is it another Irish Water?  The witnesses are major customers and we have heard their points and read their document.  Is there any chance of stopping it from a public expenditure point of view?  We did ask the former Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte to debate it in the Seanad before he went ahead with it because there was a substantial number of people in the post office who were also against this.  Their volumes are declining very rapidly, so if the existing system cannot handle a declining volume of mail and it has the technology to recognise where Clones is, what is the point of this exercise?  We are indebted to the witnesses as public-minded citizens coming in and to tell us their views on this, but is there any remaining point in proceeding with this project?<\/p><p>  The final issue is that there are civil liberties types who are concerned about this as well.

The second question is whether it is another Irish Water.  It is a good system for the emergency services because they can pinpoint a location, but they are not pinpointing a location on a sequential basis as it is once-off locations that they are pinpointing.  In terms of an Irish Water, absolutely it is an Irish Water for the transport and logistics industry.  In hindsight we will look back and we will ask how we got that wrong as well.<\/p><p>  The Senator is right to point out that we are the last to introduce a postal code system.  We should be the best.  We are recognised in this country for being technical and digital leaders and now we have an opportunity to implement something that represents that, yet we are not going to do it.

However, that does not factor in the cost to business if Eircode were pushed onto businesses.  Much of the expenditure in the public service is on cleansing of databases.  Businesses would have to cleanse databases to put in a post code that would do nothing for them.  Businesses will have two choices, effectively.  They may pay money to IT specialists to cleanse databases to adopt Eircode, which will do nothing for them.  The other possibility, or probability, is that they will simply ignore it and bring in proprietary solutions of their own and we will end up with many different solutions.  That has happened, for instance, with the major satellite navigation providers.  Garmin has adopted an Irish solution called Loc8 Code and TomTom has come up with its own solution, MapCode.  A State-sponsored solution would get around this multiplicity of post codes but unless someone gets a grip of it at State level, there is a danger of a plethora of solutions where there should be just one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014110500006#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1415181300,"counter":745,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for allowing me to sit in on this committee as I am not a member and for giving me the opportunity to say something.  Although I am not a member of the committee and I am far from an expert on this area, I have been tracking the sequence of events that led to the choosing of Eircode for a number of years.  I have spoken to many people who have concerns about it.  It seems that the witnesses are saying that because we are late coming to the whole idea of a post code, we had the opportunity to make a technological leap and we are failing to do so, that basically what we are choosing is a database system that is geared mainly towards the delivery of letters, which is a dying method of communication.  What the witnesses are asking for is some sort of a sequential code that is easily recognisable and that has some sort of logical pattern that can be used for their businesses.<br\/>I have watched this for a long time and it seems that perhaps a mistake was made in setting the parameters of the system that was to be chosen and that the tender documents and the whole preparation process seemed to be geared at facilitating An Post.  I am not against facilitating An Post but it seems to have happened to the exclusion of everybody else.  I asked a number of parliamentary questions about this and one answer stated, &quot;In addition, the emergency services sees the introduction of post codes as facilitating the speedier deployment of their services&quot;.  I am not sure how that is the case if one depends on a letter-box, since many of the emergency services go to places that do not have letter-boxes.  The reply continues that An Post, which is actively involved in the design process is fully committed to using Eircode.  If An Post was actually involved in the design process, it seems inevitable that we got something that suited its sorting system, and that we did not get something that had other functions and other users.<br\/>The witnesses are talking now about introducing a parallel system.  As I understand it, they are saying that the Government Departments that this system suits, which send many letters, may use this system, but that it should be a private system, not publicly used, and that we should introduce some sort of parallel system.  By a parallel system, they mean that the last three digits are sequenced.  I follow on from Senator Barrett's questions about how much it will cost.  Is there a huge cost involved in this?<br\/>An answer to another parliamentary question stated: <blockquote>Concerns have been expressed by a number of logistics bodies in connection with the Eircode, most specifically in relation to the non-sequential nature of Eircode.  Capita, the post code management licence-holder has met with a number of these bodies to discuss these concerns and to, <i>inter alia, <\/i>explain that a sequential post code structure is not feasible or necessary.<\/blockquote>What is it that is different about Ireland that makes it unfeasible to have a sequential postcode structure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014110500006#J00500","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415181300,"counter":746,"content":"<p>The question about the delivery of post is interesting.  It is not a question for us but I would seriously question whether An Post will even use Eircode to deliver.  It has two components: a routing key, which has a geographical basis not unlike the current Dublin postal districts, followed by a four-character random string.  It would be very interesting to ask An Post whether it is going to use the random string to deliver mail or just sort it into the postal districts and continue to do what it is doing right now.  I suspect it is the latter.<\/p> <p> On the question of cost, businesses like this are presented with a Hobson's choice of spending money to buy a database and then paying someone to interpret that database or simply to continue to do what they are doing right now.  I suspect that most of them, for practical cost reasons - not merely as a money issue - will continue to do what they are doing right now because that still will get them to the end address, albeit on a less efficient basis than is possible, without paying someone extra money for so doing.  These people do not interact with customers or businesses via An Post but interact directly with the public and with businesses.  The issue for them is they take a van, a gas truck or a pallet to a physical address and unlike a United Kingdom postcode or zip code in America that is visible in parts, Eircode is invisible at that physical address.  There is no physical sign that one is at an Eircode.  Consequently, to address the Deputy's middle point on whether there is a utility for this as part of a Government database last, that is entirely up to the Members of the House.  We believe there is huge utility in an address database but not as a postcode and not for people who are in the business of getting from a depot to a house or a business.
