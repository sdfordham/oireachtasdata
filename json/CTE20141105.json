The conclusion of his opinion is that he is aware the Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill is currently on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and that it seems to him to that the present lacuna in the registration system can only be cured by a statutory amendment to the definition of \"stillborn child\" to expressly include an unborn child of a given weight and age who dies in the womb of the mother as a result of the mother's death or, alternatively, that such an unborn child in such circumstances must be provided for in a separate category.<\/p><p>  I know the Minister of State has received the advice of the Attorney General but this is the advice of a very respected senior counsel who practises extensively in this particular area of law and which runs directly counter to it.

However, I will not hold up the passage of the Bill.<\/p><p>  Given the substantial change, it is interesting that those who would normally lobby us in terms of human rights and changes to the law, such as the Law Society of Ireland, have not been in contact on this.  There is a degree of compulsion, albeit in some ways welcome because in a small society in Ireland there are elements of genetics, elements of the rights of a child to know his or her father and a range of issues on which everybody is exercised, but there are also the rights of the mother on occasion as well, for instance, in the case of rape.  Will there be a compulsion, if the woman has not reported it?<\/p><p>  In the case of young people, for instance, there is a consequence, if a 15 year old who got pregnant declares on the birth certificate of the child a 15 or 16 year old father, that the father could be charged.  We had this debate not so long ago where one is dealing with a child in one sense, but also with a criminal offence which now is reportable.  In such a case, any official, doctor, nurse or registrar would have to report it immediately to social services and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and rightly so, but it is in some ways the unknown consequence.  I am not saying that we necessarily create a loophole, but we must be aware that sometimes when we try to do right there can be instances where the outcome is not favourable.  Perhaps that is covered in part of the Bill which allows the Registrar not to register if there is compelling reason and in that case, it might be that the Registrar would say to leave it a few years.  The problem is that if the Registrar said that, he would be breaking the law.<\/p><p>  There are many instances where the mother will not register the father, maybe because at the time of birth he is abusive or for one or more of a range of issues, and there is a retrospective registering of the father.  Similar to Deputy O'Dea's last request, in a case where a father challenges this and says \"No\", will the State pay for the DNA tests at that stage if he refuses to acknowledge or be named on a birth certificate if he has no role in the life of the mother or child?  I ask this because it will be a challenge.  There are a lot of fathers who are aware of their responsibilities, have denied them for years and will not take it easily that they are being named on birth certificates.  Somebody must foot the bill to ensure, if they are the father, that such is recognised through a DNA test or some mechanism.  In that instance one is getting into compulsion.<\/p><p>  I am not opposed to the section but am striking a note of caution.  The system has worked quite well up until now.  For many years there has been a problem where for beneficial financial reasons some might have signed the birth certificate with the father's name on it.  I might come back to the matter to see whether I can tighten it up a little at Report Stage or I might leave it to the Minister.  We have at least raised those concerns.  Perhaps the Registrar, when this is passed, can have a detailed note on what to do in specific instances, but I would be interested in those complex cases involving the teenage years of 15 and 16.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014110500005#D01100","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1415193300,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.

On the child safety element of not including the father's name, on receipt of a statutory declaration from the mother that it would not be in the best interests of the child to have the name of the father included, the Registrar, taking into account the evidence available to him or her, may decide not to include the father's name on the birth record.

I appreciate that this does not fall under the remit of the Minister of State or the Department of Social Protection.  The corresponding rights should be given to the fathers.  Obviously, fathers have rights and responsibilities.  As far as I am aware, in Scotland and the other jurisdictions in the UK, if one's name is on the birth certificate one gets automatic guardianship rights.  I am sure that is qualified in a manner like that outlined by the Minister of State, for example, when issues arise regarding the best interests of the child.  The proposal made by the Department of Justice and Equality in a forthcoming Bill does not nearly go far enough.  It continues the discrimination against unmarried fathers.  To be honest, it does this in a kind of moral or judgmental way.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said things have worked well, but I do not think they really have.  In addition to my anecdotal knowledge of cases, I have some family law experience from my time as an apprentice solicitor.  I was not involved in this area when I worked as a solicitor.  When I was dealing with cases, I felt that many unmarried fathers, or even fathers who were married, were pushed away from playing a part in their children's lives.  It is the law that does that as much as anything else.  I suggest that if they were given more rights, they would take more responsibility.  As I recall it, a finding along these lines was contained in a study that was carried out at one stage by an academic at Waterford Institute of Technology.  The study basically suggested that the rules and regulations of our society, and the manner in which things operate, are pushing unmarried fathers away from playing an active part as parents.  While I welcome this legislation as a start, I think the corresponding legislation should be used to follow the example of other jurisdictions that give full guardianship rights to unmarried fathers whose names are on birth certificates.  I just wanted to make that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22014110500006#E00700","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1415193900,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her contribution.

That full participation is often blocked by legislation.  There is quite a campaign in this regard.  I would have great sympathy for it.  A children and family relationships Bill, the general scheme of which was published last month, is currently being drafted by the Department of Justice and Equality.  I think the ideas expressed in the Deputy's comments would fit very well into that legislation.  I am not sure whether that Bill will come before this committee.  On a personal basis, I will be very interested in the progress of that Bill through the Oireachtas.  I am sure every Deputy who is present has encountered on many occasions the scenario outlined by Deputy Tuffy.  It is not just the father who is affected - there is also an impact on the grandparents and the wider family.  I hope the forthcoming children and family relationships Bill can capture this in some way.  When one is drafting legislation, it is very difficult to use it as a blunt instrument where families are concerned.

What is the relevant level here?  The major change we are being asked to agree will make it quite difficult for non-EU citizens to marry.  At the very least, it will make them jump through an extra loop through which Irish citizens do not have to jump.  Due to the level of emigration in recent years, many young Irish citizens have travelled abroad.  In the coming years, some of them might come back to Ireland with a fianc&eacute; in order to marry here.  We need to be careful to ensure what we provide for here does not restrict a loving couple in any way.  Is the problem of marriages of convenience of such a scale that it requires a substantial change in law?  We have heard about it in the newspapers, especially in the tabloids that love to run with stories suggesting that problems like this are rampant.  The number of marriages involving EU or non-EU citizens in Ireland is not that high.  I think it was higher in 2009.  Some of the criteria that will be considered are quite interesting.  They show how much we have moved.  One of the factors to be considered is whether \"the parties to the intended marriage have lived together in the past or if they currently live together\".  I can imagine Archbishop McQuaid looking at that many moons ago.<\/p> <p>The questions on where they have lived are interesting, particularly if it was abroad.  There is always the test with regard to how they know each other.  Many years ago I was on a television programme similar to \"Mr &amp;amp; Mrs\" on Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge when it was in its infancy; that is how far back it was.

I understand the committee wishes me to address it on three matters today: extending the remit of the Ombudsman Act and recommendations on the extension of powers of all ombudsmen; two particular issues which have been the subject of petitions that have already been dealt with in closed session; and the number and nature of reports being produced by my office in the context of annual and special reports issued.<br\/>I will commence by saying that the legislation underpinning the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004 as well as section 114 of the Defence Act 1954.  In my address today I will refer to the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004 as the 2004 Act and I will refer to the Defence Act 1954 as the Defence Act. <br\/>My office was established by order of the Minister for Defence on 1 December 2005.  My office provides military personnel with an independent and impartial external statutory complaint investigation authority.  It is entirely separate and distinct from both the military chain of command and the Department of Defence.  I believe we are fully compliant with the generally recognised principles of ombudsmanship.<br\/>The ombudsman provides an appeal from the formal internal military redress of wrongs procedure, a new direct referral complaints system for former service personnel, and a new system for complaints by serving or former service personnel against the actions of a civil servant of the Department of Defence.  The outcome of investigations generally are that the ombudsman makes non-binding recommendations to the Minister.<br\/>My office produces an annual report on its activities.  The most recent such report is 2012 which was published last June.  The delay in the publication of that report was due to ongoing High Court proceedings which were entirely outside the control of my office.  The annual report for 2013 is at an advanced stage of preparation.  I intend to publish it before the end of this year.  My office has not published any special reports pursuant to section 7 of the 2004 Act.  I will inform the committee later on the activities during 2013 and 2014.<br\/>The ombudsman is appointed by the President on the recommendations of the Government.  Open competitions were held by the Public Appointments Service in 2005 and 2012.  I was appointed to the office in November 2012 for a term of three years.  The Ombudsman Association, which is an international umbrella organisation for ombudsmen, has recommended consideration of a minimum term of five years for all ombudsmen.  I would commend that recommendation to the committee for its consideration.<br\/>I wish to say a brief word about the internal military complaints system.  A formal redress of wrongs-complaints system is provided for in the Defence Act for serving members of the Defence Forces.  This has been in existence since the foundation of the State under earlier legislation.  It reflects the unique circumstances of members of the Defence Forces in society.  Soldiers are citizens who have volunteered to serve.  They retain all their constitutional rights.  By joining the Defence Forces, however, they voluntarily submit themselves to a uniquely strict code of military law and discipline.  The formal complaints system provides a key component of personal rights protection for soldiers.<br\/>Complaints should be resolved at the earliest possible opportunity.  Every complaint under the redress of wrongs system is notified to my office as an oversight body and recorded on our case management system.  The Minister agreed earlier this year to provide me with additional information regarding the nature of each such complaint, and this will improve my oversight of the internal military system.  I have also proposed a strengthening of the independence of military investigation officers appointed to investigate and report on complaints under the redress of wrongs system.  I received a copy last week of draft proposals for the revision and amendment of the redress of wrongs system on which I will respond to the Department of Defence shortly.  The Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces was created as a result of protracted lobbying by PDFORRA and as an acknowledgment of the need for a transparent, external, independent and rigorous procedure to deal with complaints across the Defence Forces.  In the case of complaints against a civil servant, I believe that there ought to be established an internal, time-limited departmental complaints resolution procedure or process with an appeal for unresolved complaints to be sent to my office.<br\/>I will say a few words about my jurisdiction.  I have jurisdiction under section 6 of the 2004 Act to hear complaints from serving and former members of the Defence Forces.  The complaints must concern actions taken by either a serving or former member of the Defence Forces while serving in the Defence Forces, or by a civil servant in the Department of Defence.  Interestingly, the word &quot;action&quot; is defined in the Act as including &quot;a failure to carry out an act or make a decision&quot;.  Complaints must be made not later than 12 months from the date of the action concerned or the date on which the complainant became aware of the action, whichever is the later.  There are no exclusions to complaints under the internal redress of wrongs system except a small provision with regard to military justice decisions.<br\/>I am inclined to suggest to the committee that consideration should be given to adding some such restrictions to the redress of wrongs system to limit multiple jurisdictions dealing with the same matters.  As ombudsman, for example, I am precluded from considering complaints on a list of matters included in section 5 of the 2004 Act.  There is also provision in legislation to ensure complaints referred to me are not also referred to the national ombudsman and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  I recommend to the committee that section 5 exclusions should be reviewed.  A simpler unified system could be provided with a greater degree of consistency between the provisions of the Defence Act and the 2004 Act.  Complaints regarding matters which are clearly administrative actions in some of the excluded areas could and should be included within my jurisdiction.<\/p> <p>On a comparative basis, I should tell the joint committee there are three models for military ombudsmen throughout the world.  The first one is where the ombudsman is integrated within the armed forces, which sometimes is referred to as an inspector general.  This probably is the oldest form of military ombudsman extant and it still is operational in some countries.  Indeed, the Defence Act in Ireland contains a provision for the appointment of an inspector general.  The second such model is one in which the ombudsman has exclusive jurisdiction over the armed forces and the third is where oversight of the armed forces is subsumed into the functions of a general ombudsman.  In 2004, Ireland opted for the appointment of a civilian ombudsman, entirely independent of the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence, with exclusive jurisdiction over the Defence Forces, that is, the second of the three models I mentioned.  We share this arrangement with Austria, Canada, Germany, Norway, South Africa, the United Kingdom and, more recently, Bosnia-Herzegovina, all of which have similar-type military ombudsmen.  Independence is of critical importance for an ombudsman.  International standards show that the primary indicators of independence for ombudsmen are being independent of government and of those they are appointed to oversee.  I am satisfied the 2004 Act contains appropriate statutory provisions providing for the independence of my office along those lines.<br\/>I now wish to turn to some statistical data.  Since 2010, a total of 372 complaints have been notified to my office and since my appointment as ombudsman, more than 200 complaints have been notified to me and more than 70 cases have been appealed to me for detailed review and investigation by my office.  I should state that the ongoing High Court proceedings throughout 2013 had an impact on the number of cases that could be dealt with by my office during that time.  In November 2012, the aforementioned High Court proceedings were initiated, challenging my appointment as ombudsman and on 21 November 2013, Mr. Justice Hedigan delivered his judgment in the High Court.  His judgment ran to quite a long number of pages but I will summarise it under three aspects.  First, he stated that nothing precludes a former member of the Defence Forces from holding the post of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.  Second, he stated the appointment of a former member of the Defence Forces does not give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.  Third, he held the Minister for Defence did not act <i>ultra vires<\/i>in deciding that the office of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces should be part-time.  I should advise the joint committee that this decision is under appeal to the Supreme Court.<br\/>I already have made some recommendations to the joint committee with regard to the powers of ombudsmen in general.

However, the legislation as it stands also provides that if a person had been appointed as ombudsman for the maximum term of seven years, he or she may be eligible to be reappointed.  I do not have a personal view but the International Ombudsman Association sometimes is exercised by the fact that an ombudsman who is doing a good job and is not causing too much difficulty to the powers that be may be reappointed.  The connection of a reappointment to the manner in which the ombudsman had performed his or her duties as the case may be always is a delicate balance.

The first thing the ombudsman must do is to consider whether it is within his or her jurisdiction and sometimes it arises that it actually is outside my jurisdiction because it is excluded by the provisions of section 5 of the Act.  I believe that if we have a complaint system that has been in place since 1922 and that if a provision for an ombudsman to be inserted between the Chief of Staff's decision and the Minister's final decision was introduced almost nine years ago, there should be the minimum of restrictions on the powers and jurisdictions of the ombudsman to deal with such complaints.  Moreover, I believe that complainants may be dissatisfied, having processed a complaint all the way up to the ombudsman's office, to find that the ombudsman is not empowered to deal with it.  There may be reasons he or she is not allowed to so do that are valid under the provisions of section 5 of the Act but sometimes - I refer to matters that can be perceived clearly to be administrative in nature - there should be scope for those to be dealt with, even in the areas that are excluded from the jurisdiction of the ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014110500005#J01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony McCourt"},{"type":"speech","time":1415204700,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I thank the ombudsman for his presentation.

Postcodes are a difficult technical issue, which we will try to keep as simple as possible.  Ireland needs a postcode but not any code.  A postcode is a key part of a country's soft infrastructure and is an indicator of a nation's social imagination and ingenuity.  A national postcode lasts for a long time and the postcode that Ireland introduces next year will outlive everyone in this room.  Eircode is an excellent address database for direct mail, for utilities, for the Revenue and for local property tax but it is a bad postcode.  Eircode will assign a unique identifier to every address in the country but two adjacent properties will have different randomly-assigned Eircodes.  The joint committee's briefing notes provided by FTA Ireland give some of the places that will not have a postcode and I will read into the report some of the types of places that will not have an allocated Eircode.  These include workshops, farm buildings, windmills, piers, jetties, fields, large fixed assets, lay-bys, points of interest, lanes, archaeological sites, roads, natural features, intersections, accident black spots, pylons, parks, motorways, antennae, wells, graveyards, pumping stations, viewing points, manholes or utility access points, car parks, beaches, level crossings, transformers, bridges, forests, bogs, lakes, playing pitches, cycle tracks, picnic areas, public toilets or places along walkways such as the Wild Atlantic Way.  None of these can have an Eircode unless they also have an allocated postal address.<\/p><p>  In our opinion, Eircode departs substantially from the requirements for a postcode set out by members' predecessors in the last D&aacute;il, which we have set out in annexe 2 of our submission, as well as in the postcode tender, the requirements of which are set out in annexe 3.  In annexes 4 and 5, we compare Eircode with modern Irish and international alternatives, as well as with the United Kingdom postcode, which is almost 60 years old this year.  We give a simple example of the address of our sister trade association in Belfast in annexe 5.  Unlike any of these codes, an Eircode does not recognise when two addresses are adjacent to each other.  We have picked three local addresses in Kildare Street to show this issue to members in annexe 4.<\/p><p>  Eircode will impose a significant cost on small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, in Ireland for no tangible benefit.<\/p> <p>The companies here today span the freight, parcel and energy sectors.  Delivery to Irish homes and businesses is their day job.  They know what they are talking about and they estimate that savings in the order of tens of millions of euro annually can be passed to the public via an efficient postcode system.  As a national postcode, however, Eircode lacks vision, imagination, ambition and, most of all, practicality.  Ireland needs a modern, open, location-based postcode with a useable structure and sequence.  We here today ask the communications committee to use its influence with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, to forestall Eircode's introduction as a national postcode before it is too late.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014110500003#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415180100,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Donnell for that direct and strong presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014110500004#G00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1415180100,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I share many of the concerns Mr. McDonnell has outlined and many of the concerns outlined in the report.

Would it be fair to say that Eircode is based on a geodirectory system, a unique identifier for every address in the country?  The UK companies say the geodirectory part of it is based on a random number and that is causing them the biggest trouble.  Are there not benefits in a geodirectory system that identifies an individual address over a clustered address in terms of accuracy of delivery, leaving aside the sequential aspect of it?  One still has random numbers but because one has a unique identifier to an address, in addition to either a name, a business name, street name or house number, one has an individual code identifying a precise individual address for deliveries.  I refer to post, including commercial deliveries or parcels delivered by courier or other method.  Irrespective of the random nature of the numbering, that should be a positive development.  If the numbers were not random, would it give rise to data protection issues on the basis that one could identify who lives next door and so on?  Significant issues arise for the address owner.

The geodirectory has been bought out as part of the process by Capita plc, a UK company which is buying the database from An Post.  Effectively, all that is happening is that a unique, random seven character string is being added to postal and business addresses in the geodirectory.  That is the nub of the issue.  If the geodirectory was a good solution for getting parcels, freight or energy to one&rsquo;s premises, the delivery companies would be using it now.  Although geodirectory gives a longitude and latitude, that is insufficient data to route because if we go back to simple maths, a longitude and latitude gives a point and what these people want to buy are lines.<\/p> <p>I hope that makes sense.

What the witnesses are asking for is some sort of a sequential code that is easily recognisable and that has some sort of logical pattern that can be used for their businesses.<br\/>I have watched this for a long time and it seems that perhaps a mistake was made in setting the parameters of the system that was to be chosen and that the tender documents and the whole preparation process seemed to be geared at facilitating An Post.  I am not against facilitating An Post but it seems to have happened to the exclusion of everybody else.  I asked a number of parliamentary questions about this and one answer stated, &quot;In addition, the emergency services sees the introduction of post codes as facilitating the speedier deployment of their services&quot;.  I am not sure how that is the case if one depends on a letter-box, since many of the emergency services go to places that do not have letter-boxes.  The reply continues that An Post, which is actively involved in the design process is fully committed to using Eircode.  If An Post was actually involved in the design process, it seems inevitable that we got something that suited its sorting system, and that we did not get something that had other functions and other users.<br\/>The witnesses are talking now about introducing a parallel system.  As I understand it, they are saying that the Government Departments that this system suits, which send many letters, may use this system, but that it should be a private system, not publicly used, and that we should introduce some sort of parallel system.  By a parallel system, they mean that the last three digits are sequenced.  I follow on from Senator Barrett's questions about how much it will cost.  Is there a huge cost involved in this?<br\/>An answer to another parliamentary question stated: <blockquote>Concerns have been expressed by a number of logistics bodies in connection with the Eircode, most specifically in relation to the non-sequential nature of Eircode.  Capita, the post code management licence-holder has met with a number of these bodies to discuss these concerns and to, <i>inter alia, <\/i>explain that a sequential post code structure is not feasible or necessary.<\/blockquote>What is it that is different about Ireland that makes it unfeasible to have a sequential postcode structure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014110500006#J00500","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1415181300,"counter":232,"content":"<p>The question about the delivery of post is interesting.  It is not a question for us but I would seriously question whether An Post will even use Eircode to deliver.  It has two components: a routing key, which has a geographical basis not unlike the current Dublin postal districts, followed by a four-character random string.  It would be very interesting to ask An Post whether it is going to use the random string to deliver mail or just sort it into the postal districts and continue to do what it is doing right now.  I suspect it is the latter.<\/p> <p> On the question of cost, businesses like this are presented with a Hobson's choice of spending money to buy a database and then paying someone to interpret that database or simply to continue to do what they are doing right now.  I suspect that most of them, for practical cost reasons - not merely as a money issue - will continue to do what they are doing right now because that still will get them to the end address, albeit on a less efficient basis than is possible, without paying someone extra money for so doing.  These people do not interact with customers or businesses via An Post but interact directly with the public and with businesses.  The issue for them is they take a van, a gas truck or a pallet to a physical address and unlike a United Kingdom postcode or zip code in America that is visible in parts, Eircode is invisible at that physical address.  There is no physical sign that one is at an Eircode.  Consequently, to address the Deputy's middle point on whether there is a utility for this as part of a Government database last, that is entirely up to the Members of the House.  We believe there is huge utility in an address database but not as a postcode and not for people who are in the business of getting from a depot to a house or a business.  This is of no use to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014110500006#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1415181900,"counter":234,"content":"<p>My last question is whether any of the witnesses met Capita.
