These requirements are in line with best practice in other countries and Ireland is one of the first countries to have such a broad requirement for carbon monoxide alarms.<\/p>  <p>  From the evidence of carbon monoxide incidents in the UK and abroad, the majority appear to occur with solid fuel and gas appliances, with oil being the safest. Open flue or flueless appliances, because they take the combustion air from a room, have a potentially greater risk than a balanced flue scenario. In addition, Part L of the Building Regulations, which deals with the conservation of fuel and energy, has required all new and replacement boilers in dwellings to have an efficiency of 86% since 31 March 2008 and an efficiency of 90% since 1 December 2011. This promotes the installation of room sealed boilers, which have a lower risk of the escape of carbon monoxide due to balanced flues.<\/p>  <p>  From an analysis of the incidents that have occurred in the UK, the predominant area for carbon monoxide fatalities is in dwellings. This analysis would appear to suggest that non-domestic buildings would not be considered high risk category having regard to the number of carbon monoxide incidences involved.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the above factors, the latest requirements under Part J provide for the installation of carbon monoxide detectors in:<\/p>  <p>  - new dwellings where open flue or flueless combustion appliances are being installed,<\/p>  <p>  - existing dwellings where replacement open flue or flueless combustion appliances are being installed,<\/p>  <p>  - habitable rooms where a system chimney attached to a heat producing appliance passes within or over such rooms.<\/p>  <p>  While the new regulations will give added protection to new dwelling owners, and to the owners of existing dwellings when heat producing appliances are being replaced, it is important to note that the key actions required to prevent carbon monoxide incidences are and continue to be:<\/p>  <p>(1) the proper installation and commissioning of heat producing appliances and flues\/chimneys,<\/p>  <p>(2) proper air supply is maintained to combustion devices, and <\/p>  <p>(3) the proper maintenance and inspection of combustion appliances on a regular basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400072#WRD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1092"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Provision","counter":77,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400072#WRD00550"},{"type":"question","counter":78,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[9079\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400072#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his views regarding the proportion of new homes which must be reserved as social, or affordable, housing under Part 5 of the Planning and Development Acts; his further views that the original intent of Part 5 is being achieved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":79,"content":"<p>Under the existing Part V provisions, developers are required to ensure that up to 20% of land zoned for residential, and other uses, shall be reserved for social or affordable housing.

The meeting with the Irish Property Owners Association was part of those consultations. The association also raised other issues of interest to it including the taxation treatment of landlords and the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations.<\/p>  <p>  In the third quarter of 2014, rents were 5.6% higher nationally than in the same quarter of 2013, according to the most recent rent index from the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).

In Dublin, which is seeing the highest rates of increase nationally, overall rents were higher by 9.5% although the rate of annual increase was down slightly. Fundamentally, the main cause of rising rents is a lack of supply in the market. The implementation of the range of actions under the Government&rsquo;s Construction 2020 Strategy will support increased housing supply.  New house completions in 2014 amounted to 11,016 units nationally, up 33% on the 2013 figure. In the third quarter of 2014, planning permissions were granted for 2,144 dwellings, compared with 1,409 units for the same period in 2013 - an increase of 52%.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Social Housing Strategy 2020 published in November   2014 sets out clear, measurable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list. The total targeted provision under the Social Housing Strategy of 110,000 social housing units includes the delivery of 35,000 units and a further 75,000 solutions through the HAP and RAS schemes. In 2015 alone we will provide over 7,000 new social housing units and a further 8,400 units will be secured under the HAP scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The rent supplement scheme, administered by the Department of Social Protection, provides support to approximately 70,000 people living in private rented accommodation. Community Welfare officers have been reminded of their statutory discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Department of Social Protection has agreed and implemented a tenancy sustainment protocol with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations. The protocol applies where families in receipt of rent supplement are in danger of losing their tenancy. Since the launch of this protocol in mid-June 2014, over 370 families in Dublin have had their rent supplement payments increased. The protocol has now also been extended to Cork City.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is monitoring the rental market closely and is considering policy options in relation to achieving greater rent certainty.

This year, the Department of Social Protection will spend an estimated &euro;6.675 billion on pensions &ndash; 34.4% of all welfare expenditure and an increase of &euro;168 million over 2014.  While there have been significant real increases in pension rates over the last decade, the biggest long-term challenge to the sustainability of the pension system has been increased longevity, which is resulting in longer duration of pensions, without any corresponding increase in the PRSI contributions paid to finance them. Encouraging longer working is part of the strategy to address the issue of sustainability of the State pension without undermining its adequacy.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently 5.3 people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately 2.1 to 1 by 2060.  The over 65 year old population is projected to increase from 11% of the total population in 2010 to 15% in 2020, and to 24% in 2060.<\/p>  <p>  The Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund projects that without action to tackle a shortfall, the deficit will increase significantly over the medium to long term to &euro;3bn for 2019 and &euro;25.7bn for 2066.  It is in this context, and mindful of the importance of maintaining the adequacy of the rate of the State pension, that a number of reforms been introduced, in order to provide for sustainable pensions and to facilitate a longer working life.  State pension age is being increased in three separate stages.  In 2014, the State pension age was standardised at 66 by the abolition of the State pension (transition).  The State pension (transition) had been criticised as it required workers to retire in order to receive a pension from 65 (no such requirement applies to the State pension contributory).  While such workers could re-commence work at 66 when moving to the State pension contributory, most did not as they had already retired, and many would not have been in a position to do so even where they wished to.  The pension age will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028. It is anticipated that this rate of increase in pension age will be no faster than the rate of increased longevity.  It is also anticipated that the duration of a typical State pension may continue to increase, albeit more slowly than if these increases in pension age were not provided for.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of other reforms of the pension system being considered, and it is planned to replace the current &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; method for calculating State pension (contributory) entitlement with a fairer &lsquo;total contributions&rsquo; approach.  There are, however, a number of legislative, administrative and information technology system related issues to be addressed before this change can be put in place.  It will also be important to ensure that those who spend a number of years out of the workforce on caring duties are not disadvantaged by this approach.  It is not anticipated, therefore, that this change will be in place before 2020, although it is planned that the details of the new system would be announced well in advance of it taking effect, to allow workers good time to make decisions relevant to their retirement income.<\/p>  <p>  The OECD report on the Review of the Irish Pension System confirmed that the reforms that have been introduced are necessary if we are to continue to put pension provision on a sustainable footing given increased life expectancy, the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund, and the increasing cost of pensions into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400075#WRG01400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"One-Parent Family Payments","counter":157,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400075#WRG01500"},{"type":"question","counter":158,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[9559\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400075#WRG01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will reverse the decision whereby in July 2015 the lone parent's payment for children over seven years of age is to be removed.","asker":"1049","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":159,"content":"<p>Before I introduced the reforms, the One Parent Family Payment was a passive scheme with limited engagement by the State with recipients. For many lone parents, most of whom are women, this has meant long-term social welfare dependency, associated poverty and social exclusion for them and their families.<\/p>  <p>  Social transfers have provided a hugely important buffer in reducing poverty.

The best route out of poverty and social exclusion is through paid employment.  I want to end the expectation that lone parents may remain outside of the workforce indefinitely. I want to support lone parents to develop their skills set and, ultimately to secure employment. <\/p>  <p>  I have also made significant changes to the arrangements in place for affected customers as they transition. These include the introduction of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) transitional arrangement which gives lone parents with young children the flexibility to work part time or engage in full time education, access to subsidised child care through the after school child care (ASCC) scheme and the community employment childcare (CEC) programme and the extension this week of OFP to all lone parents providing full-time care, until their youngest child is 16 years of age. <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of the back to work family dividend (BTWFD) provides a further incentive for jobseekers and OFP recipients to avail of employment opportunities by allowing them to retain their increase for a qualified child payment when they leave income support for employment or self-employment.

All the supports of the State will be made available to workers as and when needed.  I engaged with senior management of the company in question last week and have urged them to reconsider this decision, and asked if there is anything the State or its agencies can do to mitigate its effects.  However, due to a cost base which is significantly out of line with competitor countries, the company has announced a rationalisation at its Kerry plant.  The company has pledged to support departing workers with placement services.<\/p>  <p>  In response to these developments, I have established an inter-agency group to coordinate the Government&rsquo;s response to the job losses at the company.  The group will be led by Enterprise Ireland, and will both seek to secure alternative employment for the areas affected, and also ensure that departing workers have access to supports they need from State agencies for retraining, access to social welfare supports and access to advice on employment rights.<\/p>  <p>  In an effort to coordinate constructive cross-party action to support workers affected, I invited TDs and Senators from the areas affected, including Kerry, to a briefing in my Department on the situation yesterday.  The situation at the company was also the subject of a Topical Issues Debate in the D&aacute;il yesterday.<\/p>  <p>  The company have said that they would work closely with workers in an effort to ensure that the impact of its decision is minimised to the greatest extent possible and to discuss investment it will be making in Ireland in order to build a stronger business here for the long term.  Enterprise Ireland will be involved in those discussions and I have directed the agencies of my Department to step up their efforts to bring employment to the areas affected.  Enterprise Ireland is in ongoing interaction with the company to support the retention of the existing jobs and to support the Group going forward.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland will continue to support entrepreneurs, enterprises and job creation in Kerry.<\/p>  <p>  The number of people at work in IDA supported companies in Kerry has increased by over 360 in the period 2011-2014, while the number of people at work in Enterprise Ireland supported companies has increased by over 170 in the same period.<\/p>  <p>  Last month, I announced details of the Action Plan for Jobs: Regional Initiative which will seek to maximise the strengths and assets of each region to support enterprise growth and job creation.  The Regional Action Plans will identify specific measures that can be taken to help each region to realise its economic potential, with a view to increasing the number of people at work in the region.  My objective is that six Regional Action Plans will be launched by July, with two remaining Plans in development at that stage.  It is not intended that Regional Action Plans will target every individual town for job creation or investment but, rather, that these plans will identify measures that can be taken to enable the region as a whole to build on its competitive strengths and increase the number of people at work.<\/p>  <p>  As part of this initiative, new funding of up to &euro;250 million will be made available over the next five years to support job creation through enterprise growth in the regions.  This includes &euro;150 million for an IDA property investment programme to attract foreign direct investment into the regions, and &euro;100 million to Enterprise Ireland to support indigenous enterprises to start up, grow and export.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400078#WRK01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards","counter":232,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400078#WRK01400"},{"type":"question","counter":233,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[9952\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400078#WRK01500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of senior civil servants who retired since 2011 in his Department who have been appointed to a State board under his aegis following their retirement; if he will provide in tabular form the names of these persons, the boards to which they were appointed, and the appointment process followed in each case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1008","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":234,"content":"<p>No senior civil servants who retired from my Department since 2011 have been appointed, following their retirement, to any of the State boards under the aegis of my Department.

The Deputy may be aware that an Independent Working Group was established in October 2014 to recommend to the Government what improvements should be made to the protection process, including direct provision and supports to asylum seekers. One of the tasks of the Working Group is to identify improvements to existing arrangements for the processing of protection applications taking account of the Government's intention to legislate for a single application procedure. <\/p>  <p>  The Group began its work in November last under the Chairmanship of retired High Court Judge, Bryan McMahon and its membership is drawn from a range of interests in the international protection area including UNHCR, non-governmental organisations (including the Irish Refugee Council), protection applicants, academia, and relevant Government Departments and Offices. The Working Group is due to report to Government with its recommendations by April 2015. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to protection legislation my objective is to reform the current multi-layered and sequential system which can result in applicants being accommodated in the State's system of direct provision for indeterminate periods of time.  The introduction of the single procedure will enhance our capacity to efficiently grant international protection to those who are entitled to it.  At the same time, it will identify, at a much earlier stage, persons who have no entitlement to stay in the State and who can safely return to their country of origin. I intend to publish the General Scheme of the International Protection Bill once it has been approved by Government.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the deliberations of the Protection Working Group and the imminent publication of the International Protection Bill, a number of other initiatives have already been put in place to address the number of cases on hand in the protection system which are yielding significant results. Various strategies are being utilised to deal with cases on hand including the scheduling of interviews on Saturdays. The transfer of subsidiary protection application processing to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner in late 2013 has resulted in decisions in some 825 cases at first instance by the end of 2014. In addition, a further 1,300 subsidiary protection applications have either been withdrawn or deemed withdrawn. The processing of these cases has been greatly aided by the establishment of a legal panel set up to assist the Commissioner with this work. Based on the success of the use of the panel it is now planned to expand it and extend its remit to include the processing of asylum applications. An advertisement seeking new panel members was placed in national newspapers in February.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should also be aware that the time taken to process a protection application to finality can be prolonged by the lodging by applicants of appeals with the Refugee Appeals Tribunal against determinations made by ORAC or the taking of judicial review proceedings against decisions made at various stages of the protection determination process. To assist with processing at the appeals stage of the process I have recently appointed nine additional members to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. These members have been selected from those who were considered suitable for appointment following a competitive process involving the Public Appointments Service. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also actively considering what other measures can be taken to reduce the number of cases on hand at the leave to remain stage of the process in advance of the introduction of a single application procedure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400080#WRM00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":273,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400080#WRM00500"},{"type":"question","counter":274,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[9462\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400080#WRM00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide details of all properties rented by her Department; the annual cost of the lease; the duration of the leases; and the capacity and occupancy of each premises as of 31 January 2015.","asker":"1058","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":275,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that it has not been possible to provide the information required in the time available.

To date, annual reports for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 have been published and are available from Ireland&rsquo;s dedicated anti-human trafficking website, , in addition to my Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>With regard to the specific information sought by the Deputy, fourteen (14) prosecutions in relation to human trafficking were taken in 2014, one (1) of which related to the trafficking of a person to Ireland.  I am informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that to the end of February 2015 a total of eleven (11) new human trafficking related investigations have been commenced, however, no prosecution relating to alleged human trafficking offences has been initiated to date in 2015. Human trafficking related investigations are complex, often involving an international dimension, which can result in prosecutions being initiated some considerable time after an offence is reported or discovered.<\/p><p>Over the past number of years strong legislative, administrative and operational measures have been put in place in Ireland to combat and prevent trafficking in human beings.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, with penalties of up to life imprisonment for human trafficking, greatly strengthened the law in this area and this legislation was further bolstered in 2013 with new forms of exploitation, for forced begging and forced criminal activities, being provided for in new legislation. <\/p><p>A dedicated Anti-Human Trafficking Unit was established in the Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality in 2008 with the purpose of ensuring that the State's response to human trafficking is coordinated and comprehensive.  In addition to that dedicated Unit in the Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality there are 3 other dedicated Units in State Agencies dealing with the issue:<\/p><p>-the Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-ordination Unit in the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  The Garda Commissioner has recently announced the establishment of a Child Protection and Human Exploitation Unit, within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This unit is to include Child Protection, Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit (DVSAIU) and Human Trafficking.  A Detective Chief Superintendent is to take charge of this new unit.<\/p><p>-the Anti-Human Trafficking Team in the Health Service Executive, who develop individualised care plans for victims, and<\/p><p>-a specialised Human Trafficking legal team in the Legal Aid Board. <\/p><p>Dedicated personnel are also assigned to deal with the prosecution of cases in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and staff in the New Communities and Asylum Seekers Unit in the Department of Social Protection facilitates victims moving into mainstream social services.  There are also a wide range of training and awareness raising activities on-going and extensive consultation structures exist with Non-Governmental Organisations, International Organisations and State Agencies.  <\/p><p>This year, and for the past few years, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in its Annual Policing Plan, has identified trafficking in human beings as one of its priorities with an increased focus given to prevention and detection of human trafficking. Any suspicion of human trafficking that is reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the subject of a comprehensive investigation  <i>. <\/i><\/p><p>The State provides a wide range of support services to victims of human trafficking, these include: accommodation, medical care and planning, psychological assistance, material assistance, legal aid and advice, vocational training and education.  The Anti-Human Trafficking Team in the HSE develops individual Care Plans for persons who are potentially victims of human trafficking.  These Care Plans include a range of issues including medical health, G.P. referral, counselling, psychological care, sexual health, material assistance, accommodation, training needs, education, etc. <\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s approach to the issue of Human Trafficking is set out in the National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Trafficking of Persons which set out 144 Actions to be undertaken to address this issue.  A copy of the National Action Plan and a Review of the Plan are available on the dedicated Anti-Trafficking site blueblindfold.gov.ie.  A Second National Action Plan is currently at an advanced stage of drafting and will be the subject of consultation with a broad range of organisations active in this field.  This Plan will also be informed by the findings of international evaluations of Ireland&rsquo;s anti-trafficking measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400080#WRM02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Remuneration","counter":291,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400080#WRM02300"},{"type":"question","counter":292,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[9593\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400080#WRM02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will consider sanctioning an increase in wages and\/or restoring the rent allowance payment for the recent intake of trainee members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":293,"content":"<p>Details of the remuneration package, ie basic pay and allowances were made available to all applicants prior to the commencement of the current recruitment competition.<b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b>That competition attracted over 20,000 applications in late 2013 and the most recent batch of recruits joined the force in January of this year.

Education and Training Boards are expected to take a pro-active approach to ensure that youth projects funded by my Department demonstrate appropriate governance arrangements to deliver on these objectives.  Within each Education and Training Board area, Youth Officers are the point of contact for projects in respect of application, monitoring reporting and compliance matters.

Roaccutane is not authorised in Ireland for the treatment of cancer and therefore this is not reflected in the product information.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has confirmed that a total of 289 reports of suspected adverse reactions associated with the use of Roaccutane were notified to the HPRA from 1983 up to the end of February 2015.  The majority of the reports received have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects for Roaccutane, as described in the product information.  Skin reactions such as dry skin, dry lips and inflammation of the lips were commonly reported as were mood swings, depression and anxiety.  Other frequently reported symptoms included headache, nose bleeds, muscle and joint pain and eye disorders such as dry eyes and conjunctivitis.<\/p>  <p>  It is standard practice that there is regulatory correspondence with the pharmaceutical company and the HPRA in the context of post-marketing safety monitoring (which includes review and evaluation of suspected adverse reaction reports, published literature and post-marketing safety studies).  Companies have an obligation to report suspected adverse reactions associated with the use of their products to the competent authority, i.e. the HPRA, as a condition of their authorisation.<\/p>  <p>  Roaccutane was first authorised in 1983 and the company has been obliged to submit a renewal application every five years.  It is also obliged to submit \"periodic safety update reports\" to the HPRA at regular intervals, for assessment of safety data post-authorisation.<\/p>  <p>  Roaccutane has been closely monitored at a national and European level since it was first authorised and its benefits and risks were last reviewed at EU level in 2011.  The benefits of treatment are considered to outweigh the risks, when the product is used in accordance with the product information.<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA has stated that members of the Authority, its advisory committees and staff are bound by the requirements of section 24 of the Irish Medicines Board Acts 1995 and 2006, the Ethics in Public Office Act and the HPRA's Code of Conduct and Conflict of Interest Policy, both of which are available on the HPRA website.  It is a policy of the HPRA that members of the Authority, its advisory committees and staff must not receive benefits of any kind from a third party which might reasonably be seen to compromise their personal judgement or integrity.<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA prohibits the acceptance of money as cash, cash vouchers or cash equivalents from any industry or sector regulated by the HPRA.  Gifts may not be solicited, directly or indirectly.

The key objective is to develop services in the community which will give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and other allied health professionals.<\/p>  <p>  The development of the Teams is a work in progress with enhancements occurring in terms of team membership and organisational delivery over time. At the end of December 2014, core Team staff amounted to approximately 3,000, providing services for almost 4 million of the population.<\/p>  <p>  264.5 Primary Care Team posts (Public Health Nurses; Registered General Nurses; Occupational Therapists; Physiotherapists; and Speech &amp;amp; Language Therapists) were approved in 2013. 248.5 posts are now filled or start dates agreed. The recruitment process is continuing regarding the remaining posts.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently 11 Community Intervention Teams (CITs) in place in Dublin North, Dublin South, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Clare, Tipperary, Carlow\/Kilkenny, Wicklow, Naas and Drogheda. CITs work in partnership with Primary Care Teams, General Practice, Community Response Beds, community nursing, home support services, acute hospitals and other professional, voluntary and external providers to deliver enhanced services and patient centred care in the most appropriate setting. The CIT provides a rapid and integrated response to an appropriate patient with an acute episode of illness who requires CIT services for a defined\/short period of time in the community\/home, thus helping to increase hospital avoidance and earlier discharge from acute hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  The development of Primary Care Centres (PCCs), through a combination of public and private investment, is supporting the delivery of an enhanced range of multi-disciplinary, locally accessible primary health care services. To date, there are 86 Primary Care Centres in operation throughout the country, 43 of which have opened since 2011.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently 37 locations where Primary Care Centres are at an advanced planning stage using one of the three methods of delivery (Direct build by HSE; Public Private Partnership - PPP project; or Operational Lease with the private sector.<\/p>  <p>  In November 2014, the HSE advertised an additional 73 locations for delivery of Primary Care Centres by Operational Lease. January 16, 2015 was the closing date for receipt of Expressions of Interest. The HSE is reviewing all Expressions of Interest to determine which are suitable for more detailed consideration and progression to the next stage of the process.<\/p>  <p>  In general, services provided in PCCs include: Public Health Nursing; Physiotherapy; Occupational Therapy; Speech and Language Therapy; Primary Care Social Work; Primary Care Counselling; Dietetics; and Podiatry. Some centres also provide additional services such as Minor Surgery, Mental Health services, Pharmacy and Dental services.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to widening access to primary care. This includes introducing, on a phased basis, a universal GP service without fees. This process is at an advanced stage in respect of the provision of GP services without fees at the point of access for all children under six years. The objective is to have this phase of universal GP care in place in Quarter 2, 2015, subject to the conclusion of the present discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation and the completion of a fee-setting process. The Government is also prioritising GP care without fees at the point of access for persons over 70 years. The Bill to enable this will be published shortly and the aim is for the service also to commence in Q2, 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Last week the Department of Health, the HSE and IMO signed a Memorandum of Understanding which commits the parties to commence substantive negotiations on a new comprehensive GP contract no later than 31 March 2015, with a view to concluding within 12 months. This agreement will allow discussions on the further extension of universal GP care beyond the under sixes and over 70s and will have a focus on chronic disease management.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has identified an initial five Integrated Care Programmes for implementation in 2015, including the Integrated Care Programme for the prevention and management of Chronic Disease.<\/p>  <p>  In 2013, the Government approved funding for the appointment of 17 Integrated Care Diabetes Nurse Specialists to support the phased roll out of the National Integrated Care Diabetes Programme. To-date, 16.65 Whole Time Equivalent nurse specialists have been recruited.  Work is also underway in the HSE on an implementation plan for the National Clinical Programme for Asthma&rsquo;s Model of Care.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s 2015 National Service Plan (NSP) commits the HSE to roll out a pilot, to provide GP direct access to ultrasound, at approximately eight primary care sites, across the South and West, from early 2015. The pilot will aim to clear any existing hospital waiting lists for GP referrals to ultrasound.<\/p>  <p>  The NSP also makes a commitment to pilot the provision of additional minor surgery services in agreed primary care settings and sites. This will contribute to a reduction in the waiting lists for minor surgery procedures in hospitals. The intention is to make this pilot service available in all of the HSE's Community Healthcare Organisations, ensuring local access for patients.<\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the recommendations of the Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) Report, including the establishment of the CHOs and their management structures, has been listed as a key priority of the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2015. The Report, which was launched in October 2014, sets out plans for a comprehensive reorganisation of health services outside the acute hospital system. The primary focus is to provide the maximum proportion of care to people in the communities where they live and to achieve joined-up, integrated services.<\/p>  <p>  The 17 Integrated Service Areas are being replaced by nine Community Healthcare Organisations. Existing resources will be reorganised into 90 Primary Care Networks, each serving about 50,000 of the population. Each network will be headed by an identified, accountable person responsible for care delivery by professionals such as nurses, therapists and social workers so as to meet a wide range of people&rsquo;s needs in a joined-up way. The new structures will have a strong focus on building good linkages with the acute hospital system so that people&rsquo;s care pathways are appropriately planned and their needs met in the right setting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400087#WRT00600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":433,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400087#WRT00700"},{"type":"question","counter":434,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[9513\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400087#WRT00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a common public-private waiting list system has been considered for evaluation-investigation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":435,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

The implementation of the VFM Review is a multi-year project which will result in very significant changes to the way in which services and supports for people with disabilities are delivered.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) is responsible for delivering the recommendations contained in the VFM Review and has given the implementation of these recommendations top priority in the National Service Plan for 2015, with actions and targets outlined in the Social Care Operational Plan for 2015.  <\/p>  <p>  The Working Groups established to support the implementation of the reform process are continuing their work on a range of inter-connected and challenging projects, including work on the development of the guidelines for evaluation of demonstration projects and the production of a policy appraisal project plan.  The Working Groups are also making progress on implementing recommendations on reform of adult day services, de-institutionalisation and 0-18s therapy services.    <\/p>  <p>  The VFM Review envisaged that the transformation process would be guided by demonstration projects, developed as proof of concept, and run in parallel with current services, following which their suitability for wider application would be evaluated.  The HSE and disability agencies are already working on demonstration projects aimed at giving service users greater choice and control and testing how aspects of the new policy will work in practice.  Taking into account the number and diversity of demonstration projects underway, an extensive evaluation process will be initiated by one of the Working Groups and this will guide the final shape of the disability services reform programme.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to disability services for children and young people aged 0 to 18 years, the HSE is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of therapy resources into multi-disciplinary geographic based teams for children and young people, as part of the National Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme.  As mentioned above, implementation of this reconfiguration is being overseen and monitored under the VFM process.  The aim of the Programme is to achieve a national, unified approach to delivering disability health services so that there is a clear pathway to services for all children, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme is organised at national, regional and local level and includes representatives from the health and education sectors, non-statutory service providers and parents.

Under the Health (Amendment) Act 2013 private in-patients in public hospitals are subject to charges that range from &euro;329 to &euro;1,000 per day.  The charge levied depends on whether accommodation is provided in a single or multiple occupancy room and if overnight accommodation is provided.<\/p>  <p>  As required by the Health (Amendment) Act 1986, where a hospital is informed that the patient, their personal representative or a dependent is pursuing a Road Traffic Accident (RTA) claim, billing data is generated on the local billing system. Invoices can be raised for an RTA related in-patient or out-patient charge depending on the services provided at the hospital. <\/p>  <p>  The Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005-2011 provide that, subject to certain exemptions, charges apply to the maintenance element of \"long-stay\" in-patient services (excluding acute in-patient services or services supported under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme) provided in hospitals or other specified settings by or on behalf of the HSE for over 30 days within a rolling 12 month period.

I concluded that it would not be possible to introduce a full UHI system by 2019, as envisaged in the White Paper.<i><\/i>However, I want to emphasise my commitment to implementing reforms.  In particular, I want to push ahead with key reforms in areas such as extending free GP care on a phased basis, improving the management of chronic diseases, implementing key financial reforms, including activity-based funding, and establishing hospital groups.  As well as representing critical building blocks for the future health system, these initiatives are also important reforms in their own right that will drive efficiencies and bring benefits in advance of moving to a system of universal healthcare. <\/p><p>With regard to extending free GP care to the whole population on a phased basis, the objective is to have universal GP care without fees for children under 6 years in place in Quarter 2 of 2015.  This is subject to the conclusion of discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation and the completion of a fee-setting process.  The Government is also prioritising GP care without fees at the point of access for persons over 70 years to coincide with the introduction of GP care without fees for children under 6. By the end of this year, approximately half the population will have access to GP services, without charges.  &euro;37 million has been provided for the first and second phases of this initiative this year.  It should be emphasised this funding has not been taken from any other health area.<\/p><p>Finally with regard to the wider issue of the statutory resources required to deliver UHI, my Department is undertaking a major costing exercise, in conjunction with the ESRI, the Health Insurance Authority and others.  This exercise will estimate the cost of UHI for individuals\/households and the Exchequer.

The teacher's role in the holistic development of all students is clearly threaded throughout the Council's Code of Professional Conduct for Teachers.  Initial teacher education providers aim to prepare teachers for all aspects of students' education, including students' holistic development.  Course curriculum in the colleges of education and the education department of universities include studies that underpin the student teachers' understanding of the broader emotional, environmental and temporal contexts that affect the students in their charge.  Prospective teachers are made aware of their responsibilities in relation to children's well-being - physical, mental and emotional - and to their roles and responsibilities regarding the appropriate and timely referral of children to external support agencies.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that I and my colleague, Minister of State Kathleen Lynch, launched &quot;Well-being in primary schools - Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion&quot; on 29th January 2015.  The 'Well-Being in Post-Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention' were published by my Department in 2013.  Both guidelines provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated whole school way.  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, and the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model.<\/p><p>  Support is available to all schools from the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), the HSE, Health Promotion Officers and other external agencies and support services.  The PDST provide a range of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) supports for teachers at primary and post primary level including anti-bullying seminars on awareness raising, intervention and prevention, child protection seminars and school support in SPHE and related areas.  In addition, CPD is available specifically to post primary teachers of SPHE in promoting positive mental health and well-being, mental health issues affecting Young People and Internet Safety and Cyber Bullying.<\/p><p>  The new Framework for Junior Cycle also places a clear emphasis on overall student health and well-being.  This Framework is underpinned by eight principles, one of which is &quot;Well-being&quot;.  It also has eight key skills which are to be embedded in every new Junior Cycle subject and short course including the key skills of &quot;Managing Myself&quot; and &quot;Staying Well&quot;.  In addition, the 24 'Statements of Learning' that a student should experience during their Junior Cycle programme involve the student taking action to safeguard and promote their own well-being and that of others.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) has developed a new short course in SPHE which includes strands such as &quot;Minding Myself and Others&quot; and &quot;My Mental Health&quot;, and deals with issues such as mental health and mental ill-health, dealing with tough times, loss and bereavement.<\/p><p>  My Department is also working with the Department of Health to promote participation by primary and post-primary schools in the 'Health Promoting Schools' initiative.  This European-wide programme aims to strengthen schools' capacity to be a healthy setting for learning and working by focusing at whole-school level on all the conditions that affect health and well-being.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400092#WRY00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Guidance Counsellors","counter":535,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400092#WRY00500"},{"type":"question","counter":536,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[9419\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400092#WRY00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of second level schools that provide access to school based counselling services; the number of primary level schools that provide such access; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1188","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":537,"content":"<p>My Department does not hold the type of information sought by the Deputy in relation to school based counselling services.  Since September 2012 at post primary level guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. Guidance is a whole school activity and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students.  This operates at local school level.  The Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations.<\/p><p>  Guidance counsellors have two distinct functions.  The first is general career guidance and guidance on the educational opportunities a child or young person might pursue, while the second involves support for students' well-being.  The principal and leadership of a school have the best knowledge and experience to determine how exactly guidance resources and teaching resources should be allocated.<\/p><p>  The representative organisations for School Principals and school management developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation.  This approach puts a greater emphasis on group-work and class-based activity at senior cycle and maximises the amount of time available for those pupils that need one to one support.<\/p><p>  NEPS psychologists are available to offer their advice and support to schools in establishing and developing School Support Teams.  The extension of the NEPS service to all mainstream schools since September 2013 also puts it in a good position to provide advice to the Teams in regard to students with particular difficulties and on onward referral or liaison with other community based services that also have a role in providing service to schools.<\/p><p>  Student Support Teams in Post-Primary Schools (DES 2014) is a NEPS booklet to promote the well-being of pupils in post-primary schools.<\/p><p>  Wellbeing Guidelines for Post-Primary and more recently for Primary Schools have been produced by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive.  The guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of current research.  They provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour.<\/p><p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE, Health Promoting Schools Process.

HAP commenced in Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin and Monaghan County Councils from 1 October 2014.  Subsequently, on 18 December 2014, Dublin City Council became part of the statutory HAP pilot, with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households.  Dublin City Council is implementing the HAP pilot for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all four Dublin local authorities, including D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council.  There are now more than 1,000 households being supported by HAP across the local authority areas taking part in the statutory pilot scheme.<\/p><p>During the legislation's passage through the Oireachtas in July 2014 an undertaking was given that a report would be prepared for the relevant Oireachtas Committee, that would include a full review of the statutory pilot phase.  Data for this report is being gathered from pilot sites and the report will be submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht shortly.  Based on data gathered for the review, consideration is currently being given to the sequencing of local authorities to commence HAP on an incremental basis this year.<\/p><p>The HAP scheme will bring all social housing supports provided by the State under the aegis of local authorities.  The scheme will remove a barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment.  The rent contribution payable by the HAP recipient is based on the differential rent scheme for their local authority and all payments are made electronically.  HAP will also provide for a better integrated and more streamlined service for households; facilitate better regulation of the private rented sector; provide certainty for landlords as regards their rental income; improve standards of accommodation; and provide greater consistency in the application of social housing policies.  HAP enables the relevant local authority to be a one-stop shop for all housing supports.<\/p><p>As HAP is deemed to be a social housing support under section 19 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, as amended, households in receipt of HAP are not included on the local authority waiting list for social housing support.\u00a0 However, HAP recipients may access other forms of social housing supports by applying to go on the local authority transfer list.\u00a0 I issued a statutory direction to the seven authorities involved in the first phase of the HAP statutory pilot, instructing them to take the necessary steps to ensure that households benefiting from HAP can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support, should they wish to do so, through the transfer option.  I also directed that HAP recipients, who apply to go on the transfer list, should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list.\u00a0 In practice, housing authorities inform HAP recipients in writing of their entitlement to apply to go on the transfer list when they are approved for HAP.  When a new applicant applies for a Housing Needs Assessment, the relevant local authority determines what supports are available and most appropriate for that particular applicant.

It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.  This involves the carrying out of house-to-house or other local enquiries, including in many cases delivering registration forms to households for completion.  The draft register is published on 1<sup><\/sup>November each year and is generally available for examination at post offices, Garda stations and local authority offices and on-line at up to 25 November.  The public are invited through national and local advertising campaigns to check the draft during this period to make sure that they are correctly registered and to bring errors or omissions in the draft to the attention of the local authority.  The final register is published on 1 February and comes into force on 15 February that year until 14 February in the following year.<\/p><p>On the question of making it less onerous for citizens to apply for inclusion in the supplement to the register of electors, a balance needs to found between making the registration process accessible while at the same time ensuring the integrity and security of the registration system.  Appropriate measures, therefore, are in place to guard against potential personation or abuse of the electoral system. Accordingly, the supplement application form must be signed by the applicant in the presence of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from the applicant&rsquo;s local Garda station who must first be satisfied as to the person&rsquo;s identity before signing, dating and stamping the form. The Garda may request photographic or other identification. Where the applicant establishes in writing that he is unable to progress the application in this way, the form can be signed by the applicant in the presence of an official of the local authority who is satisfied as to his or her identity. Again, photographic or other identification may be required. If neither option is viable due to physical illness or physical disability, the application form must be accompanied by a medical certificate. <\/p><p>I consider that the current arrangements strike a reasonable balance between having a flexible supplement facility and, at the same time, ensuring that there are adequate measures in place to counteract any possible abuse.

The Directive requires that certain minimum levels of monitoring are conducted for the purpose of assessment and management of air quality. The EPA has responsibility for the monitoring of air quality in Ireland, and monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants, based on data obtained from the 29 monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network.  The EPA publishes an annual report on air quality, based primarily on the monitoring requirements of the CAFE Directive. The most recent report, Air Quality in Ireland 2013 &ndash; Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality, was published in October 2014 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2013, compared to the CAFE Directive standards as well as assessments in relation to more stringent World Health Organisation (WHO) air quality guidelines for the protection of human health. <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that downward trends have been identified for many pollutants and that Ireland currently meets all EU standards for air quality, while noting that Ireland exceeds WHO air quality guideline values for particulate matter in some areas. Particulate matter levels are of concern, particularly during the winter heating season in areas where the sale of smoky coal is permitted. Because of this, levels of particulate matter in smaller towns are similar or higher than those in cities where smoky coal is banned. To help protect our good air quality, the Irish consumer must become more aware of their choice in home heating fuel and the potential impact that choice can have on air quality in their locality and on human health.<\/p>  <p>  In August 2012, following a public consultation process, new solid fuel regulations (S.I. No. 326 of 2012) were introduced with the aim of ensuring that the smoky coal ban remains fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of certain residential solid fuels. The ban now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide, including all towns with a population greater than 15,000 people, bringing the ban areas broadly into line with national EPA air quality management zones. While my Department keeps the matter under regular review, I have no immediate plans at present to extend the ban to new towns.<\/p>  <p>  Air quality monitoring by the EPA has shown that air quality is poorer in towns where the smoky coal ban does not apply, although there is evidence that smaller smoky coal ban areas tend to be less effective. The further extension of the ban to smaller towns on an individual basis may not be the most effective solution to addressing the problem of emissions from residential solid fuel use in these areas. Similarly, the border with Northern Ireland would present enforcement challenges if a national ban on smoky coal were unilaterally introduced. However, it is recognised that having different regulations between urban and rural locations is not ideal, as it results in different levels of environmental protection and clean air benefits for citizens in different locations.   <\/p>  <p>  Under the auspices of the North South Ministerial Council, and in conjunction with the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, my Department has commissioned a study to inform a discussion on policy options to further address emissions from residential solid fuel use on an all-island basis. The study includes an assessment of the solid fuel market and barriers to the use of cleaner fuels; consideration of the role and impacts of biomass (primarily wood and wood-based products) and the links to climate policy; and an economic analysis addressing the potential positive and negative effects on the consumer, for example, resulting from potential fuel switching, the availability of smokeless fuels to supply an all-island market and job creation opportunities in the manufacture and supply of smokeless fuels. <\/p>  <p>  A final report is expected to be presented to the North South Ministerial Council later this year. It should be noted that no decision has been made at this point regarding a nation-wide ban on the sale of smoky coal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400096#WRCC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Adaptation Grant","counter":631,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400097#WRDD00200"},{"type":"question","counter":632,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[9586\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400097#WRDD00300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the extent to which adequate funding has been made available to each local authority to facilitate home adaptation grants for applicants with special needs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":633,"content":"<p>I refer to the reply to Question No. 130 of 28 January 2015 which sets out the position in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400097#WRDD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Services Provision","counter":634,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400097#WRDD00500"},{"type":"question","counter":635,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[9587\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030400097#WRDD00600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he remains satisfied that the structures now in place are adequate to meet the current and future requirements in respect of the provision of a high quality, reliable and widely available domestic water supply, notwithstanding the concerns expressed through the national broadcaster; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":636,"content":"<p>Since 1 January 2014 Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels including the delivery of water services capital infrastructure.

It is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by these producers. The PSO levy is also vital to enable Ireland to meet its 2020 40% target for electricity generated from renewable sources by 2020, which in turn is important for the achievement of Ireland's 16% EU 2020 target for renewable energy.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) determines the PSO levy which is a charge on all electricity customers without exception. The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in Regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (S.I. 217 of 2002). The annual PSO levy amount for 2014\/2015 is &euro;335.4 million compared with &euro;210.9 million allowed for the 2013\/14 PSO period. The 2014\/2015 levy for residential customers and small to medium sized business customers (maximum import capacity of less than 30 kVA) is set at fixed amounts of &euro;64.37 and &euro;221.66 per annum respectively. The 2014\/2015 levy for medium and large customers (import capacity of equal to or greater than 30 kVA) is calculated at &euro;34.20 per kVA per annum. This compares to &euro;18.47 per kVA per annum for medium and large customers in the 2013\/2014 PSO year, an increase of approximately 85%. <\/p>  <p>  The biggest driver for the levy rise for this year is the lower predicted wholesale market electricity price. This results in lower predicted market income for the PSO plants and, consequently, a higher levy is required to cover their allowed costs. The lower wholesale electricity price is currently being driven by lower international gas prices in evidence since mid-2013. This drives up the proposed PSO levy. <\/p>  <p>  However, if lower gas and wholesale prices are sustained, the lower wholesale prices would reduce the wholesale cost of electricity that suppliers pay.
