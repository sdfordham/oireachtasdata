The trade mission was organised by my Department, with the assistance of Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland, Irish Thoroughbred Marketing, Horse Sport Ireland and Horse Racing Ireland.<\/p><p>  The purpose of the trade mission was to deepen political and commercial relationships between Ireland and Qatar, UAE and Saudi, and to assist in expanding our exports to this critically important target region. I also promoted Ireland as a strategic partner in the Gulf States in terms of their food security challenges, for joint investments in dairy and other sectors, as a provider of commercial and advanced expertise in the agri food and agri services sector, as a source of the highest quality thoroughbred and sport horses, and as a location to invest in the equine sector. <\/p><p>  The trade mission was viewed as a success at both political and commercial levels. The Irish Dairy Board&rsquo;s announcement of a &euro;20 million investment in a Saudi Dairy company Al Waseen will result in the importation of significant volumes of Irish milk powders to Saudi and the production of approximately 20,000t of a &lsquo;white cheese&rsquo; specific to the region, using new technology developed by Teagasc.  In addition, the opening of the Kerry Food and Ingredients development centre in UAE, which will produce products specific to the Middle East market, has also consolidated the Irish presence and reputation in the food sector in the region.<\/p><p>  Bord Bia will shortly open a new office in UAE to assist food companies exporting to the region.  Food exports to the Gulf States amounted to almost &euro;200 million in 2012. There is potential to double that figure by 2020 as almost 90% of the food consumed in this region is imported.  Biotector, an Irish company signed a &euro;5m contract for the supply of its water analysis technology in Saudi Arabia while the nine technology companies that came on the trade mission have built significant business contacts and I would anticipate follow up business.<\/p><p>  The development of Ireland&rsquo;s &euro;1billion equine sector was a significant focus of the mission and included meetings with Mohammed Bin Faleh Al Thani of the Qatari Royal family which has bloodstock interests in Ireland, Sheikh Hamdan Al Maktoum, Vice Premier and Minister for Finance in Dubai and other key investors in the Irish equine industry. Linkages with the sport horse sector are also very strong and I would expect to see these developing over the coming years.<\/p><p>  My Department, in conjunction with the respective Embassies in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, are following up on the establishment of Memoranda of Understanding on the cooperation on food security and commercialisation of expertise. <\/p><p>  In addition, I met with members of the Irish Diaspora in the Gulf Region and I would like to put on record the incredible work which they are all, both individually and collectively, doing on our behalf of Ireland in promoting Irish food and business in this region. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400055#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":9,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 11 and 12 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Horse Racing Industry Funding","counter":10,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400055#WRA00750"},{"type":"question","counter":11,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[48142\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400055#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason he ignores the Indecon report commissioned by his Department in 2012 which stated that the grant to the greyhound and horse racing industry was unsustainable; and the reason he chose to increase their subsidy to &euro;54 million.","asker":"1015","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":12,"content":"<p><b>Indecon Report<\/b><\/p><p>  Indecon Consultants were commissioned by my Department to undertake a review of certain aspects of the Irish horse racing industry. The terms of reference provided to Indecon did not extend to the greyhound racing industry. The Indecon Review consisted of an in-depth analysis of the legislation, governance structures, funding and management of the horse racing industry in Ireland and the report published in July 2012, contained a range of recommendations to assist in the future long-term development of the sector.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is mistaken in thinking that State support for the horse and greyhound racing industries has increased. In fact State funding for the horse racing industry has decreased each year since 2008 when the provision was &euro;61m, to the 2013 provision of &euro;44m, reflecting a decrease of 28% over the period Research recently published by the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association indicates that the horse racing and breeding industry supports 14,000 jobs and creates &euro;1.1bn in economic output. State funding for the greyhound racing industry has also been reduced by 28% in the same period. <\/p><p>  The Indecon Report confirmed the importance and potential of the Irish Horse Racing Industry and affirmed that with appropriate policies and structures in place the sector can contribute to the economic and social development of the country and to the expansion of employment.<\/p><p>  Indecon made a number of recommendations with regard to funding, legislation and governance, streamlining of functions between the Turf Club &amp;amp; HRI and improved marketing and competitiveness of the sector. I have confirmed, some time ago, my general acceptance of the recommendations contained in the Indecon Report and I have since the publication of the Report done my best to ensure the recommendations contained in the Report are followed through.<\/p><p>  Indecon did not state that <i>&ldquo;grant to the greyhound and horse racing industries was unsustainable&rdquo;<\/i>.  It did, however,  point to the need for change in the State funding model and in particular identified the betting industry as being <i>&ldquo;the main potential source of additional funding. <\/i>It also stated &ldquo;  <i>that, in terms of funding, it is important that sufficient funding is provided to ensure reasonable prize money and to enhance the reputation of the Irish horse racing sector.  Resources are also needed to finance racing integrity services, which are essential to the maintenance of the credibility and reputation of the sector.  The development of racecourses and maintaining the disease free status of Irish bloodstock also require appropriate funding.  In addition, effective international marketing is an important component in realising the economic potential of this unique sector.&rdquo;<\/i><\/p><p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy there are changes imminent to address the anomalies that exist with regard to the taxation of betting. My colleague, the Minister for Finance, is responsible for taxation policy and he introduced the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013 earlier this year which will bring remote and on-line betting within the tax net. This legislation is working its way through the system and is currently with the European Commission. This is consistent with the Indecon recommendation which advocated <i>&ldquo;Measures should be introduced to secure a significant increase in taxation from the Betting Sector.&rdquo;<\/i><\/p><p>  I am also mindful of the need as highlighted by Indecon to maximise efficiency, effectiveness and value for money, I am aware that the Turf Club and Horse Racing Ireland have been engaged in on-going negotiations with a view to streamlining functions between the two bodies with a view to eliminating duplication.<\/p><p>  Finally, it is important to recognise that the horse and greyhound racing industries together provide almost 24,000 jobs, many of them in rural Ireland, and stimulate approximately &euro;1.6 billion in economic output annually. I will continue to work to ensure that these important sectors continue to make the maximum possible contribution to employment and the economy generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400055#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Agricultural Policy Reform","counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400055#WRA00925"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[48283\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400055#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will ensure that co-funding for the Common Agricultural Policy Pillar 2 will be maximised; and that Ireland will benefit from the total &euro;313 million that has been allocated for Ireland for Pillar 2 purposes.

This latter requirement is an essential part of the food-chain information under EU food law and is designed to protect human health.<\/p><p>  With regard to surplus horses, the position is that it is the responsibility of horse owners to ensure the welfare of horses in their ownership and\/or their care and to dispose of them appropriately. In this context, horse owners are reminded of the advice of the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council that, where an owner can no longer adequately provide for their horse or where the horse can no longer fulfil the purpose for which is was bred, he or she should be proactive in seeking to dispose of the animal, including consideration of the option of humane disposal. <\/p><p>  My Department provides significant funding to Local Authorities under the Control of Horses Act, 1996, to enable these bodies implement their powers relating to the control and welfare of stray or abandoned horses. While efforts are made to rehome horses to responsible new owners, the reality is that this is not possible in all cases. Local authorities are humanely disposing of a considerable number of horses seized under the Control of Horses Act on an on-going basis where there is no possibility of re-homing or returning these horses to their owners. <\/p><p>  The need for additional welfare measures in the horse sector is being kept under review by my Department. The very good weather during the Summer and well into the Autumn has created a very favourable fodder situation, with the result that there is no evidence of a significant problem in relation to the welfare of horses. In addition, the continuing work being undertaken by local authorities in conjunction with the Department via the Control of Horses Act 1996 has reduced the number of abandoned horses throughout the country, particularly in urban areas.<\/p><p>  My Department will continue to deal with any animal welfare issues relating to horses through its existing mechanisms and has indicated that it is in position to provide emergency funding to assist horse owners who cannot afford to pay for their humane disposal.

The Deputy should be aware that more than 75% of the expenditure in this sector is on Irish goods and services, compared to 42% for all manufacturing. In addition it has a lower import content and a lower level of profit repatriation than other manufacturing industries.

Within the Commission, primary responsibility for direct enforcement rests with the Directorate-General (DG) for Competition. The Council of Ministers has no function in this regard. In parallel with national competition authorities, DG Competition has wide-ranging investigative powers to detect cartel activities and other illegal trading behaviour. In addition, DG Agriculture and Rural Development facilitates price transparency for suppliers through a standardised system of market price reporting implemented by Member States by reference to uniform criteria for classifying bovine carcases according to conformation, fat and sex at slaughter plants. <\/p><p>  If there were evidence of systemic failure on the scale implied in the question, then the matter could be brought to the attention of DG Competition.

These linkages encapsulate the mutually dependent relationship between the production and processing stages of the beef supply chain.<\/p><p>  With regard to the more general food policy issues raised by the Deputy, the production of foodstuffs in the EU is governed by an overarching legal framework known as the Hygiene Package. This integrated regime, which came into effect across all Member States on 1 January 2006, sets out clear, comprehensive and consistent rules for operators throughout the supply chain. With traceability as a core concept, the Hygiene Package regulates food and feed hygiene along with the production, control and marketing of products of animal origin, and animal health issues in relation to the production of those products.<\/p><p>  The Hygiene Package was motivated by the necessity to ensure high levels of public health protection in relation to food production.

In the review of the Mackerel policy which took place in 2010 specific provision was made for small vessels using, trawls or gill nets, which is important to the local community when the mackerel come inshore in the summer months.  Hook and line fishing for mackerel by small boats has been provided for since 2008.

Support for agricultural development in less favoured areas (LFAs) forms an important part of the Programme and these areas are supported both directly through LFA payments themselves and indirectly through schemes such as on farm investment and the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS), Agri-environment Options Scheme (AEOS) and Natura agri-environment schemes.

As I have indicated previously, while it is generally accepted that this is a very complex matter and requires a very detailed action plan to cover the various issues, I intend in the near future to set out proposals on how these matters will be progressed. My firm intention is that the process will be fully inclusive and that all stakeholders, particularly farmers and their representatives will be central to the process.<\/p><p>  Commonage lands form an important part of the farming enterprises of many farmers, particularly along the West Coast. They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism. However, there is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing becomes more of a problem. Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission. It is vital, therefore, to maintain the commonages in GAEC (Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition), or where there is under-grazing, to return the habitat to GAEC.<\/p><p>  Taking all of these matters into account, it is my stated aim is to ensure that a practical solution is reached, which will ensure that the current farmers actively farming these lands are protected, that the land is maintained or returned to GAEC and that the requirements of the governing EU Regulations are met. In my view, this can best be achieved by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant State Agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders. With regard to the specific recommendations of the Committee contained in their Report, I can confirm that these will be included among the range of issues to be addressed in the process that will shortly be commenced by my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400056#WRB00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":63,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400056#WRB01000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland Issues","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400056#WRB00950"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[48700\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400056#WRB01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the proposals he has had to have further discussions with the Northern Ireland Secretary of State and with Members of the Northern Ireland Executive regarding the establishment of the civic forum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Following the restoration of devolved powers in May 2007, the then First Minister and deputy First Minister considered the position of the Civic Forum in the re-established devolved arrangements and commissioned a review of the effectiveness and appropriateness of its structure, operation and membership. In April 2013 the NI Assembly voted in favour of an SDLP motion to re-establish the Civic Forum.   In my ongoing contacts with the Secretary of State and with the Northern Ireland Executive, including in the context of the North South Ministerial Council, most recently on 8 November, the Government has continued to support the re-establishment of the Civic Forum as a valuable and, as yet, unimplemented provision of the Good Friday Agreement.     I welcome the recent consultations which Richard Haass, Independent Chair of the Panel of Parties, and Meghan O&rsquo;Sullivan, Independent Vice-Chair of the Panel of Parties, have undertaken with community groups and with representatives of wider civil society in order to ensure that their views and perspectives are considered in the context of the Talks process. <\/p><p>  I hosted a Reconciliation Networking Forum event in Dublin Castle on 30 October 2013 for people who are involved in community, peace-building, public policy or reconciliation work, to discuss what civil society, including the community sector, can and should do to meet the reconciliation challenges ahead.

The actions being undertaken by each Administration to help support economic recovery and the importance of attracting Foreign Direct Investment and ensuring adequate access to credit within the banking sector in each jurisdiction was recognised as was the disposal of assets by NAMA in ways which would support economic recovery in both jurisdictions.

My Department carried out a comprehensive review of the election observation roster earlier this year.  The Information Note for Applicants, which was posted on the Department&rsquo;s websites, stated that interviews would be held in the event that a large number of applicants met the minimum eligibility requirements.  In the event, only 263 eligible applications were received for a roster to comprise of 200 individuals and 10 reserve panellists.  Given that this number was not significantly higher than the number of places available on the roster, the selection process was confined to an assessment of the written applications only and an interview stage was not included.<\/p><p>  All eligible applications were scored independently by two assessors external to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade against the four criteria published in the Information Note for Applicants.

This was to be conducted by a senior official who had not been involved in the roster review.  On foot of feedback received, two unsuccessful applicants requested a final review of their applications.  In both cases, the reviewer was of the view that the scoring of the applications was fair and impartial overall.  In one case, it was recommended that the applicant&rsquo;s score be adjusted marginally upwards.

Interest incurred before the first occupation of the property by a tenant for the purposes of a trade or undertaking, or between lettings, is not deductible.

The policy measures adopted by Government are built on that overall objective.  <\/p><p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) places an onus on the banks, in respect of a co-operating borrower, to explore all the options for an alternative repayment arrangement offered by the lender to address a mortgage difficulty before any legal action is considered.  Furthermore, under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) process, the Central Bank is now requiring the main lenders to work through their mortgages in arrears of more than 90 days and, where possible, to propose and conclude sustainable restructures with their borrowers in arrears.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Governor of the Central Bank has stated that any bank proceeding to legal recourse with co-operating borrowers, or where alternative sustainable arrangements were available, is not acting in a manner consistent with the MART process, or with the CCMA.<\/p><p>  The initial results of the Central Bank&rsquo;s audit of the banks&rsquo; end of June target will be available shortly. This will provide an independent assessment on the compliance by the banks with all the MART requirements.<\/p><p>  Of course, the CCMA and MART can only work in circumstances where the borrower cooperates with the lender and engages with the process.  Where this does not happen, the lender may have no other option but to go down the legal route to deal with an arrears case.  However, if that course of action leads the borrower to commence a constructive engagement, this can lead to a more favourable outcome for the respective parties. <\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that there are also now new insolvency resolution options available to a borrower under the Personal Insolvency Act. The Courts now have the power to adjourn legal proceedings in respect of a primary home to see if a Personal Insolvency Arrangement can be explored and agreed as an alternative to repossession.<\/p><p>  Regretfully, however it must be accepted that due to the individual circumstances, not all mortgages can be made sustainable. There will sometimes be circumstances where the person will have to lose ownership of the home.  Indeed, in such cases this may be in the best overall long term interests of all parties. The Central Bank has stated that it does not expect that repossession will be the lender&rsquo;s preferred solution to mortgage difficulties and in most cases engagement by the borrower will make the legal option unnecessary.  However in circumstances where the borrower does not engage with a lender to address a mortgage difficulty and, subject to fully complying with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, there may be no other option for the lender but to commence legal proceedings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400059#WRE02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Issues","counter":146,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400060#WRF00150"},{"type":"question","counter":147,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[48781\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400060#WRF00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether it would be beneficial for the economy if the banks passed on the ECB interest rate reduction; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":148,"content":"<p>Macroeconomic simulations published at the time of the Budget suggest that a lower-than-expected interest rate environment would be likely to result in greater-than-forecast growth in economic activity and employment.

","asker":"973","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":265,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is contained in the table.  There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office.  Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the office received 35,484 appeals.  In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office.  In addition, a major programme of process redesign and modernisation is underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas, aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals.  These measures have led to improvements in processing times and a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from 17,787 in 2009 to 32,558 in 2012.  The Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012.  Good progress is also now being made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 15,991 at 11 November 2013.<\/p><p>  The average processing time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 processing times improved by 10.3 weeks when the average time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks while the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  This improvement has continued with the average processing time up to October 2013 reducing to 34.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 26.3 weeks for a summary decision.  Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalises the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.<\/p><p>  The Social

In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services over the coming years.

Under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, commencing in 2014 the Minister for Finance will pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this revenue will be allocated to local authorities from the Fund.  In addition, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing.   <\/p><p>  The Government has indicated an intention to move to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised.  The establishment of Irish Water presents local government with significant organisational and financial challenges in 2014.  Service provision responsibilities will shift from the local authorities to Irish Water, infrastructure will be transferred, financing arrangements will alter and local authorities will operate on behalf of Irish Water under Service Level Agreements.  These changes must be managed.   <\/p><p>  In this context, it has been necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the Local Property Tax to be retained in each local authority until 2015.  This approach allows maximum flexibility in allocating Local Property Tax in 2014 with the priority to support those local authorities with weaker funding bases.  This decision has been taken in the context of Budget 2014.  The 2014 Local Government Fund General Purpose Grants will be announced in due course.   <\/p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision - in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates.

","asker":"1186","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":294,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 113 together.<\/p><p>  The Water Services Act 2013, which provided for the establishment of Irish Water as a subsidiary of B&oacute;rd G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to be formed and registered under the Companies Act, also provides for the normal governance arrangements for a commercial State body in relation to its financial sustainability.  Further proposed legislation will provide for the establishment of an economic regulator for water services within the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  While the primary function of the CER will be to protect the interests of customers and to ensure that a consistent and appropriate level of service is provided to them, it will also be responsible for approving the tariffs to be charged by Irish Water. <\/p><p>  Following the passage of this comprehensive legislation, a new funding model will be in place to meet both capital and operational costs of the new entity.  Irish Water's costs in the coming years will be funded through a mix of revenue from the domestic and non-domestic sector, third party finance (such as the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, EIB, bank lending and capital markets facilities) and State support which may be in the form of both equity and subvention. <\/p><p>  The Exchequer proposes a direct equity investment of &euro;240m towards the capital funding of Irish Water in 2014.  This will support projects to be included in Irish Water's Capital Investment Plan and will ensure that the entity is in a position to take on the water services investment programmes of the 34 water services authorities, including some 80 projects currently in progress.  Irish Water will also finance some of its costs and the liabilities transferred from local authorities through borrowings in 2014.  There has been no expenditure to date from the Exchequer other than a commitment of funding from my Department, of almost &euro;0.7m, to Irish Water in 2013 to fund the cost of a pilot study in relation to Phase 2 of the Metering Programme which is targeted at metering those properties that were not meterable in the Phase 1 Programme. <\/p><p>  Bord G&aacute;is has put in place appropriate programme management arrangements to establish Irish Water, prepare for the transfer of assets, liabilities and functions from local authorities from 1 January 2014, provide for customer service and billing and implement the domestic water metering programme.  Expenditure on this programme is a matter for Bord G&aacute;is\/Irish Water and these costs are not being funded from the Exchequer.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund has provided a bridging loan facility to Irish Water to meet the costs arising to the end of 2013.  This includes the initial stages of the domestic water metering programme, the full cost of which is &euro;539m excluding VAT.  The B&oacute;rd G&aacute;is\/Irish Water balance sheet at the end of the year will reflect the expenditure programme and funding from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.   <\/p><p>  The establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing from 2014.  Work is also underway on the funding model for Irish Water's operational costs, to ensure that it can fund the Service Level Agreements being put in place with local authorities for the delivery of water services in 2014.  Irish Water is working with local authorities to finalise the 2014 budgets associated with the proposed Service Level Agreements.  In parallel with this process, the Department has sought the advice of the Commission for Energy Regulation in relation to anticipated new operational costs associated with new functions for the entity which are likely to arise in 2014.  The outcome of these processes will determine the overall funding requirement of Irish Water in 2014 from the Exchequer, borrowing and charges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400066#WRM01300","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Services Funding","counter":295,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400066#WRM01350"},{"type":"question","counter":296,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[48601\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400066#WRM01400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide in tabular form all projects that received funding under the water services investment programme in 2012 and 2013; if he will confirm that all of the allocation of &euro;371 million in 2012 and &euro;329 million in 2013 under the programme has been spent; if either of these Exchequer payments was used to fund any part of the domestic water metering programme; if he will detail for each year the total amount of Exchequer funding that was used to fund the domestic water metering programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Garda Authorities maintain a close working relationship with the PSNI and the HET.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the late Judge Henry Barron and Patrick McEntee SC carried out detailed and painstaking inquiries into those awful events in Dublin and Monaghan in May 1974 and, indeed, other tragic atrocities that took place between 1972 and 1976 in which so many innocent people lost their lives.  The Garda authorities co-operated fully with the Barron and McEntee inquiries.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will recall that this House and Seanad &Eacute;ireann have previously and unanimously urged the British Government to allow access to documents relevant to these events.

At the start of each year, my Department issues colour maps of all land parcels declared by farmers in the previous year together with a covering letter.  In that letter, farmers are clearly informed of the need to carefully examine each map and to identify and exclude from their application all unfarmed land, ineligible features such as buildings, farmyards, scrub, roadways, forests, lakes etc. included in the land parcels.  There is, therefore, an onus on all farmers to ensure that the area of land declared by them as eligible for payment under the Direct Payment Schemes is accurate.  They are also given the means to do so by making the ortho-photos available to them on an annual basis.  These requirements are also made clear in the Terms and Conditions of the Schemes, which accompanies the pre-printed application form issued to all farmers. <\/p><p>  Deputies will be fully aware of the importance of payments made under the Single Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and other Direct Payment Schemes to the annual income of Irish farmers.  To date, my Department has paid &euro;582 million in advance payments to over 115,143 farmers under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme since payments commenced on 16 October.  Some 84,800 farmers have received &euro;179.3 million under the 2013 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme. Payments continue to issue under both Schemes as cases become clear and eligible for payment.  I can reassure farmers that no payments are held up due to the ongoing LPIS review.<\/p><p>  Department officials met the Commission in July of this year about possible disallowances, and in response my Department is currently reviewing all land parcels claimed.  This effectively means a review of all 950,000 land parcels.  This is a mammoth task but my Department is making every effort to ensure that it will be completed in a manner that satisfies the Commission.  As a result of this phase of this review, any payments made to farmers in respect of claimed areas, which were found to be ineligible, must be reimbursed.  The Review of the 950,000 parcels contained on the LPIS database is well advanced at this stage with over half the parcels reviewed and is on target to be finalised in time to allow a comprehensive response to the Commission within the specified time-frame of 15 December.<\/p><p>  To date, 19,418 over-claim letters have issued to farmers, together with maps of the land parcels in question. It should be borne in mind that for 75% of farmers, the over-claim will have no impact on payment as the many farmers declare more land than payment entitlements and a further 18% of farmers have a minimal payment reduction.  The average over-claim is less that &euro;90 or just over &euro;300 for those applicants with a reduction and penalty.  These figures are based on 2013 payments only.<\/p><p>  In the letters issued to date there is considerable detail and maps to advise of the particular over-claims, farmers are also informed of the appeals process, should   they disagree with my Department&rsquo;s findings.  The appeals process I have introduced is both robust and comprehensive; in the first instance, applicants are entitled to have their case reviewed by submitting their appeal on the form provided by my Department. If they are not satisfied with the outcome of the review, they can appeal their case to the independent-chaired Land Eligibility Appeals Committee, details of which I announced recently.  This Committee will consist of an independent Chairman and appeals officers from the Agriculture Appeals Office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400072#WRS00300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Payments","counter":423,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400072#WRS00350"},{"type":"question","counter":424,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[48611\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400072#WRS00400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding payments in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":425,"content":"<p>With processing of the application of the person named under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme and Disadvantaged Areas Scheme having recently been completed, payments will shortly issue directly to the nominated bank account of the person named.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400072#WRS00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Suckler Welfare Scheme Appeals","counter":426,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400072#WRS00550"},{"type":"question","counter":427,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[48667\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400072#WRS00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a decision will be made on an appeal in respect of the suckler cow welfare scheme in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Galway in relation to 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The development of a new Rural Development Programme under Pillar 2 will be a key support in enhancing the competitiveness of the agri-food sector, achieving more sustainable management of natural resources and ensuring a more balanced development of rural areas.<\/p><p>  A general EU co-financing rate of 53% is set out in the draft Rural Development Regulation but this rate may rise to a maximum of 80% for measures such as farm and business development, co-operation activities, and LEADER projects.  Environmental-type measures may be co-funded up to 75%.  The total Exchequer funding that will be required to draw down the available EAFRD funding will depend on the types of measures included in the new Rural Development Programme and on the co-financing rates applied to these measures.<\/p><p>  There are a number of conditions attached to Ireland&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;313 million per annum.  The draft Regulation provides that at least 5% of EAFRD funding must be reserved for LEADER while the draft Common Provisions Regulation provides that 6% of EAFRD funding must be set aside to a national performance reserve.  The funding set aside to the performance reserve will be allocated to each Member State following a performance review in 2019.  The draft Rural Development Regulation also sets out that 30% of the total EAFRD amount must be reserved for environmental operations and climate change mitigation and adaptation measures.  In addition to these considerations, transitional funding for commitments arising from the current RDP and continuing into the start of the new programming period will be included in the budgeting process for the coming years.<\/p><p>  Work is currently ongoing in my Department to design the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) for the period from 2014 &ndash; 2020.  In designing the new RDP, my Department must take account of the range of requirements set out in the draft Rural Development Regulation and the need to support key policy aims for the agri-food sector in the light of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.  In undertaking this work, a number of ex-ante analyses are being undertaken and a public consultation process has also taken place.<\/p><p>  While final decisions in relation to what measures are to be included in the new RDP have not yet been made, my Department is in ongoing contact with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the overall financing that will be required.

The legislation imposes a series of health and supervisory requirements, designed to ensure that imported products meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between Member States. Products must have originated in an area where there are no restrictions imposed under EU Safeguard measures and come from establishments which are under the supervision and control of the competent authorities. The products must be free from residues and contaminants, correctly labelled and travel with the specific health certificates or other documents conforming to the models laid down in EU legislation drawn up in conformity with the relevant model for the product, completed and signed on behalf of the competent authorities of the country of export.

This is a significant change as up to now fisheries decision making was centred in Brussels. The new CFP has moved away from the old system of EU wide development and application of the rules (a one size fits all approach).   Instead, the new policy provides for the development of measures appropriate for each region by the Member States, in consultation with the stakeholders through the new Advisory Councils to devise and implement measures that work for the types of fisheries in the region.  A first meeting of Member States from the North West region was hosted by Ireland earlier this week.<\/p><p>  A practical and phased discards policy is being introduced where in early years of implementation, TACs and quotas will be set to take account of current levels of discards, which should see quotas increase over time. This means that fishermen will have time to adjust and implement changes that will allow for the avoidance of non target species where there are particular problems with the relevant by-catch (such as that the stock is overfished and needs to be allowed to rebuild). In that context, I have established a national Discards Implementation Group to advise on the issues arising in the effective implementation of the new policy and to recommend practical solutions and arrangements that take into account the situation of the Irish industry.  <\/p><p>  Another key element of the new CFP is the setting of fishing levels on the basis of the MSY Principle (Maximum Sustainable Yield). This should lead to healthy fish stocks and to higher quotas for Irish fishermen and more sustainable fishing patterns.<\/p><p>  Technical measures will also be introduced to avoid and minimise catches of juvenile fish and the reforms contain a commitment to continue and further strengthen conservation measures in the biologically sensitive area off the South and West coast of Ireland (new Irish box). The commitment to develop and strengthen biologically sensitive areas, with spawning grounds and high populations of juvenile fish will also protect the livelihoods of coastal communities by ensuring that fish are allowed to grow to maturity, are more plentiful and fished in a environmentally responsible manner. <\/p><p>  Finally, and crucially from an Irish perspective, the Hague Preferences have been maintained and given increased reference in this agreement. The Hague Preferences have traditionally given Ireland an increased share of traditional whitefish stocks such as cod, haddock and whiting in the waters off our coast when stock levels are decreasing. It is important to bear in mind that other Member States receive reduced quota as a result of their allocation to Ireland and to the UK and there was no support from other Member States for a specific provision that would have made the application of Hague Preferences a mandatory provision of the CFP.   In that context,  having an increased reference to the Hagues in the recitals of the new CFP Regulation is significant as it can be seen by other Member States as a clear signal of the intent of the Council and the Parliament.<\/p><p>  From the outset of the Common Fisheries Policy revision process, Ireland&rsquo;s overarching goal was to ensure a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector, while balancing these objectives with the need to ensure that fish stocks would be protected for future generations. I strongly believe that the new CFP will achieve that goal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400074#WRU00600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Industry Issues","counter":479,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400074#WRU00650"},{"type":"question","counter":480,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[48767\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400074#WRU00700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which the beef industry is likely to be safeguarded in the future in view of the likelihood of substantial expansion in the dairy sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":481,"content":"<p>Given the high export dependence of the beef and dairy sectors, their future prospects will be determined in the first instance by demand and supply developments in the marketplace. The dairy industry in Ireland has been constrained by the milk quota system which was introduced in 1984. A Teagasc analysis of the post-quota situation anticipates an extra yield per cow and an increase in dairy cow numbers with most of the surplus dairy calves produced going into the beef production chain. The Draft Environmental Analysis of Food Harvest 2020 published by my Department in September 2013 envisages that, even allowing for some substitution of beef cows for dairy cows, the strength of the suckler cow herd will remain relatively stable with numbers exceeding the one million head mark throughout the forecast period.<\/p><p>  A Teagasc Sectoral Road Map for suckler beef forecasts that a 40% increase in the output value of the sector by 2020 should be achievable with increased efficiency in the suckler herd and an increase in the number of dairy beef calves.

Indigenous production of cereals is of course, an important part of primary agriculture production. In addition to generating an income for our tillage farmers, the cereals sector is a key source of grain for the milling and malting industry and feeding stuffs for the livestock sector. Annual cereals production in Ireland has fluctuated around 2 million tonnes in recent years and it is desirable to try and sustain this level of production in order to avoid over dependence on imported cereals. <\/p><p>  The most recent Teagasc estimate of total grain production for the 2013 harvest is in the region of 2.45 million tonnes, well above the long-term average production of 2 million tonnes and is 16% higher than last year. Despite the dismal start to the growing season, the good summer resulted in excellent yields in wheat and barley. Yields for winter and spring wheat are estimated at 9.3 tonnes and 7.7 tonnes per hectare, respectively, while winter and spring barley are estimated at a record 9.7 tonnes and 7 tonnes per hectare, respectively. <\/p><p>  Since Ireland is a deficit market for cereals, prices here are greatly affected by world prices and supplies. Grain prices for 2013 have been falling steadily from the peak of 2012 as world harvest estimates for cereals, and especially maize in the USA, are showing an increased level of output over previous years. Volatility in prices is likely to become a constant feature of Irish cereal prices in future and grain producers should factor such fluctuations into their planning and marketing strategies. <\/p><p>  My Department operates a range of services aimed at improving the efficiency of, quality and viability of cereal production. These services include seed certification, seed testing and recommended list of varieties, research funding through the &lsquo;Stimulus&rsquo; programme and funding for the quality assurance scheme. In addition, Teagasc provides research, training and advisory services for cereal producers. The value of all these support services is reflected in the fact that Irish cereals producers have consistently achieved some of the highest yields in the world. <\/p><p>  Food Harvest 2020 outlined a number of challenges facing the cereal sector in the coming years including price volatility, climatic and disease issues, high input prices, small and fragmented holdings and the cost of rented land. However, the report also pointed to positive projections for cereal prices as markets are relatively well-balanced and world cereal prices are projected to be higher than in the last decade. It is known that global grain production is struggling to meet the increasing demand for food, feed and industrial uses. In addition to a rising global population creating a bigger demand for cereals, an increasing demand for meat is disproportionately increasing grain demand even further. It is predicted that global demand for cereals will reach 3 billion tonnes by 2025 compared with 2.3 billion tonnes currently. <\/p><p>  The primary growth in requirement for Irish cereals in the years ahead is likely to be for animal feed, given the targets for increased livestock output proposed in Food Harvest 2020. However, considerable potential also exists in grains for the drink industry such as malting barley and recent significant investments by the large brewing and distilling companies here in Ireland are proof of such potential. Further, it is envisaged that there will be increased demand for Irish oats milled for human food for the home and export markets and in this context, the success of the Agribusiness sector in securing, long-term contracts with US-based Foods companies to supply milled Irish oats to a premium Irish oatmeal brand in the US market, is particularly welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400074#WRU01000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare Issues","counter":485,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400074#WRU01050"},{"type":"question","counter":486,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[48769\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013111400074#WRU01100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if animal welfare requirements in respect of extensions to farm buildings have been facilitated to the extent necessary by the relevant statutory authorities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":487,"content":"<p>The new EU animal welfare requirements for the poultry and pig sectors entered into force on 1 January 2012 and 1 January 2013 respectively.
