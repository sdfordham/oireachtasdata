I am assured by the Commissioner that Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with the overall policing arrangements and operational strategies are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of resources and the best possible policing service is provided to the general public. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p><p>The 2017 Garda Policing Plan has indicated a commitment to increase the number of personnel dedicated to traffic duties by 10% to reflect the increasing numbers of personnel across the entire organisation.  Given that there was no recruitment for a period of five years it will take some time before there are fully trained officers available to replace the number of personnel that have retired across the entire organisation, including traffic.  However, the Commissioner has confirmed that the personnel requirement of the Garda Traffic Corps is currently being assessed to identify the most vulnerable areas in regard to serious traffic collisions and the level of compliance with Road Traffic Legislation.  I understand that the Assistant Commissioner, Roads Policing and Major Event Management is currently assessing the capacity of Divisions and Districts to identify and target areas where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could accelerate the deployment of personnel to traffic in 2017.  The filling of any vacancies identified will be conducted on a structured basis and will be further enhanced with the recently renewed recruitment campaigns to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p><p>Road traffic legislation is, of course, also enforced as part of the day to day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both targeted and general methods of enforcement have a valuable role to play in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's enforcement programme, which targets locations with a view to preventing the commission of offences, detecting errant motorists, changing their behaviour and ultimately reducing death and injuries on our roads.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the strength of the Garda Traffic Corps on 31 January 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, is as set out in the table.<\/p><p><div><b>Garda Traffic Corps Strength 31 January 2017<\/b><\/p><p><\/div><\/p><p><table><tr><th><b>Division<\/b><\/th><th><b>Inspector<\/b><\/th><th><b>Sergeant <\/b><\/th><th><b>Garda<\/b><\/th><th><b>Total<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b>D.M.R.

Children with autism can be enrolled in an early intervention class from the age of 3.<\/p>  <p>  Children in early intervention classes benefit from a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1.  Class teachers are fully qualified and have access, through the Special Education Support Service, to training in a range of autism-specific interventions.  Each class will have a minimum of 2 Special Needs Assistants. <\/p>  <p>  As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.  This facilitates access to individualised education programmes which can be supported by Special Needs Assistants and fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA), Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) as well as the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils. <\/p>  <p>  The use of ABA as part of the range of interventions is particularly useful for addressing behavioural issues.  My Department supports the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use.<\/p>  <p>  However, my Department does not accept, based on research, advice and best practice, that ABA should be the only approach used.  While ABA helps to improve behaviour, other approaches, such as a number of those to which I have referred, are just as important in developing children's communication and speech skills.<\/p>  <p>  An application for Home Tuition for the child referred to by the Deputy has recently been received in Special Education Section of my Department.

We know that schools\u00a0have done\u00a0this well.<\/p>  <p>  We also know that under the pilot of the new allocation model that was conducted in 2015\/16 that schools welcomed the discretion that they had to allocate resources under the new allocation model to\u00a0pupils based on their individual learning needs, as opposed to primarily based on a diagnosis of\u00a0a disability.<\/p>  <p>  A category of disability, by itself, does not identify how much support a child should receive &ndash; two students, with the same disability can need completely different levels of support.<\/p>  <p>  Schools use their own knowledge of their students to allocate teaching supports and they can also call on a wide number of support services to assist them.  These include the Visiting Teacher Service, NEPS, Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) and other support services such as the Special Educational Support Services.  Under the new allocation\u00a0model, schools will continue to receive guidance when making decisions about supporting students&rsquo; learning needs.<\/p>  <p>  Guidelines for schools on supporting children with special educational needs under the new allocation model are also currently being prepared and will be published shortly.<\/p>  <p>  Under the new model, schools will be guided as to how to identify pupils for additional teaching support and how to prioritise pupils for support taking into account the extent of their learning needs in order to ensure the appropriate level of support is being given to the child.  Schools should inform parents about this process and how to request a review of their child&rsquo;s additional teaching support, if this is required.<\/p>  <p>  However, despite these measures, some parents, might still disagree with the level of support being given to their child.  In such cases parents should discuss this first with their child&rsquo;s class \/subject teacher or his\/her support teacher.<\/p>  <p>  If parents remain unhappy with the level of support being given to their child in a school they may then raise this issue with the school principal and if necessary, at a later point with the Chairperson of the school Board of Management, who are the body which has responsibility for the management of the school.<\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines for Schools Supporting Pupils with Special Educational Needs in Mainstream Schools, which are due to be published shortly will support schools in identifying and addressing the needs of children with special education needs and also in monitoring their deployment of resources to meet those needs.<\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines have drawn on best practice to assist schools to allocate the greatest level of resources to the pupils with the highest levels of needs.  The school self-evaluation process also supports schools to examine their own practices in the area of special education, to identify what is working well but also to identify areas that require improvement.  Schools will set targets for improvement and implement agreed actions at a whole-school level.  This process will enable schools to monitor their deployment of resources in area of special education needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300040#WRG00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Summer Works Scheme Applications","counter":207,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300040#WRG00650"},{"type":"question","counter":208,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[14657\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300040#WRG00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if an application for funding under the summer works scheme by a school (details supplied) will be approved; and the level of funding being considered.","asker":"1248","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":209,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the\u00a0Deputy that my Department is in receipt of a Category 10 application, external environment project, under the Summer Works Scheme (2016-2017) from the school to which he refers.<\/p><p>Nearly 50% of schools have applied for inclusion under the scheme which reflects a very high demand.

The Group is due to report in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>An important action that will have a significant impact in the regeneration of vacant properties is the Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS), which has been developed to assist private property owners and local authorities or Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to harness the accommodation potential that exists in certain vacant properties across Ireland.  The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property.  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the local authority or an Approved Housing Body (AHB).  This allows for the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum of 10 years.  The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease.<\/p><p>A property owner can either choose to arrange for a contractor to carry out the repairs themselves, or the local authority or AHB can arrange this instead.  Property owners will not be required to take on landlord responsibilities and the local authority or AHB will have on-going management and maintenance responsibilities in respect of the properties.<\/p><p>The local authority will determine the eligibility for the scheme, having regard to the location and the suitability of the property for social housing and also taking into consideration the extent of the repairs that may be required.  The maximum costs of repairs allowable under this initiative will be &euro;40,000.  My Department is working closely with local authorities to implement the scheme locally.<\/p><p>Following on from the success of the initial pilot in Waterford and Carlow local authorities, the Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) is being rolled out on a national basis from 23 February 2017.  I am making an additional &euro;26m available to fund the scheme in 2017, which brings the total amount available this year to &euro;32m.  This additional investment in 2017 means that delivery under the scheme can be accelerated and up to 800 vacant properties can be brought back into use as new homes for families on local authority waiting lists this year.  This funding represents a frontloading of the &euro;140m being made available for the scheme over the next 5 years.  Over the period 2016 to 2021, it is anticipated that up to 3,500 units will be secured for social housing under this scheme.  Funding to support the cost of bringing new social houses into use using the Repair and Leasing Scheme in 2017 will be released based on proposals submitted by local authorities to my Department rather than by allocation to each local authority.  I have provided funding to support ambitious delivery under the scheme in 2017 and I would urge every local authority to work hard to secure units as early as possible and maximise the use of this investment.<\/p><p>I will be carefully monitoring the scheme in 2017 to ensure that it works well and is cost effective.  Likewise, this analysis will assist in determining its delivery potential for future years, as well as whether additional financial resources are required in that context.<\/p><p>The Repair and Leasing Scheme is one of a number of initiatives in Rebuilding Ireland to address vacant properties around the country.  Other initiatives include the Buy and Renew Scheme.  The full details of this scheme are being finalised and will be communicated to local authorities shortly.  I have made an initial &euro;25 million available for this initiative this year and propose to increase this to as much as &euro;50 million in 2018, depending on the uptake.  I expect this investment to deliver between 400 and 500 renewed houses for social housing use.  The initiative may present opportunities for local authorities and approved housing bodies to tackle dereliction in towns and urban areas, but prospective housing units will always need to be suitable for social housing use, in an area of need, and to represent reasonable value for money.<\/p><p>The Built Heritage Investment Scheme, which comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural &amp;amp; Gaeltacht Affairs, is a &euro;2m scheme for the repair and conservation of protected structures.

Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the local authority or an Approved Housing Body (AHB).  This allows for the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum of 10 years.

The decision was communicated by the Board of CIB to all CIS and MABS Boards and to all staff on the same day.  The CIB assures me that there will be no job losses, no closure of services, no change to service delivery locations and no change to the terms and conditions of serving staff during the lifetime of the restructuring programme.  There will be no disruption to CIS and MABS services for those who use them. <\/p>  <p>  The decision comes after a lengthy and extensive analysis of options and a detailed consultation period with all stakeholders on the need for a more streamlined governance model.  The restructured governance arrangements are being implemented at local company board level only.  The decision does not include any proposal to defund the local network of services.  The services provided by CIS and MABS services are funded by the State, by way of an annual grant from the Citizens Information Board.<\/p>  <p>  The decision taken simply reduces the number of individual local CIS and MABS company boards from ninety three (93) to sixteen (16).  A new regional board structure will be put in place which will comprise eight (8) CIS boards and eight (8) MABS boards.  The valuable work carried out by the employees and volunteers working in CIS services and the employees of MABS services will continue as heretofore.  <\/p>  <p>  A more streamlined governance structure will result in a more targeted use of valuable staff resources, re-directed to increased front line service delivery, made possible by reduction in the current significant administrative burden associated with maintaining ninety three (93) individual companies nationwide.  The changes will bring the CIS and MABS organisations more into line with modern public service governance guidelines and requirements where significant State funding is involved.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, CIB is set to receive State funding of &euro;54 million, of which &euro;15 million is allocated to CIS services (including &euro;13.1 million to the 42 local Citizens Information Services, &euro;1.2 million to Citizens Information Phone services and, the balance, &euro;0.7 million to central and other supports), and &euro;24.6 million is allocated to the network of MABS services (including &euro;15.4 million to the 51 local MABS, &euro;0.3m to National Traveller MABS, &euro;2.0 million to MABS National Development Company, &euro;3.3 million to the MABS Dedicated Mortgage Arrears initiative, &euro;3.5 million to the Abhaile service, and the remaining &euro;0.1m to MABS central supports).<\/p>  <p>  Following on from the decision of the Board, a Restructuring Implementation Group is being set up by CIB to examine all aspects of implementing the new sixteen (16) board model.  This work will include examination of the establishment costs of the new structure and the potential for future savings derived from the reduction in the administrative burden associated with ninety three (93) individual local companies.  Current costs are an aggregate of the costs incurred by each of the ninety three (93) local companies on items such as audit fees, professional fees (including legal services), payroll administration and board of director expenses.  While cost is not the driver of the restructuring project, some efficiencies are likely to result from moving to a reduced sixteen (16) company model.<\/p>  <p>  The aim of the project is to improve existing governance arrangements and optimise the benefits from operating a more modern, streamlined and customer focused service delivery model.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300044#WRL02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":315,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300044#WRL02400"},{"type":"question","counter":316,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[14729\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300044#WRL02500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the details of any payments made by his Department, its agencies or any bodies under his aegis to any broadcasters here in the years 2014, 2015 and 2016; the broadcaster to which the funds were provided; the reason for the payments; and if there are any reasons for payments to broadcasters in 2017.","asker":"1255","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":317,"content":"<p>I understand that the Deputy's question relates to payments to broadcasting organisations.<\/p><p>The statutory bodies operating under the aegis of my Department are the Citizens Information Board, the Pensions Authority, the Pensions Council, the Pensions Ombudsman and the Social Welfare Tribunal.

This funding is directed towards the provision of life-saving assistance including food support, shelter, and the provision of basic services including health, education and water and sanitation.  In 2016, we also provided &euro;7.5 million in core funding to UNICEF, the UN Agency which leads efforts, globally, to provide clean drinking water in humanitarian crises. <\/p>  <p>  The continued provision of timely humanitarian assistance to those in need in these countries is crucial, and we are currently preparing a package of assistance for the crises in South Sudan and in Somalia.

129, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  To date, the Exchequer has received nearly &euro;1.5 billion in cash arising from the State Assets Disposal Programme and the sale of the National Lottery licence,\u00a0of which &euro;350m was from Ervia in respect of the sale of Bord Gais Energy.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Under Eurostat rules, the amount of any dividends received\u00a0from\u00a0a State company, including proceeds from asset disposals, which can improve\u00a0the GGB is limited by reference to the entrepreneurial income of the relevant company in\u00a0the previous year.\u00a0 In order to comply with\u00a0the fiscal rules of the Stability and Growth Pact,\u00a0the scope for the Government to use\u00a0such dividends for additional expenditure on a GGB neutral basis is\u00a0therefore limited to the amount by which the dividends paid actually improves the GGB.\u00a0 This has meant that in order to take maximum advantage of the asset disposal proceeds, they cannot all be availed of at once but must be remitted to the Exchequer over a number of years.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  When all of the remaining proceeds from the sale of Bord Gais Energy have been received, the final total from all of these State asset disposals is expected to be about &euro;2.1 billion. <\/p>  <p>  Since the State Asset Disposal Programme was agreed by Government,\u00a0a number of significant announcements have been made of\u00a0allocations of additional funding for capital investment to be funded from the proceeds of these asset disposals.\u00a0Details of these investment programmes are on my Department's website, and further detail about individual projects and programmes is available from the relevant Ministers and their\u00a0Departments.\u00a0 However, in summary: <\/p>  <p> - In July 2012, in its\u00a0first infrastructure stimulus plan involving\u00a0a total investment of &euro;2&frac14; billion, the Government announced that\u00a0on foot of the State Assets Disposal Programme, it\u00a0would undertake further Exchequer investment including enabling works to support the PPP projects.\u00a0 Almost &euro;100m   was\u00a0made available for enabling works on the roads and education PPPs.<\/p>  <p> - In June 2013, the Government allocated &euro;150m   additional Exchequer investment to schools, energy efficiency and roads projects;<\/p>  <p> - At Budget 2014, the Government announced that along with the &euro;200m already committed to the National Children's Hospital, some &euro;200m   would be invested from the proceeds of the Lottery Licence transaction and used for a range of projects and programmes;\u00a0<\/p>  <p> - In May 2014, the Government allocated a further &euro;200m   of investment for a range of capital projects in a number of different sectors and regions across the country.\u00a0<\/p>  <p> - At Budget 2015, the Government announced\u00a0that\u00a0&euro;400m   of the proceeds to be received from\u00a0the sale of Bord Gais Energy would\u00a0be made available to support the Government's Social Housing Strategy.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p> - In 2015, the Government allocated the &euro;335m   proceeds from the sale of its shareholding in Aer Lingus to establish a Connectivity Fund, to support commercial projects that enhance connectivity both within and for the State.\u00a0The Connectivity Fund was established as a sub-Fund of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and is being managed by that Fund.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>In total, the Government has, to date, allocated over &euro;1.5 billion   from the proceeds of the State Assets Disposal Programme and the sale of the National Lottery licence to support jobs and economic development across the country.\u00a0 As indicated above, Ervia has to date paid &euro;350m of the proceeds of the Bord Gais Energy transaction to the Government by way of special dividends.\u00a0 A further special dividend of &euro;100m is expected\u00a0in 2017.\u00a0 The remainder of the proceeds will be paid to the Government on a phased basis, as required by Government and in a manner that is consistent with protecting Ervia's investment grade credit rating while also\u00a0maximising\u00a0the GGB impact of the payments.\u00a0 In relation to the Bord Gais Energy proceeds earmarked for social housing, the Deputy will be aware that in Budget 2015 the Government announced that &euro;400m\u00a0of these proceeds were to be made available to\u00a0establish an off-balance sheet financial\u00a0vehicle to\u00a0provide financing to Approved Housing Bodies, with the aim of facilitating the provision of additional housing units in support of the Government's Social Housing Strategy.\u00a0 However, despite a high level of engagement by the Department of Housing Planning, Community and Local Government with a wide range of potential providers and financiers of social housing, no new model of provision and\/or financing of social housing on an off-balance sheet basis could be identified.\u00a0 This reflects the strict requirements under Eurostat rules to qualify for off-balance sheet status.\u00a0In response to this outcome, it was decided\u00a0to commit &euro;10m per annum from the Bord Gais Energy proceeds, over a longer 20 year period, which could be used to secure the development of a pilot affordable rental scheme as envisaged in Rebuilding Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  A decision on the use to which the remainder of the Bord Gais Energy proceeds is to be put is\u00a0under consideration.\u00a0 In the meantime, pending payment of the proceeds to the Government by way of special dividend, Ervia has used the sale proceeds, on a temporary basis, to reduce debt balances, including debt associated with the assets disposed of, and to restructure its current debt facilities, resulting in cheaper finance for the Company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300045#WRM01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental

The likely outcome is closer to 6%, representing a significant shortfall in terms of reaching the 20% reduction in 2020. This reflects both Ireland's reduced investment capacity over the period of the economic downturn, as well as the fact that the target itself was misinformed and not consistent with what was achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, a key objective of the first statutory National Mitigation Plan is to try and close the gap to\u00a0Ireland's 2020\u00a0EU target. In this context, the Plan sets out the mitigating measures\u00a0currently in place and also a range of mitigating measures under consideration. It is important to note that the first National Mitigation Plan represents an initial step to set us on a pathway to achieve the level of decarbonisation required by 2050. It does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve the 2050 objective, but rather\u00a0is a work in progress reflecting the reality of where we are in our decarbonisation transition. When finalised, the Plan will become a living document, accessible on my Department's website, which is continually updated as on-going analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options. In addition, there will be the formal preparation of successive National Mitigation Plans at least once every five years as provided for in the 2015 Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act. <\/p>  <p>  In the context of the development of renewable electricity generation, the White Paper on Energy Policy, \"Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future 2015-2030\" (December 2015),\u00a0is a key policy driver in our low carbon transition and in\u00a0the development of appropriate mitigating measures to achieve that transition.<\/p>  <p>  The overarching objective of the Energy White Paper, published in December 2015, is to transition to a low carbon energy system which provides secure supplies of competitive and affordable energy to citizens and businesses. This will involve moving away from higher emissions fuel types to lower emissions fuels such as gas, or zero carbon renewable energy technologies. Public Service Obligation (PSO) support for Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s Edenderry peat-fired generation station expired in December 2015. PSO support for the ESB owned West Offaly and Lough Ree power stations will expire in 2019. The Edenderry power station is now in receipt of support for biomass co-firing via REFIT3 for up to 30% of the size of the plant. In addition, Bord na M&oacute;na has stated that it intends to cease harvesting peat for electricity generation by 2030. The company has committed to replace large-scale peat production with alternative energy sources. This will contribute to the decarbonisation of electricity generation and is in line with the Energy White Paper.<\/p>  <p>  Moneypoint generation plant contributes to Ireland&rsquo;s security of supply by diversifying the fuel mix, provides generation storage capacity and provides competitively priced electricity. However, while Moneypoint is an important element of our power generation mix, before it comes to the end of its operating life in its current configuration in 2025, the most suitable low-carbon generation technology will have to be identified as committed to in the Programme for a Partnership Government. Key decisions on the future of Moneypoint will be taken before 2020, and this is included as\u00a0mitigating option under consideration (RE8)\u00a0in the draft National Mitigation Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300052#WRT01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":517,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300052#WRT01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Transport Programme Funding","counter":516,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300052#WRT01150"},{"type":"question","counter":517,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[14611\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300052#WRT01200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the cost of increasing the rural transport programme funding by 5%.","asker":"1333","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":518,"content":"<p>\u200bI refer the Deputy to my answer of 09 March 2017 to her Question (ref no 12495\/17, Proof 200).

In its new strategy 2017 - 2020, Building Scale, Expanding Reach, EI is aiming to increase this further with a new target to create an additional 60,000 new jobs by 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy for 2017 &ndash; 2020 also aims to drive innovation in Irish enterprise to unprecedented levels through new supports to reach the target of &euro;1.25bn in R and D expenditure by its client companies per annum by 2020.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Enterprise Ireland operates a range of supports to help companies engage with third level researchers to undertake collaborative research for the benefit of companies.  Again, evidence shows that R and D active firms who collaborate with the Higher Education sector do significantly better in terms of job creation and exports than those that do not collaborate.  Through supports such as Innovation Vouchers; Innovation Partnerships, and its network of Technology Centres and Gateways, Enterprise Ireland is striving to ensure optimum industry collaboration with our Higher Education sector.  In 2016 alone, a record number of 1,036 collaborative projects were supported by EI.<\/p>  <p>  A major aspect of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s work is to extract maximum value from Ireland&rsquo;s investment in the research system &ndash; the objective is to secure commercial purpose, leading to jobs and sales by transferring technologies and ideas developed in Irish research institutions out into firms.<\/p>  <p>  EI will continue funding its critical existing innovation supports while also developing a number of new supports which include:<\/p>  <p>  -  A new programme for Business Innovation to drive innovation beyond selling products based on technical innovations providing more customer focussed process and service solutions;<\/p>  <p>  -  A Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Initiative, a mechanism which enables public sector bodies to connect with innovative ideas and technologies and aimed at providing novel solutions for specific public sector challenges and needs. <\/p>  <p>  -  New initiatives to equip graduates and researchers in the higher education system with the key skills required by the enterprise base;<\/p>  <p>  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s main objective is to encourage investment into Ireland by foreign-owned companies.\u00a0 The Agency reported a second, consecutive record year in 2016.  199,877 people are now employed in IDA Ireland supported client companies, up from 188,035 in 2015.  This is the highest level of employment in the Agency&rsquo;s history.<\/p>  <p>  The area of research, development and innovation (RDI) is of strategic importance to IDA Ireland.  A company decision to invest in RDI may be to support improvement in productivity; to develop a strengthened reputation for quality or to develop new products and services.<\/p>  <p>  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy Winning FDI 2015-2019 outlines a plan to support clients in creating 80,000 new jobs and increase employment in the client portfolio to 209,000 by 2019.  Support for RDI will be key to achieving these targets.  Research, development and innovation investments not only embed existing FDI operations and employment but pave the way for future investment, job creation and export growth.  As the global battle for FDI intensifies, our investment in research and development will become even more critical to attracting and retaining FDI companies.<\/p>  <p>  The increase in RDI investment since 2000 has improved our attractiveness as an FDI location.\u00a0 60% (just under &euro;60m in 2015) of IDA&rsquo;s total grant-aid budget is allocated to RDI projects each year.  This investment leverages RDI expenditure of &euro;600m by IDA clients for these approved projects and an overall annual spend by IDA supported companies of &euro;1.53bn per annum on RDI.  This has the effect of anchoring FDI clients and securing sustainable employment and related benefits to the Irish economy.<\/p>  <p>  The National Support System for Horizon 2020, the EU Framework Programme for research and innovation, is coordinated by Enterprise Ireland.  Horizon 2020 is part of the drive to create new growth and jobs in Europe, has a budget of almost &euro;75 billion and runs over the period 2014-2020.  Irish companies that compete successfully for funding from Horizon 2020 will boost their innovative capability and competitiveness which in turn will deliver strong national economic impacts, including job creation.<\/p>  <p>  Demand for the Framework Programme from Irish companies has been high.  In the first 33 months Ireland&rsquo;s draw down was &euro;336.6 million, placing Ireland on target to meet its goal of securing &euro;1.25bn from Horizon 2020 by 2020.  Of this funding, over &euro;104 million went to companies and &euro;73.6 million of this went to SMEs.  Ireland has the highest success rate in Europe for the Horizon 2020 SME Instrument with a 16% success rate, compared to a European average of 6%.  Innovative Irish SMEs have secured &euro;26.5 million.<\/p>  <p>  70% of the Horizon 2020 budget (&euro;52 billion) is to be allocated between 2017 and 2020, which gives Irish companies the opportunity to continue availing of these supports. <\/p>  <p>  The recent national ex-post evaluation of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7) estimated that the European Commission contribution of &euro;625M to Ireland from 2007 to 2013 would lead to an estimated 2,000 jobs created per year.  It is expected that such figures will grow considerably in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s current target to double participation in the period 2014-2020.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently analysing more recent data in relation to Horizon 2020 and will publish updated results in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300053#WRU01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Direct Investment","counter":553,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300054#WRV00200"},{"type":"question","counter":554,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[14673\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300054#WRV00300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which she and her Department continue to compete for foreign direct investment with particular reference to job relocation arising from Brexit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":555,"content":"<p>My responsibility, as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, is on ensuring that Ireland as a whole is best placed to capitalise on whatever foreign direct investment (FDI) opportunities may emerge on account of Brexit.

These plans are delivering clear results with an implementation rate of over 90% for each region.

This expansion was given significant consideration by the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Childcare which reported in July 2015. Senior officials from the Department of Education and Skills contributed to the discussions on an upper age limit for the scheme, taking a child centred approach and considering the delivery of better outcomes for all children.  As with any scheme, there must be entry and cut off points.  Prior to Budget 2016 the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme had one entry point (September) from when children could begin pre-school, and children had to be aged between 3 years and 2 months and 4 years and 7 months by the September to avail of the free pre-school year (i.e. 38 weeks).  The programme was then expanded by reducing the age of eligibility to 3 years and by increasing the number of entry points to three throughout the programme year (September, January and April).  This means that children can begin to avail of their free place on the pre-school programme as soon as possible after they reach the age of 3 and participate in the programme once they will not be older than 5 years and 6 months by the end of the programme year (i.e. end of June).  These rules for ECCE reflect evidence based policy and are necessary from an administrative and budgetary management perspective.  Regrettably, it is the nature of such rules that they benefit some more than others and it will therefore not be possible to provide an extension of ECCE in circumstances where a family may be unable to find a place for a child in their local school.<\/p><p>The Department of Education and Skills main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area. Parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.  However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  In a circumstance where a child has been refused a place by a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, a parent or guardian can choose to take an appeal under Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998  to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance.  Further information on the Section 29 appeals process is available on the Department of Education and Skills website <i>www.education.ie. <\/i><\/p><p>The Educational Welfare Service (EWS) of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is the statutory agency which can assist some parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The EWS can be contacted at 01-7718500.  The Deputy will be aware that, in legislation, the legal school starting age is 6.  Prior to a child reaching the age of 6, the Educational Welfare Services of Tusla cannot do anything in terms of representing\/advocating for parents to access school places.  However, after the age of 6, Tusla's Educational Welfare Service would engage with, advise and support parents in accessing school places, including advising on the writing of appeals, with the Educational Welfare Officers acting as advocates at appeal hearings. <i><\/i><\/p><p>I would also note to the Deputy that plans are currently in train to provide for a new national scheme of financial support for parents towards the cost of their childcare entitled the Affordable Childcare Scheme, which will replace the existing targeted childcare subsidisation schemes with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme.

While there are a number of initiatives underway, realistically it will take time for a return to previous levels of capability in the Air Corps as pilots within the system progress to become aircraft commanders and newly qualified cadets become co-pilots.    <\/p>  <p>  There are currently three Cadet classes totalling 27 personnel at various stages of the Wings Course (this is reduced from the 28 previously reported, where one person has been unable to continue their pilot training) with 7 currently undergoing flight training, and four Apprentice Technician classes totalling 41 personnel in training with 5 due to qualify this summer. <\/p>  <p>  The 2017 Cadetship competition was launched yesterday Wednesday 22 March with a planned intake of up to 12 Cadets in Quarter 3 of 2017.  The Defence Forces also plan to launch an Air Corps Trainee Military Aircraft Technician competition in early Summer this year, from which it is planned to induct up to 25 Apprentice Technicians in Autumn 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300056#WRX00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":612,"content":"<p>Question No. 223 answered with Question No. 219.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Corps","counter":613,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300056#WRX00450"},{"type":"question","counter":614,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[14713\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032300056#WRX00500","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the details of the budget for the Air Corps for each year since 2007, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":615,"content":"<p>Vote 36 Defence is managed through a single programme with all operational outputs delivered from a single set of forces encompassing the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.
