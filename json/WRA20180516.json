The commencement order for the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 was signed by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on 21 December 2011 and the Act came into force on 1 January 2012. Local Authorities are responsible for the implementation of the Act.  As previously advised to the Deputy, Revenue does not have any role to play under the Dog Breeding Establishments Act and is not involved in inspecting relevant establishments to ensure compliance with the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  As regards taxation, the profits of any dog breeding business are liable to tax irrespective of whether it is included on a register of dog breeding establishments or not.  The Deputy will be aware from my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 110 of 27 March 2018 that Revenue examined a number of dog breeding establishments as part of its 2017 compliance programme.  Revenue has confirmed that most of the businesses involved were found to be tax compliant, with enquiries still ongoing in a small number of cases.  However, taxpayer confidentiality provisions contained in section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 precludes Revenue from providing any further information in regard to the cases examined or providing any information that could identify them.  The section formalises taxpayer confidentiality and specifically prohibits unauthorised disclosure of taxpayer information. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to administering the tax and duties system, Revenue enforces a range of restrictions and product safety regimes on behalf of other State Agencies at the point of import and export.\u00a0 One such example is the work Revenue does with bodies like the Dublin Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (DSPCA) and it has achieved some notable successes as part of this joint working initiative.\u00a0 Revenue collaborated closely with DSPCA and other agencies in Operation Delphin, to disrupt the illegal cross-border trade in pups.

It allows for losses incurred in the course of business to be accounted for when calculating a business&rsquo; tax liabilities.  Loss relief for corporation tax is a long standing feature of the Irish Corporate Tax system and is a standard feature of Corporation Tax systems in all OECD countries.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 396C of the TCA 1997 previously restricted losses for NAMA participating institutions to offset losses against 50% of taxable profits in a given year.  At the time of its introduction the Government had limited involvement in the banking system.  However, by Finance Bill 2013, this measure was considered to have outlasted its initial purpose as, due to the substantial holdings that the State had by that time acquired in the banking sector (99.8% AIB and 15% of Bank of Ireland at the time), the restriction was deemed to be acting against the State&rsquo;s interests.<\/p>  <p>  Section 396C was repealed to reduce the State&rsquo;s role as a &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; provider of capital and to protect the existing value of the State&rsquo;s equity and debt investments.  With the removal of Section 396C, AIB and BOI were restored to the same position as other Irish corporates including other Irish banks which effectively levelled the playing field.<\/p>  <p>  As I have previously stated, I do not intend to change how tax losses are currently taxed for Irish banks, including those that were bailed out by the State, as I believe there could be consequences that would make it difficult for me to fulfil other objectives in respect of the Irish banking system.  <\/p>  <p>  There would be a material negative impact on the valuation of the States investments from any change in tax treatment of accumulated losses where the banks are concerned.  It is critically important to understand that the State is actually getting value today from these tax losses through our share sales. <\/p>  <p>  Despite the scale of losses accumulated the banks are contributing to the Exchequer through the financial institutions levy.  To recognise the part that the banks played in the financial crisis, in 2013, the Government decided that the banking sector should make an annual contribution of approximately &euro;150 million to the Exchequer for the period from 2014 to 2016.  In Budget 2017, the payment of this levy was extended until 2021.  It was anticipated that the bank levy could be expected to raise &euro;750 million over five years.<\/p>  <p>  At Committee Stage of Finance Act 2017, I agreed that my officials would produce a report on the effect of limiting tax reliefs on losses carried forward for banks, with the stipulation that the policy outlook I will adhere to is the maintenance of the bank levy.

They are focused on long-term holding of income-producing property as opposed to short term speculative gains.<\/p>  <p>  The function of the REIT framework is not to provide an overall tax exemption, but rather to facilitate collective investment in rental property by providing the same after-tax returns to investors as direct investment in rental property and removing a double layer of taxation at corporate and shareholder level which would otherwise apply.<\/p>  <p>  In general, trading profits of Irish companies are subject to Corporation Tax (CT) at the rate of 12.5% and rental profits are subject to CT at 25%.  In contrast, rental profits arising in a REIT are exempt from CT, provided the REIT distributes at least 85% of its property income each year, for taxation at the level of the investor.\u00a0 While most property disposals by a REIT will not give rise to Capital Gains Tax (CGT), where a REIT disposes of a newly developed property within 3 years of completion of the development, CGT will arise.\u00a0\u00a0Other profits earned by the REIT are subject to CT in the normal way.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT) at 20% is levied upon distributions by a REIT.\u00a0 An Irish resident individual can claim a credit for this DWT against his or her income tax liabilities while a non-resident investor may be able to claim a full or partial refund of DWT under a double tax agreement. Pension schemes, life assurance companies, charities or NAMA may receive distribution gross subject to the completion of valid declaration.<\/p>  <p>  As such, the estimated cost attached to the REIT relates not to an exemption from tax, but rather to the move from direct taxation of rental income to the taxation of dividends distributed from REIT profits arising from that rental income.\u00a0 The extent of any net tax cost of the REIT exemptions will therefore be the difference between the tax which would have arisen on the property income in non-REIT ownership, and the tax charged on the dividends paid out of that property income by the REIT to their investors.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Any potential\u00a0loss of tax relating to foreign investors is due to the difference between how company dividends are taxed in the hands of foreign investors compared to how profits from direct ownership of property are taxed. Ireland, in line with most countries, retains the right to tax profits arising from land and buildings in the State, regardless of where the owner is located.\u00a0 In contrast, taxing rights for dividends are usually divided between countries, based on tax treaty agreements. In general, Ireland allows for dividends of Irish companies to be paid to shareholders resident in treaty partner countries without any liability to Irish tax.\u00a0 This is because tax should already have been paid on the company's profits in Ireland the dividends are paid out of the after-tax profits of the company and the dividends received will form part of the shareholder's income for tax purposes in their country of residence.<\/p>  <p>  In the absence of any other provisions, foreign REIT shareholders would not have had any liability to Irish tax on REIT dividends, despite the fact that the REIT itself benefits from a tax exemption on qualifying profits of the rental business.\u00a0 In order to ensure that tax from foreign investors is retained, a Dividend Withholding Tax\u00a0(DWT) at the standard rate of tax (currently 20%) was legislated for to specifically apply to REIT dividends.\u00a0 Foreign investors from treaty resident countries may be able to reclaim some part of this DWT if the relevant tax treaty allows for this.\u00a0 The taxation of dividends varies from treaty to treaty, but commonly a source State would retain the right to approximately 15% tax on dividends paid from that State.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that their obligation to observe confidentiality for taxpayer information, and the small group of taxpayers involved, precludes them from providing more specific information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600075#WRA05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners Data","counter":53,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600075#WRA05100"},{"type":"question","counter":54,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[21300\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600075#WRA05200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of assessments conducted by the Revenue Commissioners investigating false self-employment; the number of investigations that found against the employer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":55,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that tackling shadow economy activity continues to be one of its key priorities. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As part of its compliance programme, Revenue works in co-operation with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) and the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to pursue employers engaged in the misclassification of employees as self-employed individuals. <\/p>  <p>  In 2017, Revenue identified 199 businesses that were not, but should have been, registered with Revenue for PAYE purposes and, following Revenue&rsquo;s intervention, those businesses were registered for PAYE purposes. \u00a0The figures for 2015 and 2016 were 112 businesses and 216 businesses respectively.<\/p>  <p>  Also during 2017, Revenue identified 1,912 individuals who were not, but should have been, registered with Revenue as employees for PAYE purposes and, following Revenue&rsquo;s intervention, they were correctly registered as employees for PAYE purposes.

My Department, along with the Department of Rural and Community Development, are responsible for fulfilling this commitment.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Local public banking is where a State, or other public body, has ownership of a financial institution.  In Germany, local public banks, called Sparkassen, are only permitted to operate in specific geographic regions.  The business model of Sparkassen is not to maximise profits, but rather promote economic development and financial inclusion in the particular regional area in which they operate.  In terms of SME finance, Sparkassen tend to build close relationships with SMEs in their locality. <\/p>  <p>  The investigation of local public banking has consisted of a consultation process engaging with stakeholders and interested parties.  This consultation process was carried out last year by the Department of Rural and Community Development, assisted by the Department of Finance.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, there has also been detailed consideration of a proposal put forward by Irish Rural Link and the Savings Banks Foundation for International Cooperation (SBFIC), the international development wing of the Sparkassen group.

In April 2014, my Department prepared and presented a report for the Finance Committee to explain figures which are quoted and attributed to Ireland on this matter. <\/p>  <p>  This technical paper, available on the Department of Finance&rsquo;s website, provides clarity on the matter and to ensure this piece of work was as objective as possible, my Department commissioned an external and independent academic to co-author the paper. Based on data from the Central Statistics Office and Revenue, the report highlighted that since 2003 the effective corporate tax rates on Net Operating Surplus and Taxable Income averaged 10.9% and 10.7% respectively. <\/p>  <p>  While these percentages are lower than the 12.5% headline rate, this can be attributed to the availability of the small number of targeted tax measures that are available in Ireland that may lower the effective rate of corporation tax paid in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s (C&amp;AG) Report Annual Report for 2016 highlighted that 79 of the top 100 companies paid an effective rate of 10% or more, and almost two-thirds paid in excess of 12%.  This supports\u00a0the previous work carried out by my Department, which demonstrated that the effective rate of corporate tax in Ireland is close to the headline rate of 12.5%.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that, of the companies which paid less than an effective rate of 10%,\u00a0in most of these cases the\u00a0relevant company was\u00a0in receipt of foreign dividends\u00a0for\u00a0which double tax relief was available for taxes incurred in other jurisdictions in respect of that income.  Therefore, when foreign taxes are factored in, the rate of tax was substantially higher.<\/p>  <p>  In a number of cases, the effective corporate tax rate\u00a0was also impacted by R&amp;D tax credit claims.  The R and D tax credit is one of the few reliefs we have which may lower the effective rate of corporate tax paid in Ireland.  Some other countries have higher headline rates, supplemented by a high number of tax reliefs, which reduce the overall tax paid. In contrast, Ireland&rsquo;s approach is transparent. We have a competitive headline rate of corporate tax applied to a broad base.  Of the small number incentives we have, these are focused on the creation of additional employment and on areas of innovation. <\/p>  <p>  Further work carried out by Revenue, has identified that the effective rate of tax paid by companies in 2015 was provisionally 9.8%, which was a marginal increase on the 2014 rate of 9.7%.  The 2012 and 2013 figures are 10.1%.  Again, while these percentages are lower than the 12.5% headline rate, this can be attributed to the small number of targeted tax measures available in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  On the basis of this extensive analysis, I am satisfied that companies in Ireland are paying the appropriate rate of corporate tax on profits generated by those companies in Ireland.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I and my officials\u00a0recognise the importance of\u00a0ensuring effective taxation of multinational companies and the need for internationally agreed solutions to counter aggressive tax planning, base erosion and profit shifting. \u00a0However, we do not believe these issues can be properly addressed by focussing on a minimum effective level of taxation only.\u00a0 A minimum effective tax would be a fundamental change to our system and would be unprecedented in comparison with other jurisdictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600076#WRB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Aid Investigations","counter":82,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600076#WRB02400"},{"type":"question","counter":83,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[21288\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600076#WRB02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the progress in respect of funds being lodged in the escrow account in respect of the state aid judgement by the European Commission (details supplied); the funds lodged to date; the likely timetable for the lodgement of additional funds to the account; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":84,"content":"<p>The Government does not accept the Commission&rsquo;s analysis in the Apple State aid Decision and has lodged an appeal in the European Courts.

The impact of excessive premiums being charged to consumers from all over the country was a feature of this engagement process with industry. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department officials regularly raise specific issues affecting consumers across the country during their ongoing engagement with Insurance Ireland, including within a sub-group formed to implement relevant consumer-focused recommendations from the Motor Report. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy has separately\u00a0met with representatives from insurance companies and other relevant stakeholders in relation to a number of issues and the problems resulting from high insurance premiums have been\u00a0discussed during these engagements. \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600076#WRB03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry Regulation","counter":95,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600076#WRB03700"},{"type":"question","counter":96,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[21387\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600076#WRB03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the timeframe to implement the report on the cost of employer and public liability insurance;

In 2013, the Central Statistics Office conducted the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), which provided the first comprehensive data on Irish household wealth. <\/p>  <p>  The net wealth Gini coefficient is a commonly used measure of inequality, where a figure of 100 indicates that one household holds all the wealth and 0 indicates that wealth is evenly divided among all households.  This measure, based on the HFCS data,\u00a0indicates that wealth inequality in Ireland (64) for 2013 is lower than the euro area average (69).  In addition, the HFCS results also\u00a0show that wealth in Ireland is less concentrated at the top of the\u00a0distribution (i.e. the top 1% of the population) than the euro area average. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Government is committed to various targets, policies and initiatives to further reduce inequality in Ireland.  Firstly, we are committed to further implementation and progress towards our inequality reduction goals within the Programme for Partnership Government, particularly\u00a0in\u00a0the context of\u00a0the\u00a0budgetary\u00a0process.  Our highly progressive income tax and well targeted welfare systems are notably successful at reducing income inequality.  In fact, the most up-to-date OECD data available show that Ireland&rsquo;s tax and welfare system creates the largest improvement in the equality of income distribution of all OECD countries for which data are available.  We are also dedicated to further advancements in the area of limiting tax avoidance, which is evident, for example, through our involvement in the OECD BEPS initiative.  Furthermore, additional policy measures such as regular reviews and\/or increases of the national minimum wage also support the goal of a more equal income distribution.<\/p>  <p>  The charging structure for the LPT is progressive.  The basic rate of 0.18 percent applies up to property values of &euro;1 m with a higher rate of 0.25 percent applying on the portion of value above the &euro;1 m threshold.  In addition to the progressive rate structure, and to the extent that better off people tend to own more valuable properties, the LPT is a progressive tax particularly over the life cycles of tax payers.<\/p>  <p>  In January I\u00a0announced a review\u00a0of the Local Property\u00a0Tax (LPT)\u00a0which is looking in particular at the impact on LPT liabilities of property price developments.

A number of these recommendations call\u00a0for the existing LPT deferral provisions should be continued and be reviewed and revised at frequent intervals in line with movements in the CPI so as to maintain their real value and that the period of relief for income-stressed owner-occupiers who have outstanding mortgages should be extended beyond the end of 2017.  In addition there is a recommendation that for owner-occupiers over 80 years of age or those with stated certified long term illnesses and disabilities who are also living alone that consideration be given to raising the eligible income limit for deferrals to &euro;20,000.<\/p>  <p>  It is expected that the review will be completed at the end of August and that the review report will provide a number of policy choices for consideration.\u00a0 The review will be informed by the desirability of achieving relative stability, both over the short and longer terms, in LPT payments of liable persons. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600076#WRB05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Programme","counter":116,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600076#WRB05800"},{"type":"question","counter":117,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[21625\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600076#WRB05900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when legislation on the rainy day fund will be published; if his Department has completed its examination on the main functions of the proposed &euro;500 million fund; the cases in which this includes a cost-benefit analysis in relation to the deferred public expenditure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":118,"content":"<p>I expect to bring my proposals for\u00a0the general scheme of a\u00a0Rainy Day Fund Bill\u00a0to\u00a0Government for decision in the coming weeks.\u00a0 Following the consideration of Government, I would expect to forward the general scheme of the Bill to the Oireachtas for its\u00a0consideration.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I would\u00a0hope to progress the Bill\u00a0quickly, but I am not yet in a position to give a detailed timeline.

Defence Forces troop contribution to the United Nations mandated, European Union led peacekeeping mission to Chad and the Central African Republic commenced on 21 February 2008.\u00a0\u00a0Initially the force was known as EUFOR TCHAD\/RCA.\u00a0 The aim of the mission was to protect civilians in danger, particularly refugees and\u00a0internally displaced persons, facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and protect UN personnel.\u00a0 It helped to create a safe and secure environment where humanitarian aid could be delivered safely and the local civilian population could go about their lives in safety.\u00a0 EUFOR TCHAD\/RCA was mandated under a UN Security Council Resolution.<\/p>  <p>  On 20 November, 2007, Government approved the despatch of a contingent of Permanent Defence Force personnel to the EUFOR TCHAD\/RCA mission.\u00a0 A resolution was also passed in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 28 November, 2007, approving participation in the mission.<\/p>  <p>  The force changed over to UN command on 15 March 2009\u00a0and became known as United Nations Mission in Chad and the Central African Republic (MINURCAT).\u00a0\u00a0On 28 October, 2008, Government approved the continued participation of the Defence Forces in this follow-on mission.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  On 30 March, 2010, in the face of significant\u00a0uncertainty regarding renewal of the mission mandate, the Government decided to withdraw the Irish contingent from MINURCAT for logistical reasons ahead of the onset of the rainy season.\u00a0 In May 2010, the United Nations Security Council decided to terminate the MINURCAT mission at the end of 2010.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In the case of EU led missions, costs are borne by the participating States on the basis of \"costs lie where they fall\".\u00a0 As such, the\u00a0costs of participation in EUFOR TCHAD\/RCA\u00a0mission was met by each of the relevant troop contributing countries including Ireland.\u00a0 Ireland also contributed to the common costs of the operation under the Athena Mechanism.\u00a0 These costs are allocated across the EU member States (except for Denmark which has an opt-out) on the basis of a GNI key.\u00a0 As MINURCAT was a UN led operation the UN reimbursed certain troop and equipment costs mainly in the form of Appropriations-in-Aid to the Exchequer.<\/p>  <p>  As published in the Departments Appropriation Accounts, the cost of participation in the EUFOR Chad mission in 2008 was &euro;39.1m, the cost of participation in EUFOR Chad and MINURCAT\u00a0in 2009 was &euro;42.3m and the cost of participation in MINURCAT in 2010 was &euro;21.2m.\u00a0 Total receipts from the UN in respect of the MINURCAT mission amounted to &euro;19.5m.\u00a0 Irelands contribution of personnel to these missions was in the region of 420 personnel per month.<\/p>  <p>  Certain equipment and assets were not brought back to Ireland following completion of our deployment in Chad as it was deemed economically unviable to do so.\u00a0 This equipment was handed over to the UN for disposal and included gymnasium equipment, kitchen equipment,\u00a0 trailers, multi-cabins,\u00a0waste tyres and oil, timber decking and plastic matting.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  There are currently 637 members of the Defence Forces serving in missions overseas.\u00a0 Individual Permanent Defence Force personnel are repatriated ahead of the scheduled rotation date from time-to time at Ireland's expense for a variety of reasons, including health grounds, family bereavement and\u00a0disciplinary issues.\u00a0\u00a0Records of overall numbers and costs of repatriation\u00a0are not held in a readily accessible format.

As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of policyholders.<\/p>  <p>  However, what was recognised with the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group was that the environment within which insurers conduct their business can be better shaped, in order to make the Irish insurance market a more competitive one and also make it more attractive for new entrants. In this regard, the initial focus of the Working Group was the issue of rising motor insurance premiums and the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  The second phase of the Cost of Insurance Working Group under the Chairmanship of the Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, Michael D&rsquo;Arcy TD, published its report in relation to employer liability and public liability insurance in January 2018.  This Report acknowledges that many of the difficulties being faced by business are also impacting community groups, including men&rsquo;s sheds.<\/p>  <p>  The Working Group&rsquo;s second Report makes 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions to be carried out.  The recommendations and actions are detailed in an action plan contained in the report with agreed timelines for implementation.  All 29 actions are scheduled to be implemented before the end of 2019, with 26 due for completion this year.  The recommendations, covering three main themes, include actions to:<\/p>  <p>  - Increase Transparency: enhance levels of transparency and improve data sharing and collection processes<\/p>  <p>  - Review the level of damages in personal injury cases: request that the Law Reform Commission undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries and<\/p>  <p>  - Improve the personal injuries litigation framework: through a number of measures, namely:<\/p>  <p>  a. ensuring potential defendants are notified in sufficient time that an incident has occurred in relation to which a claim is going to be made against their policy;<\/p>  <p>  b. tackling fraudulent or exaggerated claims; and<\/p>  <p>  c. ensuring suitable training and information supports are available to the judiciary to assist in the fair and consistent assessment and awarding of damages in personal injury cases.<\/p>  <p>  The fifth Quarterly Progress Update on implementation was published on 11 May and is available on the website of the Department of Finance.  In respect of the actions from the Report due for completion in Q1 2018, all eight deadlines have been met.    <\/p>  <p>  While the focus of the Reports was to examine the cost of insurance for motorists and for businesses in particular, it is envisaged that the cumulative effect of the implementation of the recommendations, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, will achieve the objective of delivering fairer premiums for consumers and businesses, and also beneficially impact community, voluntary and charitable organisations in Donegal and across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600077#WRC03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commencement of Legislation","counter":155,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600077#WRC04000"},{"type":"question","counter":156,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[21506\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600077#WRC04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when section 76 of the Finance Act 2015 will come into effect; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":157,"content":"<p>Sections 888 and 894 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997  impose an obligation on lessors, lessees and agents in relation to rental property to return certain information in relation to rental income to Revenue.

The second of which is if they contain added sugar, and the third criteria is if they contain 5 grams of sugar or more per 100 millilitres.  <\/p>  <p>  The rationale behind the tax is to help tackle the overweight and obesity problem in Ireland.  A small number of exemptions exist for drinks within the CN 2202 category on the basis of the policy rationale for the introduction of the tax.  These include, non-alcoholic products as they offer an alternative to alcohol products. Soya, cereal, nut, and seed based drinks offer an alternative to dairy for persons with dietary requirements such as lactose intolerance.  Further to this, products with milk fats are exempted as they are comparable to dairy products such as milk.  Milk is outside of the tax on the basis of the health benefits it offers such as calcium and protein.  For reasons of clarity an amendment to the legislation will be brought forward in this years Finance Bill to impose a calcium threshold on products within these exempt categories.  <\/p>  <p>  In order to ensure that the tax is free from State aid a formal notification of Ireland's intention to introduce the tax was submitted to the European Commission earlier this year.  The Commission found that the tax, as designed, did not constitute aid.  <\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that the yield from the sugar sweetened drinks tax will be of the order of &euro;40m in a full year.  The additional tax yield from extending the scope of the tax to the aforementioned products is likely to be very low. In any event, as the design and scope of the tax have been approved by the European Commission it is not possible to alter these without opening up the potential for litigation and consequently the potential to jeopardise the existence of the tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600077#WRC04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Charges","counter":166,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600078#WRD00200"},{"type":"question","counter":167,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[21577\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600078#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason a bank (details supplied) is charging customers a break fee significantly higher than other banks if they decide to move from a fixed rate apparently in contravention of the Mortgage Credit Directive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":168,"content":"<p>I have received the following response from AIB:<\/p><p><font color=\"#444444\">&quot; AIB adheres fully to the Mortgage Credit Regulation (MCR) and explicitly in relation to section<\/font><font color=\"#444444\">26 &ndash; Early Repayment.

This survey series, most recently conducted by Fitzpatrick Consultants and Behaviour and Attitudes on behalf of my Department, is the most comprehensive survey of SME credit demand in Ireland, covering 1,500 respondents and involving over 6,000 direct telephone calls to SMEs. SMEs of all sizes, trading in all sectors, excluding property development and speculative activities, are included.  The survey covers demand for credit from both bank and non-bank sources.<\/p><p>I would draw the Deputy's attention to the most recently published Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey, covering the period April to September 2017, which can be found at <i>www.finance.gov.ie. <\/i>The results of this survey shows that, when pending applications are excluded, 84% of credit applications to banks were approved or partially approved.  Purchases, replacement or lease of new vehicle\/equipment is now provided as the main reason for applying for bank finance with 29% stating this is why they requested bank finance.  The survey also showed continued positive trends in terms of trading performance, profitability and employment.<\/p><p>Government is focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.  In this regard the Government has developed a number of initiatives to ensure that the supply of credit in the market is sufficient to meet the existing and future funding needs of SMEs.  It should also be noted that the SBCI have reported that, as of year-end 2017, 24% of their loans (by value) were to SMEs operating in the agriculture sector. <\/p><p>In addition, to address the challenges posed to SMEs by Brexit, last year the Government announced a Brexit Loan Scheme.  This provides affordable working capital financing to SMEs and small mid-caps that can demonstrate that they are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be in the future.  The Scheme is operating from March 2018 to March 2020 and is delivered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland through commercial lenders and will serve to get much needed working capital into Irish businesses.  The Scheme has made &euro;300 million available to businesses of up to 499 employees, and will be open to both clients of State Agencies and businesses with no relationship with State Agencies. <\/p><p>All viable SMEs operating in Ireland should have the opportunity to access sufficient finance to meet their enterprise needs in a manner that supports growth and employment in the economy and the Government remains committed to the SME sector, as reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government.

Over the long run, any barrier to trade will impact on Irish growth.  In addition to the impact of Brexit, potential changes in the international tax landscape, the risk of disruption to world trade and rising geopolitical tensions all have the potential to negatively impact the economic outlook over the coming years.  <\/p>  <p>  Given these challenges we need to build upon the progress we have already made, managing our public finances in a prudent manner and maintaining competitiveness-oriented policies so that the Irish economy is in the best possible position to weather any shocks that may emerge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600078#WRD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inflation Rate","counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600078#WRD01700"},{"type":"question","counter":181,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[21677\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600078#WRD01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department has identified specific inflationary tendencies within the economy or has indicated plans to address such issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":182,"content":"<p>Inflation in Ireland has been subdued for several years.

A key element of the Central Bank&rsquo;s role is ensuring that the consumer protection regulatory framework is fit for purpose and ensures that consumers best interests are protected. <\/p>  <p>  Within the remit of the Central Bank&rsquo;s responsibilities for safeguarding stability and protecting consumers, its approach to mortgage arrears resolution is focussed on ensuring the fair treatment of borrowers.  This is realised through a strong consumer protection framework and ensuring that lenders have appropriate arrears resolution strategies and operations in place.  <\/p>  <p>  The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) forms part of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Framework.  It is a statutory Code first introduced by the Central Bank in February 2009, with the current CCMA becoming effective from 1 July 2013.   The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework, aimed specifically at the process to be followed by relevant firms, to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner.<\/p>  <p>  Banks, retail credit firms and credit servicing firms servicing loans on behalf of unregulated loan owners are all required to comply with the CCMA.  The overriding objective of the CCMA is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of consumers in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears, and that there is due regard  the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated firms to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow.  It sets out the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), a four-step process that regulated entities must follow:<\/p>  <p>  Step 1: Communicate with borrower;<\/p>  <p>  Step 2: Gather financial information;<\/p>  <p>  Step 3: Assess the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances; and<\/p>  <p>  Step 4: Propose a resolution<\/p>  <p>  Each regulated entity must consider the borrower&rsquo;s situation in the context of the solutions they provide, which may differ from firm to firm.  The CCMA does not prescribe the solution which must be offered.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the CCMA, a regulated entity may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where it has made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment arrangement (ARA) with the borrowers and other clear requirements are met or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating.  This framework requires lenders to exhaust the options available from the suite of ARAs offered before taking action which may result in the borrower losing his\/her home (whether by voluntary sale or repossession).  During the legal process, borrowers have opportunities to re-engage with lenders to find a solution.  In some circumstances, however, loss of ownership may be unavoidable.  <\/p>  <p>  In February this year, I wrote to the Governor of the Central Bank and requested that they carry out a review of the CCMA to ensure it remains as effective as possible.  I have asked that the report be completed as soon as practically possible.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy will be aware, most loan agreements include a clause that allows the original lender to sell the loan on to another firm.  The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 (&ldquo;the 2015 Act&rdquo;) was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans are sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  Under the 2015 Act, if the firm who bought loans from the original lender is an unregulated firm, then the loans must be serviced by a &lsquo;credit servicing firm&rsquo; which is regulated by the Central Bank.  Credit Servicing Firms are typically firms that manage or administer credit agreements such as mortgages or other loans on behalf of unregulated entities.<\/p>  <p>  Credit servicing firms must act in accordance with the requirements of Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;.  This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank such as the Consumer Protection Code 2012, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013, and the SME Regulations.  Contractual terms are not changed by the sale of the loan.<\/p>  <p>  Over the last number of months, there has been a lot of concern regarding loan sales, specifically in relation to PTSB.  Arising from this, Deputy Michael McGrath published a Bill on the regulation of loan owners.  This Private Member&rsquo;s Bill is complex and there are multiple issues with it which need to be resolved.  However, the Government supports the intent behind the Bill and has committed to assisting the Deputy in improving the Bill to make it more effective.  Officials in my Department have been discussing the Bill with Fianna F&aacute;il and are actively preparing amendments which will make the Bill effective and rectify technical drafting issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600078#WRD02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget Targets","counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600078#WRD03000"},{"type":"question","counter":194,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[21682\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600078#WRD03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which budgetary projections remain on target for the balance of 2018; the extent to which he expects adjustments to be required in 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":195,"content":"<p>The recently published Stability Programme Update 2018 included an update of the fiscal outlook for 2019.

The recovery in growth has been accompanied by improved credit conditions and a rise in lending. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of credit is an important driver of economic growth as credit is used to fund consumption and investment, while it is also a key transmission channel for monetary policy.  In the euro area, lending growth turned positive in 2015 after contracting during the crisis, and has strengthened consistently since then. Loans to the euro area private sector rose by 3 percent on an annual basis in March 2018, reflecting continued increases in lending to both households and non-financial corporations (NFCs).  In March, the growth rate of loans to households rose from 2.9 percent to 3.0 percent, while NFC loan growth rose from 3.2 percent to 3.3 percent. <\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, credit has been slower to pick up following the crisis, however loans to the private sector have seen positive growth since November 2017.  While this was initially driven by positive growth in lending to households, lending to NFCs also began to grow in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  There has been a moderation in European growth in the first quarter of 2017.  Flash estimates showed quarterly GDP growth in the euro area slowed to 0.4 percent, from 0.7 percent in Q4 2017.  While a moderation has yet to bear out in lending data, this highlights the need for continued monitoring of developments in the European economy and the factors driving growth, including lending conditions, consumption and investment.  An appropriate balance of fiscal, monetary and structural reform policies is necessary to ensure sustainable growth is maintained. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600078#WRD04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":209,"content":"<p>Question No. 86 answered with Question No. 82.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Data","counter":210,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600078#WRD04700"},{"type":"question","counter":211,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[21688\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600078#WRD04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the way in which Ireland's economic performance compares with other EU countries in the eurozone or outside; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":212,"content":"<p>According to EUROSTAT, the statistical office of the European Union, Ireland was the fastest growing economy in the EU in 2017.

Any change to that principle would alter fundamentally the conduct of industrial relations that has served us very well.<\/p>  <p>  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 introduced a provision to provide access to the industrial relations bodies in respect of former employees on an individual basis.  This was facilitated by an amendment to Section 23 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 which extended the scope of the definition of \"worker\" to include workers who have ceased employment. <\/p>  <p>  The question of providing access to the State's industrial relations bodies by groups of pensioners was also considered in the context of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015.  However, it was considered that it was more appropriate that collective concerns relating to pensions should more appropriately be addressed under pensions legislation. <\/p>  <p>  It is the case that active members of pension schemes can and do regularly engage with employers in an attempt to reach an agreed position as regards changes in pension schemes.  This may come about as a result of a crisis in the scheme or otherwise. The outcome of that engagement can only be a collective agreement which cannot, in and of itself, alter the pension schemes concerned.  Proposed changes to schemes are given effect via the mechanisms set out in pension trust deeds and rules of schemes and are at the discretion of the parties designated in the rules\/deeds of schemes.  It is considered that it is within this framework that a collective approach would be most effective.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of changes to pension schemes generally, the Trustees of a particular pension scheme are required by law to act in the best interests of all the members, be they active, deferred or pensioner members. <\/p>  <p>  Responsibility for pensions legislation rests with my colleague, Regina Doherty TD, Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and I understand that Section 50 of the Pensions Act 1990 was revised in 2015 to provide for the recognition by trustees and the Pensions Authority of groups representing the interests of retired and deferred scheme members of a particular pension scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600081#WRG01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1272"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":346,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600081#WRG01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Reviews","counter":345,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600081#WRG01100"},{"type":"question","counter":346,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[21499\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600081#WRG01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a medical card review will be finalised in respect of a person (details supplied) that has provided documentary evidence from the Revenue Commissioners that they are tax compliant and correspondence from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection confirming their low income; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1274","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":347,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600081#WRG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Administration","counter":348,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600081#WRG01400"},{"type":"question","counter":349,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[21503\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600081#WRG01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an appointment for surgery for a person (details supplied) will be expedited.","asker":"1250","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":350,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

One of those recommendations is to examine the evidence regarding the outcomes of the use of Nicotine Replacement Therapy ('NRT') and other approaches.  <\/p><p>My Department requested HIQA to undertake a Health Technology Assessment ('HTA') of the clinical and cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical smoking cessation products and services.  The HTA was published in 2017 and found that all the pharmacological interventions were effective compared to no treatment and that a prescription only drug called varenicline was the most effective drug on its own. However, the HTA also found that using a combination of varenicline and NRT was the most effective pharmacological intervention and that people using this combination were over three and a half times more likely to quit than those who were in a control group and did not receive this treatment. <\/p><p>Group behavioural therapy, individual counselling, intensive advice and telephone support were all found to be effective behavioural interventions with group therapy found to be the most effective of these interventions.  The addition of a behavioural intervention to a pharmacological intervention improved the effectiveness of the intervention.<\/p><p>The HTA recommended that smoking cessation services should seek to increase the uptake of varenicline, either alone or in combination with NRT, for smokers who want to use a pharmacological support. <\/p><p>In relation to e-cigarettes and vaping, although the HTA found that results for e-cigarettes are promising, there is currently a lack of evidence to recommend their use as a smoking cessation aid and at present no e-cigarette product is licensed as a medicinal product in Ireland.  The safety of e-cigarettes is an evolving area of research; while potentially safer than smoking, evidence on its long-term safety has yet to be established.  In the absence of additional evidence confirming the effectiveness of e-cigarettes, the HTA recommended that the HSE smoking cessation services should seek to increase the uptake of combination NRT treatment among those for whom varenicline is contraindicated, not tolerated or not preferred.  <\/p><p>The results of the HTA are informing the development by the HSE, in conjunction with the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee, of national clinical guidelines. <\/p><p>Current evidence-based means of quitting include behavioural support and pharmacotherapies.  The HSE provides and promotes these safe and evidence-based services, supports and aids to help people to quit.

The workforce plan will be a key part of dealing with a rise in referrals due to mandatory reporting, and in helping to reduce unallocated cases. <\/p>  <p>  I believe that the level of Exchequer funding of over &euro;753m in 2018 provides Tusla with resources to significantly increase its capacity to respond to areas of identified risk and anticipated demand. <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of mandated reporting will no doubt bring challenges, but the resources to help Tusla deal with these challenges are in place.  Tusla can, I believe, progress a number of key service developments which will ensure better outcomes for vulnerable children, and families, who need our services and support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600084#WRK01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Affordable Childcare Scheme Implementation","counter":516,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600084#WRK01100"},{"type":"question","counter":517,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[21592\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600084#WRK01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the status of the implementation of the affordable childcare scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":518,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I would be delighted to update her on positive progress my department is making in developing the new Affordable Childcare Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department, along with colleagues in Pobal, have been working hard to develop the legal, technical and administrative infrastructure for the new Affordable Childcare Scheme.  This scheme will provide financial support for parents, establish a sustainable platform for investment in the childcare sector for decades to come and- crucially- allow us to continue to invest in giving our children the best start in life.<\/p>  <p>  As you know, the Childcare Support Bill passed all stages in the D&aacute;il in the first quarter of this year.  I was delighted with the positive, cross party support it received and want to thank everyone for their valuable input.  The Bill has now completed Committee Stage in the Seanad and will commence Report Stage this Thursday (17\/05) so we are hopeful that this stage will be completed over the coming weeks. <\/p>  <p>  Intensive work is also ongoing on the drafting of supporting regulations for the scheme and on regulations to provide, for the first time, for the registration of school-age childcare providers.  The latter regulations will ensure that all school-age childcare services are registered with Tusla prior to the introduction of the Affordable Childcare Scheme and can participate in the scheme from the outset.   <\/p>  <p>  The IT infrastructure that supports the scheme is making good progress.  In January I published a Request for Tenders for the development of a new IT system and an evaluation of tenders received is currently coming to a conclusion.  As stated before, the introduction of the scheme is dependent on this new IT system.  As such, as soon as a contract is awarded to a successful bidder and a timeframe agreed for the completion of the system, I hope to be in a position to confirm and communicate an official launch date for the Affordable Childcare Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Work is also progressing well on the administrative and communication elements of the scheme.  Specialist expertise has been procured to support the detailed development of a robust governance framework for the scheme.  A high-level Communications and Engagement Strategy was published in February and a training needs analysis is underway at present. Both of these provide the starting point for significant work in preparing timely and user-friendly information, resources and supports for parents, providers and other stakeholders.  <\/p>  <p>  In tandem with the development of these resources, I am also committed to ongoing consultation and engagement with all stakeholders in the run-up to the introduction of the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The Affordable Childcare Scheme is ambitious in scale and complex in its design but I am delighted that we are achieving our milestones in its development and confident of the lasting impact it will have once launched. This is a system which will underpin the technical and legal infrastructure of childcare for many years to come. <\/p>  <p>  In order to fast-track some of the benefits of the new scheme, last September I introduced a series of measures to make childcare more affordable for Irish families. I am delighted to report that take up of these measures has exceeded all of our targets.  The new universal subsidy, worth up to &euro;1,040 per year for children under three in registered childcare is now benefitting the families of more than 36,000 children, while almost 40,000  children that will benefit most from enhanced supports are receiving up to &euro;145 per week towards the cost of their childcare. <\/p>  <p>  I have confirmed that these supports will remain in place until the Affordable Childcare Scheme goes live.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600084#WRK01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Family Resource Centres","counter":519,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600084#WRK01400"},{"type":"question","counter":520,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[21593\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051600084#WRK01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of family resource centres; and her plans to roll out more centres.","asker":"1257","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":521,"content":"<p>Family support is an important priority for me, and the increased level of funding for Family Resource Centres in 2018 reflects this. <\/p><p>Family Resource Centres are front-line services rooted in the communities they serve.

In support of this I have provided for a significant increase in Tusla&rsquo;s funding allocation with an increase of &euro;40.6m in 2018 and a total increase of &euro;144m since its establishment in 2014.  Given this level of funding, Tusla expects to increase its total workforce by approximately 422 in 2018 resulting in a total workforce of 4118 whole time equivalents (WTE) by the end of the year. <\/p>  <p>  Given the current limited availability of social work graduates, Tusla expects at least 45 of these staff to be additional social workers.  There will also be proactive recruitment of grades such as social care and clerical administration staff to support social workers to ensure that they can focus on their core tasks. <\/p>  <p>  To support Tusla&rsquo;s ambitious recruitment targets it launched its 2018 graduate recruitment campaign last September.  This campaign is currently open for applications with interviews expected to commence in May\/June 2018.  The campaign included Northern Ireland and Scotland.

The 2018 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes of &euro;2.17 billion.<\/p>  <p>  In line with other EU and OECD jurisdictions where such measures feature, reduced rates for younger jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients were first introduced in 2009 and extended to those under 26 in Budget 2014.  Lower weekly rates for younger jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients were introduced to protect young people from welfare dependency by providing them with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  Where a young jobseeker participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;198 which is the maximum personal rate for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  <\/p>  <p>  The reduced rates of jobseekers allowance do not apply to 18 -25 year olds with a qualified child, those making a claim for jobseekers allowance where that claim is linked to a jobseekers allowance claim made within the previous 12 months to which the maximum personal rate applied, those transferring directly from jobseekers allowance from disability allowance.  The reduced rates also do not apply to 18-24 year olds who were in the care of the Child and Family Agency (TUSLA) during the period of 12 months before they reached the age of 18. <\/p>  <p>  The total cost of expenditure required in a full financial year to restore people under 26 years of age on the reduced rate of jobseekers allowance to the full weekly rate of &euro;198 would be approximately &euro;94 million. The total personal rate cost of increasing the jobseekers allowance payment for 25 year olds i.e. people under 26 years of age on the &euro;152.80 weekly rate to &euro;170.40 per week would be approximately &euro;2.5 million.  The total personal rate cost of increasing the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment for 18-24 year olds i.e. people under 26 years of age on the &euro;107.70 weekly rate to &euro;150.35 per week would be approximately &euro;39 million.
