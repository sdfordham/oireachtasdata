This relocation interim legal agreement provides for the payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum, while these applicants are awaiting relocation to non-designated bogs.<\/p><p>- The third is a relocation final legal agreement. This agreement has been issued to qualifying turf cutters where a site has been assessed as suitable for relocation and is ready, or can be made ready, for use for domestic turf cutting. <\/p><p>Turf cutters who sign and return the applicable legal agreement to my Department will also receive a once-off incentive payment of &euro;500. <\/p><p>  The interim legal agreement is required in the case of relocation sites because, for the majority of raised bog special areas of conservation, the relocation site and the terms and conditions applicable to those sites will take time to finalise. Turf cutters are being asked to sign the interim agreement on the understanding that when a relocation site is sourced, assessed and agreed, they will be asked to sign a final legal agreement at that time. If it is not possible to find a suitable relocation site - for example, for reasons of quality or quantity of turf, planning requirements, or issues in relation to the purchase or lease of a site - my Department will consult with turf cutters as to the best option to take at that time.  <\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the legal agreements as set out above are appropriate to the circumstances in these cases.<\/p><p>  It is the aim of my Department to secure a relocation site for every person who has applied for one and progress is being made in that task. However, relocation is a complex process that does take some time to deliver. The agreements being issued reflect this reality.

There are over 14,000 registered boat owners on the seven waterways managed by Waterways Ireland. These seven waterways make a vital contribution to tourism, attracting visitors from around Ireland and from abroad.  <\/p><p>  The proposed bye-laws are intended to support the investment already made by Waterways Ireland in new infrastructure and facilities along the canals. That investment has made the waterways more attractive for boat owners and is helping to develop them as a vibrant recreational and tourist amenity. Given that background, it is now necessary to update the bye-laws to ensure that the rules governing use of the waterways are fit for purpose and best meet the needs of all waterway users. <\/p><p>  The proposed new bye-laws provide for the management of house boats, defined as a boat on the canals which is being used as the sole or principal residence of the owner or an occupant with the owner&rsquo;s permission, as well as for extended moorings and residential moorings. An Annual Houseboat Mooring Permit will be required for a houseboat not navigating or continuously cruising the canals.  The permit will allow the use of a mooring identified by Waterways Ireland on the canals where the houseboat may moor for more than five days and up to one year. It is not possible to give an accurate estimate of the total number of boat owners who will be required to take out an Annual Houseboat Mooring Permit in the event of the draft bye-laws coming into force. However, I am advised that Waterways Ireland issued 276 Combined Mooring and Passage permits in 2013 for boats to navigate on the Grand and Royal Canals. In addition, 151 Extended Mooring Permits have been issued to boat owners wishing to occupy dedicated berths on these navigations. <\/p><p>  The proposed bye-laws will also modernise the charging regime. There will also be further provision for the care, management, maintenance and control and the regulation of the use of the canals, moorings on the canals, and their use by the public for recreation and navigation purposes.<\/p><p>  The proposed new bye-laws will be introduced only after the completion of an open public consultation process, which is currently underway. The Canals Act 1986, as amended, stipulates a 21-day consultation period, which, in the present instance, ends at 3pm on 3 February 2014.  This public consultation process provides stakeholders, including boat residents and anyone who may have any concerns, with an opportunity to submit their views, opinions and written objections on the draft bye&ndash;laws to Waterways Ireland.  <\/p><p>  I am informed by Waterways Ireland that the main stakeholders, which include the Inland Waterway Association of Ireland, the Heritage Boat Association, the Royal Canal Amenity Group and the Irish Boat Rental Association, have been contacted individually and invited to meet with the Chief Executive and the senior management team of Waterways Ireland prior to submitting their consultation responses. This will afford these groups an opportunity to express their views, opinions and any concerns they may have regarding the proposed bye-laws.

The arts sector continues to offer vital opportunities for the provision of important cultural, social and employment benefits to communities throughout the country.  <\/p><p>  In terms of financial impact from the wider arts sector, the total direct and indirect tax revenue earned by the Exchequer in 2011 was estimated to be some &euro;336 million.

In terms of its contribution to national income, Ireland's historic environment is estimated to account for some &euro;1.5 billion annually to the nation's Gross Value Added, with a contribution to the national economy estimated to be equivalent to 1% of total Irish GVA, and some 2% of overall employment.

For the year 2014, the liability date is 1 November.\u00a0 I would draw the Deputies attention to the fact that the 1 November liability date has been raised and responded to on several occasions in the House previously and, as far back as 27 March last year, in a reply to Question No. 110, I specifically addressed the fact that where a liable person sells their residential property between 2 November 2013 and 31 December 2013, provided that they owned the property on 1 November 2013, they will be liable to pay LPT on that property for 2014.\u00a0 Furthermore, the LPT liability crystallises on the sale of a residential property and must be paid in full either in advance of the sale or must be deducted from the proceeds of the sale. This includes any LPT that has been deferred by the liable person. This is in accordance with section 126 of the Act.For a tax such as LPT to function properly, legislation must specify a liability date for the tax to have application for a particular year. Whatever date is prescribed, the question of liability when there is a change of ownership has to be managed, and I expect the LPT liability is likely to be factored in during negotiations between the parties on the sale price and the closing date of a particular contract. <\/p><p>  In relation to the assertion that there is an anomaly created when a property is sold between 2 November 2013 and 31 December 2013, an individual selling a property will often be purchasing another property at around the same time. While a vendor who owns a property on 1 November 2013 is liable for the 2014 LPT on that property, if s\/he does not purchase another property before 1 November 2013 s\/he will not be liable for the 2014 LPT on that &quot;replacement&quot; property - whoever is the owner as of 1 November 2013 will be liable.As there are a number of LPT issues to be considered when buying or selling a house, I am advised that detailed guidance on LPT issues arising in the context of the sale or transfer of a residential property was prepared by the Revenue Commissioners in consultation with the Law Society and is available since last August on the Revenue website at    and on the Law Society's website.The liability date for 2014 of 1 November 2013 is in the LPT legislation and I have no plans to change it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900067#WRC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":78,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900067#WRC00350"},{"type":"question","counter":79,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[4397\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900067#WRC00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider the merits of the proposal (details supplied) regarding single parent tax credit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"990","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":80,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the One-Parent Family Tax Credit (OPFTC) is being replaced with a new Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit from 1 January 2014.\u00a0\u00a0 The restructured credit will be of the same value i.e. &euro;1,650 per annum as the one-parent family tax credit and it will also carry the same entitlement to the additional &euro;4,000 extended standard rate band, which increases it to &euro;36,800 per annum, before liability to the higher rate of income tax arises.\u00a0 However, the credit will be more targeted, in that it will in the first instance, only be available to the principal carer of the child.\u00a0  Given the difficult fiscal environment, it is essential to review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and if necessary re-focused in order that they can achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them.\u00a0 A system that allows multiple claims in respect of the same child or children is unsustainable.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  The new credit is designed to be an activation measure, which was the original intention behind the OPFTC.\u00a0\u00a0 It is designed to be an in-work benefit to support the primary carer to take up, or remain in, employment.

The restructuring of the credit will achieve such an outcome.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  As regards the potential of this change to interfere with the level of maintenance payments, if such reasoning were to be applied, then any general tax increase, as a result of an adjustment in tax credits, rates or bands could lead to similar situations.\u00a0 Ultimately, maintenance payments are a matter for parents and if necessary, the courts to decide. It is not possible, and indeed would not be appropriate, for the tax code to take account of every possible variable. However, as a result of the amendment which I brought at Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, a primary carer can relinquish the credit such that a non-primary carer can claim it. This could be done on alternate years, should the relevant individuals agree. In such manner, both carers would have the benefit of the credit and additional standard rate band but only on alternate years. This goes some way towards achieving the result that your proposal advocates.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900067#WRC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Debt","counter":81,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900067#WRC00550"},{"type":"question","counter":82,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[4410\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900067#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the action he will take where certain banks are refusing to engage with persons in respect of mortgage arrears and threatening repossessions; if his attention has been drawn to the deep concern being created in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":83,"content":"<p>The Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) sets out requirements for mortgage lenders dealing with borrowers facing or already\u00a0in arrears on a mortgage which is secured on a primary home.

It is not possible to estimate\u00a0by how much a particular individual will be\u00a0affected by this measure\u00a0as tax relief\u00a0on premiums\u00a0is only\u00a0one factor that could influence the\u00a0pricing\u00a0of premiums by insurance companies.\u00a0Any change\u00a0in the net amount payable for a premium\u00a0could be caused by\u00a0general\u00a0increases in the price of the plan and\/or\u00a0changes in the medical procedures or hospitals covered\u00a0and\/or the\u00a0imposition of the new ceilings for tax relief.<\/p><p>  It is important to point out that the Government fully supports the elderly in retaining access to medical insurance via community rating of insurance premiums.\u00a0 Community rating, in principle, provides that everybody is charged the same premium for a particular health insurance plan, irrespective of age, gender and the current or likely future state of their health.\u00a0 Community rating therefore means that the level of risk that a particular consumer poses to an insurer does not directly affect the premium paid.\u00a0 It also means that premiums for younger or healthier lives are typically higher than their expected claims would require, whereas for older or less healthy lives, premiums are typically lower than the expected claims would require. Older people who have been paying health insurance premiums for many years will have contributed to intergenerational solidarity when they were younger and could reasonably expect to benefit from it now. The support system that enables community rating involves the charging of a levy on the policies of younger individuals to contribute to a fund that enables\u00a0risk equalisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900068#WRD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Euro Payments Area","counter":103,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900068#WRD00550"},{"type":"question","counter":104,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[4555\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900068#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is concerned that reports that the implementation of the single euro payments area regulation may result in delays to the payment of salaries and welfare entitlements; if he had discussed with financial institutions how such delays can be minimised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

These Guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated.  The aim of the Guidelines is to help as many schools as possible to start such book rental programmes.  A special &quot;Guide for Parents&quot; was also published, to inform them of how the schemes operate and how parents can help schools to establish and run them.  I have been very clear in my support for book rental schemes.  All of us who are parents know how expensive textbooks can be and what a burden it places on already hard pressed families at the start of every school year.  The Department will continue to provide a book grant as usual to all primary schools.  This grant, can be utilised for the purposes of updating or expanding a school's existing book rental scheme.<\/p><p>  I want to commend all schools that have used it to help build up book rental schemes over the years.  Their efforts mean that the high costs of school books is being significantly reduced for parents.  At my request, the National Parents' Council surveyed the views of their members in relation to currently operating book rental schemes.  Parents have reported that where book rental schemes operate, they are open to all parents in 95% of cases, and that the cost per child is under &euro;40 per year in a considerable majority of schools.  Perhaps most tellingly, the survey has found that 93% of parents believe that book rental schemes help with the costs of educating a child.  Ensuring that book rental schemes are available to all parents must therefore clearly be our aim.<\/p><p>  I understand that it feels unfair to those schools who have invested time and money to establish such schemes, that they now cannot benefit from the additional funding which was secured as part of the Budget.  Of course it is unfair, but equally, the status quo was deeply unfair on many parents.  The parents who had no access whatsoever to book rental schemes needed more support.  With the limited funding available, I believe that targeting this funding - to make sure that every parent in Ireland has access to some level of a book rental scheme - was the greatest good that could be achieved.  The Department is contacting primary schools that do not currently operate a book rental scheme to advise them of the application process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900069#WRE00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Staff Remuneration","counter":126,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900069#WRE00550"},{"type":"question","counter":127,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[4461\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900069#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the current salary of the director of the Teaching Council.

In an effort to help ease cash flow difficulties for Irish small businesses operating under the current economic environment, while at the same time, setting an example for businesses in the private sector to improve their payment record by paying each other more promptly, Ireland has introduced, on a voluntary basis:<blockquote>  A 15 days prompt payment requirement for all central Government Departments to pay their business suppliers within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice. This arrangement applies to all valid invoices received on or after 15 June 2009;<br \/><br \/>  A similar arrangement has now being extended beyond central Government Departments to our State Agency Sector to include the Health Service Executive, the Local Authorities, State Agencies, and all other Public Sector Bodies, (with the exception of the Commercial Semi-State bodies). These new arrangements apply in respect of valid invoices received on or after 01 July 2011.<\/blockquote>  The Late Payment Directive that established EU law in the area of prompt payments was originally introduced in 2000 and was recast in 2011 to modernise the law in this area.  The Recast Directive (2011\/7\/EU) came into effect across the EU on 16 March 2013.  The issue of prompt payment is now covered in Irish law by the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 580 of 2012).<\/p><p>  This legislation will act as a deterrent to late payment and as a driver for payment on time by establishing a clear expectation in law that payment will be made according to agreed terms. It lays down the specific deadlines for the payment of invoices and establishes a right to compensation in the event of late payment in all commercial transactions, whether they relate to transactions between private or public undertakings, or between undertakings and public authorities.<\/p><p>  The Regulations specifically provide that Public Authorities must pay for goods and services that they procure within 30 days.  Payment can be extended up to 60 days only it if is &ldquo;expressly agreed&rdquo; and justified in light of the nature or feature of the contract.<\/p><p>  For business to business transactions, where no contract exists, the payment period is set at 30 days.  Where a contract stipulating the payment period does exist, normally such a period should not exceed 60 calendar days unless both parties agree otherwise and providing it is not &ldquo;grossly unfair&rdquo; to the creditor.  For small businesses in particular, this contractual freedom to agree payments terms is vital as it provides protection when negotiating payments terms with larger companies. <\/p><p>  Any harmonisation of payment periods for business to business transactions could lead to a loss of flexibility and contractual freedom by removing the ability of companies, especially SMEs, to compete with payment periods offered to customers. This in turn could put more pressure on other aspects of contract negotiation where larger companies can still exercise significant influence over small companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900072#WRH00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Disputes","counter":194,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900072#WRH00950"},{"type":"question","counter":195,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[4421\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900072#WRH01000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if there is any relevant national collective agreement in place which is a legally binding collective agreement between the Technical Engineering and Electrical Union, TEEU, and any other party including local authorities and the health service for public works contracts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

That Article provides, in effect, that the exclusive power to make laws is vested in the Oireachtas. The Supreme Court took the view that Registered Employment Agreements (REAs) are instruments having the status of laws made by private individuals. While the Constitution allows for the limited delegation of law making functions, the provisions of the 1946 Act went beyond what is permissible under the Constitution.<\/p><p>  The effect of this decision is to invalidate the registration of employment agreements previously registered under Part III of the 1946 Act, including the REA for the Electrical Contracting Sector, to which the TEEU was a party. In consequence the Labour Court no longer has jurisdiction to enforce, interpret or otherwise apply these agreements.  As a result, all such agreements no longer have any application beyond the subscribing parties and are not enforceable in law.  However, existing contractual rights of workers in sectors previously covered by REAs are unaffected by the ruling. Contractual rights can be altered only by agreement between the parties involved.<\/p><p>  The Supreme Court judgment is clearly an important issue for many employers and their employees, particularly in relation to rates of pay and tendering for contracts.

The draft National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan explores the possibility of using the limited flexibility within the terms of the Habitats Directive for continued turf-cutting on a small number of raised bog SACs where relocation possibilities are shown not to exist.

This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and <\/p><p>- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. <\/p><p>  The ESB Electronic Communications Bill, which I introduced last week, is a further step in promoting investment in competitively priced high speed broadband. The Bill will, when enacted, enable the ESB to utilise its electricity distribution network to provide telecommunications services in the Irish market. Formal proposals are awaited in relation to the project currently being considered by the ESB and I cannot therefore comment on implementation timescales and specific areas that will be covered. This initiative is however very much in the spirit of the National Broadband Plan which recognising the role of commercial State companies in providing telecommunications infrastructure and services and the role that State assets can play generally in accelerating the roll out of high speed broadband. <\/p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.

All relevant matters, including issues related to pricing, will be considered as the process of the detailed design of the intervention develops. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.<\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900078#WRO00500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electricity Transmission Network","counter":300,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900078#WRO00550"},{"type":"question","counter":301,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[51465\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900078#WRO00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the likely impact of the proposed EirGrid Gridlink pylon project on Ireland's heritage and wildlife; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":302,"content":"<p>EirGrid&rsquo;s Grid25 Programme is a Government endorsed strategy to develop the transmission network to ensure nationwide safe, secure and affordable electricity supply supporting economic growth, renewable and sustainable energy.

In summary terms, it can be said that the arrangements being put in place for the control of building activity may result in   additional design, certification and, possibly, insurance costs which must ultimately be borne by the building owner\/contracting authority. Such additional costs would be justified by the enhanced quality and standard of design and construction of the building project concerned in light of several notable instances of non-compliant buildings which failed to meet minimum building standards.

In addition, Departmental costs which included the staffing of the Water Sector reform Project Management Office in my Department, amounted to some &euro;1.3m in 2013.   <\/p><p>  The balance of the costs incurred in 2013 includes &euro;0.76m paid to the Commission for Energy Regulation in respect of their expanded functions in becoming the independent economic regulator for the public water sector and &euro;55,000 paid to the Economic &amp;amp; Social Research Institute in respect of providing research and advice on affordability issues associated with the introduction of domestic water charges.   <\/p><p>  It is estimated that some &euro;2m will be spent on my Department&rsquo;s programme management and the Transition Office during 2014. It is also expected that some &euro;5m will be re-couped to local authorities in connection with road-opening licence work associated with the national domestic metering programme.  In 2014, Irish Water, which now has statutory responsibility for water services, will receive &euro;240m in   equity from the Minister for Finance and some &euro;490m from the Local Government Fund but no other funding from the Department&rsquo;s Vote for establishment or other costs. Irish Water is currently preparing a Capital Investment Plan for 2014 &ndash; 2016 that will provide for the transition of projects previously included in my Department&rsquo;s 2010 - 2013 Water Services Investment Programme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900079#WRP01000","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Funding","counter":326,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900079#WRP01050"},{"type":"question","counter":327,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[4384\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900079#WRP01100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if his Department gave consent for the expenditure of &euro;12 million on a district heating scheme in the Dublin 4 area associated with the Poolbeg incinerator; the amount his Department provided for same; the person who signed off on the expenditure; if external consultants were commissioned for this work; and if he will provide a copy of all documents in his Department related to this specific project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In 2013, 19 applications were lodged in the Examiners Office, of which 17 were adjudicated bankrupt and 2 cases were adjourned to 2014.  In 2014, 17 applications had been lodged in the Examiners Office as at 27 January 2014, of which 6 cases are listed before the Courts.  The Courts Service has indicated the remaining cases are expected to be listed before the High Court during February 2014.<\/p><p>  It is not possible to provide the average cost of engaging a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) because the ISI has no regulatory power over the level of fees that a PIP may charge.

In all cases fees, costs and outlays must be in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 15 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 (Authorisation and Supervision of Personal Insolvency Practitioners) Regulations (S.I.

The PIP must at the outset of the Debt Settlement Arrangement or Personal Insolvency Arrangement process provide the person in writing with details of the fee arrangements and likely costs involved in entering into an arrangement before appointment.

These State services link closely with RIA in terms of needs assessments, case conferences and follow-up services.<\/p><p>  As regards education, children of asylum seekers are linked to local mainstream primary and post-primary schools as well as ECCE pre-school placements in a like manner to the general population and the role of the accommodation centre manager is central to this process.<\/p><p>  Children of asylum seekers can also access recreational facilities available in the locality in which they are living.  Some Direct Provision Centres have on-site playgrounds.  Many individual centres will provide other facilities and will also facilitate NGO&rsquo;s who organise outings and other activities.  Homework clubs are also provided at certain family centres.  Details of the on-site and local services available to children and families across the direct provision system are set out in the RIA's Annual Report for 2012 which can be found on the agency's website at www.rie.gov.ie.<\/p><p>  RIA also has a Child Protection Policy based on the HSE's &quot;Children First - National Guidelines for the protection and welfare of children&quot;.  A Child and Family Services unit in RIA is well established and its role is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all persons residing in RIA accommodation centres and to act as a conduit between RIA and the HSE.  In conjunction with the HSE, RIA is currently updating its existing Child Protection Policy, in line with the recent revisions to &quot;Children First&quot;.  RIA is currently liaising with the HSE regarding the re-training of the Designated Liaison Officers.  The HSE hopes to be in a position to facilitate this training shortly.<\/p><p>  All staff of centres under contract to RIA are Garda vetted. It is an important aspect of RIA's Child Protection policy which has, as its principal aim, the minimisation of risk to children and vulnerable adults residing in Direct Provision centres.  In keeping with this policy, children must be supervised by adults at all times.  They are not permitted to be left alone overnight.  In addition, children cannot be accommodated in a room separate from their parents save through interconnecting rooms. <\/p><p>  Management of accommodation centres are obliged to ensure that all staff working in the centre are aware of, and adhere to, RIA's Child Protection Policy. In addition, the HSE have provided 'Keeping Safe' child protection training to designated officers, and other staff members, in accommodation centres.<\/p><p>  RIA is also currently finalising, in consultation with Cosc and NGOs, a policy on &quot;Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence and Harassment&quot; to provide guidance and contact information for staff and residents at Direct Provision centres.<\/p><p>  The system of Direct Provision allows for a level of non-intrusive supervision of residents which would not be found in general alternative living arrangements in the community.  Centre staff, designated liaison officers and management are always available to assist.  Public Health Nurses, General Practitioners, Community and Ethnic Liaison Garda&iacute; and others linked in with an accommodation centre are alert to child welfare issues.  They also provide support for families within the Direct Provision System.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900082#WRS01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Applications","counter":389,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900082#WRS01050"},{"type":"question","counter":390,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[4489\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900082#WRS01100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if an application for naturalisation will be expedited in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 15; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It is therefore vital that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.<b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b> All applications are processed with a view to establishing whether the applicants meet the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation, such as good character and lawful residence, and are submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.  In some instances that can be established relatively quickly and in other cases completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.<\/p><p>  When I came into office in March 2011 one of my immediate priorities was to address the unconscionably large backlog of applications for naturalisation awaiting decision that had built up over several years.  At that time there were approximately 22,000 applications awaiting decision, many of which had been waiting for three years or longer.<\/p><p>  Since then I have decided on some 68,000 applications, notwithstanding a significant increase of almost 60% in the volume of valid applications received - from 12,500 in 2010 to nearly 20,000 in 2013.  In the past year I have decided over 30,000 applications and issued certificates of naturalisation to some 28,000 applicants.  Quite clearly, this has also resulted in a huge reduction in processing times, with over 70% of standard applications now being decided within six months.  I think the Deputy will agree that this represents a major turnaround, especially given the 115% increase in valid application levels since 2008, when processing times were more than four times longer.  It is my intention that we will continue to build on this success in 2014 and to further reduce the time taken to reach a decision for most applications.<\/p><p>  The new arrangements I have put in place since my appointment include improved application forms that are currently available on-line together with streamlined and accelerated procedures for certain types of application.  I have also requested that my officials ensure that all the procedures involved in processing an application are reviewed regularly to ensure that they are conducted as efficiently as possible.<\/p><p>  The costs paid by applicants on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation were last increased by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship (Fees) Regulations 2008, which came into effect on 1st August 2008. The standard certification fee is &euro;950 while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain circumstances when the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen. In the case of refugees and stateless persons no certification fee is charged.  A new application fee of &euro;175 was introduced in November 2011. This fee contributes towards the costs of processing those applications that do not attract any certification fee and helps to reduce the proportion of invalid and ineligible applications being lodged.  The fees are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation and there are no additional costs to the State relating to the length of time taken to process each application.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I have introduced formal citizenship ceremonies at no extra cost to applicants. These have been universally well received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900083#WRT01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizenship Applications","counter":409,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900083#WRT01400"},{"type":"question","counter":410,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[4537\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900083#WRT01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when a decision on citizenship will be made on an application in respect of persons (details supplied) in Dublin 22.","asker":"1028","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":411,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[4538\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012900083#WRT01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a family of two adults and three children (details supplied) in Dublin 22 has been living in a hostel for seven years awaiting a decision on its citizenship application.","asker":"1028","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":412,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151 and 152 together.<\/p><p>  Officials in the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department inform me that there is no record of an application for a certificate of naturalisation from the persons referred to in the Deputy's question.

Supporting infrastructure, procured through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of multi-disciplinary primary health care.  The location prioritisation exercise initiated by the HSE in 2012 is a dynamic process, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances including the feasibility of implementation using the following delivery mechanisms:<\/p><p>- direct\/own-build (by HSE); <\/p><p>- by way of the operational lease with the private sector; or <\/p><p>- through the Public Private Partnership (PPP) project.<\/p><p>  In addition to the infrastructure already in place thirty four primary care centres have been delivered between March 2011 and December 2013.  These locations are set out in the following table.  The Heath Service National Service Plan 2014 (Appendix 5 Capital Infrastructure Pages 68, 69) advises that an additional 21 primary care centres are expected to open over 2014\/Q12015; 19 by way of operational lease and two by direct\/own-build.  Significant progress has been achieved using the operational lease mechanism.  The HSE continues to work with the private sector to deliver primary care centres by means of operational lease.  In addition, a further 13 are to be delivered by direct\/own-build.  These are St Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital campus, Cork city; Finglas; Grangegorman; Monaghan town; Ballinamore; Sligo town; Manorhamilton; Erris; Ballyshannon; Edgesworthtown; Tullow\/Rathvilly\/Hacketstown; Loughrea and Dungloe.    <\/p><p>  In relation to the potential  Primary Care Centres to be delivered under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) Project, the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) published a Prior Information Notice (PIN) on Friday 15th November 2013 in the Official Journal of the European Union (&quot;OJEU&quot;) through the eTenders Public Procurement portal which can be viewed on the www.etenders.gov.ie website.  Of the 35 primary care centre locations announced under the Infrastructure Stimulus Package in July 2012, 15 locations have been identified as being suitable for the PPP model.  These are Ballymote; Boyle; Westport; Claremorris; Tuam; Limerick City; Dungarvan; Carrick-on-Suir; Wexford Town; Waterford City; Kilcock; Knocklyon\/Rathfarnham; Crumlin\/Drimnagh; Coolock\/Darndale; and Summerhill, north inner city Dublin.  In addition, the HSE has progressed Ballinrobe, which was not one of the original 35, as a suitable substitute.<\/p><p>  By year end 2013 the HSE had lodged 14 planning applications, details of which will be available on the relevant planning websites.  The submission of Limerick City and Ballinrobe planning applications are to follow as soon as possible.  It is expected that 10-14 sites (indicative number 12 based on affordability) from the above list will be delivered as part of a single PPP contract with the remaining centres to be delivered by the HSE using other procurement means.  As with all other capital projects the further expansion of the primary care infrastructure programme (including locations that have not moved to planning stage) must be considered within the overall capital envelope available to the health service.<\/p><p>  Your question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply in relation to following:<\/p><p>- The schedule of suitable primary care infrastructure delivered before March 2011; and<\/p><p>- Locations at planning stage (other than the locations set out above).<\/p><p><br \/><table><tr><th><b>Count<\/b><\/th><th><b>HSE

In October 2009, the then Minister for Health and Children announced the establishment of an independent non statutory review, the &ldquo;Drogheda Review&rdquo;.  The purpose of this review was to advise her on whether a further investigation into the procedures and practices operating at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda during the period 1964 to 1995 to protect patients from sexual abuse while undergoing treatment or care at the hospital and to deal with allegations of sexual abuse against a certain doctor, would be likely to provide additional information or insights which would be of significant public benefit in helping to improve best practice guidelines and policies.  This review was carried out by retired High Court Judge T.C. Smyth.  Judge Smyth submitted his report to the Minister in September 2010.  The report recommended that a further investigation should not<b><\/b>  be held and that, in order to avoid prejudicing any civil or criminal cases, the report should not be published.  I am aware that such proceedings are underway.  A short summary of the report was, however, prepared and supplied to the patient support groups in January 2011.<\/p><p>  The High Court proceedings with the Information Commissioner and also the Circuit Court proceedings, initiated by the Office of the Ombudsman, are on-going and accordingly I am not in a position to make any further comment as these matters are <i>sub judice<\/i>.  The legal costs of the Department associated with these proceedings are borne by the Chief State Solicitor's Office vote.
