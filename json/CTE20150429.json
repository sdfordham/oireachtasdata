I very much hope I will be of assistance to the committee today in its important work.<\/p> <p>  I joined AIB as head of investment banking early in 1991.  And subsequently, as I said, I served as managing director of AIB Capital Markets and then as managing director of the Poland division.  In October 2000 I was appointed group chief executive designate and I formally took over as group CEO in June 2001.  My successor was designated in March 2005 and I retired at the end of June 2005.  From the date of my retirement onwards, I had no further involvement in the management and board of AIB group.  As I was retiring ten years ago, I can honestly say that I had no premonition, let alone any evidence, that a liquidity and credit crisis was building internationally or that when that major crisis crystalised late in 2008 that AIB would be so vulnerable to it and ultimately would only survive through taxpayer support.  I deeply regret what happened and the damage it inflicted on the lives of so many.<\/p> <p>  There are two interlocking parts, Chairman, to the account I want to give of my time as CEO of AIB.  They are in my written witness statement.  I'm just summarising them here.  I'm going to start with the business strategy in general and as it applied to the Republic of Ireland in my time.  And second of all, I want to talk about risk and credit management.  First, the business strategy.  In 2001 the business environment was fraught.  It was in the wake of the dotcom crash, then 9\/11 and we had the added challenge in Ireland of foot and mouth disease.  As a result, the strong period of growth that started in the second half of the 1990s slowed for, I think, about two years, but from early to mid-2003 the economy returned to its catch-up growth spurt.  There had been a one million person increase in the population between 1971 and 2001.  The labour force had increased by 400,000, or 32%, in the ten years up to 2001.  The number of people in employment had risen by about 400,000 also, or 49%, in the same ten year period.  Such a rate of demographic growth and change hadn't been seen in the history of the State and the numbers continued to grow through the whole period of my time as CEO.  That meant the potential for many new customers and strong demand from that growing customer base across the whole range of financial products in a very low interest rate environment.  I think that context is very important.<\/p> <p>  In 2001, investors saw AIB as a federation of banking franchises with varying growth prospects but without any distinctive common thread to its brands.  They saw our main market, the Republic of Ireland, as dynamic but their view was that other banks operating here had more exciting growth prospects.  The strategy we set out in response to those factors, was to position ourselves to build one distinctive model of doing retailing and commercial banking that could be applied to each country in which we operated.  And that model was to focus on growing the total value of each good customer relationship based on having best products, best service and best people.<\/p><p>In our largest business here in Ireland we believed that we hadn't been fully exploiting our greatest strengths, those were that we had between 30% and 40% market share of all personal current accounts and all business working accounts but a much lower market share of most individual product categories.  So the strategy was to get better at responding to customer needs across the whole product spectrum.<\/p><p> I've mentioned the very strong demographics so building our relationships with good customers in the property and constructions sectors was a logical part of the strategy, but so too was building a stronger presence in the growing health insurance market and meeting the needs of our growing customer base in deposits, mortgages and investment products.  When I presented that strategy to the board in 2001, I said that if we were successful in executing it we could have an aspiration of doubling our profits over the next five years.  In some of the documents I've been given that aspirational outcome has been incorrectly represented as the strategy itself, in fact the medium term forecast and annual budgets presented to the board throughout my period are focused somewhat more modestly on achieving double digit earnings growth overall on a consistent basis.  So doubling profits in a five-year period was never actually a budgeted target.<\/p><p> Property and construction lending grew strongly during my time, most of the material I have been sent about that looks at growth trends across the whole period of 2001 and 2009 in percentage terms.  That in my view is misleading because the starting base was actually quite low.  In money terms the entire group exposure to property and construction during my four years was about &euro;6 billion in mid 2001 and it grew to about &euro;19 billion, this is in euro, by mid 2005.  And within those overall totals the figures for the Republic of Ireland were that it grew from &euro;4 billion to &euro;11 billion.<\/p><p> I have no evidence that at that level we had materially outrun the demand arising from deposit and demographics nor did I have a view coming to me from my credit professionals that standards were slipping at the time.  On the contrary their view to me throughout and to the board was that credit quality was stable and strong.<\/p><p> In any business you're trying to keep a fairly wide range of shifting factors in good balance so towards the end of 2004, as a result of the fact that loan growth had been significantly outpacing deposit growth, I began to focus on the increasing loan to deposit ratio and on the proposal from myself and my management team, the board put in place at that stage targets, one for the simple loan to deposit ratio and the second for an adjusted loan to deposit ratio.  That was done to begin to slow down the rate of credit growth to a level closer to the growth rate for deposits and also to help ensure that internal capital generation was positive. <\/p><p> I'm going to turn now to my second main aim in the period mid 2001 to mid 2005; which was improving our risk management capability.  That was partly for strategic reasons, it was partly also because we had three massive regulatory projects to implement; Basel II, Sarbanes Oxley and the new IFRS accounting standards, and thirdly because I had to deal with two major crisis management events during my time - the fraud in our Allfirst subsidiary in 2002 and the FX charging issues identified in Ireland in 2004.  Collectively all of those factors required the single risk and finance support organisation to be built across AIB Group which had always been heavily divisionalised.  That was a huge five-year project as I saw it.  In the wake of the Allfirst fraud we commissioned separate independent reviews and reports on treasury operational risk, credit risk, policy frameworks across all of those things to get assurance that they were fit for purpose and we constructed a series of projects to implement the recommendations arising.  The general message in those reports was that within each division there were no major issues but that we needed to establish common standards across the whole group.<\/p><p> During 2002-03 we recruited an experienced chief risk officer, reporting directly to me, to build that single organisation.  We put in place a single group-wide treasury organisation.  We again recruited externally an experienced head of internal audit to build a group-wide capability and we enlarged the mandate and scope of the compliance function across the group.  We devoted massive resources both to the regulatory projects and to remediation programmes arising from Allfirst and from the FX charging issues in 2004.<\/p><p>Implementation was still going on when I retired, including a wide range of actions designed to change those aspects of culture and practice in the bank that were obstacles to colleagues at any level feeling free to raise any issues that concerned them. And that was a strong personal mission of mine.  I have a couple of final things to say, Chairman.  First of all,  turning to credit policies, delegated authorities and exception management, Deloitte had carried out a very detailed policy and process review, I think towards the end of 2002 if my recollection is right.  What they found was that there were &quot;well established processes, policy and delegated authorities based on skill and experience, that grading and monitoring systems accommodated early identification and management of deterioration of credit policy, that there was a system of credit review independent of business reporting lines and written policies pertinent to current business.&quot;  That's the end of the quote.  Their recommendations mainly had to do with ensuring consistency across all of our divisions.  The delegated authorities to divisional credit committees were relatively modest during my time.  They were increased somewhat towards the end of 2004, but not dramatically, and exceptions to large exposure policy were infrequent.  The month before I retired, in May 2005, Standard &amp;amp; Poor's raised our long-term credit rating to A+.  In their announcement, the agency said:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>The rating on AIB reflects its leadership position in its main market, the Republic of Ireland, strong credit risk management, good underlying financial performance and sound liquidity.  They also reflect AIB's ongoing initiatives to improve its risk management procedures and control frameworks.<\/blockquote>That is the end of the quote.  Thank you Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430262000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Buckley.

At the outset,  I want to say I'm very sorry for what happened and my role in these events.  I know a lot of people were let down and feel very angry, deservedly so.  I draw no comfort from the extraneous factors that contributed to the crisis.  I take personal responsibility for my actions and omissions.  Public apologies on many occasions have not diminished the deep disappointment that I feel on a daily basis.  Chairman, in my written statement I have addressed the themes that the inquiry requested me to focus upon  including property risk concentrations, liquidity, business planning, remuneration, regulatory relationships, delegated authorities and the bank guarantee.  Conscious of time and that these themes will be covered during my evidence, and in light of evidence given to the committee last week, I will confine my verbal remarks to a summary of the evidence contained in my written statement concerning the bank guarantee.  I have been asked to make a statement on the appropriateness of the guarantee.  Though we did not make the decision, I will describe my role on the night and this role is described in detail in my contemporaneous notes, of which you have a copy.<\/p> <p>  Together with our counterparts from Bank of Ireland, we asked for a meeting with Government.  At that meeting,  we requested a four bank guarantee, but not the blanket guarantee that was ultimately provided.  We were in Government Buildings for over six hours, our presence at the meeting was not continuous, and we were dismissed from the decision-maker's room on four occasions.  At the first session we described what was happening in our business, and how our liquidity was being positioned.  That day had been a tumultuous one on global financial markets.  To stabilise the Irish banking market, we asked for a four bank guarantee.  This was not a new idea.  You will have copies of minutes of an AIB bank board meeting of the night before, in which I am quoted, \"The authorities expect that two financial institutions will fail (unless white knights emerged) and would guarantee the obligations of the other institutions on a temporary basis\", recorded in the AIB minutes the day before the guarantee.  We were dismissed from the room while our request for a guarantee was considered.<\/p> <p>   At the second session we attended, we were told that Anglo was about to default.  The Government wanted us to give Anglo a loan to get them through the week so that they could be decisively dealt with by the weekend.<\/p><p>We refused initially and were dismissed and were asked to reconsider our position.  Working over the phone with colleagues back in Bankcentre we mobilised resources and looked into every possibility to come up with a response that would meet the Government's needs.  At the third session, we said we would give Anglo &euro;5 billion until the weekend.  On notice at this stage that Anglo was about to default, we refused to go on risk for Anglo.  Our offer was conditional on a Government guarantee for this Anglo loan.  This solution appeared to be acceptable to the Government and we said we would start moving assets to have the phones ready by Wednesday morning, and that in itself was quite a complex and intricate business.<\/p><p> The meeting reverted to the four bank guarantee and its form.  We made suggestions regarding duration of the guarantee - we wanted a longer one than the one-year one proposed - and also on the merits of including bonds ... of which we were in favour of.  We were dismissed while a drafting process was undertaken and during this interval our input was sought on ... in bilateral sessions regarding treatment of subsidiaries, for instance, our Polish business, and on what basis would be ... what basis would be used to determine the price of the guarantee.  When we were called back for the fourth session, there was a short discussion about a solvency statement being issued with the guarantee.  We didn't think it was necessary and after discussion, the Government decided not to include that reference.  We returned to the room and at 3:30 a.m. we were told we were no longer needed.  When we saw the guarantee document for the first time the following morning, we could not understand why Anglo and Irish Nationwide were included.  All our discussions that night were based upon a premise that Anglo was to be taken down.  We did not think they would be part of the guarantee, in fact, we were at that time, in response to a Government request, risking our own liquidity to keep Anglo afloat until the following weekend.<\/p><p> From our perspective, a four institution guarantee was appropriate and necessary for a number of reasons.  Firstly, an Anglo default was absolutely certain to result in an immediate across-the-board agency downgrade for all Irish institutions and an immediate worldwide risk aversion for all Irish institutions.  Secondly, in Great Britain where we had high street branches and &euro;10 billion in retail deposits, we could expect an immediate run on our deposits.  Thirdly, given the Irish public's reaction to Northern Rock, a very minor player in this market, during their crisis in 2007, you could deduce from that it was certain that there would be panic on the streets and that our branches would not be able to cope.<\/p><p> In the absence of a statutory mechanism to deal with a failing bank, the options were to nationalise, liquidate or guarantee.  There was no contingency plan nationally to deal with Anglo or at EU level to deal with the crisis in general.  In the absence of alternatives, the default option was a four bank guarantee for the remaining four institutions, not the blanket guarantee ultimately given.  This, I believe, offered the best chance to cope with the fallout about to be triggered by the imminent liquidation or nationalisation of Anglo and Irish Nationwide.  The lessons from two weeks previously were fresh in everybody's mind.  Solutions that didn't convince the markets invited misfortune.  This was amply demonstrated when the US authorities allowed Lehman's to fail.  The decision did not restore market discipline and within days the US Government had to rescue many institutions -huge institutions - and introduce a &euro;700 billion TARP, the troubled asset relief programme.  These events contributed hugely to initiating the meltdown in global liquidity.<\/p><p> I wrote up my notes of the minutes ... my minutes of the meeting a couple of days afterwards and absent hindsight observations that ... I have made some in this statement ... they are a contemporaneous record of events on the night as I saw them.  Since I submitted my statement a month ago, I have been furnished with another record of events on the night from a Department of Finance source, which has been quoted at the committee.  Comments are attributed to me that I cannot remember making.  There was absolutely no evidence of any discussion of AIB's solvency on the night, in either my note or that of Dermot Gleeson's.  We were asked for an update on what was happening in our banks which we gave.  We were asked to provide funds to cover Anglo until the weekend which we agreed to provide.  We were asked about the form of guarantee.  We gave advice on duration and the instruments that could be included.<\/p><p>We were asked for our views on Anglo and Irish Nationwide.  We said they should be nationalised.  This fact is recorded in both my note and that of Dermot Gleeson.  This fact is further collaborated by the note from the Department and I quote, \"Minister asks FR, did they agree with AIB, Bank of Ireland, that two need to be nationalised first.  FR did not agree.\"<\/p><p>If I said the words attributed to me in the Department of Finance note, they could only have been in the context of what would have happened to the system if no remedial action was taken.  There was absolutely no issue about AIB solvency at that time.  <\/p><p> Chairman, in conclusion, I spent 38 years in AIB, operated at many levels and I knew the organisation very well.  I was proud of what the bank had achieved over the decades.  I always viewed my job when I became CEO as one of stewardship, responsibility to staff, customers, shareholders and the public in general.  It was my wish that in due course I would hand on the job to somebody else with the bank in good shape.  That I failed in that responsibility, for me is a matter of eternal regret and sorrow. <\/p><p> Thank you, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Sheehy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430262000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Sheehy and thank you again, Mr. Buckley.

The thing I would say is that a common thread between them is that, to take the FX charges and related things first of all ,those issues, by and large, referred back to the 1980s up to the early 90s, and the subsequent investigations found that in most cases the particular issues that had been brought to the regulator's attention and, via the regulator, to our attention, had been dealt with, by and large, during the course of the 1990s so there was a large element of history about them.  To me, they were probably ... the FX charges was probably the most upsetting part personally to me of my time as CEO because it said that there was stuff going on there that, in terms of the values and principles that I would have had, that were contrary to those principles.  Now ... but we did tear up the floorboards.  I mean, I remember when the FX charges thing came up first, I was on television, and I said those very words.

What had happened was we as a bank were required to get written approval in the mid-90s, I think it was 1996 or something like that, for our foreign exchange charges.  We had failed to do that.  The investigation then found that actually our charges in the marketplace were no worse than any other bank, so therefore we were not disadvantaging customers.  Despite that, we went and remediated and refunded every customer that we could find.  The third element, Faldor, was a situation where there was no customer detriment.

I mean, when I came from the States I was paid a lot less over there, but they had a totally different philosophy about long-term compensation, so you could make a lot of money in the States as a bank executive if you stayed in an institution for a long time, because there was a huge upside in stock.  Here there was ... actually it turned out, no upside in long-term compensation because the bar had to be ... was ...

In the bilateral discussions that we had around pricing of the guarantee I was pushing for an FDIC model which is the US model about ... you price the guarantee relative to the risk you are taking, and the risk you are taking is based on a formula called a camel formula which takes in capital, liquidity, management risk.

The methodology used there was that when loans went over certain limits, they went to the next level of authority.  And they carried with them the approvals and arguments that the various levels prior to that had made.  In this case, when we looked at it and it went to board, there was a lot of support.  The individual had enormously, much higher net worth, there was professional evaluations, there was in overall, I think, a loan-to-value of around 50% in the entire exposure.

This is two months prior to Lehman's and the general collapse of the markets.  In addition, the question implies that the dividend was ... extra dividend was &euro;270 million.  The dividend... the interim dividend is always smaller than the final dividend.  Generally it is a kind of two thirds, one third split.

And just one other matter there, Mr. Buckley, before I bring in Senator O'Keeffe, is if I could just come to yourself, maybe just to explore and get some understanding of the access ... the relationships had ... the access and relationship particularly how ... the relationship that AIB had with the Financial Regulator, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance, okay.  And a ... the nature and the appropriateness of that relationship between the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and the banking institutions, in this specific case, AIB.  What did you see, Mr. Buckley, as the main purpose and indeed the main outcome of the round-table discussions held with the Central Bank post-publication of the financial stability reports from 2004 onwards?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#S00100","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430262000,"counter":241,"content":"<p>Chairman, I don't have a very clear recollection of those round-table events or of their connection with the financial stability report.

My first big interaction with the Central Bank in its prudential role was in 2002 when we had the Allfirst fraud.  As you can see, it has marked my recall of my whole time as CEO, but there I found .... what happened at the stage was that we had to deal with a whole lot of regulatory intervention from the Federal Reserve in New York because, remember the fraud had happened in a US regulated bank with a subsidiary of ours and the local regulator, and what I found was that there was a very professional, very thorough approach adopted by both of the regulators.  They worked together, very closely, we had to sign up a memorandum of understanding, we had to undertake a very detailed programme of remedial action.  That programme was given oversight by a man called John Hyman, who had been the previous controller ...  one of the previous controllers of the currency in the USA.  So, and we worked our way very thoroughly.  I put one of my most senior executives full time on making sure we met all the requirements.  So, in that case I found the regulator acting, if you like, in its prudential mode, behaved very professionally.<\/p> <p>  The second thing, I'd say, and I am sorry if I'm taking too long but I just want to give you a balanced account.  In the FX charges and related issues that came up during 2003-04 which Deputy O'Donnell has already referred to, I found that the regulator which at this stage was on the conduct side, the customer side of it, was very proactive, was very demanding, rightly, as I would say.  And again, I found that we got into that way of independent investigation, independent oversight, we had a former Comptroller &amp;amp; Auditor General involved, we had a former Governor of the Central Bank involved.  And I found that that relationship was properly demanding from the regulator. <\/p> <p>Now, other than those two big crisis events, I would have interacted with the regulator and other than the meeting that you mentioned in the beginning, I would have interacted with the regulator a couple of times a year when our interim results were coming out and when our annual results were coming out, the process was that myself and my finance director would go in the day before, before we made the market announcement, into the Central Bank and have a meeting with the prudential side of the Central Bank.  We would present our results to them, they were ... if you like ... we were open to any questions they would ask us and I suppose my recall of those meetings is that ... and I think I mentioned this in my written statement, that they weren't very demanding, they weren't very probing.

Banks absorb the risk between short money and long money and when there's a problem of that nature, it will materialise in falling asset values and problems for banks.

Bankruptcy for profit will occur if poor accounting, lax regulation or low penalties for abuse give owners an incentive to pay themselves more than their firms are worth and then default on their debt obligations.

So what the escalation of sanctioning - if you go through the various committees - meant was that in each case, first of all, you were going through the committee process because the loans were getting larger, and that's a fact.  And, you know, we talked about a big loan earlier on.  But to me there was a benefit of ... in this process, which was you got fresh eyes at each level, and feedback and interaction.  So the group-large exposure policy, and the passing on of when people went over certain limits into their next level was, I think, is a positive process in looking at risk.  It's a positive process.

And I'm asking you to comment upon Mr Daly's testimony when he says:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>While internal bank lending documentation may indicate that the loan-to-value ratios were, typically, less than 100% when the loan was drawn, the reality, in many cases, was that a developer's equity contribution was in the form of a rolling-up of unrealised, paper profit from other developments.  This was presented as an equity position.  Rarely, if ever, was it in the form of cash.<\/blockquote>So basically what Mr Daly is implying there ... that as a development was under way, its equity was growing probably beyond the original valuation of the purchase or development at the site; therefore, the equity then could be offset against a new development.  He then goes on to say:<blockquote>In effect, therefore, the banks were providing all of the real cash funding for both acquisitions and development.  It's safe to say that quite often the borrower's paper equity position never paid for an acre of land or concrete or scaffolding or a worker's wage at the end of the week.  The safety zone of borrower equity usually existed only on paper.  The result is that the borrower was typically not the first to lose.  In the event of a crash the banks stood to take 100% of the losses, and that's what happened.<\/blockquote>Is that what happened in AIB?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#X01000","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430262000,"counter":399,"content":"<p>No.  I understand exactly what Mr. Daly was saying.  And if you look at a loan application, where an individual could have been in business for 20 years in a trade, i.e. property construction, and has developed a net worth in that business, there are a couple of options open to the individual.  They could say, \"I'll cash out here and take my cash off the table,\" and try to continue on with non-recourse lending ... trying to get that ... \"Or I'll leave everything I have in the business\".  By and large, to my recall, almost all of the developers we'd have dealt with left everything in the business.  Now, then you come to the kind of intellectual argument about is leaving everything in the business the same as committing to the business?  It is.  I mean, if you have made money over decades and you leave it all in the business, and that is then recognised by the bank as equity, not cash, but as equity, I think that's entirely correct.  And I'll just go ... add a little bit to it.  I mean, when I was a branch manager I dealt with a lot of SMEs and start-up businesses, they never had cash.  People who go into business rarely have cash, because when you go into a town you'll see banks lined up on one side of the street, you won't see \"private equity\" or \"vulture fund\" over somebody's door.  The banks provided equity for people who wanted to ... provided cash for people who wanted to take risks.  And, by and large, that came from a trust-based, personality-based decision, a personal guarantee from parents or supporters.  So, you can imagine if everybody ... and we had nearly 40% SME customers and builders ... if the bank had a view that we would not back anybody unless they had hard cash, and disregard their equity, the person coming to the bank who wanted to start a business, had a house worth &euro;150,000, a  mortgage of &euro;75,000, wanted to get seed capital to start off, and we said, \"You know what?

It's not that you're giving a few bob to an SME here, or a video shop here, or a health club here.  What you were doing was giving compound lending into one sectoral area, one loan after another, after another, that led to an exposure.  So a developer built the shopping centre, the equity value in that - no cash transaction - maybe increased by 20%.  That 20% then - no cash transference - was used as a notional concept to securitise a new loan to build another development.  This was all construction.  This wasn't SMEs, this wasn't some guy setting up some carpet shop down the road, these were developing loans that ultimately resulted in all these major borrowers having to go into NAMA with massive loans that your bank had provided.  So this is an exposure issue.  And what Mr. Daly is indicating in his statement - and Mr Daly may well be back before the committee and we'll get further clarification from himself, and we may call other witnesses back as well - is that the business model operated by banks was creating an exposure in property without any down payment or cash being made.

But I agree with Mr. Daly, you know, that it would've been a lot better off if the structure ... the industry structure in Ireland around property, had more private equity, you know, and I think that's happening now.

Here, when like ... I agree with everything Mr. Buckley said, it's a totally nonsensical accounting standard from a banking point of view.  It may be appropriate for other industries but for banking it was totally nonsensical.  There was a board discussion during my period there.  I haven't seen it noted but I did talk to an official in the bank who would have been an executive director at the time and we did discuss it.  And we discussed whether we should go to the regulator with our concerns and given that no European country other than Spain had deviated from it, we decided there was no point.  Now, I then tried to research what had happened in Spain and why it happened in Spain and there is a very particular reason.  For historical reasons, Spanish banks were required to hold very large shareholdings in large Spanish companies.  When their tier 1 was being calculated, the equity value of those holdings, which are basically stocks and shares, were included in their total capital.  That didn't meet the international standard for tier 1 because of its volatility so the Spanish authorities were able to make the case that, \"We have this historical volatile piece of capital in our banks balance sheets - we need the extra comfort of not changing\", in effect and having cross cyclical provisions to bolster their resilience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#Z02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Sheehy"},{"type":"speech","time":1430262000,"counter":522,"content":"<p>Sorry, just to clarify, Mr. Sheehy.

This meeting took place on the 17th, so two days after you report that liquidity pressures increased at that point.  You say that there was a systemic need for term debt of up to &euro;15 billion in the Irish market.  You go on to say that AIB would breach its regulatory liquidity ratio by the end of October 2008 if market conditions did not ease and term funding became available.  It goes on to say Central Bank has been informed of that.  The chairperson goes on to indicate that in the absence of a response from the regulators to the systemic funding problem, the matter would be pursued at a political level.

There was always going to be funding in the meantime so that date would keep on moving out, but there were real concerns after Lehman's that even offering better prices on term debt would have no effect because people were running to avoid risk everywhere.

What we do then is that in certain cases where we believe, and we're talking about categories rather than individuals, in certain cases where we believe that people's repayment capacity will grow quite rapidly in the future or where they have family support, we are prepared to go to a higher LTV then we generally would, that's what I said.

I felt that - just to give an overall comment - I felt that achieving double-digit growth was a realistic target, that it was stretching to some extent, but that it was realistic and if I may take that in the context of the Republic of Ireland division, I suppose to summarise the reason why I would have thought that there was good growth available in the Irish division.  Twofold: one, the demographics that I referred to before.  Second of all, a point I mentioned in my opening statement, that, while we had a big share of the current accounts of households and individuals and of the working accounts of companies and the strong position with the SMEs that, on a product-by-product basis, we actually had a much lower market share.  So let's say in mortgages, while we had 30% of all the current accounts in the country, we had 16% market share in mortgages.  So, there was inherent growth potential and when we made an assessment of what would be the net result of doing better on that front, but also reorganising ourselves, for instance by centralising the way in which we dealt with producing mortgages and producing a better proposition, that we would get there.  Double digit growth in the sense of 10% or 11% or 12% per annum, in the context of the economy we had, was not a wild or strange target to have would be my view, even still looking back at it now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#DD03900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1430262000,"counter":738,"content":"<p>Mr. Sheehy you made reference, a few minutes ago, to taking a voluntary reduction in your pension.

As CEO of AIB since December 2011, I welcome this opportunity to outline to the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis my own experience of joining a bank that was in a significantly challenged state and leading its return to stabilisation and recovery over a three-year period.  I've worked in banking for almost 30 years, specialising in managing and restructuring banks through challenging times.  Though I grew up and was educated in Ireland, I spent most of my career working abroad.  From 1987 to 1997, I worked with Goldman Sachs International in various senior positions, including head of human resources Europe head of general services Europe and business manager for information technology.  From 1998 to 2006, I held various positions at ING Group, including the position of head of global wholesale banking network.  This role included the management of a team of CEOs covering all of the bank's regions globally.<\/p><p> Prior to that, I was president and chief executive officer of the ING franchises in the US and Latin America.  From 2006 to 2011, I worked with Standard Bank PLC\/Standard Bank International, including holding the position of CEO.  In 2007, I took responsibility for the full international franchise.  I relocated to Asia in the summer of 2010 and in October assumed the role of head of strategic projects.  Leaving Standard Bank in 2011, I established Celtic Advisory International, providing capital raising and development advisory services to corporate and emerging companies.  <\/p><p> I was asked to return to Ireland at the end of 2011 to become CEO at a troubled AIB that had been rescued by the Irish taxpayer following investments of &euro;21 billion.  Together with the then chairman, David Hodgkinson, who joined in late 2010, we set about a daunting task that involved a radical restructuring of the bank and its balance sheet, the implementation of a &euro;350 million cost-cutting programme, an overhaul of the bank&rsquo;s funding and pricing models, governance enhancements, and creating the ability to effectively deal with our challenged loan book.<\/p><p> Today AIB is a profitable organisation with key performance metrics in 2014 trending positive.  In particular: our lending levels are increasing; our impaired loans and arrears levels are decreasing; the bank's capital and funding levels have stabilised and are improving; the bank&rsquo;s organisational structure and risk framework have been restructured; the bank has received approval for its restructuring plan and passed the ECB\/EBA comprehensive assessment; the bank has placed significant emphasis on meeting the expanded and enhanced regulatory environment across Europe.  Having returned the bank to profit and stability, it is my expectation that AIB will be in a position to return capital to the Irish State over time, subject to economic conditions and the wishes of our majority shareholder. <\/p><p> In conclusion, as mentioned, I have covered the six topics here.  I think the effectiveness of the bank's board governance is fairly well documented here, so I won't spend much time on that and we'll just deal with that in questions.  Our bank credit risk strategies and risk management strategies are significantly updated here.  I'd draw your attention to cash flow, credit lending, which is the most significant difference.  There are many other complementary and important adjustments that have been made in the bank, but that area is one of particular emphasis, versus what has been a practice in the past.<\/p><p> With regard to remuneration arrangements and bank's risk assessment, I'd just draw your attention to the fact that we are under the bank's placing agreement and restricted in that matter, but I have documented our philosophy with regards to that for the purposes of discussion, although it has been in practice not applied due to the restrictions that we have.<\/p><p> On the clarity and effectiveness of the nexus of institutional roles and relationships, I think one area of emphasis that I will discuss is the fact that we are supervised in reality by the SSM, and so all decisions on capital funding, appointment of senior persons up to and including my replacement as a CEO, are at the behest of the European supervisors.  I think those were the four that I particularly wanted to mention out of the six.  <\/p><p> I would say that the liquidity and capital will be an extensive discussion, so I won't try and select components of that.  And with regards to item 5, on the appropriateness and effectiveness of domestic policy responses, and in particular NAMA, I don't have much experience of the history prior to my arrival, but I'll endeavour to answer questions as best I can.  <\/p><p> In summary, I wish to thank the committee of inquiry for considering my account as documented.  I fully appreciate the difficulties you face in dealing with such a weight of information from so many witnesses.  The banking and economic crisis In Ireland has indeed been staggering, the impact of which I could not fully understand until I returned to Ireland and witnessed the consequences first hand.  I hope that my statement to you has assisted the committee in appreciating how, in spite of the depths to which it plunged, the bank has been stabilised and restructured and should go on to support the Irish economy and the Irish people, as it should rightly do.  Chairman, that concludes my comments.  Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#KK01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430262000,"counter":883,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Duffy.

They refer to the significant scale of the financial numbers involved in the rescue of AIB.  The original &euro;21 billion which was invested in AIB as capital was only part of the equation.  In the first year of my taking on the role we had an additional obligation to deleverage a further &euro;20 billion of assets under the direction of the troika regime.  So that was another &euro;20 billion, an almost coincidental number.  Prior to that we had to deliver a very significant portfolio of assets to NAMA at a very significant discount with another capital impact.  In addition, assets had to be sold in various other jurisdictions, notably, most significantly, Poland, but also the US.  So if you look at the cumulative effect of all of those numbers it was a shockingly large number, and in addition it wasn't just about those sales, those disposals, and those injections of capital.  The requirement to reduce the staff by pretty much a further 4,000 since I took over on a gross basis, and a further cut of &euro;350 million of costs, plus an overhaul of the entire structure, governance, culture, and leadership and executive levels, I would put all of those into the rare situation of having to do all at once in one bank as being exceptional and perhaps, therefore, staggering in terms of the scale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#LL00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1430262000,"counter":886,"content":"<p>Thank you.

When I refer to the team, as I have referred to them, I refer to the mix of skills, very importantly, as the first element; secondly to the experience base; and thirdly to the international experience base of the team.  I think it's very important, particularly sometimes when you're in a smaller universe, that you have best practice experience and benchmarks from within the universe, but also externally, and those who have the experience of crises perhaps before, perhaps not on this scale.  The recruitment effort that we had sought to find the best in class for each position, and in each position we looked to see if there was a capability that had experience of how to manage significant change management programmes which was, as I mentioned earlier, fairly massive in its scale, and also had the competence to deliver on a model which we were designing which was, in our minds, being structured to prevent a recurrence of any similar catastrophe in the future.  That skill base and that intellect and that experience, domestically and international, was something we took two years to put together, it was challenging, but we succeeded, and I'm very confident in that team today.<\/p> <p>  I think the comparisons to the past are not directly linked, because what we are faced with is a challenge as a change management universe and a restructuring universe is very different than a business-as-usual management universe, so regardless of whether somebody was competent or not in the past, the skills required to do what we had to do, where every single action was almost simultaneous and in a very short window of three years, were different skills than existed in the team at the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#LL01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1430262000,"counter":892,"content":"<p>You quoted the figures in terms of the reorganisation of AIB.

What I am implying by that comment is that on my arrival, when I met with the regulators, there was some dissatisfaction with our process, our control, the quality of our relationship, our communications.  The bank had, during the period prior to my arrival, seen a number of CEOs and new heads, so there was a bit of disarray.  There were impending material programmes, such as severance, which were outstanding 16 months at the time of arrival.  That level of uncertainty and changing leadership meant that the organisation was not in a sufficiently effective place from a regulatory interaction perspective as regards the regulator's opinion.<\/p><p>Similarly, our shareholder in the Department of Finance in the shareholder management unit did not yet have the confidence on what the strategy would be to recover the bank as we had not obviously had time to explain that so there were concerns about how we would approach that and how effective we could be in delivery.  So it was that level of interaction that led to my comment where there was a concern.  Did we have the right skills, as I mentioned earlier?  Did we have the right leadership?  Did we have a strategy that would be agreeable to, and comply with, the requirements of both the regulator and the troika?  All of those elements were uncertain at the time.  I myself did not know the full extent of the problems until I had spent a bit more time there but those were very clear issues that were relayed to me by the individual stakeholders at the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#LL01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430262000,"counter":897,"content":"<p>And if you were to do a one, two, three of what were your three greatest concerns starting with your greatest one, two, three?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#MM00200","speaker":"1160"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430262000,"counter":898,"content":"<p>I think my greatest concern relates to what is necessary to run a bank well and that starts with culture.  I think there was an organisation that had been through too much change in leadership, had been through a shocking crisis in terms of shock to the system of internal as well as external.  There was a huge amount of uncertainty.  There was a fear about the individual roles.  It was so much of a distraction that we needed to be able to be very clear up front that the bank is not there for itself, it's not there to worry about itself; it is there to serve customers and delivering a customer culture.  In other words, every thing that gets done in the bank, every process it serves, the customer had to be prioritised.  How could we do that?  That meant customers not just in the normal course of banking, but it meant the significant population who were in distress and arrears at the time for which we had no capability ... so creating that culture which recognised that the priority was not necessarily an internal focus, the priority was an external focus and that meant shifting the culture of the bank to an external lens and then applying all the lessons that we needed to recover the bank to that lens.  So that would be the first issue.<\/p> <p>  The second issue was, I think, operational risk.  You had a bank that had been through so much recent turmoil, it was not yet certain of the outcome.  We had very many staff leaving, senior people leaving, and an awful lot of the organisation was in stasis.  It was unable to move, it wasn't sure which direction to go, it wasn't sure of its future.  So that uncertainty and operational risk that it generates ... Are people doing their job?  Are they managing the processes?  Are they implementing the controls that we should have?<\/p> <p> The third area would have been the functioning of the bank in its purpose, which primarily is to lend to customers, that risk aversion was very material at the time.  People weren't sure of what the capital structure was, whether our funding was stable and, therefore, were very, very adverse to taking decisions on lending.  So there was a very significant adversity to taking risk in the bank and that aversion meant that I couldn't be sure where the revenue profile and the cost profile was going to end up in the first six to 12 months.  So I think if ... you know, I'd want to reflect in time if I whether there was any change in that priority but I think culture is overarching.  It's overwhelming in terms of success or failure and then the other two follow from that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#MM00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1430262000,"counter":899,"content":"<p>And are you satisfied with where AIB are currently in relation to -----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#MM00400","speaker":"1160"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430262000,"counter":900,"content":"<p>I am, Senator.

I think my observation would be more limited to what was happening internationally.  I think there was a crisis that was sown a long time before it happened.  When you originally had Glass-Steagall allow retail and investment banking come together, that created a potential significant leverage and, ultimately, greater risk in the system.  When you add to that the techniques of distribution around the globe and securitisation of asset classes where the well known subprime category and many others were combined in tranches of debt which were sold around the world, you spread that risk. which was already highly leveraged.  Then on top of that, the light regulation or principles-based regulation, as it was mentioned, in numerous forums existed and the covenants and documents for loans became less restrictive and lighter and more forms of collateral were acceptable in any circumstance.  And that principally allowed collateral on real estate to be offered up as part of the credit process.  If you look at all of those taken together I think it was common practice across the globe to use real estate as collateral hence the subprime crisis that occurred globally.

You can't borrow unless you can afford to repay it and, therefore, I think the level of borrowing perhaps would not have been as extreme or as large and significant individual cases as the cash flow would have to be demonstrated.  With collateral you tend to have value rather than cash flow so it's not provable that you can repay the loan; it's implied that you can pay the loan based on future values.  Those future values are subject to, as we've seen, asset class corrections.

We started out with two principles.  If we wanted to keep people in homes wherever possible and if we wanted to protect SME jobs, what would the best approach be?  We didn't necessarily take the view that someone would have to stay in their home.  It may be a suitable home.  We took the view that SMEs should be protected only when the business was viable and then when we applied those principles and looked at the financial aspects of each of the cases, we took the view that if it was clear that the debt was simply unaffordable, there are many extremes.  You can have an SME that had a property investment strategy on multiple buy-to-lets in concert with two other businesses or individuals in a small town where the income ratio would imply that to recover the debt might take something in the order of 50 to 100 years, depending on your assumptions.<\/p><p>If there were extreme cases where you could not see any circumstance of repayment, we thought that on balance it was better to be realistic about that debt structure and to put ourselves in a position where the SME could return to supporting its business and its employment that it had originally started out with, and that would be constructive and positive for the economy.  Secondly we would be, in the case of an individual and the home and looking at exactly the same situation, there are many examples of cases where it was more attractive for the individual and for the bank, for the individual to remain in the home.  If I may give you an example.  If an individual had purchased a house, as was in one case for &euro;400,000, and if you were to evict the individual in the house - on sale in the market at the time was valued at &euro;100,000 - and at the same time you could agree with the individual on &euro;200,000 or &euro;250,000 as an affordable long-term debt repayment, then you would maybe compromise on the residual debt but at the same time the individual remains in their home.  They are functioning in the economy and they are repaying far more for the shareholder than would have been obtained by a simple repossession and eviction.  It was that thinking that we constructed around all of those.  They were very exceptional and treated all individually, very consistently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#MM01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430262000,"counter":912,"content":"<p>Mr. Duffy, you are about to leave AIB.

I think you have a simple ... when you wake up in the morning running a bank you worry about liquidity, No. 1.  Secondly you worry about capital and they are the two priorities.<\/p> <p>  If you are going to lend, you have to have a threshold minimum of capital, which is not just the minimum regulatory capital but is probably that plus a buffer, where you would look to have a very conservative view on a stressed environment as to what that capital could become.  And that is your starting point.  You can then determine what your lending can be, providing that it doesn't breach those hurdles.  Secondly, your lending composition has to be understood in terms of your funding.  The history of lending had no regard necessarily to the composition of funding and you have two choices: retail longer term sticky funding as it is referred to, and wholesale funding.  If it is a short term, as wholesale often is and can be subject to flight in a very quick fashion as happened in Ireland, then long-term lending without short-term funding is going to put you significantly at risk.  <\/p> <p>  So I think you start off with two very careful principles - what is the minimum threshold of capital - which when in a stressed environment based on rapid asset deterioration, what is that level you should maintain - and is your funding correlated to that profile?  If you have confidence in those two then you can set a target of growth which doesn't breach either of those two objectives.  So I would never start with a number, I would start with the capital and the funding and then allow myself grow according to those definitions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#NN01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1430262000,"counter":926,"content":"<p>And Mr. Duffy, during the period from 2001 to 2008 which were the highest level of balance sheet growth by AIB, based upon the liquidity within AIB ... at the time I know it is before your time but I'm sure you must have done some analysis in relation to that period, what was your opinion upon the operation of the bank at that stage, outside of your opening statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#NN01600","speaker":"1160"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430262000,"counter":927,"content":"<p>Senator, not to be difficult but I don't really have an opinion because I haven't, contrary to popular views, spent a lot of time studying in the past.

I think in Ireland's situation you were suffering the consequences of what was happening globally, which was then exaggerated by the composition of the assets which each bank had here at the time.  Many of those situations involved banks being allowed to go under and many of those situations involved banks being rescued.  There were different logics applied in each of the circumstances.  I think in Ireland's case, were one or two banks allowed to go under, that probably would have created quite a risk for this country but maybe it would have been a position where there was finality a lot sooner ... but is impossible to predict.<\/p> <p>  There was no question in my mind that a guarantee of sorts had to be applied.  Banks don't make anything, they offer a service which is providing funding for commercial activities.  If there is a failure or a lack of confidence in a bank then there is no control that you have over that and your deposits will run out of the bank.  So if there wasn't a guarantee of some kind - I can't form an opinion as to whether it was the right guarantee or not - but if there was not a guarantee of some kind, the confidence in the banking system here didn't exist and it could have led to a more dramatic and severe outcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#NN01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1430262000,"counter":930,"content":"<p>Do banks not make profits?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#NN02000","speaker":"1160"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430262000,"counter":931,"content":"<p>They do make profits but I mean physical goods, so what you are really ... you're doing ... in those circumstances ... you're not selling off your physical goods but you are going to be at risk if your deposits run and that's what a guarantee is intended to stop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#NN02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1430262000,"counter":932,"content":"<p>Just to finish, Chairman, the drive to keep up with a market share, to protect the franchise, there are terms ... a number of terms that have been used, can I ask your opinion in relation to the attempt to keep up with, potentially, another institution?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#OO00100","speaker":"1160"},{"type":"speech","time":1430262000,"counter":933,"content":"<p>In what timeframe, Senator?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#OO00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1430262000,"counter":934,"content":"<p>From our terms of reference, going back to '91 to 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#OO00300","speaker":"1160"},{"type":"speech","time":1430262000,"counter":935,"content":"<p>All right, final question.

Limits in the past I have seen, have been either indicative, guidelines, or tacitly accepted as too low, many different practices in different countries.  But, again, I regard that as interesting but not the criteria that you manage a bank by.  You yourself have to look to the sustainability of the bank under your fiduciary responsibility and in so doing you have to set the minimum capital and other thresholds that you have, and included in those are concentration risks.  The model which we have in the governance of AIB now is very explicit.  You are going to set limits, with the board's full involvement, to understand in all areas what your limits are at a maximum, whether by sector or individual.  Any breaches of those have to be escalated to the board risk committee, which is chaired by a non-executive, not the executive.  They are raised by the chief risk officer who, in our climate now, does not report to me but reports independently to the chair of the risk committee, who is a board member.  So I think you have to say: is the right answer whether you can or can't breach?  No.  The right answer is: what is the right concentration?  And you should not breach that if you think it's the right concentration.  You set those limits based on your minimum capital and funding thresholds.

They can contribute, and the board contributes to a strategy, but when you are operating the bank, the people who originate must be separately accounted for in terms of those who approve.  So independence of the risk function is fundamental.  On top of that, the chief risk officer should not be reporting to the chief executive.  If you were, as in some banks in the world today, or as accepted, you were the chief executive and you have a chief risk officer and you are paying his bonus or variable compensation, then you cannot say with absolute confidence that there would not be a conflict of interest at some point.  So I think, one of the first things we did was for both audit and risk, made sure the independence of reporting directly to a board member, non-executive, who chairs the risk committee is a fundamental principle of how you should operate.  So that, and then our ... all of our policies, all of our guidelines which I have tried to document in my statement, with limits, with exception reporting explicitly mandated and required to be reviewed at the board, with all of those elements I believe we have the appropriate governance to prevent a re-occurrence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#PP00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1430262000,"counter":963,"content":"<p>In relation to your opening statement on page 3, paragraph seven, you say that the large exposures and approval authorities policy \"replaced the previous Group Large Exposure Policy.\"  Can you tell the committee why you replaced the group large exposure policy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#PP00800","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430262000,"counter":964,"content":"<p>Well, what we did, Deputy, was we felt that best practice governance would tell you that you need to have a strategy which is informed by a risk appetite and therefore you need a risk framework.

The suggestion has been made in many cases that the loan to value were 100%.  I want to put to you the evidence to the committee of Donal Forde and he said in relation to security and loan approval, it is on page 137 of his evidence and he... the quote is:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>the difficulty arose because the security that we held, which in many cases was equity, also began to devalue very quickly.

I think there were circumstances that I saw of that nature.  I think the problem that I could see there is that, a bank should never be the first loss in any lending and putting equity into a transaction puts you in the position of being a first loss there in many circumstances.  Secondly, loan to values have to be very carefully considered; they should not be at 100% in any asset class even with guarantees.  I have seen in the crisis, in my previous bank, a loan to value of 40% become 100% in a matter of five weeks.  So they are an element but they are a spurious element, they cannot be the defining criteria of your lending.  And as I go back to the point, if you are relying again totally on asset valuations, and loan to values against an asset valuation and you have equity in the deal and no cash flow comfort, then you have a much higher risk.

This was presented as an equity position, rarely if ever was it in the form of cash.<\/blockquote>And Mr. Daly then goes on to say<blockquote>In effect, therefore, the banks were providing all of the real cash funding for both acquisitions and development.  It is safe to say that quite often the borrower's paper equity position never paid for an acre of land or concrete or scaffolding or a worker's wage at the end of the week.  The safety zone of a borrower's equity usually existed only on paper.  The result is that the borrower was typically not the first to lose in the event of a crash.

That being said, it was a material concern for us in terms of the absolute level and back when I joined the bank, there were in the ... probably thousands, quite a few thousand, that were, you know, were really just not in our possession or at the level of satisfaction that we would like to have in our possession.  And, it has taken at least three years, to the first part of your question, to materially resolve that issue.  We still have some outstanding issues but we have an agreement in process to try and resolve those and that's going well.

Can you say why ... why would the board not have considered doing its own inquiry as to why a once traditionally conservative bank ended up having to be bailed out by the State with a bill of &euro;20 billion?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#YY01600","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430262000,"counter":1091,"content":"<p>I'm not 100% knowledgeable but I know there were reports produced -----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#YY01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1430262000,"counter":1092,"content":"<p>Yes -----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#YY01800","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430262000,"counter":1093,"content":"<p>... in the past which may have satisfied those obligations.

It's a once in a generation circumstance where the availability of a huge amount of liquidity including retail bank liquidity which wasn't available before in the sense that it was made available as well as geopolitical events where China in order to grow was very much a supporter of a cheap cost of capital through its purchasing of US debt despite the overall levels of debt.<\/p><p>That meant that the US consumer became very heavily indebted and that was a contributor to the property boom.  So there were many macro or geopolitical events that were fuelling cheap funding and property escalation of pricing.  With that there was also a light regulatory universe which ... of all of the asset classes in property many of which were sub-prime, they were packaged and securitised, distributed around the world with a mix of good and bad assets in those packages.  And rating agencies on top of that were rating the majority of these triple A.  So, bad risk was distributed globally with a high rating.  I don't think in history there has ever been a confluence of events around the scale of cheap money and the distribution of risk and the unknown element of risk contained in the securitisations.  That cheap money was allowing every market to chase property and when it collapsed in the sub-prime and then was further influenced by allowing banks to go bankrupt in the US, there were many more banks were very close to going bankrupt.  So the extraordinary measures of the US Government at the time, both negative and positive, if you put all of those together, it is an exceptional period of time.

Now once you put the two of them together you had a whole lot more money, a whole lot more leverage and a whole lot more risk.  A retail bank ... its purpose is, I think Lord Turner many years referred to it as \"socially useful\".  But it is serving the economy you reside in, for the purpose of growth of the economy that you reside in.  Doing so in a way that you're selling products that are suitable to those customers and frankly you should be a boring utility.  That's what banking should be.  It lost the run of itself, it got into all kinds of leverage and chaos that it should not have been in.  So, if you ask the question \"Are some of the regulations better today?\" - yes.  \"Is the process better?\" - some of it's a pendulum swing and maybe it's going too far in terms of the bureaucracy sometimes, but the spirit of what the intent is, I fully support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#ZZ00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1430262000,"counter":1103,"content":"<p>Can I ask you about the appropriateness of the transfer in August 2012 of &euro;1.1 billion from the company's balance sheet into your pension fund.

And in today's environment we have barely crawled out of it, and we are already starting to talk about how much all the margins or rates should be cut.  We have to be very careful.

There is another bank on twice that income.  Same jobs, same street, a bus stop away, massively different.  I think it is very specific to the circumstances.  The one thing I would say about compensation and I believe this passionately; it is not so much the number, it is who bears the risk with that number.  My practical example, if you will forgive me for a second Senator, is I am used to a culture where I was paid a variable amount of compensation.  It was deferred for three years pending the performance of the bank.  It was put in the shares of the bank, and if the shares of the bank tanked then I lost it.  At the end of that, it was also subject to a malice clause which is matching the duration of risk to the duration of my bonus and could be ... and 100% could be clawed back.  So philosophically, I believe that is the only way you pay variable compensation and if there was a model in the future that allowed for that, the market drove it, investors drove it, I would very much believe that that is the kind of structure you put in a bank.

Yes, yes, well that was kind of looking forward for how do we prevent what's happened in the past.  But in relation to your opening statement you talk about the need to deleverage to meet the newly-proposed Basel III ratios and also the demands of the Troika.  How has AIB deleveraged its loan portfolio, and can you give us a sense of the type of loans that AIB deleveraged?  In your view, if it wasn't for the Troika's demand would AIB have been better to hold on to them for a while longer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#KKK00700","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430262000,"counter":1289,"content":"<p>I think the answer to that, Deputy, is that of the &euro;20 billion of loans there was a lot of overseas UK property, which was non-core to our activity at the end of the day.  There was some miscellaneous property portfolios around this country which we probably would have sold, and there was some which, in the benefit of hindsight, if we'd seen the speed of the recovery, you might keep.  So there's no explicit black and white answer, it's a combination of the above.  But I think the significant portion of that portfolio would have been for sale in any case.  It has allowed us, additionally, create the space in our capital structure to lend at the levels which we're seeing today, which is new lending stimulating the economy, and more valuable therefore, so a little bit of positive comes out of it in any case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#KKK00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1430262000,"counter":1290,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015042900002#KKK00900","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1430262000,"counter":1291,"content":"<p>Very, very last question, Mr. Duffy.
