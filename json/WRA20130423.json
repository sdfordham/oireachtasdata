The combined wholesale and retail sector in Ireland employs 273,000 people.  The sector also supports employment in other related services, such as transport and logistics.  A number of new measures of particular assistance to retail businesses under pressure have been introduced by this Government including: the introduction of the Micro Finance Loan Fund and Credit Guarantee Scheme; reform of wage setting mechanisms and removal from the JLCs of the setting of a Sunday premium; extension of seed capital and employment and investment incentive scheme to the retail sector and reduction of employers PRSI and a low rate of VAT for certain sectors.<\/p><p>  In recognising the importance of the retail sector to the economy, the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 contains a number of measures aimed at supporting the sector.  These include an initiative to increase the number of small businesses trading on-line and an initiative to streamline business licence application procedures.  The retail sector has been chosen to pilot the licencing initiative as it is one of the sectors which requires a multiplicity of licences and where the positive impact of streamlining the application process can be realised fairly quickly.  The intention is that an integrated licensing application system, incorporating up to 25 licences in the retail sector, will be developed in 2013. Additionally, the Government has committed to strengthening the Credit Review Office to deal with problems in getting access to finance and integration of local authority business support into a stronger local enterprise office to support the emergence of a better local environment for micro and small businesses.<\/p><p>  The Government has also committed, in the Action Plan for Jobs, to establishing an Interdepartmental Group to undertake a short examination of further possible measures to assist the retail sector, which could, for example, be considered in the context of the Budget or the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs. The Group will comprise key Government Departments and will consult with relevant stakeholders across the retail sector as part of its work.

IDA has transformed its investment profile with RDI projects increasing from &euro;80m in 2004 to &euro;700m in 2011 - representing some 50% of IDA investment wins. It was most encouraging to see that the recent European Commission&rsquo;s Innovation Union Scoreboard, published in spring 2013, shows Ireland retaining its position among those EU Member States with above average performance in their research and innovation systems.  In addition, improvements have taken place in Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness, reflected in the fact that, in 2012, Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness ranking improved four places from 24th in 2011, to 20th in the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook for 2012.<\/p><p>  IBM&rsquo;s Global Location Trends Report of 2012 places Ireland:<\/p><p>  - 1st in the world for inward investment by quality and value;<\/p><p>  - 1st in Europe for jobs created in Research and Development;<\/p><p>  - 1st in Europe for investment in the pharmaceutical sector; and,<\/p><p>  - 2nd is Europe and 4th globally for the number of investment jobs per capita.<\/p><p>  In a modern economy, highly innovative sectors deliver high returns. In Ireland, we have some of the largest and most dynamic medical device and pharmaceutical companies in the world. Nine of the top 10 pharmaceutical companies in the world have a base in Ireland, as do eight of the top 10 medtech companies. The life sciences sector in Ireland accounts for over 50,000 jobs and &euro;50 billion worth of exports. High value added, productive manufacturing is increasingly dynamic, sophisticated and innovative and requires investment in research and development. Statistics show that exports from R&amp;amp;D performing companies have increased from &euro;44bn in 2003 to &euro;111bn in 2011, while for non R&amp;amp;D performing companies, exports decreased from &euro;48bn to &euro;30bn over the same period.  This clearly demonstrates the significant contribution investment in R&amp;amp;D makes to the national recovery effort.<\/p><p>  There are a number of factors which are likely to affect growth in industry; export-led growth is essential for a return to sustainable economic recovery and it is identified as a key component of the Programme for Government. Cost competitiveness is a critical foundation of international competitiveness and we are cognisant that we must use research and innovation to build a competitive advantage. Irish cost competitiveness has improved markedly over the last three years and we need to ensure this improvement continues.  Continued innovation in products and services is also crucial in building a competitive advantage.  Measures designed to support industry growth are set out in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 and include improved access to finance by SMEs, further improving our skills base, encouraging entrepreneurship and supporting start\u2010up activity, assisting our businesses to grow, and developing and deepening opportunities from global investment. Building competitive advantage is also a key driver of growth and the Action Plan includes a particular focus on using Research and Innovation to drive job creation.<\/p><p>  In this context, the Government&rsquo;s strategy is to accelerate the economic and societal return on our STI investment, especially in terms of sustainable jobs.  In particular we aim to further strengthen enterprise engagement with and take-up of public research and to drive commercialisation. A number of initiatives are being rolled out across Government in support of this strategy.  Implementation across Government Departments and agencies of the recommendations in the report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group seeks to maximise the impact of our spend by focussing the majority of public competitive research funding on 14 priority areas which are most likely to deliver societal and economic impact. Other initiatives include expanding the remit of Science Foundation Ireland to cover applied research; a new Intellectual Property Protocol which gives more clarity and certainty around ownership of IP emerging from state funded research; the establishment of a Central Technology Transfer Office to act as a one stop shop providing an effective interface between industry and the research community; and the R&amp;amp;D tax credit scheme which continues to encourage business to invest in research.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300055#WRA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights Issues","counter":17,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300055#WRA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":18,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[18594\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300055#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the action he proposes to take to deal with the position of workers whose contract of employment expires on their sixty-fifth birthday, a year before the official State pension age; if he has any legislative proposals to allow for contracts to be extended at the request of workers in these circumstances, or to ban the making of long-term employment contracts that are not aligned with the State pension age; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1178","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":19,"content":"<p>There is no statutory retirement age for employees in the private sector in Ireland.

The informal discussions focused on better ways of co-ordinating economic and fiscal policies as well as enhancing the social dimension of the EMU, including social dialogue. <\/p><p>  Deliberations at the formal Council meeting included political agreement being reached on the Youth Guarantee.  This is a significant achievement for our Presidency.  The Council Recommendation is that each Member State should ensure that every young person under the age of 25 receives a quality offer of employment, or of continued education, an apprenticeship or traineeship, within four months of becoming unemployed.  When implemented, the Youth Guarantee will contribute to three out of the five Europe 2020 targets by:<\/p><p>  - increasing the employment rate,<\/p><p>  - reducing the extent of early school leaving, and<\/p><p>  - lifting people out of poverty and social exclusion.<\/p><p>  There were two policy debates during the Council.  Minister Burton chaired a lunch time debate on &ldquo;Pension rights to support Labour Mobility&rdquo; while I chaired a debate on the &ldquo;European Semester&rdquo;.  There was broad support for the valuable role the Semester process plays in working towards our Europe 2020 targets.  EPSCO also adopted the Commission&rsquo;s 2013 Joint Employment Report and Council Conclusions on the Annual Growth Survey.

In the areas specific to the EPSCO Council, it identified the need for Member States to address the following priorities:<\/p><p>  - active employment, social and labour market policies with particular priority to be given to promoting youth employment;<\/p><p>  - better performing education and training systems, ensuring that young people are equipped with the right skills and linking the worlds of work and education more effectively;<\/p><p>  - continued application to increasing female labour participation rates, reducing long term unemployment and ensuring full participation of older workers;<\/p><p>  - tackling the social consequences of the crisis and fight poverty and social exclusion.<\/p><p>  The Commission introduced its proposal for a Social Investment Package (SIP).  The measures in the package are aimed at enhancing people's capacities to support better involvement in society and better participation in the labour market.

Energy Costs remain relatively high in Ireland, particularly for SMEs.  While Ireland is the sixth most expensive location from 15 countries benchmarked, the cost of water for industrial users remains relatively unchanged since 2007. Waste costs in Ireland remain relatively high, particularly for landfill, while Ireland is also relatively expensive for broadband, particularly when broadband quality is considered.<\/p><p>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs process, Forf&aacute;s undertook a study to identify changes in the operation of sectoral regulators that would enhance cost competitiveness. The sectors examined in the report are energy, telecommunications, transport, waste and water. The report, which was published yesterday, also assesses Ireland&rsquo;s cost performance in these sectors relative to our key competitor countries and the drivers of costs, in particular what drivers are within and outside our control in each of the sectors studied. <\/p><p>  The study finds that in many cases policy actions have a more significant impact on cost competitiveness than regulatory changes. The report suggests that there are a number of areas where changes to the operation of sectoral regulators could have a real and positive impact on cost competitiveness.

The Act provides for a radical overhaul of the system so as to make it fairer and more responsive to changing economic circumstances and labour market conditions.  It reinstates a robust system of protection for low paid and vulnerable workers in these sectors in the aftermath of the July 2011 High Court ruling in the John Grace Fried Chicken case.<\/p><p>  Workers that were in employment in a JLC sector prior to the July 2011 judgment, continue, unless otherwise agreed with their employer, to be covered by their individual contracts of employment and enjoy the terms set out in the ERO that was in place up to 7 July 2011. Workers who commenced employment in those sectors after 7 July 2011 are covered by the full suite of employment rights legislation, including the National Minimum Wage Act, the Organisation of Working Time Act and the Payment of Wages Act.  The 2012 Act also provides that a Review of each Joint Labour Committee be carried out by the Labour Court. The aim of the review is to ensure that the range of sectors and enterprises to which they apply remains appropriate, with consequent changes to their Establishment Orders if necessary. That Review was completed on 12 April 2013. <\/p><p>  The review assisted the Labour Court&rsquo;s  deliberations as to whether any JLC should be abolished, maintained in its current form, amalgamated with another JLC or its establishment order amended and the Labour Court is required to make recommendations to me to this effect.

However, the Government acknowledges that we have a long way to go.  If we are to sustain and accelerate this positive movement, we must continue a relentless focus across Government on jobs and competitiveness.  The challenge now is to build on the progress we have made, work harder, deliver more ambitious change &ndash; and we are determined to do that to tackle our number one priority and create the jobs we need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300055#WRA04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Numbers","counter":65,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300056#WRB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":66,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[18634\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300056#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the jobs that have been secured for each county by each of the trade missions in the past 12 months.","asker":"984","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":67,"content":"<p>During 2012, I led 20 Trade and Investment missions with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to countries such as the United States, China, Canada, South Africa, Russia, Brazil and Germany.<\/p><p>Each year Enterprise Ireland organises a series of targeted international trade missions, market visits, participation in international trade fairs and a large number of international buyer visits to Ireland for the purpose of assisting Irish firms target and secure international contracts and overseas partners.  Contracts and commitments worth over &euro;200 million to the Irish Economy were signed during the trade missions organised by Enterprise Ireland in 2012.  These contracts, together with the other business links established during the events, have helped grow and sustain jobs in Enterprise Ireland client companies.  In 2012 Enterprise Ireland client company employment totalled more than 169,000 on a full and part time basis, representing a growth in full time jobs of 3,338 in the year.<\/p><p>The Investment missions organised by IDA Ireland are more intimate in style. Typically, the programme involves meeting with Chairpersons, CEOs and other senior executives of leading companies, across all sectors.  Some of the companies which I met during 2012 already had substantial and valuable activities in Ireland and those meetings focussed on retaining, expanding and further embedding their presence here.  For companies who do not have a presence in Ireland, the focus was to underpin Ireland as a location for the proposed investment against intense competition from other locations around the world.<\/p><p>Immediate job creation is not expected from this type of mission as, typically, jobs are created over a period of between 3 and 5 years, depending on the company&rsquo;s business plan. I should point out, however, that IDA client companies created a total of 12,722 jobs during 2012. The net number of new jobs created at 6,570 represented the third consecutive year of growth in net employment, while job losses in IDA client companies were the lowest in a decade.<\/p><p>Details of

One of the key objectives of my Department is that of ensuring the protection of employment rights and worker health and safety. This objective is shared across a number of other Government Departments at a sectoral level.<\/p><p>  In the case of the Tit Bonhomme, I welcome the response of the lead Department in this instance, the Department of Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, to the Marine Casualty Investigation Board (MCIB) report into the sinking of the Tit Bonhomme. That Department is in the process of implementing all of the safety recommendations in the MCIB report. I note in particular, the intent to enforce the European Community (Workers on board sea-going fishing Vessels) (Organisation of Working Time) Regulations, 2003 (S.I.709 of 2003). This along with the implementation of the other recommendations will greatly assist in encouraging a strong safety culture at sea.<\/p><p>  My Department's remit in this respect is generally limited to cases where there is an employer &ndash; employee relationship. Fishermen very often work on a profit sharing basis and as such are not deemed to be employees. I am aware of the contention that there are illegal workers operating in the industry. In terms of employees working illegally, this can arise where there is an employer-employee relationship and where the employee requires, but does not hold, an employment permit, or where an employee has not been granted permission to reside in the State by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>  In this respect, my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality informs me that from an immigration perspective all non-EEA national migrants, whether working or not, must have the appropriate permission to be in the State. While there may be atypical elements to the situation where the person spends much of their time at sea, the general principle still applies. The Minister further points out that because a person may elect not to abide by the rules does not imply that the onus is on the State to regularise - far from it.  However, any migrant who is in the State in breach of immigration laws may apply to the immigration authorities for permission to be in the State and would be strongly advised to do so. Such applications would have to be considered on their individual merits rather than as a class but it can never be to the non-EEA national's advantage to endure exploitative working conditions for fear of possible deportation.<\/p><p>  My Department wishes to satisfy itself that it is fulfilling its functions where they may relate to the issue of worker safety at sea and the enforcement of employment rights. In the case of my Department, while its remit in this respect is limited to cases where there are employer &ndash; employee relationships there may be potential for my Department to contribute to the overall response. Therefore, I will be writing to my colleagues the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Minister for Justice and Equality offering my Department&rsquo;s support and assistance in any cross Government process whereby the State seeks to apply better regulation to this sector for the benefit of those who work within it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300056#WRB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Development","counter":85,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300056#WRB02200"},{"type":"question","counter":86,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[18347\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300056#WRB02300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the difficulty in attracting significant new industry to County Kerry; if his further attention has been drawn to the fact that this problem has existed for many years before the current crisis; if he will formulate a specific plan to tackle County Kerry's problems; if he will prioritise a visit to County Kerry to meet with industry leaders, local authority and educational leaders and agency representative; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":87,"content":"<p>I am informed by IDA Ireland that, having regard to its statutory responsibility for attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to Ireland, it will continue to promote Kerry as part of its marketing efforts, in response to specific client queries and also on an opportunistic basis.<\/p><p>  At the end of 2012 there were 12 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kerry with total employment of circa 1,600 people.  In accordance with its Horizon 2020 Strategy, IDA Ireland continues to engage with these client companies in order to transform the existing FDI base with a view to developing, retaining and growing employment opportunities. This is given particular emphasis in respect of client companies in Kerry, who are located outside of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s main Gateway locations.<\/p><p>  The provision of flexible and cost effective property and infrastructure solutions is a key aspect in developing regional value propositions and in attracting FDI. In this regard IDA Ireland will continue to market all available land and buildings in County Kerry and work with local authorities and property developers to deliver appropriate solutions in response to potential investors&rsquo; needs.<\/p><p>  IDA Ireland has indicated that, in seeking to win FDI, the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services. Ireland has only one such Metro Region, the Greater Dublin area, so, in order to achieve balanced regional economic development, the Agency prioritises the marketing of its Gateway locations within each Region. The Gateway locations in the Mid-West and South West Regions include Limerick and Cork. However, IDA Ireland also highlights the opportunities provided by other locations such as the linked hubs in County Kerry of Killarney and Tralee, which are within commuting distances of the Gateways of Limerick and Cork.<\/p><p>  In 2012 I attended a briefing meeting on the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 in Tralee, along with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Mr. Jimmy Deenihan and all of the relevant enterprise support agencies.

This analysis, which will be undertaken later this year, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, any changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that may be introduced in the near future and our agreed approach to regional development.<\/p><p>  Meanwhile IDA's commitment to delivering business to County Kerry continues and, while globally the outlook for FDI continues to be challenging, there are still investment opportunities in global markets.

Rental costs for new leases of office space in Dublin, for example have decreased by 45 per cent between 2007 and 2011. Of course, I recognise that many existing businesses are tied into higher property costs having purchased or leased property with upward only rent review clauses during the property boom.<\/p><p>  The Government has taken steps to address the issue of upward only rent reviews where possible. In the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, the Government undertook to place downward pressure on commercial rents where the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) had acquired the loan on the underlying property.

Donegal's industry base is transforming from the clothing and textile industry to high tech, high skill activity. Accordingly, IDA Ireland continues to work with its existing client base to encourage them to transform and expand their existing operations while actively encouraging new investment in Donegal in knowledge based industries and high-end manufacturing, mainly to companies in the medical technologies sector. In October 2012 KeyedIn solutions announced its plans to establish a software development centre in Letterkenny with the creation of 20 highly skilled jobs over a period of three years.<\/p><p>  The challenge facing IDA Ireland is to continue to win top quality investment for Ireland in a very challenging global environment.  International competition for FDI has become extremely intense and continues to increase. Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world class physical and digital infrastructure as well as the availability of sophisticated, professional and business support services. Consequently, when marketing potential locations for site visit to clients, IDA Ireland has to be credible and competitive in its approach, in the face of stiff international competition for FDI, as locations must meet the criteria of the client company in respect of skills, labour, site and\/or buildings and infrastructure.  Donegal is part of IDA's North West Region, along with Counties Leitrim and Sligo, and this Region has two urban centres of sufficient scale - Letterkenny and Sligo- to meet these criteria.<\/p><p>  IDA Ireland has also assured me that it continues to focus on the designated linked Gateway of Letterkenny\/Derry.

In general, Irish law does not try to impose a solution on parties to an industrial relations dispute, but rather is designed to help support the parties in resolving their differences. Employer and trade union interests have remained committed to this approach in the interest of the harmonious conduct of industrial relations for more than half a century. The State takes a supportive role, by providing a framework and institutions through which good industrial relations can prosper, rather than an interventionist one. Institutions such as the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court were established to assist in the resolution of disputes between employers and workers.<\/p><p>  The experience and expertise of the State's industrial relations machinery offers the best avenue for resolving issues in dispute. In this context, it is expected that the parties to a dispute come to the process in good faith and consequently are prepared to give serious consideration to the decisions or recommendations made.  Recommendations of the Labour Court are not legally binding. Neither the Labour Court, not I, can compel a company or its employees to comply with such a recommendation. Ultimately, responsibility for the settlement of a trade dispute rests with the parties involved.  I have no plans to make any changes to Industrial Relations Acts which would compel either party to a dispute to accept a Labour Court recommendation in disputes referred under those Acts.<\/p><p>  With regard to employment rights legislation, I currently have discretion to pursue enforcement proceedings on behalf of claimants under certain employment rights enactments. This role is carried out by the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) on my behalf. Alternatively, individual claimants can take enforcement proceedings themselves or through their trade union.  In order to have credibility, a system of employment rights adjudication must be backed up by an efficient and effective enforcement regime. Therefore, there is a need for a robust method of enforcement of awards.<\/p><p>  As you may be aware, I have commenced a root and branch reform of the State&rsquo;s Workplace Relations Services. The reforms which I propose to introduce will include improved measures to secure the enforcement of awards made by the State's Workplace Relations adjudication bodies.  The Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill, which will give legislative effect to the new Workplace Relations structures, has been approved by Government for priority drafting and I hope to publish this Bill during 2013.  As part of this Reform Programme, I propose to put in place a more robust method of enforcement of awards. It is proposed that there will be an Enforcement Section within the new structures that will implement the revised enforcement system, where the District Court will have considerable enforcement powers in relation to decisions of Adjudication Officers of the WRC and determinations of the Labour Court.<\/p><p>  I am confident that the measures which I propose to introduce in the Workplace Relations Bill will provide a legislative basis to facilitate the more effective enforcement of awards made under the reformed Workplace Relations adjudication structures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300056#WRB03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Issues","counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300056#WRB03700"},{"type":"question","counter":101,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[18598\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300056#WRB03800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his plans to develop State led research opportunities for the 4,000 post doctoral graduates who are currently unemployed whose skills could be used to spearhead innovation and job creation opportunities.","asker":"1015","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":102,"content":"<p>Through the Action Plan for Jobs, the Government is providing the basis for increased employment opportunities for graduates, particularly in growing and emerging sectors that rely on high knowledge and skills levels.

One of the ambitions outlined in the Plan is that, by 2018, Ireland will have the highest percentage of computing graduates as a proportion of all tertiary graduates.

The balance of the cost is covered by the company.<\/p><p><br \/>  - <b>Participation on an Outward\/Trade Mission<\/b> - A mission participation fee of &euro;500 is sought per participating company. The fee represents a contribution toward receptions, group transport\/transfers and administration. Additional costs may be levied directly to the client depending on the specifics of the trade mission.<\/p><p><br \/>  - <b>Participation at Trade Fairs<\/b> - Enterprise Ireland seeks to recoup 50% of the total gross costs (floor space, design and construction costs and any additional costs of client companies' participation on the stand) of the space they occupy or benefit from.  Enterprise Ireland pays 100% of the space it occupies on the stand.<\/p><p><br \/>  County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) support micro enterprises through direct grant aid and training and support measures - the latter being subsidised by the Boards.  The Board may charge fees to clients for participation in their training or mentoring programmes.  Whilst these charges are based on a number of factors - such as trainer costs - the CEBs will always consider the participant's ability to pay.  If the participant is unemployed, the Board may decide to waive the fee.  CEBs also provide a facility to pay by way of installments.  Fees for specific interventions such as the National Mentoring Scheme provide for a fixed rate of payment to the mentor.  Management Development courses are usually offered through a package of interventions.  These include various training elements at a set fee. <\/p><p><br \/>  The two Enterprise Agencies who report to my Department and who have significant property portfolios, namely IDA Ireland and Shannon Development, have confirmed that, where businesses are in difficulties, they have, on a case by case basis, responded to and facilitated companies' requests for reduced rent and will continue to do so.  I can assure the Deputy that the Enterprise Development Agencies continually seek to keep fees to a minimum. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300057#WRC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":126,"content":"<p>Question No. 139 answered with Question No. 111.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Targets","counter":127,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300057#WRC01250"},{"type":"question","counter":128,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[18577\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300057#WRC01300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which he expects to achieve targets in respect of job retention and job creation; if he has identified any particular issues likely to impact on performance in this regard; the degree to which he expects an increase in job creation in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":129,"content":"<p>In the Action Plan for Jobs, the Government has set an ambitious target of having 100,000 more people at work by 2016.  As I have pointed out previously to the House, achieving this target requires a transformational change to our economy.  This Government, when it came into office, was starting from a position where more than 250,000 private sector jobs had been lost in the previous three years. This was primarily the result of relying, for a number of years, on economic growth fuelled by a property price and construction sector bubble. <\/p><p>  The new economy which we need to build must be based on enterprise, innovation and exporting.  The transformation which we need to bring about will require progress on a number of fronts, including fixing our banking systems, reforming the public sector and embedding a jobs agenda across Government through the Action Plan for Jobs.  Key areas which I have been working on directly to support job creation by enterprise include improving access to finance for businesses, reforming the statutory wage setting mechanisms, reducing other costs and administrative burdens for enterprise, improving our export performance, and supporting innovation.  Details of progress on these measures are available in the Quarterly Progress Reports on the Action Plan for Jobs which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>  This is a huge task, but we are making progress. We are climbing back up the international competitiveness tables again; our exports are at record high levels, not even seen at the peak of the boom; IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland had their best years for jobs growth in 2012 for ten years and five years respectively and overall, the level of private sector employment is stabilising.<\/p><p>  While these signs of recovery are welcome there is much more to be done to get more of our people back to work. That is why the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs is more ambitious than the 2012 Plan and it introduces the idea of Disruptive Reforms, seven significant projects that require cross Government collaboration that can make a real difference to enterprise and jobs. The goals attached to them are ambitious in nature and they have aggressive timescales in which they will be delivered. They will also require new ways of working.<\/p><p>  We are making real progress, but I do not underestimate the scale of the challenge that still faces us.  As a small open economy, we are influenced heavily by the challenging developments in international markets.  However, the merit of the Action Plan for Jobs is that every year, each Department is required to focus on changes that can be brought about to make a practical contribution to the target of supporting the creation of 100,000 extra jobs in the economy by 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300057#WRC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Travel","counter":130,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300057#WRC01450"},{"type":"question","counter":131,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[18348\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300057#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will report on his visit to Germany; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":132,"content":"<p>As part of the Governments Ministerial-led St Patrick&rsquo;s Day &ldquo;Promote Ireland&rdquo; programme, I undertook a 4-day, 4-city trade, investment and tourism mission to Germany.

The final outturn for the Uganda aid programme in 2012 was &euro;15.54 million.  An interim Aid Programme for Uganda has been put in place for 2013 with a budget of &euro;16.4 million.

Ireland, together with our EU partners and other international donors in Uganda, has engaged actively on the issue of this draft legislation since it first arose in 2009.  The draft Bill was re-introduced in 2012, but has not yet been formally tabled in Parliament. The position of the Government of Uganda on the proposed law is that it was presented as a private member&rsquo;s bill and is not part of the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme.  President Museveni and the Cabinet have publicly stated that the Bill is unnecessary.  He has also made a commitment to engage members of Parliament on the implications of this Bill for Uganda&rsquo;s international relations and reputation.  <\/p><p>  I raised the issue directly with President Museveni when I visited Uganda last July and our Ambassador in Kampala has also continued to follow developments closely.  She and other EU Ambassadors have outlined our serious concerns in several meetings at the highest levels in Uganda.  The Ugandan Government and other interested parties are in no doubt about the Irish Government&rsquo;s profound concerns on this issue.  Ireland, in conjunction with our EU partners and the wider donor community, remains committed to ensuring that citizens of Uganda do not suffer violence or discrimination on the grounds of their sexual orientation.

The Bill is a very positive development which, if adopted, would help to end the great hardship and uncertainty faced by undocumented Irish in the US and their families here in Ireland.  The inclusion of a new provision to allow several thousand Irish citizens to legally avail of employment opportunities in the US every year is also particularly welcome.  <\/p><p>  Both of these issues have been a key focus of my ongoing engagement with political leaders in the US, particularly during my visit to Washington D.C. over St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day when I discussed them with Ireland&rsquo;s key friends on Capitol Hill and in the Administration.  The Government has maintained close contact since publication of the Bill with the key players through our Embassy in Washington.  I am conscious that the overall issues involved are complex and sensitive ones within the US political system and that much further debate is likely to be required before the final shape of any overall legislation becomes clear. <\/p><p>  The plight of the undocumented remains a top priority for Government and we have worked closely with the bi-partisan group of Senators and other legislators in the run-up to the publication of this Bill.

More than 4,000 schools have been destroyed or are no longer operational, and hundreds of thousands of children are being denied a basic education. One out of every two refugees from the conflict is a child.  <\/p><p>  When I visited al-Zaatari refugee camp on the Syria-Jordan border last August, all the refugees I spoke to were clear that eland&rsquo;s assistance was greatly needed. Although Syria&rsquo;s neighbours, including Jordan, were making a major effort to support Syrians affected by the crisis, they were already under strain because of the scale of the challenge and the steady escalation of needs. Earlier this month, the T&aacute;naiste visited refugee camps in southern Turkey and witnessed the major humanitarian effort underway there to support Syrian refugees. This visit further confirmed our belief that the international community has a duty to move immediately to help protect the lives and dignity of the beleaguered Syrian population. eland has responded generously to the humanitarian crisis in Syria and neighbouring countries.  To date, through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Government has provided over &euro;8.15 million in humanitarian assistance.  This has been channelled through long-standing and reputable partners such as the World Food Programme (WFP), the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the UN Children&rsquo;s Fund (UNICEF) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).   They have a demonstrated track record of effective humanitarian response in Syria, with strong strategies for targeting and delivery and robust systems for monitoring and accountability.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s humanitarian support is allocated through the Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Fund managed by ish Aid. The specific objective of this fund is to save and protect lives in acute crisis situations on the basis of independently assessed humanitarian needs. It is designed to finance activities that provide protection for civilians, the delivery of clean safe water, sanitation services, food, shelter, healthcare, or other forms of assistance necessary to sustain life in natural or manmade disaster situations.  <\/p><p>  I believe that the ish people strongly support the provision of much-needed humanitarian support for people whose lives and livelihoods are being destroyed by the conflict in Syria.  We are continuing to monitor the situation in the region in order to assess the most effective way in which eland can continue to contribute to relief of suffering among the civilian population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300058#WRD01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Remuneration","counter":187,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300058#WRD01750"},{"type":"question","counter":188,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[18870\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300058#WRD01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the number of civil\/public servants under the remit of his Department who earn more than &euro;500,000, between &euro;400,000-&euro;500,00, &euro;300,000 - &euro;250,000, &euro;250,000 - &euro;200,000, &euro;200,000 - &euro;150,000, &euro;150,000 - &euro;100,000, &euro;100,000 - &euro;80,000, &euro;80,000 - &euro;60,000, &euro;60,000 - &euro;40,000 and less than &euro;30,000.","asker":"1017","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":189,"content":"<p>The table below sets out the range of earnings within my Department.

In accordance with the legislation, it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the amount of LPT due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  The level of household income, or the number of residents in the household, has no bearing on the amount of LPT due.<\/p><p><br \/>  The initial valuation of a property on 1 May 2013, assuming it is made in good faith, will be valid up to and including 2016 and will not be affected by any increase or decrease in property prices or other changes, during this period. A system of deferral arrangements for owner-occupiers is available, one of which is dependent on the level of the owner's annual income. Where a property owner qualifies for deferral, interest will be charged on LPT amounts deferred at a rate of 4% per annum and the deferred amount, including the interest, will attach to the property and will have to be paid before the property is sold or transferred.

An increased gross income threshold applies in the case of properties occupied as a sole or main residence and subject to a mortgage.

Fuel laundering imposes significant costs on the community and poses a serious threat to tax yield and to legitimate businesses.  As part of its strategy to curb illegal activity in this area, Revenue strengthened licensing requirements for traders in auto fuels in 2011 to limit the ability of fuel criminals to get laundered fuel onto the market.  A new licensing requirement was introduced for traders in marked fuel oil from 1 October 2012 to limit the ability of fuel criminals to source marked fuel for laundering.  In addition, Revenue introduced new supply chain controls requiring all licensed fuel retailers to make monthly returns to Revenue, from 1 January 2013, of their fuel transactions, which will provide assurance about the distribution of all fuels and identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and distribution patterns.<\/p><p>  In the period 2011 to 2012, over 2 million litres of fuel was seized, 20 fuel laundries were detected and closed and 89 filling stations were closed because they were unlicensed or in breach of licensing conditions.<\/p><p>  In view of the links between organised criminals and the illegal fuel trade, Revenue works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other law enforcement agencies.  A Cross-Border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group, involving all relevant agencies from the State and from Northern Ireland, facilitates co-operation among these agencies in dealing with the illegal fuel trade.  Arising from its work, a number of groups operating in both jurisdictions and involved in the production and distribution of laundered diesel, have been targeted for investigation.<\/p><p>  In addition, Revenue and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in the United Kingdom are pursuing jointly a new and more effective fuel marker for common use in both jurisdictions.  A Memorandum of Understanding was agreed in 2012 by Revenue and HMRC and work on the project is proceeding.  A joint &lsquo;Invitation to Make Submissions&rsquo; (IMS), which issued in June 2012, generated international interest and twelve submissions were received by the closing date.  These submissions are being evaluated jointly at present by Revenue and HMRC on the basis of agreed scientific, legal and operational criteria.<\/p><p>  The question of introducing a rebate scheme for users of marked gas oil has been addressed in previous parliamentary debates.  A change to a system of this nature would involve the establishment of an expensive repayments system and would give rise to significant costs and place an administrative burden on oil traders, users and the Revenue Commissioners.  It would also pose significant cash-flow costs for those currently using marked gas oil.  Marked gas oil has a wide range of uses such as the propulsion of trains, the operation of agricultural, construction and industrial machinery, commercial sea-navigation (including fishing) and for commercial and home heating purposes.  Any change in the existing system would therefore impact across a wide range of users.  In addition, repayment schemes are vulnerable to abuse and the introduction of a wide-ranging scheme such as that proposed would not necessarily offer greater security against fraud than the current arrangements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300059#WRE00600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Collection","counter":224,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300059#WRE00650"},{"type":"question","counter":225,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[19131\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300059#WRE00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will clarify the position regarding a person (details supplied) in Dublin 12 and the collection of property tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1030","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":226,"content":"<p>The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that Revenue is responsible for the administration of Local Property Tax (LPT).

In line with this principle, the majority of social welfare payments are reckonable as income for tax purposes.  These include long-term payments such as Disablement Benefit, the State Pension, Widows, Invalidity and Blind Pensions, Carers Allowance and the One Parent Family Payment, as well as short term benefits such as Job Seekers Benefit. Treating these payments as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.<\/p><p>  As a result of maternity benefit payments becoming liable to income tax for all claimants, from 1 July 2013, a number of possible tax outcomes could arise:<\/p><p>1.  An individual may pay no income tax on their maternity benefit payment as their tax credits will be sufficient to reduce their tax liability to zero.<\/p><p>2.  An individual may pay income tax on some or all of their maternity benefit payment solely at the standard rate.<\/p><p>3.  An individual may pay income tax at the standard rate on a portion of the maternity benefit and the higher rate on the balance of the maternity benefit payment.<\/p><p>4.  An individual may pay income tax on all of their maternity benefit payment at the higher rate.<\/p><p>  I am fully aware that some employers do not pay a top up payment to their employees whilst on maternity leave.  However, in such circumstances many mothers will not be subject to income tax on their maternity benefit payments as their personal credits will ensure that no tax arises on the social welfare income itself.  Of course, the extent, if any, to which taxation actually arises in a given case depends on the level of income that a recipient has in a tax year.  Accordingly, the tax liability on maternity benefit payments will ultimately depend on the total income of the individual or couple concerned in the tax year or years concerned.<\/p><p>  There are situations currently where an employee continues to be paid by her employer, while on maternity leave and, based on her PRSI contributions, is entitled to Maternity Benefit from the Department of Social Protection.  The non-taxation of such benefit currently results in an employee having a greater net take-home pay for the period of maternity benefit, than if she was at work.  The rates of Maternity Benefit are earnings-related and are set to reflect post-tax income.  It was never intended that individuals would gain financially by being on maternity leave.  The introduction of the charge to income tax on maternity benefit payments will ensure that those with identical incomes will be treated the same for income tax purposes.<\/p><p>  I would point out though, that maternity benefit payments will remain exempt from Universal Social Charge and PRSI.  Given the current budgetary constraints I have no plans to introduce a tax exemption along the lines proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300059#WRE01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Exemptions","counter":236,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300059#WRE01550"},{"type":"question","counter":237,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[18226\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300059#WRE01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide details of the exemptions in property value for persons who have a disability in respect of the local property tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":238,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my detailed reply to Parliamentary Question No. 115 on 27 March last.

It can only happen in very narrowly defined situations.  A person, whose mortgage on their home or on a rental property, for example, is partly written-off, will not suffer any income tax charge on the write-off. <\/p><p><br \/>  Since 1970, the income tax code provides for the write-off of trade debts to be treated as a receipt of income in the year of write-off. However, carried-forward losses in the trade up to that time can be set against that income and may well reduce the charge to zero.  This applies to all traders and professionals, whether in insolvency or not.  This year's Finance Act (section 18) introduced a similar provision relating to the write-off of loans used to acquire and develop land as part of a trade of land dealing or development. The new provision operates in the same way as the 1970 provision but is even more restricted in that it only applies to land dealers and developers.  From an income tax point of view, the consequences of debt write-off are exactly the same, whether insolvency is involved or not.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am further informed by the Commissioners, that within the past month, they have made it clear, publicly, that where for bona fide commercial reasons, a financial institution enters into a debt restructuring, forgiveness or write-off arrangement with a customer, then Revenue's approach is to accept that the financial institution is not intent on making a gift to the debtor and, consequently, no charge to Capital Acquisitions Tax will arise.  However, where the bona fides of such arrangements are open to question or tax avoidance is involved, then this approach does not apply.<\/p><p><br \/>  There are no<b><\/b>capital gains tax or value added tax implications associated with any benefit that might arise to a debtor from the writing-down or writing-off of a debt under the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  In summary, I can say that in the majority of cases of personal insolvency, which may involve mortgage default on family homes and which will come within the ambit of the new Personal Insolvency Act 2012, there will be no tax consequences of any kind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300059#WRE03500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBRC Liquidation","counter":264,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300059#WRE03550"},{"type":"question","counter":265,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[18444\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300059#WRE03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will outline any representations that he or his Department has received from, or on behalf of, borrowers at the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation in special liquidation, after the announcement of the special liquidation of IBRC on 6 February 2013.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":266,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, representations are received in a number of ways including representations through political representatives, from individuals directly, from legal representatives of clients of the bank etc.  These representations are received through a number of channels including mail, e-mail and primarily by telephone contact.

Specifically:<\/p><p> - the draft budget for central government and the main parameters of the draft budgets for all the other sub-sectors of the general government must be published by 15 October each year;<\/p><p> - draft budgetary plans in a common format must be submitted by all Euro area Member States not in a programme of assistance; and<\/p><p> - the budget for the central government must be adopted or fixed upon and published by 31 December each year.<\/p><p>  In light of these requirements, the Government has decided to bring Budget Day forward from the first week in December to on or before 15 October from now on. This means that Budget 2014 will be presented and published on Tuesday, 15 October this year.  The Government has also decided that the Finance Bill should complete its passage through the Oireachtas by 31 December each year. This timeline will be considerably shorter than the present requirement that it must be enacted within 120 days of the Budget. Under the new arrangements, the Finance Bill will have to be passed 65 to 70 days after the Budget.<\/p><p>  Following the Government decision on the timing of the budget, the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform are considering the follow-on implications of moving both Budget Day and the Finance Bill forward. However, the key change relates to the timing and, as I have stated before, it means that Government will have to make its budgetary decisions much earlier in the year. It is the intention of both Departments to keep all bodies that contribute to the Budget and Finance Bill processes fully informed of changes so that they can plan accordingly.<\/p><p>  There is another requirement in the \"two-pack\", namely that the macroeconomic forecasts on which the Budget is based must be independently endorsed. Implementation of this requirement is still under consideration.  As regards documents to be published antecedent to the delivery of Budget 2014, the Stability Programme Update will be published by the end of April, as usual. It has been normal practice in the last few years to publish a medium-term fiscal statement or equivalent in October\/November. As this overlaps with the new budgetary timetable, this is likely to be consolidated into the budget publication from now on. The requirements regarding the White Paper on Expenditure and Receipts have not been altered by these changes.<\/p><p>  Finally, the Government will decide later in the budgetary process whether to submit a draft budgetary plan in the common format as Ireland is exempt from this requirement because it is in a programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300060#WRF02700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget Consultation Process","counter":306,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300060#WRF02750"},{"type":"question","counter":307,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[18459\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300060#WRF02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will outline the consultations that will take place in relation to Budget 2014, with both national and international parties, together with the nature and timing of those consultations.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":308,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[18460\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300060#WRF02900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will outline any special measures that will be adopted in 2013 in order to facilitate consultation prior to deciding on the final measures to be contained in Budget 2014.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":309,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 205 and 206 together.<\/p><p>  As the deputy is aware, last March, both ECOFIN and the European Parliament agreed on the content of two draft regulations known as the \"two-pack\".

In the specific case of KBC Ireland, the bank is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland as a Credit Institution in the Republic of Ireland.  In addition its parent, KBC Group, is profitable and has a strong liquidity position and the Group is currently providing the necessary capital and liquidity to its Irish subsidiary.  These are challenging times for the whole banking sector in Ireland, not just for the domestic banks. KBC Ireland is an important provider of credit to the Irish housing market and as the Deputy rightly points out the Bank has extended some &euro;14 billion of credit to the Irish economy. This is a very significant investment in Ireland, predominantly in the residential mortgage market.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that KBC Ireland anticipate that increasing economic stability will lead to more sustainable conditions in 2013 with the bank hoping for reduced credit costs in the year ahead.  I welcome KBC Group&rsquo;s commitment to the Irish market and note that they are planning to develop their business in Ireland further with new retail branches and distribution platforms to be rolled out in 2013 and continued expansion of their retail product portfolio.  This will add welcome competition in the retail banking market in Ireland.<\/p><p>  In the first quarter of 2013 the parent company invested &euro;125m in its Irish subsidiary to support on-going business development.  In April KBC Ireland opened a new high street retail office in Cork, which is its first new office outside of Dublin.  The Cork office, I understand, will employ 28 people initially and the Bank has said they have plans to open new offices in other cities during the course of 2013.

According to this ECB Press Release, the purpose of OMT is: &ldquo;Safeguarding an appropriate monetary policy transmission and the singleness of the monetary policy&rdquo; <\/p><p>  This press statement sets out that a necessary condition for OMT is strict and effective conditionality attached to an appropriate European Financial Stability Facility\/European Stability Mechanism (EFSF\/ESM) programme. Such programmes can take the form of a full EFSF\/ESM macroeconomic adjustment programme or a precautionary programme (Enhanced Conditions Credit Line), provided that they include the possibility of EFSF\/ESM primary market purchases. The ECB have also stated that OMT may also be considered for Member States currently under a macroeconomic adjustment programme &ldquo;when they will be regaining bond market access&rdquo;.  The ECB press statement also notes that the ECB&rsquo;s Governing Council will decide on the start, continuation and suspension of OMT, following a thorough assessment, in full discretion and acting in accordance with its monetary policy mandate.  The decision on whether to grant OMT or otherwise in any particular case is therefore a matter for the ECB.<\/p><p>  I believe the ECB&rsquo;s announcement regarding its OMT programme is a significant development and is viewed as such by the financial markets.

The recent highly successful sale of long term bonds by NTMA is another very significant step in this process.  We continue to assess a number of options in this regard.

In particular, the Code provides that a lender&rsquo;s Arrears Support Unit (ASU) must base its assessment of the borrower&rsquo;s case on the full circumstances of the borrower including:<\/p><p>  - the personal circumstances of the borrower;<\/p><p>  - the overall indebtedness of the borrower;<\/p><p>  - the information provided in the standard financial statement (SFS);<\/p><p>  - the borrower&rsquo;s current repayment capacity, and<\/p><p>  - the borrower&rsquo;s previous history.<\/p><p>  The Code, which applies to all mortgage lending activities of all regulated entities, except Credit Unions, operating in the State, is currently being reviewed by the Central Bank of Ireland.  The public consultation process has been completed and the Central Bank expects to publish the revised Code before the end of May.<\/p><p>  Separately from this Central Bank action, the new personal insolvency system, in particular the new resolution frameworks provided for in the Personal Insolvency Act, will also shortly be available to borrowers who are in significant difficulty in their mortgage repayments.  Utilising this process, the borrower will be in a position to consult an independent personal insolvency practitioner and where necessary to make a formal and realistic personal insolvency arrangement proposal to all eligible creditors, including a mortgage lender.  In such a situation the creditors will be obliged to formally consider and vote on the arrangement as proposed by the debtor.  In the event of a refusal by creditors, the debtor will also have access to the reformed bankruptcy framework, which has significantly reduced automatic discharge period to three years.  I would also remind the Deputy that, under the mortgage advisory service developed by the Department of Social Protection, independent financial advice is available to borrowers who have been offered a long term forbearance option by the lender and a panel of around 2,000 qualified accountants is now in place to provide this service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300062#WRH00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Application","counter":378,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300062#WRH00350"},{"type":"question","counter":379,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[18506\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300062#WRH00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will clarify any recent changes in respect of VRT\/VAT allowance on motor vehicles for persons with special needs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":380,"content":"<p>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners, who administer the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme, that the changes to which you refer are changes which were made in 2012 to &lsquo;administrative practice&rsquo;, to ensure that the provisions of SI 353\/1994 are being adhered to correctly.

As a result, a cost arises which is covered through the charging of a break cost.

Funds in the Exchequer are used for all the ongoing payments necessary for running the State, which include debt redemptions.  While the Exchequer had &euro;28.5 billion on hand in cash and deposits at end-March, there was a &euro;4.6 billion large bond redemption on 18 April which has since reduced the cash position.<\/p><p><br \/>  The State earns a return on these.

In addition to these day-to-day costs and as referred to above, the Exchequer must have sufficient resources to repay debt redemptions, including the recent &euro;4.6 billion Government bond repayment on 18 April and a &euro;7.6 billion Government bond repayment in mid-January 2014.  The continuing Exchequer deficits and debt redemptions must be adequately and prudently funded.<\/p><p><br \/>  Decisions on the level of cash reserves, which are a matter for the NTMA, take account of various factors in addition to the cost of maintaining such reserves.

The Act also provides that owners of multiple properties must file their LPT returns online.  A key aspect of the work undertaken by Revenue was the development of a comprehensive register of residential properties in the State.  This register is being used to issue correspondence to property owners and work is still in progress to ensure, as far as possible, that all property owners will be contacted.  The process to issue LPT Returns and supplementary information to the owners of in excess of 1.62 million residential properties has been ongoing since last month and is almost complete.<\/p><p><br \/>  However, LPT is a self-assessed tax and therefore liable persons are obliged to calculate the tax due based on their assessment of the market value of their property, file their return by the relevant deadline and pay the tax due.  This obligation applies to all owners whether or not they receive a return form from Revenue.  They should contact the LPT helpline at 1890 200 255 or they can login to LPT online at <i>www.revenue.ie<\/i> and file a return by clicking on the &quot;I have not received a Property Pin&quot; tab. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputies will be aware that Revenue has provided a wide range of payment options for LPT, including payment by instalments by direct debit or deduction at source.  The closing date of 7 May for paper filing of LPT Returns has been chosen with a view to the logistics of ensuring that the chosen payment option can be activated in good time for the July payment dates.  The e-filing closing date of 28 May is the de facto extension to the filing date for paper LPT Returns.  The online system is secure and user friendly, with built in calculators and easy access to guidance.<\/p><p><br \/>  For property owners for whom e-filing is not practical, the legislation provides that another person may file on their behalf, and Revenue has made it clear on several occasions that they can visit their local Revenue office where computers and assistance to e-file will be available.  In addition, Revenue has made arrangements for property owners to pay and file by telephone via the LPT helpline 1890 200 255.  To avail of this option, the caller needs their property details, PPSN and details of the bank account or other source from which they wish the payment to be deducted.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The requirements of a property owner to self-assess and file an LPT return even if he or she does not receive a form from Revenue, and the telephone filing arrangements, have been set out in national and local newspaper advertisements last week.  I am satisfied that this range of filing and payment options provides property owners with the opportunity to meet their LPT obligations, and I do not propose to extend the closing date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300062#WRH02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Regulation","counter":411,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300062#WRH02550"},{"type":"question","counter":412,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[18802\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300062#WRH02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will confirm if a person who holds a US passport and an Irish passport is eligible to buy shares in financial institutions in the State; if he will advise on the eligibility criteria that would apply in such cases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":413,"content":"<p>Where the ownership of a financial institution is in the form of shares quoted on a stock exchange it would be open to a person as described by the Deputy to purchase shares in that financial institution.

Compliance with the Code is mandatory on all mortgage lenders regulated by the Central Bank.  The Code provides a number of protections to borrowers. These include the establishment of a formal Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) to deal with mortgage customers who are in arrears or in pre-arrears, the establishment of a dedicated Appeals Support Unit and a separate internal appeals process by lenders to deal with individuals on a case by case basis. A copy of the Code is available on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website www.centralbank.ie.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank has advised that as soon as a borrower goes into arrears, a lender must communicate promptly and clearly with the borrower to establish in the first instance why the repayment schedule as per the mortgage contract, has not been adhered to. A lender must pro-actively encourage its borrowers to engage with them about financial difficulties which may prevent them from meeting their mortgage repayments.  A lender must ensure that all communications about arrears and pre-arrears are provided to the borrower in a timely manner. All information relating to a lender&rsquo;s handling of arrears and pre-arrears cases must be presented to the borrower in a clear and consumer friendly manner. The language used in communications must indicate a willingness to work with the borrower to address the situation and must be in plain English so that it is easily understood. Legal jargon must be avoided, where possible. <\/p><p>  A lender must also prepare and make available to borrowers, an information booklet providing details of its MARP and this must include:<\/p><p>  a) an explanation of its MARP, including the alternative repayment measures available to borrowers and outline in general terms, the lender&rsquo;s criteria for assessing requests for alternative repayment measures;<\/p><p>  b) a statement that the borrower will not be required to change from an existing tracker mortgage to another mortgage type;<\/p><p>  c) information about the potential availability of relevant State supports such as mortgage interest relief or Mortgage Interest Supplement;<\/p><p>  d) relevant contact points (i.e., the dedicated arrears contact points not the general customer service contact points); and<\/p><p>  e) reference to relevant website(s) operated by the Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS). <\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that on 13 March the Central Bank announced new measures to address mortgage arrears, including the publication of performance targets for the main mortgage banks and proposed changes to the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA).  The new approach is aimed at ensuring banks offer and conclude sustainable solutions for their customers in arrears by setting specific performance targets and proposing revisions to provisioning standards.  The Central Bank is also updating the CCMA so that it continues to provide protection to customers who cooperate with their bank while facilitating and promoting the resolution of arrears cases.  Issues being considered in the review include:<\/p><p>  - New safeguards to ensure borrowers are given sufficient warning before being classified as &lsquo;non cooperating&rsquo;; <\/p><p>  - Changes to the contact levels permitted, while ensuring consumers are not subject to harassment; <\/p><p>  - Transparency on resolution options so borrowers have a full understanding before making a decision; and<\/p><p>  - Consideration on whether there is merit in allowing a lender to move a borrower in arrears off a tracker rate where the lender has offered an alternative arrangement which is more advantageous in the long term.<\/p><p>  Further information on the review is available on www.centralbank.ie.

I have sought to re-assure property owners by publicly stating on numerous occasions that where they make their property valuation in an honest and reasonable manner, whether they base that on Revenue's own valuation guidance or some other means, that valuation will not be challenged by Revenue in accordance with its normal Customer Service Charter. <\/p><p><br \/>  I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the Central Statistics Office (CSO) monthly report, &#8220;<i>The Residential Property Price Index&#8221;<\/i> , provides guidance on establishing the percentage reduction to be applied to property values where the only reliable comparable home values available to them are 2010, 2011 or 2012.  The CSO's report is designed to measure the change in the level of prices paid for residential properties sold in Ireland and is compiled using data on mortgage drawdowns provided on a monthly basis from mortgage lending institutions.  The report is based on the prices of properties that were actually sold and tracks percentage changes in values over time related to an index point set at January 2005.  It does not, however, show average prices.  Nor does it include cash based transactions.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The Revenue valuation guidance also uses the above CSO data to adjust for price changes in the interim.  Consequently, using the Revenue valuation guidance will give property owners average indicative valuations based on the property type, age and location on an adjusted basis and can be relied on to assist property owners in determining the appropriate valuation band for their particular property.  In conjunction with the Revenue guidance, the property owner should consider the specifics of his or her own property, for example, if the property has certain unique features, is smaller or larger than the average property in the area, or is in a significantly poor state of repair and these factors should be taken into account in the owner's assessment of the valuation of the property.   <\/p><p><br \/>  The property price register details can also be used as a further source to help the owner determine the valuation band and this is the case even where the details from the prices register are potentially dated.  It is particularly so given that the majority of properties will fall into valuation bands, with a range of &euro;50,000 in each band, which means that property owners are not required to provide a precise value for their property.  Therefore, if a person lives in a house similar to a house that was sold in 2010, applying the percentage reduction in property values for that area as set out in the CSO monthly Price Index report should give a reasonable basis for selecting a valuation band. <\/p><p><br \/>  I am satisfied that using the Revenue valuation guidance along with the person's own knowledge of their property and, considering these together with the property prices register, should allow the owner make an honest and reasonable assessment of the valuation band for their property.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300063#WRJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Arrears Proposals","counter":441,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300063#WRJ01100"},{"type":"question","counter":442,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[19030\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300063#WRJ01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his response to the proposal made in a newspaper article (details supplied) in relation to the deferral of mortgage debt.","asker":"1178","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":443,"content":"<p>The Government is very aware of the significant difficulties some homeowners are facing in meeting their mortgage obligations and it is committed to advancing appropriate measures to assist those mortgage holders who are experiencing real and genuine difficulty.  Building on the 2011 &lsquo;Keane Report&rsquo;, the Central Bank, under its MARS project, has for some time been intensively working with lenders to ensure that they can offer a range of longer term forbearance options to their customers who are experiencing mortgage difficulty.  The Deputy will be further aware that, on 13 March 2013, the Central Bank announced additional measures to address mortgage arrears, including the publication of performance targets for the main mortgage banks.

In that regard, in addition to the existing forbearance arrangements such as term extensions or reduced payments that were being deployed, the Keane Report outlined other long term forbearance\/resolution options such as split mortgages, sale by agreement, and trade down mortgages that could be utilized.  The Report also recognised that lenders could develop other possible options in this area for use by their customers.

A Sheriff's debt collection activities, including seizure procedures, are governed by the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1926 as amended, which allows that where necessary in execution of a warrant the Sheriff may enter any dwelling house or other building, regardless of whether the building is occupied or not, for the purpose of seizing goods, that are not exempt under the Act. <\/p><p><br \/>  Section 12 of Enforcement of Court Order Acts 1926 provides as follows:<\/p><p><br \/>  &#8220;(1) No action shall lie against an under-sheriff who has complied with the conditions hereinafter stated for or on account of his having entered or broken into any lands, house, close, or other premises for the purpose of taking in execution any goods, animals, or other chattels which were or might be on or in such lands, house, close, or premises, or for or on account of any injury occasioned to such lands, house, or premises by or in the course of such entry or breaking in.<\/p><p><br \/>  (2) The conditions hereinbefore mentioned are:-<\/p><p><br \/>  (<i>a<\/i> ) that before breaking into any dwelling-house or other building the under-sheriff shall make reasonable efforts to enter peaceably and without violence, and<\/p><p><br \/>  (<i>b<\/i> ) where the under-sheriff breaks and enters the premises of a person other than the person against whom he has been called upon to enforce an execution order, he shall either have had reasonable grounds for believing that there were some goods, animals, or chattels of such last-mentioned person in such premises or he shall actually find some such goods, animals, or chattels in such premises&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300063#WRJ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":454,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300063#WRJ02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teaching Contracts","counter":453,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300063#WRJ02300"},{"type":"question","counter":454,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[18511\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300063#WRJ02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the extension of teachers' working hours in the Croke Park Agreement will cease and the old teaching hours return post recession; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":455,"content":"<p>Under the Public Service (Croke Park) Agreement 2010 &ndash; 2014, teachers undertook  to provide an additional hour per week to allow for a range of essential school  activities, such as school planning, continuous professional development, induction, substitution and supervision (including supervision immediately  before and after school times), to take place without reducing class contact\/tuition time.

If more than one permanent\/CID holding teacher applies to be placed on the redeployment panel in place of the most junior permanent\/CID holding teacher, the Board of Management will consider all applications from permanent\/CID holding teachers. Where a Board of Management decides that the most junior permanent\/CID holding teacher can be replaced on the panel, it will determine which applicant senior permanent\/CID holding teacher is to replace the most junior permanent\/CID holding teacher.

This scheme is confined to schools in close proximity to the surplus schools in Sligo.

At primary level the focus is on acquisition of the two national languages, Irish and English.  Beyond the primary level, the focus expands to include not only English and Irish but also other languages.  Post-primary builds on the foundation established at primary level by offering not only English and Irish but also a range of foreign languages. French, German, Spanish, Italian at Junior Cycle with the addition of Russian, Japanese and Arabic at Leaving Cycle.  Examinations are also offered in a number of other non-curricular EU languages for native language speakers from EU Member States.  Candidates presented in some 16 EU languages for the Leaving Certificate in 2012.<\/p><p>  The new Framework for Junior Cycle (2012) will support schools in fostering practical language-learning skills.  It will give all students the opportunity to study at least one language in addition to Irish and English.  Revised syllabuses of modern foreign languages are scheduled for implementation in 2016.  Schools will also have the flexibility to offer short courses of 100 hours duration i.e. in a second language, including languages not currently offered in the junior cycle curriculum. The NCCA is currently developing a short course in Chinese, which will also be available to schools from 2014.<\/p><p>  A Transition Year module in Chinese was launched last year, having already been piloted by over 20 schools across Ireland.  For many years now, Japanese has been offered in a number of TY programmes, and has resulted in a follow-on uptake of Japanese to Leaving Certificate level, which in 2012 reached 239 students.  In 2012, over 30,000 students sat a European language for the Leaving Certificate, including around 26,000 in French, 6,700 in German, 4,000 in Spanish and 700 in Polish, with smaller numbers taking other languages such as Italian, Japanese and Russian and Arabic.  The Post-Primary Languages Initiative is broadening its remit to provide support for all teachers of modern foreign languages, through the provision of materials on its website. It was originally set up to offer support to schools who wished to introduce Spanish, Italian and Japanese and Russian.<\/p><p>  Prospective students have access to a wide range of foreign language courses at third level that can be taken as core subjects or in combination with a range of other disciplines across business, the arts, the humanities and the sciences.  A number of language programmes have also been selected for funding through the Springboard skills initiative which was launched in May 2011.  Preliminary data from the HEA research on the provision of foreign languages indicates that some 9,000 third level students are studying a foreign language.<\/p><p>  The EU's Erasmus initiative has played a key role in enhancing the language proficiency of Irish graduates. 28,000 Irish students have benefited from this programme over the past 25 years.

The REV gives a fuller, more detailed breakdown of spending by each Department and Vote than the spending information announced in the Estimates which are published with the Budget each year.  The REV also gives the provisional outturn for spending in the preceding year and includes performance budgeting information for each area of Government spending. <\/p><p>  The REV 2013, published last week on Wednesday, 17 April, elaborates on the 2013 spending information published in the Expenditure Report 2013 at Budget time last December.  Individual Vote Estimates were also presented to the D&aacute;il and referred to the relevant D&aacute;il Select Committees for discussion.  The Revised Estimates set out detailed financial and output information for all Departments and it is important that select committees have the opportunity to examine this information and in particular the performance budgeting information and programme outputs.<\/p><p>  In keeping with the largely technical nature of the REV, the majority of adjustments arise from the allocation of savings around pay, pensions, conditions of service and reductions in public service numbers.  The estimates in Budget 2013 included some of these savings in individual Votes and also an undistributed amount that was yet to be allocated.  These savings have now been fully apportioned across individual Votes on the basis of the Labour Relations Commission recommendations.  A small element of the 2013 savings is non-Exchequer, non-voted or non-pay, so these savings will not be seen in the voted Exchequer pay total shown in the REV 2013. <\/p><p>  The overall savings arising as a result of the Labour Relations Commission recommendations would have achieved the required savings for 2013 and the full target by the end of the deal period.  I made a decision to publish the Estimates, which are based on the implementation of the Labour Relations Commission recommendations, because that is what we hoped the position would be.  The recommendations were the most appropriate means of achieving the savings required.  The Government will continue to reflect on last week's outcome of the ballot.

The Employment Appeals Tribunal has seen a significant increase in its caseload in recent years, as it is one of the front-line services directly impacted upon by the economic downturn.  The largest increase in claims has been in redundancy appeals but other types of claims have also increased.  Regrettably, this has increased the time it takes for a claimant to have his or her case heard. All appeals are listed for hearing in accordance with their date of lodgment with the Tribunal. <\/p><p>  The tribunal itself has been active in ensuring that the resources allocated to it are used in an efficient manner and there is an ongoing review of how this is best delivered.  For example, divisions of the tribunal are sitting longer, hearing more cases per hearing and seeking to manage the caseload to maximise efficiency.  Cases are assessed at the scheduling stage and those that are seen as requiring less time to conclude or are of a similar nature are streamed together in an effort to conclude as many cases as possible in as short a time as possible.  This is reflected directly in the increase in the number of cases finalised by the tribunal over the last three years.  These increases are as follows: 2010 + 30%, 2011 + 11% and 2012 + 13%.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the efforts of the tribunal, I believe that the delays that users of the service are experiencing are unacceptable.  This is one of the reasons I am undertaking a root and branch reform of all five workplace relations bodies.  The reform programme I have commenced will deliver a two tier workplace relations structure by merging the activities of the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).  The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court.  Work has commenced on the drafting of a workplace relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure.<\/p><p>  The purpose of the reform programme is to provide a more efficient and effective system of resolving employment disputes.  Substantial progress has already been made in this regard.  For example, the establishment of a workplace relations single contact portal from January this year has resulted in all complaints now being acknowledged and respondents notified within a matter of weeks of receipt of the complaint.  In some cases this was taking up to eight months.  This service enhancement increases the likelihood of employers and employees resolving issues sooner and has substantially reduced the backlog for certain hearings.  I understand that the backlog for Rights Commissioner hearings has effectively been eliminated.<\/p><p>  The service improvements have also been underpinned by the launch from January last year of a single complaint form for all first instance workplace relations complaints.  A Pilot Early Resolution Service commenced on 14 May last year.  This service will provide the opportunity in certain cases for employers and employees to resolve issues without recourse to formal adjudication hearings, thus relieving pressure on adjudication services such as the Rights Commissioner Service and the EAT. <\/p><p>  The two tier model now being designed will deliver a just, fair and efficient adjudication service provided by independent, professional and impartial decision-makers with a target period of three months from the time of complaint to hearing, and written, reasoned decisions within 28 working days of the hearing with published decisions.  Finally, I also intend to provide for a more effective method of enforcing the awards of adjudicators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300066#WRM01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights Issues","counter":616,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300066#WRM01150"},{"type":"question","counter":617,"qnumday":311,"qnumall":"[18394\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300066#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the reason NERA will not investigate a legitimate complaint raised by a person (details supplied) in County Waterford; if there is another means by which a satisfactory resolution can be reached; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1093","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":618,"content":"<p>I have been informed by NERA that the complainant is a proprietary director of the company against whom he has made the complaint.

An employer who employs a 3rd country national requiring, but without, an employment permit is open to prosecution under the Employment Permits legislation.  There is a careful balance to be struck. On the one hand there can be situations where an employee, unwittingly, falls out of the employment permit regime and the question then arises as to whether there should be a channel for them to regularise their position. On the other hand, such a provision should not serve to incentivise employers for not adhering to their legal responsibilities.<\/p><p>  I do recognise that occasionally 3rd country nationals, having entered the labour market legally, can find themselves, through no fault of their own, without the necessary permission to remain employed, or, having left the original employment in respect of which an employment permit was granted, are unable to re-enter employment. From time to time the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland brings such cases to the attention of my Department and in such circumstances, I may consider the granting of an employment permit on an exceptional and case by case basis. Applicants must set out in detail their particular circumstances explaining how they arrived at their situation and satisfy me that a refusal to grant an employment permit would cause undue hardship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300067#WRN01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Issues","counter":641,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300067#WRN01800"},{"type":"question","counter":642,"qnumday":320,"qnumall":"[18999\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300067#WRN01900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the level of educational or skills requirements in respect of jobs created over the past three years to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":643,"qnumday":328,"qnumall":"[19008\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300067#WRN02000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the job skills\/educational requirement levels most sought after in new jobs created over the past two years, both indigenously and through foreign direct investment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":644,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 320 and 328 together. <\/p><p>  High growth sectors with continued potential to grow in the medium term include Information and Communications Technology (ICT), Health Life Sciences, International Financial Services, Agri-Food and Internationally Traded Services.  During 2012 employment increased by 7% within the ICT sector, by 12% within the Agri-Food sector and by 6% in professional, scientific and technical activities.  There is strong demand within the ICT sector here due to -<\/p><p>  - an expansion of the business operations of companies, inflow of foreign R&amp;amp;D investment and formation of new start-ups;<\/p><p>  - potential for foreign companies to win mobile investment from parent companies and the availability of high skilled personnel to enhance their business proposition; <\/p><p>  - emerging skills demands around cloud computing, service design, database management, social networks and media, development of e-commerce applications and internet marketing.<\/p><p>  The Government has brought education and training to the heart of its Action Plan for Jobs and targets set for initiatives such as Springboard, the ICT Conversion Programme have the ultimate aim of providing Ireland with the highest proportion of ICT graduates as a share of third level graduates by 2018.  New Sectors which are small in employment terms but which have experienced additional employment growth include clean\/green technologies, creative digital media and content industries, marine and maritime and healthcare (eHealth) services.  Traditional Sectors where employment has shown recovery include tourism and hospitality, and also within the sub-sector of the construction industry which has focussed on business opportunities in the design and use of eco-construction products and materials and energy efficiency improvements in housing and buildings. <\/p><p>  As regards foreign direct investment, there have been substantial job gains in the high-tech sector within both new arrival foreign investment companies (such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter) as well as from well-established businesses such as Paypall, HP and IBM. Indigenous engineering, software, internationally traded services and medical devices companies have also performed well in export markets.  The main skills sets in demand within these sectors are &ndash;<\/p><p>  - international management skills (e.g. export marketing, international marketing and sales, managing international customers and suppliers, etc.) <\/p><p>  - foreign language capabilities and cultural awareness (e.g. mainline European including German, French, Italian and Spanish, as well as &ndash; at a relatively lower level - Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Russian and Arabic) <\/p><p>  - international sales skills<\/p><p>  - marketing &amp;amp; sales skills<\/p><p>  - science &amp;amp; engineering skills (including within the renewable energies sub-sector)<\/p><p>  - high-level ICT skills<\/p><p>  There are currently 1,848,900 people at work in the economy. As well as additional jobs that have arisen in recent years, it is important to note that there is a level of replacement demand in the workforce as people retire, take up home\/caring duties, take up full time education, etc. This creates replacement demand estimated at 44,000 jobs per annum.<\/p><p>  Skills demands arise not only from within the additional jobs created but also within existing jobs as, in order to remain competitive, firms need to continually up-skill their workforces.  The main drivers of change impacting on the skillset requirements for these jobs include customer demand, new technology developments, product and market specific regulations and directives, and internal organisational change. <\/p><p>  My Department continues to work closely with the Department of Education and Skills to ensure our workforce is well aligned with the skills that employers need now and into the future. As a country, we must continue to up-skill, not just for additional jobs but also in terms of existing jobs.

It was clear what was needed was to transform our economy from one that became over dependent on property, construction and debt, to one focused on enterprise, innovation and exports.  The Action Plan for Jobs is a key instrument in this objective and is designed to deliver measures right across Government to protect existing jobs and support the creation of new ones.  A key feature of the Action Plan process is that each of the actions to be delivered is broken down into Quarterly milestones and progress against these targets is rigorously monitored and published on a quarterly basis.<\/p><p><br \/>  One year into the Action Plan for Jobs<i><\/i>process, we can see evidence that the strategy and architecture are working. Over 90% of the 270 individual actions committed to last year were completed on time.  They included many important reforms designed to enhance competitiveness, improve access to finance, support enterprise and develop employment in sectors of opportunity for Ireland.  In many cases, the full impact of these reforms will take time to materialise.  However, some significant objectives have already been realised, including:<\/p><p><br \/>  - the establishment of a Microfinance Fund for small businesses;<\/p><p><br \/>  - the introduction of a Partial Credit Guarantee scheme; <\/p><p><br \/>  - new supports for first time exporters; <\/p><p><br \/>  - the launch of a new Women-In-Business programme; <\/p><p><br \/>  - the simplification and extension of the Employer's PRSI Exemption scheme; <\/p><p><br \/>  - the launch of a National Broadband Plan;<\/p><p><br \/>  - the piloting of a Health Innovation Hub; and <\/p><p><br \/>  - work being undertaken to develop sectors such as Cloud Computing, Digital Games, Manufacturing, the Green Economy and other areas.<\/p><p><br \/>  More significantly, last year, 12,000 jobs were created in the private sector, particularly in export-oriented sectors that are targeted by the Action Plan for Jobs.

This year's Action Plan for Jobs includes 333 actions for delivery across all Government Departments and 46 Agencies or Offices.  The Plan also includes seven landmark projects, or Disruptive Reforms, that the Government has identified as having potential to impact significantly on job creation.

Ireland is already rated highly internationally as one of the best countries in the world in which to do business, and we have built a strong competitive basis on which to go out and compete on global markets.  For example, Ireland has moved up to 20th place in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook 2012 and is also ranked 15th in the World Bank&rsquo;s Doing Business 2012 Report.<\/p><p>  There are a number of key areas where Ireland tops global competitiveness rankings, including: <\/p><p>  - business impact of rules on foreign direct investment; <\/p><p>  - inflation;<\/p><p>  - FDI and technology transfer; <\/p><p>  - availability of skilled labour; <\/p><p>  - flexibility and adaptability of the labour force; and <\/p><p>  - investment incentives.<\/p><p>  We are making progress on the jobs front through the Action Plan for Jobs process, which is systematically transforming the operating environment for business, improving our competitiveness and supporting companies increasing employment.   <\/p><p>  In 2012, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland companies created almost 10,000 net new jobs between them, representing the strongest performance for the IDA in a decade and the best performance in over five years for Enterprise Ireland.  There was a good regional spread in these new jobs, including new investments in Letterkenny, Sligo, Westport, Dundalk, Kilkenny, Limerick, Kildare and Wexford.  The latest QNHS figures show that overall, employment in the economy increased by 1,200 people year-on-year to the end of 2012.  This was the first increase in employment since the second quarter of 2008 and is in stark contrast to a situation where the economy was losing an average of almost 90,000 jobs per year in the period 2008 to 2011.  Meanwhile, we are also showing that we can compete on international trade markets, as our total exports in 2012, at over &euro;182 billion, were at their highest level ever.<\/p><p>  However, while these improvements are very welcome and indicate that we are moving in the right direction, we must continue to focus on actions to promote further cost reductions across the economy.

That policy has proved to be particularly successful as, at the end of 2012, there were 152,785 people employed in over 1,000 IDA client companies which, in turn, result in another 100,000 spin off jobs in the Irish economy. The net effect is that 1 in 7 Jobs in the Irish economy is accounted for by FDI. FDI is a key stimulator and driver of the Irish economy through its contribution to Exchequer finances, exports and research and development.<\/p><p>  Interaction with companies who have decided to invest in Ireland continuously highlights that there are many factors which attract such companies to this country. We have stable government, an attractive corporation tax rate, a young educated workforce, a technologically advanced environment and a strong track record in winning FDI.  In addition, Ireland is a member of the EU and the Euro zone.  Another factor which weighs heavily in our favour is the pro-business environment which permeates our economy. <\/p><p>  It is for these reasons that the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2012 ranks Ireland very favourably in a number of key areas of importance for FDI.

This analysis, which will be undertaken later this year, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, any changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that may be introduced in the near future and our agreed approach to regional development. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300067#WRN04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":667,"content":"<p>Question No. 328 answered with Question No. 320.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commercial Rent Reviews","counter":668,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300067#WRN04500"},{"type":"question","counter":669,"qnumday":329,"qnumall":"[19009\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300067#WRN04600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which upward only rent reviews continue to remain a reason for closure or job losses in the retail or commercial sectors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":670,"content":"<p>In the current economic climate, a range of factors are impacting on job losses in the retail and commercial sectors, including, for example, changing patterns of consumer behaviour through on-line trading.

The aim of the National Internship Scheme is to assist in breaking the cycle where jobseekers are unable to get a job without experience, either as new entrants to the labour market after education or training or as unemployed workers wishing to learn new skills.  The scheme provides work experience placements in the private, public and voluntary sectors.  Interns receive an allowance of &euro;50 per week on top of their existing social welfare entitlement. This is payable for the period of the internship. While the scheme has been availed of by client companies of the enterprise development agencies, it does not directly result in an increase in the employment associated with those companies (i.e. participants are interns receiving social welfare payments, and not full-time employees receiving a salary from the placement).<\/p><p>The Forf&aacute;s Employment Survey does not capture data in relation to the number of Job Bridge participants in client companies of the development agencies.

Only jobs created during, and sustained at the end of each seven year period are represented in the calculations. The number of JobBridge participants is not associated with these calculations, and therefore the scheme will not have any direct impact on the cost per job in the development agencies.

Smaller falls were recorded across a range of other service industries. By contrast, at the end of 2012, employment in two sub-sectors - healthcare and the information\/communications sector - were above the levels of 2007\/2008.<\/p><p><br \/>  Driven primarily by these sectoral trends, the occupations most affected by the down turn were the skilled trades, where employment fell by about 140,000.  The sharp contraction in construction and manufacturing also partly explains the fall of 60,000 in the unskilled or &#8220;elementary&#8221; manual occupations, which contain a sizeable number of unskilled construction workers.  Smaller but nonetheless significant declines have occurred for clerical and secretarial jobs (down by 50,000) and for sales and transport occupations affected by the fall in distribution (down by 50,000).  By contrast, professional workers, associate &amp;amp; technical professionals and managers actually experienced slight increases over the course of the recession. The number of science\/engineering professionals and technicians, for example, rose by 16,000 between 2008 and 2012.  <\/p><p><br \/>  When broken down by highest education level achieved, employment for those with at best a Leaving Certificate or Post Leaving Certificate qualification fell by almost 370,000 between 2007 and 2012 whereas employment for persons with a third-level qualification rose by over 100,000. These changes reflect the rapid growth in the numbers of people with higher qualifications in the overall population as well as changes in employment prospects for those with various qualifications. The employment <i>rate<\/i>  (percentage of the adult population with jobs) fell for all groups between 2007 and 2012; however, the rate for those with third-level fell by about 6 percentage points, from 85% to 79%, while that for those with Leaving Certificate or PLC qualifications fell by 15 percentage points, from 75% to 60%, and those with lower qualifications saw even greater reductions, of the order of 18 percentage points.<\/p><p><br \/>  As a result of the downturn, the unemployment rate has risen significantly for persons with lower levels of education. For persons with at most primary education, the unemployment rate increased from10.3% to 27.8% between 2008 and 2012. For persons with a best a lower secondary education unemployment rate increased from 10.6% to 25.5% and for persons with a best a Leaving Certificate the unemployment rate increased from 6.7% to 16.9%. By contrast, the unemployment rate for those with honours degrees was relatively lower, at 6.5%, in 2012.<\/p><p><br \/>  In recognition of the skills gap among the unemployed people, the Government operates a number of initiatives to allow those who are out of work to up-skill through the education and training system. These include the Back to Education Allowance (26,000 people), Springboard (6,000 people) and Momentum (6,500 places).  Eligible participants on both Springboard and Momentum programmes retain their welfare payments made through my Department.<\/p><p><br \/>  These special initiatives are in addition to the existing range of full-time vocational training options provided through F&Aacute;S that are closely aligned to the needs of the labour market. Specific Skills Training courses are employment-led and lead to qualifications that offer learners both generic and advanced skills. The expected outcomes are progression to employment in the occupational field or to further and higher education\/training and the achievement of certification from levels 5 - 7 in the National Qualifications Framework.  F&Aacute;S also provides Traineeships which entail significant skill requirements best acquired through a combination of alternating periods of on and off-the-job training, as well as foundation courses for those who require them prior to going on to skills training.  There were some 21,000 participants on these three FAS programmes in 2012. F&Aacute;S has also expanded provision of free part-time and evening courses for unemployed people in recent years, and a further 21,000 people took such courses in 2012.   The Government is prioritising places on training courses for those who have been on the Live Register for 12 months or more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300068#WRO00200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":682,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300068#WRO00250"},{"type":"question","counter":683,"qnumday":334,"qnumall":"[18227\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300068#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a review for carer's allowance will be expedited in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":684,"content":"<p>I can confirm that the Department received an application for Carer's Allowance from the person in question on 16th November 2011.

This panel is available on a county by county basis on the website www.keepingyourhome.ie.<\/p><p>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender advises the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &euro;250 to an accountant of the borrower&rsquo;s choosing for the provision of this advice.  The advisory framework has commenced with practising accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.<\/p><p>  There is nothing to inhibit other financial intermediaries from continuing to give advice on mortgages as required by borrowers.  The advisory framework is being monitored on an on-going basis and a full review of the service will be undertaken in June 2013.  The review will be undertaken to ensure that it is meeting its objectives and will encompass all aspects of the service including if participation is extended to other interested parties, the criteria that would be required in terms of relevant qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance, etc.  All relevant stakeholders will have an opportunity to input to the review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300068#WRO01500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":700,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 339 and 340 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Treatment Benefit Scheme Applications","counter":701,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300068#WRO01575"},{"type":"question","counter":702,"qnumday":341,"qnumall":"[18268\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300068#WRO01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if an application for funding under the treatment benefit scheme will be processed in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Limerick.","asker":"1056","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":703,"content":"<p>Eligibility for treatment benefit is based on the person concerned fulfilling certain PRSI requirements.

CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance\/develop both their technical and personal skills.<\/p><p><br \/>  The basic rules governing the maximum duration a person can remain on Community Employment (CE) are unchanged since 2006. The maximum participation limits for CE are 3 years in total for those under 55 years of age, and 6 years in total for those of 55 to 65 years of age. Off-shore islander clients are exempt from CE participation caps. Persons in receipt of a qualifying disability-related social welfare payment are eligible for one additional year on top of these two limits, i.e., 4 years for those under 55 and 7 years for those of 55 to 65. <\/p><p><br \/>  The actual length of time a person can remain on CE is dictated by a number of factors (as governed by the eligibility rules of CE):<\/p><p> - Age of the person<\/p><p> - Department of Social Protection (DSP ) payment and duration of receipt<\/p><p> - Previous participation on CE since 3<sup>rd<\/sup>   April 2000<\/p><p> - Whether they are considered job-ready at their CE contract end-date<\/p><p> - Engagement under a person's Individual Learner Plan (training &amp;amp; development)<\/p><p> - Budgetary limitations<\/p><p><br \/>  The overall duration limits are strictly enforced to maximize the number of places available for potential clients. <\/p><p><br \/>  There are two strands available on Community Employment (CE), namely Part-Time Integration Option (PTI), which is the one-year version of CE, and the Part-Time Job Option (PTJ), which is the three-year version of CE (subject to annually renewable contracts). All CE participant contracts are for 1 year's duration at a time. The ratio of PTI to PTJ places is set at 75% PTI to 25% PTJ to maintain the throughput of participants. A maximum of 10% of participants on the PTI Option can be extended into a subsequent year's participation. The annual renewal of PTJ participant contracts is subject to the factors mentioned above.<\/p><p><br \/>  Eligibility for the PTI Option is generally determined by being in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment for a minimum of 12 months. For the PTJ Option, the qualifying period is 3 years in receipt. There are some exceptions to these qualifying periods for certain categories of participants.  The only recent change to the CE operating Guidelines with respect to duration on the programme is that &#8220;time spent on CE no longer counts towards continued time on CE for new entrants who commence on or after 8 October 2012. Existing PTI participants can still have time spent on CE count as part of the qualifying period until they exit&#8221;.<\/p><p><br \/>  Previous to this amended rule being introduced, time spent on CE counted towards the CE-qualifying period, so it was possible for a client commencing CE under the PTI Option who had only been in receipt for 12 months to avail of one year's placement. If they happened to be in the 10% of PTIs extended into a second year, that would mean that the combination of their 12 months in receipt and two years on CE qualified them under the PTJ Option (i.e. 3 years on CE), thereby giving them a third consecutive year on CE.  The emphasis on shorter-term interventions on CE as part of the Pathways to Work Initiative is to assist the maximum number of eligible persons via participation on the scheme. The current rules governing CE eligibility allow for 10% persons engaged on a year's placement to have their time extended into a second year if they can demonstrate that they would benefit from such an extension.<\/p><p><br \/>  The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>  on progression into employment.  There is a wide range of client groups which need access to CE - lone parents, persons with disabilities, stabilised substance abusers and unemployed persons.  DSP at all times is obliged to accommodate the needs of all these groups in terms of participation on Community Employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300068#WRO02700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":721,"content":"<p>Question No. 350 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Appeals","counter":722,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300068#WRO02775"},{"type":"question","counter":723,"qnumday":351,"qnumall":"[18497\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300068#WRO02800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will approve and expedite an appeal for disability allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":724,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 26 February 2013.

Following some small changes required by the Council's Jurist\/Linguists, it is anticipated that the final text will be formally adopted by the Council this month.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The Recommendation is that Member States should ensure that all young people under the age of 25 years receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education.  While it is recommended that the guarantee should be implemented as soon as possible, it is recognised that implementation will be more gradual in the Member States experiencing the most severe budgetary difficulties and higher rates of youth unemployment. The government will now review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee. <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  With regard to <\/font>job creation for youth in support of the guarantee, the Government's primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery. The government's job-creation policies are outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs, which sets out a target for 100,000 net new jobs to be created by 2016, many of which will be filled by young people. Under the updated Action Plan for 2013,<font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> a new recruitment incentive - JobsPlus - has also been developed by my Department and was approved by the Government.  This incentive will cover the cost of c. &euro;1 in every &euro;4 of an employer's wage costs and will be launched for availability by July 2013. <\/font>  Young people are likely to be major beneficiaries of this initiative as employers tend to hire young people when there is a recovery in employment. This incentive will be launched for availability by July 2013.<\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The scale and nature of any additional measures required will depend on the trend in youth unemployment, and in particular the number of young people likely to experience periods of unemployment of more than four months under current policies.  In this context, it is a welcome development that the official labour market figures published by the CSO recently indicated that the number of young unemployed at the end of 2012, at 59,000, a reduction of almost 9,000 on the same time a year earlier.  It is to be hoped that this is the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will, almost certainly require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education and training, internships, subsidised private-sector recruitment, and supports for self-employment.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  In this regard the State already provides a significant number of initiatives which are of relevance to young people and the Department of Social Protection took steps in Budget 2013 to increase funding and places for schemes such as JobBridge, Community Employment, T&Uacute;S and a new state employment scheme in the local Government sector.

To be of assistance to the Deputy, I have, however, made enquiries in relation to this issue, which was mentioned in the course of the recent British Irish Parliamentary Assembly meeting in Letterkenny on 4 March.  I am also aware that Minister of State, Ciaran Cannon, TD, addressed this matter in a Adjournment Debate on 7th   March last.<\/p><p>  I am advised that the UK Ministry of Defence undertook sea dumping of weapons and munitions as a means of disposing of redundant and surplus stocks and dealing with the legacy of weapons produced in the World Wars.  It is understood that the UK, which at the end of the war in 1945 had a surplus stock of 1.2 million tonnes, was not alone in this process and that most nations at the time disposed of such material by dumping at sea.  The relevant legal framework is the Oslo Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft 1972, now OSPAR, at which Ireland is usually represented by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p><p>  In addition to OSPAR, Marine Notice No. 16 of 2001 issued by the then Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (now a matter for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport) to all fishermen and other users of the sea relates to explosives and other explosive missiles sighted, picked up in trawls at sea or removed from wrecks. This notice covers chemical and conventional munitions and requires all encounters with such munitions to be reported to the Naval Authorities via the Irish Coast Guard Coast Radio Stations. Information on the location and type of munitions dumped in the Convention area was supplied by contracting parties and published by OSPAR in 2005.  The report identified more than 140 dump sites throughout the Convention area and this is believed to be the best information available.

The CER provides quarterly and annual updates on the electricity and gas retail markets, including on disconnections, and further information may be found at:http:\/\/www.cer.ie\/en\/electricity-retail-market-reports-and-publications.aspx.<\/p><p>  Nevertheless, the number of disconnections is a matter of great concern to me as it is for the Government, the CER, voluntary organisations and suppliers.  The rise in disconnections in recent years has coincided with the economic recession, which has caused customer arrears and debt levels to rise.<\/p><p>  In line with the CER&rsquo;s Code of Practice on disconnection, electricity and gas suppliers must facilitate payment options\/plans for domestic customers experiencing genuine hardship and, where appropriate, engage with a money advisor acting on behalf of the customer or a recognised charity.  This must include offering the customer a prepayment meter.  According to CER&rsquo;s published report on its website on Electricity and Gas Retail Markets, concerning the period to the end of September 2012, over 11,000 Pay as You Go electricity meters have been installed.  That report also states that there are approximately 19,500 token meters in operation.  In relation to gas the report states that for the period to end of September 2012, 63,933 Pay as You Go and token meters are installed, with 36,109 installed since December 2008.  In addition, disconnections may not be initiated where a customer has entered into a payment plan with the supplier and is honouring that arrangement.<\/p><p>  I welcome the fact that CER is working with energy suppliers to ensure that they take all reasonable steps to assist customers through this difficult period and that disconnections resulting from genuine inability to pay are minimised, and only occur as a very last resort.  Implementation of the measures set out in the Government&rsquo;s Affordable Energy Strategy, published last November, is pivotal to protecting the interests of vulnerable customers and improving energy affordability.

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Waterford, can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at <i>www.callcosts.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme.  NBS services are available within 31 of the 130 Electoral Divisions in County Waterford.  The following table contains a list of these Electoral Divisions.<\/p><p>With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.  During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.<\/p><p>The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  In an important milestone towards delivery of this commitment in the Plan, my Department will shortly appoint experts, to assist in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be on-going throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.  It is expected that services will be available in areas such as Waterford after the procurement process is concluded and services are rolled out.  It is likely that, Waterford may also benefit from parts of commercial roll out of high speed services.<\/p><p>Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland, including all of County Waterford, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity, through public or private sector investment, as outlined in the National Broadband Plan.<\/p><p><b>Electoral Divisions (ED) covered by the NBS in County Waterford<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th><b>ED Name <\/b><\/th><th><b>ED Reference No.<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>BALLYDUFF <\/td><td>ED 227004<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BALLYDURN <\/td><td>ED 227005<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BALLYNAMULT <\/td><td>ED 227013<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BALLYSAGGART MORE <\/td><td>ED 227014<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BOHADOON <\/td><td>ED 227015<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CARRIGCASTLE <\/td><td>ED 227019<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CASTLERICHARD <\/td><td>ED 227021<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CLASHMORE <\/td><td>ED 227022<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>COLLIGAN <\/td><td>ED 227025<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>COMERAGH <\/td><td>ED 227026<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>COUMARAGLIN <\/td><td>ED 227027<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>FEWS <\/td><td>ED 227038<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>FOX'S CASTLE <\/td><td>ED 227039<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GARDENMORRIS <\/td><td>ED 227040<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GEORGESTOWN <\/td><td>ED 227041<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GLEN <\/td><td>ED 227042<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GRAIGNAGOWER <\/td><td>ED 227045<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GURTEEN <\/td><td>ED 227048<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILBARRYMEADEN <\/td><td>ED 227052<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILCOCKAN <\/td><td>ED 227053<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILWATERMOY EAST <\/td><td>ED 227062<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KNOCKAUNBRANDAUN <\/td><td>ED 227065<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KNOCKMAHON <\/td><td>ED 227066<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MOCOLLOP <\/td><td>ED 227068<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MODELLIGO <\/td><td>ED 227070<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MOUNTKENNEDY <\/td><td>ED 227072<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>RATHGORMUCK <\/td><td>ED 227078<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ROSS <\/td><td>ED 227082<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SESKINAN <\/td><td>ED 227083<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TEMPLEMICHAEL <\/td><td>ED 227087<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TINNASAGGART <\/td><td>ED 227088<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300072#WRS01500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Offshore Exploration","counter":895,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300072#WRS01550"},{"type":"question","counter":896,"qnumday":416,"qnumall":"[19111\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300072#WRS01600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he has any plans to examine seabed ice gas reserves that lie off the South West Coast;; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":897,"content":"<p>I understand that there are early indications that methane hydrates may be present offshore of the west of Ireland, in particular in the area of the Rockall Basin.

An appropriate approach to charging those customers who may not be metered when charges are introduced will be put in place.

In 2012 , I introduced a once-off Litter Enforcement Grants Scheme, targeted specifically at the issue of fly tipping and small scale illegal dumping, encouraging local authorities to enhance their existing enforcement activities, through measures such as the purchase of CCTV equipment to allow for the effective monitoring of known litter black spots. I also launched, again in 2012, a national campaign in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency and supported by the print media, to highlight the economic value of our environment and encouraging the public to report all incidences of illegal dumping to the Agency&rsquo;s National Environmental Complaints hotline at 1850 365 121.   <\/p><p>  Existing penalties available under the Litter Pollution Acts for litter offences range from an on-the-spot fine of &euro;150, to a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction, and a maximum fine of &euro;130,000 on conviction on indictment. The fines for continuing offences are &euro;600 per day for summary offences and &euro;10,000 per day for indictable offences. A person convicted of a litter offence may also be required by the court to pay the local authority&rsquo;s costs and expenses in investigating the offence and bringing the prosecution.  Penalties for more serious dumping offences provided for under the Waste Management Acts are also substantial. Persons who are found to be responsible for, or involved in, the unauthorised disposal of waste are liable to a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction and\/or imprisonment for up to 12 months, and to a maximum fine of &euro;15 million on conviction on indictment and\/or imprisonment for up to 10 years. <\/p><p>  Following a review of legislation in this area and notwithstanding the significant penalties currently in place, my Department is currently preparing legislative proposals that would provide for the introduction of a specific on-the-spot fine for incidences of fly-tipping or small-scale illegal dumping. I expect to be in a position to submit proposed Heads of a Bill in this regard to Government for approval shortly.   <\/p><p>  Enforcement action in relation to illegal dumping is a matter for the relevant local authority concerned and also the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Environmental Enforcement (OEE), which supervises the environmental protection activities of local authorities. My Department provides funding to support the activities of a network of local authority environmental enforcement officers and the OEE. Each local authority sets out an annual programme of action, detailing its planned enforcement action in relation to activities such as illegal dumping, towards which this funding will be utilised. <\/p><p>  In relation to the issue of &ldquo;naming and shaming&rdquo;, the Data Protection Commissioner has previously indicated to my Department that actions taken by local authorities in publishing the names and addresses of persons fined or convicted as a result of littering or illegal dumping, whether by publication on their websites or by notices published in the local press and paid for by the local authority, would be in breach of the principles of data protection.  These principles are contained in the Data Protection Act 1988, as amended by the Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2003, and in particular, by Section 2A of that Act. Having examined this matter in some detail, I do not plan to introduce legislation allowing for &ldquo;naming and shaming&rdquo; at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300074#WRU01000","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Noise Pollution Issues","counter":995,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300074#WRU01050"},{"type":"question","counter":996,"qnumday":453,"qnumall":"[18764\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300074#WRU01100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will commit to providing any necessary funds to complete an action plan on noise reduction in the Strawberry Beds area following the noise mapping currently being conducted by the Dublin local authorities along the route of the M50","asker":"954","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":997,"content":"<p>The Environmental Noise Directive (END) 2002\/49\/EC sets out certain requirements for the assessment and management of environmental noise from transport sources, including the making of strategic noise maps and action plans.

As highlighted in the Cross Border Threat Assessment for 2012, fuel laundering continues to be a serious concern for authorities, North and South.

There are currently 35 asylum accommodation centres under contract to RIA, providing accommodation and ancillary services to approximately 4,800 persons.  It is worth noting the decline in the number of persons seeking accommodation in the RIA system in recent years.  During the four year period ending on 31 December, 2012, RIA had closed 25 centres and was accommodating 2,161 fewer persons. During this period, RIA spending had declined from &euro;91.5 million to &euro;62.3 million i.e.32%.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Direct Provision system remains a key pillar of the State's asylum and immigration system.  I, and previous Ministers for Justice and Equality, have explained in response to previous D&aacute;il Questions how the normal structures dealing with homelessness could not cope when the number of asylum seekers arriving in Ireland increased dramatically, and how the Direct Provision system was the only realistic accommodation solution.  There are no cheaper alternatives to the direct provision system.  In fact, if we were operating a system which facilitated asylum seekers in living independent lives in individual housing with social welfare support and payments, aside from the asylum 'pull factor' it would likely create, the cost to the exchequer would be double what is currently paid under the direct provision system. This was a key finding in the recent Value for Money Report on the direct provision system which was published in 2010 and is on the RIA website - <i>www.ria.gov.ie.<\/i>   I have also explained the nature of the full board accommodation system provided; how RIA coordinates through other Government bodies a number of ancillary services to residents; how residents are offered free medical screening on arrival in the State and have access to health services; and how residents have access to primary and secondary education services, on the same basis as Irish citizens. <\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to the broader asylum issue, I acknowledge that the length of time spent in direct provision and the complexity of the asylum process is an issue to be addressed.  The system is inextricably linked to the surrounding asylum process. The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which I intend to re-publish, should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements for asylum, subsidiary protection and leave to remain applications.  It will do this by making provision for the establishment of a single application procedure, so that applicants can be provided with a final decision on all aspects of their protection application in a more straight forward and timely fashion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300075#WRV03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Policy","counter":1070,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300075#WRV03150"},{"type":"question","counter":1071,"qnumday":484,"qnumall":"[18505\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300075#WRV03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide an update on his plans to reform the immigration system in relation to the length of time for court cases in this area to be heard and decided upon; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1010","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1072,"content":"<p>Work on the details of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 is ongoing at my Department pursuant to current Government policy which is committed, under the Programme for Government and<b><\/b>National Recovery, to &quot;introduce comprehensive reforms of the immigration, residency and asylum systems, which will include a statutory appeals system and set out rights and obligations in a transparent way&quot;.

The position with regard to my Department is unchanged since then and was stated as follows.<\/p><p><br \/>  <i>There are no current plans to engage in any form of blanket regularisation of migrants who are unlawfully in the State. It is the responsibility of all non EEA nationals who are resident in the State to ensure that they have an appropriate permission from the Minister for Justice and Equality. Most migrants do in fact comply with this condition and obey the State's immigration laws.<\/i><\/p><p><i>  Clearly, all illegal immigrant cases are not the same and must be dealt with on a case by case basis taking account of their individual circumstances. At one end of the scale are those where the person's illegal status is through no fault of their own and indeed the Department continues to deal with cases of this nature on an ongoing basis. However there are also much more egregious instances of immigration abuse, often at considerable expense to the State and it does not follow that such persons should profit from their conduct.<\/i><\/p><p><i>  At EU level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments &#8220;to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons&#8221;. While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual cases. In our case there are also considerations based on maintaining the integrity of the Common Travel Area with the UK which must be taken into account.<\/i><\/p><p><i>  In looking at cases as they arise, among the issues that would be relevant to the outcome would be the circumstances in which the person became undocumented, the length of time they have been in that situation, their prospects of being able to gain lawful employment without being a drain on the financial resources of the State such as the welfare, health, housing and education areas, along with the more general considerations applicable to immigration decisions, including any family related rights they may have in the context of the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/i><\/p><p><i>  Sometimes case by case consideration will result in a positive outcome for the applicant. However, in other cases this may result in a decision by the Irish authorities, subject to the oversight of our Courts, that the person has to go home. That decision should be respected.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300076#WRW03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Family Reunification","counter":1120,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300076#WRW03250"},{"type":"question","counter":1121,"qnumday":500,"qnumall":"[18785\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300076#WRW03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress made in determination of eligibility for family reunification in the case of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 15; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1122,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that a letter issued to the person referred to by the Deputy on 15th March 2013 in relation to his wife and that a decision will issue to him shortly.<\/p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Substantial work has been undertaken to date on the identification of the forestry assets involved, the determination of their value and the consideration of a number of issues associated with the proposed sale of the harvesting rights.  These include, <i>inter alia<\/i>, the possible impact on the timber industry, public access to recreational land, environmental and social impacts and consequential implications for the company.

While the consideration process is at an advanced stage, no decision has yet been taken.  The outcome of the overall analysis will be considered by the Government upon its conclusion.  In relation to the ownership of the company, Coillte was established as a private company in accordance with the Forestry Act 1988, which also provided for the issue of shares to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is therefore a State owned company.

I have recently held round-table discussions with HSE, service providers, advocates and the voluntary sector in relation to the recent improvements in aftercare service delivery and the proposed legislative change.  My officials have met with their counterparts in Northern Ireland to discuss the nature and impact of the strengthening of aftercare legislatively in Northern Ireland and issues to do with service provision. The Deputy will be aware that I had previously indicated my intention to bring forward legislative amendments in the legislation to establish the Child and Family Agency, and this remains my focus.<\/p><p>  The HSE Children and Family Services has developed a National Policy and Procedures Document which sets out out eligibility, assessment and service available to young people on reaching 18 years and a  National Implementation Group has been established   to oversee the progress and challenges in improving services and outcomes for young people leaving care.  The Group is comprised of representatives of funded services providers such as Focus Ireland and other advocacy organisations, as well as representatives of foster carers and other groups.  They have found  an  increasingly systematic approach across the country  to young people around age sixteen being identified through the care planning review process and a standardised aftercare planning template. This approach is helping the early identification of young people with special needs, such as learning disabilities, and has led to good examples of inter-agency working. There have also been some improvements in the data available although more work is required in this area and in rolling out fully standardised financial allowances.<\/p><p>  The HSE's annual spend on aftercare in 2012 was &euro;17 million. There are currently 45 dedicated aftercare workers in the HSE; additionally, the HSE commissions aftercare services, residential and support in the community, from Focus Ireland, Don Bosco and Cross Care across the country.  The HSE have advised me that approximately 500 young people reach the age of 18 in care every year, with 412 young people in care reaching their 18th birthday in 2012.<\/p><p>  At the end of December 2012:<\/p><p>  - 639 young people over the age of 18 years were supported financially to remain living with their foster carers. These young people did not have to face the transition of leaving their foster carers at age 18 and for many, in addition to having access to an after care worker,  they received their key support from their foster carers.<\/p><p>  - 110 young people were living in supported living arrangements and had an aftercare key worker.<\/p><p>  - there were 384 young people over 21 receiving some aspect of aftercare support; the remaining 1073 were between 18 and 21.<\/p><p> -  599 of the total number  were in full time education.<\/p><p> - a further 656 were in some form of education and training.<\/p><p>  Given the particular difficulties of some young people in areas of mental health and disability, the aftercare policy has a strong multi-agency dimension.  The Aftercare Implementation Group is developing protocols with Social Inclusion, Disability Services, Mental Health Services and Primary Care and the Department of the Environment regarding housing to support this approach.  A protocol has been signed with the Irish Youth Justice Service which covers joint working arrangements for young people in Detention Schools. <\/p><p>  Clearly, there have been improvements in the delivery of an aftercare service but more work remains to be done.  My officials will continue to engage with the HSE to ensure that the service is addressing the needs of these vulnerable young people and the information provided will inform the policy development being undertaken to underpin aftercare in legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300076#WRBB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Children in Care","counter":1327,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300076#WRBB02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1328,"qnumday":570,"qnumall":"[19074\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300076#WRBB02200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will detail the external agencies and NGOs which are funded by the Health Service Executive or her Department to provide aftercare services.","asker":"989","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1329,"content":"<p>The HSE  has advised me it commissions a number of agencies to provide provide aftercare services to young people leaving care as follows: Focus Ireland, Crosscare, Don Bosco, Peter McVerry Trust, Smyly's Aftercare, ClareCare and Good Shepherd Services, Cork.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300076#WRBB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Numbers","counter":1330,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300076#WRBB02350"},{"type":"question","counter":1331,"qnumday":571,"qnumall":"[19075\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300076#WRBB02400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of aftercare workers employed directly by the Health Service Executive.","asker":"989","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1332,"content":"<p>The HSE has advised me that at their last audit in January 2013, there were 45 dedicated aftercare workers in the HSE.

This event provides a forum for wider public consultation and discussion on social inclusion issues, in particular for people experiencing poverty and social exclusion and the groups that work with them.  The forum has ensured that such stakeholders have a voice in the development of the policies that directly affect them, and how they are implemented.  The Social Inclusion Forum is convened by the Department of Social Protection.  In relation to disability funding, this Government currently provides funding of over &euro;1.5 billion to the Disability Services Programme through the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2013, and is committed to protecting frontline services for people with disabilities to the greatest possible extent.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Health is working to ensure that protection is afforded to the disability sector, and the Social Care area as a whole.  In 2013 the HSE is seeking to maximise the provision of services within available resources and to maintaining a consistent level to that provided in 2012,  by providing the following specialist disability services:\tresidential services to over 9,000 people with a disability; day services to over 22,000 people with intellectual and physical disabilities; respite residential support for over 7,500 people with intellectual and physical disabilities; and 1.68 million hours of Personal Assistant\/Home Support Hours.  The Government and the HSE are committed to protecting the level of Personal Assistant services available to persons with disabilities.  In the 2013 National Service Plan (NSP), the HSE's priority is to maximise the provision of services to people with disabilities within available resources and to maintain a consistent level to that provided for in 2012, including the provision of 1.68 million hours of Personal Assistant\/Home Support Hours.<\/p><p>  The demand for life-skills training and day services for school-leavers with disabilities continues to grow.  The HSE expects that approximately 700 school-leavers will require services in 2013.  I am pleased to confirm that, although the 2013 allocation for disability services has been reduced by 1.2%, the HSE National Service Plan includes an additional &euro;4 million to provide training places and day services for school-leavers in 2013.  This funding will be allocated to each HSE Region based on the percentage of population.

Regulations were introduced in 2007 to give legal effect to this change.

The opinion of the Expert Body is supported by the World Health Organisation; the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health Service and the Surgeon General of the United States; the World Dental Federation; the International Association for Dental Research; the Royal College of Physicians of England and by major international scientifically validated reviews in many countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300076#WRCC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Provision","counter":1390,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300076#WRCC02250"},{"type":"question","counter":1391,"qnumday":590,"qnumall":"[18298\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300076#WRCC02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding home help hours in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1392,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300076#WRCC02400","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":1393,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300076#WRCC02450"},{"type":"question","counter":1394,"qnumday":591,"qnumall":"[18374\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300076#WRCC02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if and when a medical card will issue in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Wexford.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1395,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.

Home helps play a vital role in enabling people to continue to live at home and this policy will continue to be a key feature of health service delivery.

Their terms and conditions were covered by an agreement negotiated with the representative unions in 2009.  On 29 June 2012, the Labour Court recommended that the HSE and SIPTU should engage in relation to matters concerning the contracts of home help assistants.  The Court issued a further recommendation on 12 December 2012 noting that management proposals to deal with the issues raised would be encompassed in a comprehensive delivery model for home help services.

The National Ambulance Service (NAS) is not a static service. The NAS deploys its emergency resources in a dynamic manner and works on an area and national, rather than a local, basis.  The dynamic deployment of ambulance resources ensures that the nearest appropriate resource within a region is mobilised to an incident.<\/p><p>  For dynamic deployment of emergency resources within a region to be effective, those resources must be available to be used as efficiently as possible. Following a referral to the Labour Court under the Public Service Agreement, the NAS is progressing a number of efficiencies arising from the Court's ruling, including more efficient rostering and the removal of overtime built in to rosters.  New rosters are now in place and are operating successfully.<\/p><p>  The National Ambulance Service has been addressing response times through a number of measures, including:<\/p><p>- the Performance Improvement Action Plan, focussing on local issues such as call taking and dispatch, faster crew mobilisation and community first responder schemes;<\/p><p>- the intermediate care service (ICS), for non-emergency ambulance transport, such as inter-hospital transfers, freeing emergency vehicles for emergency calls:  nearly 40 ICS staff were appointed last year, with further resources to be deployed in 2013;<\/p><p>- the trial emergency aeromedical service (EAS), which reduces transit times, particularly in the West, and allows emergency vehicles to remain within their regions;<\/p><p>- the national control centre reconfiguration, with one national control system on two sites - Tallaght and Ballyshannon - for improved dispatch and response times, with regional, rather than local, deployment and better use of first responder schemes.<\/p><p>  These measures, together with more effective use of existing resources, for example with improved training and better deployment through more efficient rostering,  will drive the improvement of response times in every region.  This will lead to better services and better outcomes when our citizens need these services.<\/p><p>  In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy regarding the proposal  to invest &euro;12m in the ambulance service in 2013,  as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300076#WREE03500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Abortion Services","counter":1520,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300076#WREE03550"},{"type":"question","counter":1521,"qnumday":635,"qnumall":"[18817\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300076#WREE03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the evidence available in his Department to support the X-Case judgement to provide for abortion on suicide grounds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1095","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1522,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the law in Ireland in this area is set out in Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution, which states: <i>&amp;#8216;The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.'<\/i>  The law was further clarified by the judgment of the Supreme Court, in the case of <i>Attorney General v X &amp;amp; Others<\/i><b><i><\/i><\/b>(the <i>X<\/i> case)<b><i><\/i><\/b>  in 1992.

In relation to the latter, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the successor to HETAC, has established a Standards Development Group for Counselling and Psychotherapy which aims to establish standards of knowledge, skills and competence to be acquired by candidates for educational qualifications that will be required for careers in counselling and\/or psychotherapy.  This is an essential prerequisite to regulation of the profession.  The QQI Report is expected to be completed later this year or early in 2014.

The Review covered the period 2002 to 2009.<\/p><p>- Key findings of the Review include:<\/p><p>- Concerns over the value for money in the context of a rate of increase in Programme funding without an accompanying equivalent increase in passenger numbers or services <\/p><p>- The current organisational structure for delivery (35 RTP groups) is a key factor in the lack of cost efficiencies being achieved both in administration and operations<\/p><p>- The cost of administration has been and remains very high as a proportion of total RTP group expenditure (22% in 2009)<\/p><p>- Substantial increases in operating costs - between 2007 and 2009 wages and salaries doubled as a consequence of increased staffing and salary levels<\/p><p>- Lack of data to measure the benefits of the Programme in terms of addressing social inclusion objectives and data gaps in the framework of performance monitoring and evaluation.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Review made a number of recommendations to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Programme.  The NTA was tasked with implementing the findings of the Review.<\/p><p><br \/>  The main recommendations of the report are:<\/p><p><br \/>  - Reduce overall Programme costs particularly the administration costs<\/p><p><br \/>  - Improve efficiency of the Programm<\/p><p><br \/>  - Address the status of the Programme within the context of public transport regulation in Ireland<\/p><p><br \/>  - Develop a detailed appraisal plan for an organisational restructuring to achieve greater programme efficiencies<\/p><p><br \/>  - Better alignment to be established between the voluntary county-based RTP groups involved and the Local Authorities<\/p><p><br \/>  Administration costs to the Programme were reduced by 33.5 % by end 2012.  Combined with the reduction in Pobal's costs, the threshold administration proportion of 17% recommended in the VfM Review was also achieved by end 2012.  In order to achieve the recommended administration costs of 13%, the proposed restructuring of the RTP is required.\u00a0 The current structures of the RTP are not sustainable if the required efficiencies and savings are to be achieved.  If these are not achieved then with the limited resources available services will decline.<\/p><p><br \/>  The RTP budget for 2014 - 2015 will be determined as part of the estimates and budgetary process for these years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300076#WRHH02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taxi Regulations","counter":1665,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300076#WRHH02350"},{"type":"question","counter":1666,"qnumday":685,"qnumall":"[18911\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300076#WRHH02400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the reasons hackneys cannot use bus lanes and if there will be any attempt to change this regulation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1041","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1667,"content":"<p>The use of bus lanes is provided for in the Road Traffic (Traffic &amp;amp; Parking) Regulations, 1997, as amended.\u00a0 The primary purpose of providing bus lanes is to facilitate and promote bus based public transport.\u00a0 The regulations generally limit the use of bus lanes to buses and, in the case of with-flow bus lanes, to cyclists.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><p>  Having regard to the role of taxis in providing on-street immediate hire services, an exemption to that limitation is allowed in respect of taxis when they are being used in the course of business.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  There have been many requests over the years to extend the use of bus lanes to other categories of road user.\u00a0 These include limousines and hackneys, motorcycles, multi-occupancy vehicles and ambulances for cats.\u00a0 My Department has rejected these requests in light of the original reason for the creation of bus lanes, at the taxpayer&rsquo;s expense, i.e. the prioritisation of public transport and the fact that hackneys and limousines, unlike taxis, are not available for on-street hire.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  My view remains that the use of bus lanes should not be extended in any way which would undermine their original purpose through adding to congestion in these lanes.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300076#WRHH02500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":1669,"qnumday":686,"qnumall":"[18917\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300076#WRHH02600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the work that has taken place with his Department, Dublin City Council, the National Transport Authority and Railway Procurement Agency to plan for the provision of sufficient taxi ranks during the construction of the new Luas line.","asker":"1022","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":1670,"qnumday":687,"qnumall":"[18918\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300076#WRHH02650","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the work that has taken place to plan in conjunction with bodies such as Dublin City Council, the National Transport Authority and Railway Procurement Agency where taxi ranks will be restored and the new ranks that will be required for taxi following the completion of the new Luas line in order to provide the best link up transport provision possible.","asker":"1022","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1671,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 686 and 687 together. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>  The provision of taxi ranks during and after the construction of\u00a0the Luas Cross-City project is a matter for the National Transport Authority (NTA)\u00a0in conjunction with Dublin City Council.

These include, <i>inter alia<\/i>, the possible impact on the timber industry, public access to recreational land, environmental and social impacts and consequential implications for the company.  I note that these are also the issues raised by the Donegal Woodland Owners Society Limited.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government is fully conscious of such concerns in relation to the Coillte sale proposal.  A number of these issues were also discussed in the D&aacute;il debate on the proposal on 26 and 27 February last.  While the consideration process is at an advanced stage, no decision has yet been taken.  The outcome of the overall analysis will be considered by the Government upon its conclusion.  In relation to the ownership of the company, Coillte was established as a private company in accordance with the Forestry Act 1988, which also provided for the issue of shares to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is therefore a State owned company.  I wish to reiterate that it is the sale of the harvesting rights to Coillte's forests that is under consideration and not the sale of the land or the company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300078#WRY01900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dairy Equipment Scheme Applications","counter":1740,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300079#WRZ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1741,"qnumday":522,"qnumall":"[18279\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300079#WRZ00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding grant aid under the dairy equipment scheme in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Limerick; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1056","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1742,"content":"<p>The person concerned is an applicant for grant-aid under the TAMS Dairy Equipment Scheme and has received approval to proceed with the investment works concerned in regard to two separate applications.

I have recently held round-table discussions with HSE, service providers, advocates and the voluntary sector in relation to the recent improvements in aftercare service delivery and the proposed legislative change.  My officials have met with their counterparts in Northern Ireland to discuss the nature and impact of the strengthening of aftercare legislatively in Northern Ireland and issues to do with service provision. The Deputy will be aware that I had previously indicated my intention to bring forward legislative amendments in the legislation to establish the Child and Family Agency, and this remains my focus.<\/p><p>  The HSE Children and Family Services has developed a National Policy and Procedures Document which sets out out eligibility, assessment and service available to young people on reaching 18 years and a  National Implementation Group has been established   to oversee the progress and challenges in improving services and outcomes for young people leaving care.  The Group is comprised of representatives of funded services providers such as Focus Ireland and other advocacy organisations, as well as representatives of foster carers and other groups.  They have found  an  increasingly systematic approach across the country  to young people around age sixteen being identified through the care planning review process and a standardised aftercare planning template. This approach is helping the early identification of young people with special needs, such as learning disabilities, and has led to good examples of inter-agency working. There have also been some improvements in the data available although more work is required in this area and in rolling out fully standardised financial allowances.<\/p><p>  The HSE's annual spend on aftercare in 2012 was &euro;17 million. There are currently 45 dedicated aftercare workers in the HSE; additionally, the HSE commissions aftercare services, residential and support in the community, from Focus Ireland, Don Bosco and Cross Care across the country.  The HSE have advised me that approximately 500 young people reach the age of 18 in care every year, with 412 young people in care reaching their 18th birthday in 2012.<\/p><p>  At the end of December 2012:<\/p><p>  - 639 young people over the age of 18 years were supported financially to remain living with their foster carers. These young people did not have to face the transition of leaving their foster carers at age 18 and for many, in addition to having access to an after care worker,  they received their key support from their foster carers.<\/p><p>  - 110 young people were living in supported living arrangements and had an aftercare key worker.<\/p><p>  - there were 384 young people over 21 receiving some aspect of aftercare support; the remaining 1073 were between 18 and 21.<\/p><p> -  599 of the total number  were in full time education.<\/p><p> - a further 656 were in some form of education and training.<\/p><p>  Given the particular difficulties of some young people in areas of mental health and disability, the aftercare policy has a strong multi-agency dimension.  The Aftercare Implementation Group is developing protocols with Social Inclusion, Disability Services, Mental Health Services and Primary Care and the Department of the Environment regarding housing to support this approach.  A protocol has been signed with the Irish Youth Justice Service which covers joint working arrangements for young people in Detention Schools. <\/p><p>  Clearly, there have been improvements in the delivery of an aftercare service but more work remains to be done.  My officials will continue to engage with the HSE to ensure that the service is addressing the needs of these vulnerable young people and the information provided will inform the policy development being undertaken to underpin aftercare in legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300081#WRBB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Children in Care","counter":1884,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300081#WRBB02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1885,"qnumday":570,"qnumall":"[19074\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300081#WRBB02200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will detail the external agencies and NGOs which are funded by the Health Service Executive or her Department to provide aftercare services.","asker":"989","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1886,"content":"<p>The HSE  has advised me it commissions a number of agencies to provide provide aftercare services to young people leaving care as follows: Focus Ireland, Crosscare, Don Bosco, Peter McVerry Trust, Smyly's Aftercare, ClareCare and Good Shepherd Services, Cork.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300081#WRBB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Numbers","counter":1887,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300081#WRBB02350"},{"type":"question","counter":1888,"qnumday":571,"qnumall":"[19075\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300081#WRBB02400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of aftercare workers employed directly by the Health Service Executive.","asker":"989","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1889,"content":"<p>The HSE has advised me that at their last audit in January 2013, there were 45 dedicated aftercare workers in the HSE.

The forum has ensured that such stakeholders have a voice in the development of the policies that directly affect them, and how they are implemented.  The Social Inclusion Forum is convened by the Department of Social Protection.

I am pleased to confirm that, although the 2013 allocation for disability services has been reduced by 1.2%, the HSE National Service Plan includes an additional &euro;4 million to provide training places and day services for school-leavers in 2013.  This funding will be allocated to each HSE Region based on the percentage of population.  The recommendations of the National Working Group for the Review of HSE-funded Adult Day Services (New Directions) will guide the reconfiguration and modernisation of HSE funded adult day services and will underpin the collaborative action in terms of flexibility and innovation when addressing requirements for school leavers in 2013.

Regulations were introduced in 2007 to give legal effect to this change.  The fluoride currently used is sourced as a primary product; it is mined directly from a raw material source, the mineral fluorospar as calcium fluoride (CaF2).  It then goes through a purification process to conform to tightly controlled specifications under the requirements of CEN Standard I.S.EN 12175:2001 to produce hydrofluorosilicic acid, specifically used as the mineral additive, fluoride, to water.<\/p><p>  The effects of fluoridation on health and related matters are kept under constant review.  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects.  It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and is the safest and most cost effective method of protecting the oral health of the population.  The opinion of the Expert Body is supported by the World Health Organisation; the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the Public Health Service and the Surgeon General of the United States; the World Dental Federation; the International Association for Dental Research; the Royal College of Physicians of England and by major international scientifically validated reviews in many countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300082#WRCC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Provision","counter":1947,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300082#WRCC02250"},{"type":"question","counter":1948,"qnumday":590,"qnumall":"[18298\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300082#WRCC02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding home help hours in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1949,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300082#WRCC02400","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":1950,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300082#WRCC02450"},{"type":"question","counter":1951,"qnumday":591,"qnumall":"[18374\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300082#WRCC02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if and when a medical card will issue in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Wexford.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1952,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.

The National Ambulance Service (NAS) is not a static service. The NAS deploys its emergency resources in a dynamic manner and works on an area and national, rather than a local, basis.  The dynamic deployment of ambulance resources ensures that the nearest appropriate resource within a region is mobilised to an incident.<\/p><p>  For dynamic deployment of emergency resources within a region to be effective, those resources must be available to be used as efficiently as possible. Following a referral to the Labour Court under the Public Service Agreement, the NAS is progressing a number of efficiencies arising from the Court's ruling, including more efficient rostering and the removal of overtime built in to rosters.  New rosters are now in place and are operating successfully.<\/p><p>  The National Ambulance Service has been addressing response times through a number of measures, including:<\/p><p>- the Performance Improvement Action Plan, focussing on local issues such as call taking and dispatch, faster crew mobilisation and community first responder schemes;<\/p><p>- the intermediate care service (ICS), for non-emergency ambulance transport, such as inter-hospital transfers, freeing emergency vehicles for emergency calls:  nearly 40 ICS staff were appointed last year, with further resources to be deployed in 2013;<\/p><p>- the trial emergency aeromedical service (EAS), which reduces transit times, particularly in the West, and allows emergency vehicles to remain within their regions;<\/p><p>- the national control centre reconfiguration, with one national control system on two sites - Tallaght and Ballyshannon - for improved dispatch and response times, with regional, rather than local, deployment and better use of first responder schemes.<\/p><p>  These measures, together with more effective use of existing resources, for example with improved training and better deployment through more efficient rostering,  will drive the improvement of response times in every region.  This will lead to better services and better outcomes when our citizens need these services.<\/p><p>  In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy regarding the proposal  to invest &euro;12m in the ambulance service in 2013,  as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300084#WREE03500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Abortion Services","counter":2077,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300084#WREE03550"},{"type":"question","counter":2078,"qnumday":635,"qnumall":"[18817\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013042300084#WREE03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the evidence available in his Department to support the X-Case judgement to provide for abortion on suicide grounds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1095","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2079,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the law in Ireland in this area is set out in Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution, which states: <i>&amp;#8216;The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.'<\/i>  The law was further clarified by the judgment of the Supreme Court, in the case of <i>Attorney General v X &amp;amp; Others<\/i><b><i><\/i><\/b>(the <i>X<\/i> case)<b><i><\/i><\/b>  in 1992.
