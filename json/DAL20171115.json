The capacity of the Government to deal with the enormity of this crisis is again being called into question with the revelations in an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>today outlining the extremely poor performance in building council houses since the start of 2016.  Less than 1% of the social housing that is needed in this State has been built since the start of 2016 and of the 1,093 social housing units built, 638 were built last year and 455 were built in the first six months of 2017.  Local authorities only built approximately 459 of them according to this article and research.  Across Dublin's four local authority areas, just 478 units have been completed with 324 of them completed by approved bodies.  In the first six months of this year, no social housing was built directly by three of the capital's authorities.  Fingal County Council managed to build ten houses and has a waiting list of approximately 7,000.  In five counties, namely, Laois, Leitrim, Offaly, Roscommon and Wicklow, not a single unit of social housing has been built since 2016.<\/p><p>Even if people query these data, they really reveal a shockingly poor performance.  Apparently County Wexford tops the list with 67 houses having been built, which is the highest in the country.  There were poor outcomes in Limerick, Cork city and Galway, with 50, 59 and 42 houses built, respectively.  No social housing has been built in Kildare since 2016.  It seems to be consistent across the board and is widespread and long term.  Mel Reynolds, one of the analysts quoted, stated:<\/p><blockquote>There is almost nothing happening in social housing.  It seems we are in a mad situation where the strategy is not to build local authority housing at all across the country.<\/blockquote><p>Two years ago, at the formation of the Government, I recall being with independent Deputies and meeting officials in the then Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and I came away with that impression.  There seems be an ongoing strategy to not go down to the road of building council houses again.  It seems to be a policy that is deeply embedded.  Given the enormity of the crisis, it is really shocking how it impacts on families, does the Taoiseach accept these figures represent a failure of the Government's housing policy and its attempt to get to grips with this enormity and to get houses built?  Does he accept there is a deeply embedded policy within the Government and within the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, as well as filtering down through the Government's agencies, to avoid at all costs the building of council houses and to allow the public sector to resolve this crisis for us?  Is this the reality of what has been happening over the last years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510747500,"counter":8,"content":"<p>We all recognise the severity of the housing shortage in this country, the impact it has on people's day-to-day lives, as well as the human impact on young people who are not be able to afford their own home or on those who are living in overcrowded accommodation and sharing rooms when they need better housing.  I do not believe that anyone in the House doubts that impact and the Government certainly does not doubt it.<\/p>  <p>  I do not want to get involved in exchanging statistics with Deputy Martin.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has a different view on the numbers.  It is worth saying the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government estimates that 2,000 new social homes - council houses or apartments - will be built in 2017.  This is 2,000 in total through direct build.  That figure will rise to 3,800 next year.  From building very few social housing units a few years ago, it has gone up to a couple of hundred and will be 2,000 this year and 3,800 by next year.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities can acquire social housing in many different ways.  It is not just a case of local authorities building units.  The Deputy will be aware from the position in Cork situation, it certainly is the case in Fingal, that local authorities often provide public housing through approved housing bodies, AHBs, such as Cl&uacute;id and Fold Ireland for example.  Local authorities also can bring voids back in to use whereby council houses that are no longer habitable are brought back into habitation.  Local authorities sometimes also buy housing directly from private developers.  This is done through Part V or through pure, direct acquisition.  The Deputy made reference to Fingal County Council having built only ten units.  I am sure that is not correct because Fingal is my local authority.  Even if that is correct, I know for a fact that last year the authority bought at least 20 units directly from private developers in Waterville alone.  There are lots of ways to acquire social housing and it is not just done through direct build by councils.  It can be done by approved housing bodies, by purchasing from developers through the Part V system, which ensures integrated communities, and by bringing voids back in to use.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy Martin's question, there is absolutely no difficulty on behalf of this Government when it comes to supporting the construction of social housing.  We agree that building social housing will be part of the solution to the housing crisis.  This is why, in 2018, &euro;1.9 billion has been allocated.  This will allow for 3,800 new social homes to be built directly by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  This is 1,800 more than will be built this year.  In addition, a further 1,200 will be Part V builds.  The Deputies are aware how that works.  Private developers who build a housing estate must offer 10% to the local authority to purchase.  That is a good idea because it means we have much more integrated communities.  In addition to that, 900 will be acquired and bought directly by local authorities and a further 2,000 will be secured through long-term leasing arrangements.  That is a total of 7,900 next year.  It must be acknowledged, the Deputy would want it acknowledged, that the important point is that we provide houses and apartments for people who need them.  Whether this is done through a voluntary housing body, directly through the council or bought by the council does not matter to the person getting the house.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500004#B00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1510747500,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The figures covered both approved housing bodies and local authorities.<\/p><p>Even the figures the Taoiseach mentioned of 2,000 this year and 3,000 will go nowhere near dealing with the crisis.  We all have families coming to us every week in dire situations.  I have a family of a mother and three children living in a hotel in Cork who have been on the city housing list for ten years.  To get a council house now in Cork, one has to be ten years on the list.  The Government and its agencies seem paralysed by the scale of the crisis and the response is in no way proportionate to its severity.  I have to put that to the Taoiseach.  All this bandying about of billions and figures means nothing because we all know, deep down, that local authorities are not building houses at the rate they should be.  They should not be buying houses in the private market at this juncture because they are competing with young couples and contributing to house price inflation.  It is estimated that they could build houses for &euro;200,000, at cost, yet they are going out there and paying &euro;400,000 for housing in the leafy suburbs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500004#B00300","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510747800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500005#C00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1510747800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>It makes no sense.

Yesterday, I had the opportunity to watch Leaders' Questions on television and I listened intently, as I always do, to what the Taoiseach had to say in response to Deputy Mary Lou McDonald's propositions for the resolution of some of the dreadful difficulties around housing provision.  The Taoiseach's answer was not even in response to her questions or to the important issues she raised.<\/p><p>As with his Ard-Fheis speech and other recent remarks, the Taoiseach was talking only to the Fine Gael base and that other section of the electorate that he hopes to win over in the next election.  He may say that is an entirely appropriate thing for him to do and if being here is all about getting into or staying in power, that is fair enough.  However, it should be a question of how he uses that power and whose interests he serves.  If it is a case of governing fairly, building a decent society and guaranteeing people's rights that is a different story entirely.  That should be more important than the Taoiseach's efforts to reposition Fine Gael for the next election.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge that the Taoiseach has just said the Government inherited problems created by Fianna F&aacute;il and others but when Fine Gael took over from Fianna F&aacute;il it followed its policies to the letter and managed collectively to destroy the largest Fine Gael mandate in the history of the State, as well as the Labour Party.  That is because people elected Fine Gael to do something different from Fianna F&aacute;il and because most people are decent they punished it.  Now Deputy Varadkar is Taoiseach, irony of ironies, by virtue of Fianna F&aacute;il support.<\/p> <p> All the problems remain and it seems to me that the Taoiseach's narrative is to minimise the scale of these problems to serve his electoral ambitions.  It does not seem to matter how this affects those whose lives are miserable because of the Government's bad policies.  A very obvious example is how it has dealt with homelessness.  The solution is simple: it is for the State to build more homes and to make housing affordable.  The levels of family, child and adult homelessness are the highest ever recorded in this State.  The Taoiseach's public relations narrative has been picked up by others, including officials whose responsibility it is to solve these problems.  The same is true of cr&egrave;ches and health services, the North, rural Ireland and Brexit.  I appeal to the Taoiseach not to dismiss my comments in his usual glib way.  I ask him to reflect on what I am saying and to consider that his approach will divide our society and fracture it even further.  That in time will be desperately bad for everyone, except the Taoiseach's peer group, even if he succeeds in getting back into government in the next election.  Surely the Taoiseach is obliged to do more than that.  Surely his focus should be on those whose very lives depend on good government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500005#C02100","speaker":"1330","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510748400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Adams.

All of the problems that we inherited from Fianna F&aacute;il do not still remain.  Unemployment, for example, is down from 15% to 6% and falling.  The public finances are now in a much more stable position and our national sovereignty is restored.  There are of course new and other problems, such as Brexit, which the Deputy mentioned, and of course the housing crisis.  We will deal with these problems as soon as we can and will put the maximum effort behind all of those.  I can guarantee we are doing exactly that.<\/p>  <p>  As I mentioned already in my response to Deputy Martin, we are absolutely committed to increasing the provision of social housing in this State.  Some 2,000 new homes will be built directly by local authorities and approved housing bodies this year, rising to just under 4,000 next year.  We have invested in the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, providing funds to local authorities to provide services to land, roads, utilities and so on, to enable those lands be released for housing and affordable housing.  We have increased the vacant site levy to punish land hoarders, so that land is brought into use.  In the Finance Bill 2017, yesterday, we brought in an examination of whether we should tax vacant homes.  It is difficult to know whether we can do that because the numbers for vacant homes are unreliable.  We have changed the planning regulations to fast track planning making it much easier for builders to go for bigger developments and as well as that there are the building regulations which are being changed to reduce the cost of building housing.  Across Government there is an enormous commitment to getting to grips with the housing crisis.<\/p><p>There is also a factual realisation and understanding that this is not a problem that will be solved easily or overnight.  From a point where almost no houses were built in the country for a number of years, we have to a point where thousands rather than hundreds are being constructed.  Next year, there will be tens of thousands.  Against a backdrop of a rising population and increasing household formation, however, it will take time for us to get on top of the problem.

Deputy Mich&eacute;al Martin and others put some of these queries to the Taoiseach yesterday on Leaders' Questions.  It is unfortunate that the Minister failed to make clear in his responses to those parliamentary questions that neither he nor his predecessor had knowledge or were aware of the legal strategy being pursued by the former Garda Commissioner against Maurice McCabe.  That the Taoiseach was able to do so yesterday when asked in this House and subsequently by the media shows it was possible to answer these questions.  I cannot see any legitimate reason for the Minister not to have done so.<\/p>  <p>  While clarity has been bought to that aspect of the situation we are still unclear as to the level of involvement or knowledge of the Department of Justice and Equality in the strategy.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach said that the Department of Justice and Equality is a big place and that many different people are in it but that as things stand the Department has not been able to find any record of being informed before the fact of the legal strategy the former Commissioner was going to pursue.<\/p>  <p>  I would like the Taoiseach to confirm whether he has spoken directly to the Secretary General of the Department on this matter.  Is he satisfied at the absence of sufficient reassurance for him to confirm to the House that the Department was not aware of the strategy to go after Maurice McCabe?  Yesterday, the Taoiseach said the T&aacute;naiste \"found out about it after the fact, but around the time it was in the public domain when everyone else knew about it as well\".<\/p><p> This matter came into the public domain when it was reported on by Mick Clifford and Katie Hannon after the commission had reported in May 2016, which was a full year after the strategy to go after Maurice McCabe was set out by the commission.  If we are to accept that the T&aacute;naiste did not become aware of this until the matter came into the public domain, we must believe two things.  This House is expected to believe either that the Department of Justice and Equality did not receive any contact from Garda management about this issue, even long after the strategy had been dropped, or that the Department actually had this information but sat on it for an entire year without informing the T&aacute;naiste about it.

My predecessors have ruled on this issue and, in certain circumstances, have allowed questions on particular matters that were being examined by judicial tribunals.  Such questions were allowed in a context where there was considered to be a public interest in having a limited engagement on certain matters, while having regard to the fact that we should not encroach on the activities and work of the tribunal.

A report, the Climate Change Performance Index, has just been published.  It was produced by the leading NGOs dealing with this issue across the world.  The process relating to the report has been running for a long time.  The report indicates that Ireland is seen as the worst country in Europe in terms of climate action and is ranked 49th out of the 60 countries assessed.  This is a huge issue for this country and its future, reputation and direction.  When the Taoiseach assumed office, he said that he wanted to make climate action a priority.  I will explain why this is not true.  It is not happening across a range of different areas.  Climate Action Network, one of the authors of the report, said at the conference in Bonn which I attended earlier this week that when it comes to the European talks about climate, Ireland is nowhere to be seen except playing a negative role to try to hinder positive actions.  That is what is happening in the European process under the Taoiseach's Government.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment has just concluded a renewables strategy.  In it, he says we should have no ambition to increase renewable power between now and 2030.  That is the official Government position.  We think we could easily accommodate an increase of 75% in this area, which would send us up the international league tables.  If we did that, we might start holding on to some of the Apple investments that are now reading the tea leaves and heading off to Denmark - not just because our planning process delayed its project but because it senses that this country is not serious about the matter.  That is a significant issue for the development of rural Ireland, including Mayo and Galway.<\/p>  <p>  The position regarding transport is the same.<\/p><p>The Government has just published the national planning framework which states that we want to cut emissions but is doing absolutely nothing about it.  It is all roads and the same old model of sprawl and growth outwards.  That is what it is actually doing.  The Citizens' Assembly did a wonderful job looking at the issue.  The sense of dismay in the assembly at the lack of leadership was absolutely tangible.  It supported the recommendation from Alan Matthews that we should turn Irish agriculture towards a better and more profitable system.  The Taoiseach's Ministers immediately debunked it and said \"No\".  Last week, I asked the Minister for Finance what price he applies to carbon in the projects in his new capital plan.  He said &euro;7 a tonne when the better people, the World Bank and the European Investment Bank, have set it at &euro;40 and &euro;50 a tonne.  In every area the Government is failing in climate action and it is starting to come home to roost where we are shamed in the world.  Our green reputation is in tatters.  The Government is spending a fortune on Origin Green branding but is doing nothing about it in reality.  What will change?  What leadership does the Taoiseach intend to show?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500009#G01700","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510750800,"counter":90,"content":"<p>The report the Deputy refers to has only been published in the last hour or so.  Neither I nor my staff have had an opportunity to read it.  I am informed it is a ranking assessment published by three NGOs.  It is not an official report and has no status other than as a commentary on individual countries' climate policies.  In this respect, the commentary, while it purports to assess countries' national and international climate policies, provides little information on the basis for the compiling of the ranking.  With regard to Ireland's performance against emission targets for 2020 under the EU effort-sharing decision, the Government has been very upfront that Ireland expects to miss these targets.  Ireland will not be alone among EU member states in that regard.  The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions by the Environmental Protection Agency indicate Ireland's emissions in sectors covered by our EU targets could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels.<\/p>  <p>  The projected shortfall in our targets in 2020 reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis and the extremely challenging nature of the target.  It is now accepted that Ireland's 2020 target was not consistent with what would have been achievable on an EU-wide cost-effective basis.  Notwithstanding this projected shortfall, Ireland's first statutory national mitigation plan, which the Government published in July 2017, provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The plan sets out what is being done and what it is planned to do to further the national transition objectives set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act.  This first plan will not provide a complete roadmap to achieve the national transition objectives.  It begins the process of the development of medium to long-term options to ensure we are well-positioned to take the necessary actions in the next few decades.<\/p>  <p>  The national planning framework is a draft.  I do not accept the Deputy's characterisation of it.  The national planning framework goes against continued sprawl.  It argues for a major increase in population in our existing cities in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  It calls for a population increase of 40% to 50% in Limerick, for example, a city in which there has been virtually no population growth in recent years.  Why does it call for that?  It is because it makes sense from a planning and climate change point of view to have more people living more densely in urban settlements.

The Taoiseach constantly accuses other Members of the House of not being up to speed on the brief and of reading out what they have done.  The Taoiseach has just read out the public service response to this.  There is nothing new or different in it.  There is no ambition.  I thought the Taoiseach meant what he said on the first day and was going to do something about it.  There is nothing happening.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said this is just an unofficial report but they are experts in the field who are reading what anyone could read, which is that our emissions are rising and that we are in Europe negotiation trying to get lower emissions targets.  The Taoiseach is always blaming high targets.  It will come home to roost because this is the new, clean industrial revolution that the world is moving towards and we are not.  We are selling ourselves as a green nation.  We can only do that for so long before the reality catches up with us.  The Government needs to change the national planning framework.  The mitigation plan is nowhere near good enough.

The Bill seeks to amend the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act.<\/p><p>I have just returned from the COP23 in Bonn.  Despite what I said last week to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, that I would be mortified representing the country there because of our bad record on meeting the Paris Agreement targets - and that was confirmed to me this morning by the report that has been issued - I was slightly mortified but not as mortified as I could have been because what I found in Bonn was an astonishing and quite scary lack of mention of the elephant in the room.  In other words, the climate problem we face, that is, the continued use of fossil fuels throughout the world, was not really called out.  There are many reasons for this, but I was flabbergasted by the political responses from the majority of delegates and diplomatic representatives there.  At the interparliamentary meeting, I think I was the only delegate to use the dirty words &quot;fossil fuels&quot; and &quot;fossil fuel corporations&quot;.<\/p><p>Apart from Donald Trump and probably a few Members of this House, there is widespread acceptance of the science surrounding climate change.  The earth is now 1&deg; Celsius warmer than the pre-industrial average and is on course for an increase of 1.5&deg;.  The level of carbon and other greenhouse gases being emitted by industry and land use change means that if we keep on in a business-as-usual scenario, we will be locked into a 3&deg; or 4&deg; temperature rise in the future.  This would be an extinction event.  We are already seeing the disastrous consequences for large parts of the globe, particularly the developing world, with the rise of CO<sub>2<\/sub>levels to 400 parts per million.  Such CO<sub>2<\/sub>levels are unacceptable and constitute a climate emergency.  Unfortunately, even if the Paris Agreement commitments were delivered, we would still be on course for a 2&deg; and possibly a 3&deg; temperature rise.  Large parts of the globe, millions of people on it and entire ecosystems face destruction.  We know already that 80% of the proved reserves of fossil fuels need to remain in the ground if we are to have any hope of limiting temperature rises in line with the Paris Agreement.  However, incredibly, here and elsewhere we are still issuing licences for the new exploration of sources of gas and oil, and this must stop.  We must leave this in the ground and we must politically name and shame the actual causes of climate change, namely, the addiction of fossil fuel corporations to profits that is driving climate change, not the addiction of ordinary people to fossil fuels.<\/p><p>This Bill will simply mean that while there is a climate emergency, no new licences shall be issued from this country for oil or gas exploration.  It is a simple but significant measure, and we would be the third such country to attempt to adopt such a measure, after France and Costa Rica.<\/p><p>In doing so, we could be world leaders in the attempt to deal with climate change.  We saw this morning how we played a huge role in being world leaders in dealing with marriage equality, with a great result in Australia and the role played by Irish people there.  This country could play a leading role, as was repeated to me many times at the conference in Bonn, in dealing with climate change if we were to implement this simple measure.  It is not because we are a significant player in fossil fuel exploration but that cumulatively, with France, Costa Rica and others that may follow, we will put pressure on Donald Trump, Saudi Arabia and so on to take the matter seriously.  It is a significant measure and takes as its benchmark the figure of 350 parts per million of CO2 as the maximum that humanity should seek to have in the atmosphere.  Anything above that will define the world as being in a climate emergency.  It is currently above 400 parts per million.  This is the first time we have reached that in a million years of the earth's history.  It is unbelievable.  This figure does not come from me, but from scientists and campaigners such as James Hansen and Bill McKibben, who are very well-known in the science community.<\/p> <p> It represents a small but historic step and look forward to cross-party support.  If we can follow that up with real investment in renewable energy and public transport, we would be on course to improve our current standing as one of the world's worst contributors to dealing with climate change.  I believe what was said to us by global scientists in Bonn, that it would be significant if a small country like Ireland could provide a positive lead to dealing with climate change by leaving fossil fuel in the ground and not issuing any more licences for exploration of gas or oil along our shores.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500016#O00900","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510754400,"counter":163,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500017#P00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1510754400,"counter":164,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500017#P00300","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510754400,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1510754400,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500017#P00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1510754400,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500017#P00600","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510754400,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions","time":1510754400,"counter":169,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500017#P00700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cabinet Committee Meetings","time":1510754400,"counter":170,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500017#P00750"},{"type":"question","time":1510754400,"counter":171,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[47835\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500017#P00800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee E (health) will next meet.

On Friday, I met with a number of groups in Waterford campaigning for 24-hour cardiac care support, including a second catheterisation laboratory on a permanent basis and the provision of a 24-7 emergency facility.  The report commissioned by the Government, by Dr. Niall Herity, in July 2016, stated that any elective procedures would be carried out in the south east region, putting at risk people who live more than the 90 minute critical timespace away from either the Dublin or Cork based hospitals.

Pardon me - it was not clear and I was not sure.  I was wondering at the gap between the last time and the next scheduled meeting later this month.  I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that over the first ten months of this year, record levels of people have been left on trolleys in hospitals throughout the State.  I am sure many colleagues here have particular instances reflected to them, as a very distressing case was reflected to me in the recent past.  As we progress into the winter, these figures are set to continue to rise.  Over the period I refer to, up to this particular point over 2017, some 82,000 patients admitted have experienced time on a trolley.  Throughout the month of October, the figure reached 9,000.  Any extrapolation of those figures could indicate that between this month and next, we could very well reach almost 100,000 people or more.  This is a 15% increase in the October figures compared to the figure for the same month in the previous year.  This is a very difficult issue not only for staff in our hospitals, but for families coping with loved ones in hospital care.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach is familiar with the problem, having formerly been a Minister for Health himself.  At this late point, what steps are being seriously taken to address this matter?  It was an issue the Taoiseach flagged up himself in the course of his own tenure in office.  When he took over as leader of Fine Gael, I recall him indicating that he would take a special interest in health.  What is being done to address this serious issue?  When will we see a detailed, costed overall plan with a timeframe?  A plan is needed to tackle this unacceptable situation across our public hospital network.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500017#P01200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1510754400,"counter":177,"content":"<p>Whereas, in principle, the Government says that it is in favour of Sl&aacute;intecare, reading between the lines, I do not get a sense that the Government is totally committed to Sl&aacute;intecare at all.  The Taoiseach's reply confirms that to me, since he says there is further work to be done on costings and implementation which is code for me for slowing down the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  I have not had any sense of the Government deciding to hammer out the issues, whatever the issues are that the Department and Government seem concerned about.  In the absence of Sl&aacute;intecare, if that work is going to continue, there does not appear to be any real strategy governing health at the moment within the Government.  There has been an absence of a strategy since universal health insurance was abandoned.  It took five years to abandon a false promise that was made to the people in 2011.  It was repeatedly promised that there would be universal health insurance and we got nowhere near implementing it.  Senator James Reilly, then Minister for Health, abolished the board of the HSE and played politics with the whole thing, and then announced the establishment of hospital groups with no boards, just a chair and executive.<\/p><p>The governance of health has been in limbo for the past six years.  I now learn the Government, belatedly, will reappoint an external board to the HSE.  The situation has been unsatisfactory and incoherent in recent years with regard to the governance side; nobody is in a position to make up their mind, people were appointed not knowing what their mandate is and what the future held for them.  Over the past year or so, hospital groups in particular have communicated to us about being in a limbo situation with regard to legislation.<\/p> <p> I echo Deputy Howlin's comments on the south east.  Prior to the Herity report, a reconfiguration report and an earlier national cardiac report recommended emergency heart care cover for the south east.  I do not believe that Cork can deal with the patient cohort from the south-east area.  University Hospital Waterford was left very short in respect of the reconfiguration report.  Wexford and Kilkenny moved out of the south-east health area, became connected to the Dublin region and Waterford was on its own.  Prior to that Waterford had been the main hospital in the south east, or was meant to be, in the South Eastern Health Board's original strategy.  Now, once again, it is in a limbo situation and, as a result, is losing a lot of vital services such as the emergency cardiac care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500017#P01300","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510755000,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Deputy Howlin's remark that there are no allocations for Sl&aacute;intecare in the budget is incorrect.  There is an allocation to establish the health reform office.  One of the recommendations in the Sl&aacute;intecare report was that one of the first actions to be done is the establishment of such an office to work on the implementation plan for Sl&aacute;intecare.  Sl&aacute;intecare is a plan for a plan, it is not a plan in itself.  It requires an implementation plan and it recommends that a number of reviews be done.  Those reviews have to be done, one of which is the review of the public-private mix in the public hospitals and how it might be eliminated.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has appointed a group to do that.  This group is, I believe, led by Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report also recommends that we begin, progressively over time, to reduce out-of-pocket expenses and costs for patients.  There are two specific measures in the budget that do exactly that, namely, a reduction in the prescription charge for medical card holders under the age of 70 - having done it for the over-70s last year - and the reduction in the monthly charge for the drugs payment scheme, DPS, for those who do not have medical cards.  That will be reduced by &euro;10 per week-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500018#Q00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1510755000,"counter":180,"content":"<p>That was in all our manifestos.

He determined that it would not be safe or sustainable to provide 24-7 primary PCI in University Hospital Waterford.  I am aware that the report has been rejected by many of the campaigners there and the clinicians working in the cardiology service there.  Nonetheless, I believe all in the House would agree that decisions on where national or regional specialist units should be located must be based on scientific advice, not on politics.  The Minister for Health plans a national review, which will be different to previous reviews.  It will not simply be an expert review.  There will be much more room in it to hear other voices such as the voices of patients and others.<\/p>  <p>  On a more positive note, the second cath lab is now in place.  It is a mobile cath lab at University Hospital Waterford and is working on elective cases.  It seems to be having some success in reducing waiting times for people who need cardiac procedures.  In the interim, we will have to give consideration to whether that second cath lab should be kept in place.  While it may not be providing 24-7 primary PCI, it appears to be reducing waiting lists and waiting times for patients who need cardiac procedures on an elective basis.  That has to be a positive.<\/p>  <p>  Reference was made to scheduling of Cabinet sub-committee meetings.  I believe I have explained this before.  The Cabinet meets each week, sometimes twice per week now, and that is where most business is done.  The Cabinet sub-committees meet every six weeks, not to crisis-manage but to deal with strategic planning, strategies, reviews and long-term policy thinking.  I meet bilaterally with Ministers all the time, more often than I am able to keep records of.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare report but we do understand what it is.  As I have already said, it is a plan for a plan, not an implementation plan.  We are committed to the principles such as public health and the need to improve our health as a nation and as individuals.  We will not deal with any of the long-term problems in health care or ever get on top of the costs if we do not deal with that.  On the investment in capital and ICT, there is an increase in capital spending for health happening already and into the future.  There is also a great emphasis on primary and community care, reducing out-of-pocket expenses and reviewing the public-private split in our hospitals.  Those principles are very much accepted by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  There are, however, issues.  Deputy Martin asked what these are.  There are issues around the costings, which need to be interrogated.  I had one costing looked at within recent days.  I believe we would all agree that there should be a lower threshold for individuals on the DPS.  It is currently assessed on a household basis and this does not properly recognise that individuals - single people - can lose out under such a system.  The costings in the report suggest that the threshold could be halved and it would cost only &euro;7 million.  After interrogation, however, nobody is actually able to come up with an estimate as to what it would cost because there are no records of whether people live in single-person households.  As a result, that costing is certainly wrong.  That gives just one small example of how costings in the report are definitely wrong and need to be interrogated further.<\/p>  <p>  The report leaves open the question as to where the money will come from for its implementation.  The report does not say, for example, that the funding should come solely from general taxation.  It suggests a number of different sources as to where money could come from, including co-payments and social insurance.  That would need to be teased out.<\/p>  <p>  The report does not deal with one of the big questions we face in health care, which is why we spend so much and not get value for money for it.  I have often said that spending on health in Ireland is in the top tier per head in the western world.  We do not, however, have top-tier access.  Any report about reform of our health service would have to deal comprehensively with that question.<\/p>  <p>  The report does not come to conclusions; it recommends a number of different reviews.  It recommends that further reviews be done on certain areas such as the public-private mix, which we have started.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500018#Q00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1510755000,"counter":182,"content":"<p>So it is back to normal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500018#Q00500","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1510755000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>The sense I get from members of the Opposition is that they are accusing the Government of somehow paying lip-service to supporting Sl&aacute;intecare, even though we are actually taking it seriously and doing some of what is recommended in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500018#Q00600","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1510755000,"counter":184,"content":"<p>But all the commentary-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500018#Q00700","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1510755000,"counter":185,"content":"<p>It seems to me that the Opposition parties are actually paying lip-service to it.

It would be very useful for the debate if it was published.

Those are we all share, none more than those of us who have the privilege to represent Border constituencies.  Last month, three reports were presented to the European Parliament's agriculture committee which exposed not only how badly Ireland's largest indigenous sector will be affected by Brexit, but also just how unprepared the authorities here and in Europe are to cope with the changing landscape.  The reports make for very grim reading, especially for Ireland where the brunt of the economic shocks will unquestionably be felt.<\/p><p>Irish farmers are particularly vulnerable, not just because of their reliance on British markets to sell their produce but also as a result of consumer tastes and processing routes.  Almost all of the processed foods that we deliver, even to the Continent of Europe, are transported across Britain at some point.  When Britain leaves the EU, there is a possibility that Irish hauliers will be stopped up to four times in a single journey.  This will have a very serious impact on their competitiveness and their ability to hold their share of the market.  What is the Government's most up-to-date thinking on what I and many believe to be the best way of achieving the least worst scenario out of all this, namely, designated special status for the North of Ireland within the European Union?

I do not know what \"I am not afraid of it\" means because all the analysis I have read indicates that the consequences would be disastrous for this country.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could do two things.  Last week, he indicated that he is confident and at the weekend that he is prepared for a hard Brexit.  What is his analysis of the prospect of being able to move on - with a satisfactory conclusion for Ireland - to phase 2 at the December Council meeting?

I am not saying he made a definitive statement.  He indicated a degree of positivity or optimism about the possibility.  I am concerned because we are up against an almost dysfunctional British Government that is conducting negotiations while there is an internal war over Brexit among the principle negotiators, the Tories.  Have strategic risk assessments been carried out in the Departments of the Taoiseach, Foreign Affairs and Trade or Finance on the implications for the development of Irish tax policy, particularly corporation tax, post-Brexit?<\/p>  <p>  Understandably, the Taoiseach also indicated last week, during his visit to the United States, that he is very excited at the developments in robotics and so on and that we should be at the cutting edge when it comes to the development of driverless vehicles.  I believe he was referring to lorries in that regard.  The tax and jobs implications of that, coming together with Brexit, are enormous.

There are lots of other people -hundreds in fact - working on international affairs, on Brexit and on issues relating to Northern Ireland within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Additional people in the various agencies -  IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia and so on - area also engaged in this work.  We do not need to replicate the work they do in the Department of the Taoiseach but we do need to oversee and coordinate it.  That is the role of the Department of the Taoiseach and 25 people is an adequate number to do that at this stage.<\/p><p>In respect of Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin's reference to the announcement of a breakthrough or breakdown, I do not recall anyone making an announcement of a breakthrough or breakdown in the talks.  That is an interpretation or misunderstanding on the Deputy's part.  The situation is very fluid and is changing all the time.  For that reason, I will not give a running commentary on the negotiations and I will not provide an analysis in respect of them because things change a lot from day to day.  I will be in Gothenburg on Friday to meet other Heads of State and Government.  I will have an assessment after that which may be different from one I might give now.  I do not want to cause confusion or distress for other leaders or Deputies by being obliged to provide different analyses on different days.<\/p><p>As Deputy &Oacute; Caolain knows, the proposal for designated special status has been rejected by the United Kingdom.  It has not been sought by Northern Ireland because there is no Executive or Assembly to seek it.  If they existed they probably would not seek it.  A very unhelpful motion tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in MEPs and calling for special status for Northern Ireland was rejected by the European Parliament because, of course, using a term such as &quot;special status&quot; sets off alarm bells for other countries.  It speaks to separatism within their own countries and to a view within the European Union that the <i>acquis<\/i>should apply and that there should not be exceptions created for other areas.  This conversation about and demand for special status - and particularly the use of that term - is detrimental to our national interest.  From time to time, we speak about unique or special arrangements.  However, those are quite different. <\/p><p>On contingency planning, as I have said before, the kind of contingency planning we are doing is for different scenarios and there are many that could arise and that is the planning we are doing.  It does not, however, extend to hiring border guards or training dogs or scoping out sites for border posts.  Nor would it extend to designing information technology, IT, systems or customs forms or anything like that because trade is an exclusive competence of the European Union and anything done on that basis would have to be done on a European level not by a member state or domestic government.  <\/p><p>On corporation tax, I do not know the details of any analyses carried out by the Department of Finance on these issues but I am sure it does carry them out from time to time.  Our position on corporate tax is straightforward.  We believe in tax sovereignty.  Corporation and income taxes should be set by national parliaments and national taxes should fund national budgets.  That could only ever be changed by unanimity in the European Union.  There certainly is not unanimous support for any change to that.  We do not need to do a lot of analysis in respect of it because our position on that is exactly as it is, namely, that there will be no change.<\/p><p>As for embracing new technologies, I can understand the fears Deputy Burton may have around future technologies, artificial intelligence, robotics and driverless vehicles, but history teaches us that there have always been people and political forces afraid of new technologies.

We all acknowledge the distress caused to patients and families, and indeed the impact on staff, when cramped and overcrowded conditions are experienced in some of our hospital emergency departments.  I have outlined on many occasions what we need to do to break that cycle.  I have referred to the bed capacity review and the need for significant capital investment.  We need to turn Sl&aacute;intecare into a reality and take some services out of our acute hospitals and put them into primary care.  I opened a primary care centre in Castlebar, County Mayo, last Friday.  In April of this year, there were 517 people were awaiting X-rays at Mayo General Hospital.  That figure has now been reduced to zero as a result of the decision to provide such facilities in the primary care system.<\/p><p>By the end of September, emergency department attendances had increased this year by over 1.8%, or more than 16,000 patients.  This includes a 5% increase in emergency department attendances by people over the age of 75.  In this context, trolley numbers and patient experience times are showing some small improvements on this time last year.  That is not to suggest there is anything to be triumphalist about.  HSE data show that on 13 November 2017, over 1,000 fewer patients were waiting on trolleys this year compared to last year.  It is important to acknowledge the progress that is being made by our hospital and our front-line staff.<\/p><p>According to the HSE's TrolleyGAR figures, which are published on the HSE website at 8 o'clock every morning, every day so far in November there have been fewer patients on hospital trolleys than there were on the same day last year.  There have been fewer patients on trolleys 15 days in a row.  Winter started on 1 November, presumably, and it is now 15 November.  On every single one of those days, there have been fewer patients on trolleys.  I accept that the number of patients on trolleys is still far too great.  I do not accept the idea of constantly referring to new records at a time when some of our front-line staff and management personnel are making significant progress.<\/p><p>Several hospitals are showing significant overall improvements in trolley numbers.  According to HSE data for the period to the end of September, the number of people on trolleys at Mayo General Hospital, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda and Beaumont Hospital has reduced by between 30% and 40% compared to the same period in 2016.  The Deputy is right when he suggests we have an awful lot more to do.  I think we all share a view on what needs to be done in the medium term.  What are we going to do right now as we come into the winter?  I am happy to confirm that &euro;40 million in additional funding has been made available as part of budget 2018 to address winter pressures and waiting lists over the rest of this year.  A further &euro;45 million has been allocated for measures to improve access to unscheduled care and other acute hospital priorities.  That means more home care packages.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>Some of this funding is already being utilised within the system, with an additional 45 home care packages and 20 transitional care beds being provided each week for the duration of the winter period.  This funding will allow patients to return home or go to an appropriate community setting, when clinically appropriate, thereby helping to alleviate some of the pressures our hospitals are experiencing.  Funding will be provided to increase bed capacity this winter and as part of service planning for 2018.  The Department of Health is undertaking a health service capacity review in line with a commitment in the programme for Government.  The findings of this review, which are due to be published before the end of the year, will provide an evidence base for future capacity decisions.  All hospital groups and community health organisations have developed and put in place integrated winter preparedness plans for their localities focused on planning and escalation preparedness, maintaining patient flow processes and ensuring public health preparedness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500022#U00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1510757400,"counter":296,"content":"<p>The Government is making an effort to normalise misery and mediocrity in all areas of Irish life.  The Taoiseach recently spoke about the normalising of homelessness.  This can be seen in the crime statistics as well.

I recently received information in replies to parliamentary questions about the number of people over 75 years of age who are waiting 24 hours or more on trolleys in emergency departments.  The Government is failing to achieve the targets it has set for itself.  Elderly people are lying on trolleys.  All the clinical evidence shows that if proper wards are not accessed in a timely manner, there are adverse health outcomes.  Overcrowding is costing us lives.  The statistics are there.

I am not going to stand here and allow Deputy Kelleher to decide the narrative.  I am going to follow the evidence and see where it brings us.  Every single day so far in November, there have been fewer patients on trolleys.  I will send a copy of those figures to the Deputy.  Perhaps I will put them on the record of the House.  The idea that the Deputy has decided that this is the worst winter ever, even though the winter period just started at the beginning of this month, is not factually backed up.  That is not to say we do not need to do much more.  The Deputy is particularly right when it comes to older people on trolleys.  That is why we are putting in place a programme of frailty teams.  This will mean that older people are streamed to geriatricians when they come through the doors of our emergency departments.  We need to do more with home care packages.  Funding has been provided for an additional 45 home care packages each week from now until the end of the year.  This will be sustained throughout 2018.

The Minister can pick out statistics to show there has been a small reduction in the number of people on trolleys so far in November, but the overall position points to the fact that our hospitals simply do not have sufficient capacity.  I refer to the numbers of beds, clinicians and front-line staff dealing with patients.  That is manifesting itself in the consistent need to keep elderly people on trolleys for long periods.  Front-line staff are saying that this is jeopardising patient safety.  With the onset of winter, the concern is that this could have profound implications for the ability of our emergency departments to cope in the event of an outbreak of flu or the winter vomiting bug.

I look forward to going before the Joint Committee on Health and Children next Thursday to outline the steps we have taken in this regard.  The bed capacity review I will receive by the end of this year will tell us how many hospital beds and other beds we need right across the health services and for the next 30 years.  It will set out how many beds will be needed if we stand still and do nothing and how many beds will be needed if we implement Sl&aacute;intecare.  The Deputy is right when he says we need to get on with expanding capacity.  As of today, I have to use all the levers at my disposal, including more social care, more community intervention teams, opening transitional care beds, encouraging people to get the flu and trying to encourage people to go to the appropriate place, which is not always the emergency department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500022#U00800","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1510757400,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I am sure the Minister means that people should get the flu injection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500022#U00900","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1510757400,"counter":303,"content":"<p>Very much so.

I have been made aware of concerns about complications arising from the use of transvaginal mesh devices in women.  Recent media reports here and elsewhere have highlighted concerns that have arisen for some women.  A number of women who had these devices inserted for\u00a0the treatment of specific\u00a0medical conditions have reported negative experiences.\u00a0 It is important for me to say that these devices have been shown to be as effective as more invasive surgery, with the advantages of shorter operating and admission times, a quicker return to normal activities and lower rates of complications.  My Department is not aware of any scientific evidence which concludes that these devices are unsafe when used in line with their intended use.\u00a0 These mesh devices continue to be certified as compliant with EU legislation and have not been removed from the market by regulators in Europe.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, there is no such thing as a medical or surgical procedure that does not carry some risk.  That is why the Health Products Regulatory Authority\u00a0monitors the safety of medical devices placed on the market and monitors international data on such matters.\u00a0 The authority has received six incident reports in relation to these devices, four of which have been received following recent media coverage.  Perhaps this suggests that more people are coming forward as they are being made aware of this issue.\u00a0 It is important that clinical facts and evidence determine the further response I give to the issues raised by the Deputy.  I have asked the Chief Medical Officer to provide a report on the issues raised.

An interdepartmental \"Make Work Pay\" group was set up under the Government's comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities.  This group was independently chaired by Professor Frances Ruane and I thank her for the wonderful work she did.  The group's report sets out findings and recommendations, some of which deal with the potential loss of a medical card, which can act as a barrier to take-up of employment for persons with disabilities who wish to engage in work and have the capacity to do so.  When that report was published, I was struck by the concern people with a disability had about losing the medical card.  Be it a real or perceived concern, it was one of the biggest barriers in many cases.<\/p>  <p>  The report made two principal recommendations regarding medical cards and people with disabilities.  The first was to raise the medical card income disregard from its current level of &euro;120 per week for people on disability allowance or on partial capacity benefit.  I am strongly committed to the implementation of this recommendation.  To that end, my Department is working with the HSE and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in order to assess the number of people who would stand to benefit under this measure and, most importantly, to examine the best administrative route to implementing a change in the earnings disregard.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that this work is expected to be completed shortly and it is my intention to implement the recommendation by the end of 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The second recommendation was that the medical card guidelines be amended to remove a requirement that employment be of a \"rehabilitative nature\" in order for the associated income to be disregarded from the calculation of income when a person with a disability is being assessed for a medical card.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that this recommendation has also been accepted and is being implemented by the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500023#V00900","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1510758000,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I very much welcome the Minister's news in this regard.  Since my appointment as party spokesperson on disability a year and a half ago, I have met with many groups and advocates for people with disabilities.  Across the range, this concern is the biggest fear.  It is probably the most mentioned issue.  People are very afraid that they will lose their medical card.  The medical card opens many doors.  It is not just about their medicine.  Medical support will be required, particularly for people with a permanent disability, which will improve their quality of life but quality of life extends beyond medical care.  These people should be allowed to reach their full potential and get a job for which they are qualified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500023#V01000","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speech","time":1510758000,"counter":322,"content":"<p>The Deputy is entirely correct, which is why it is so important that things like the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities is implemented in full.

People with disabilities that the Deputy and I meet do not just want the State to provide them with a support and say \"there you go\".  They want to be able to get on with their lives and be empowered to do so.  When one reads the report published by Professor Ruane and the group in April, it is very clear that one of the reasons why people were often afraid to access the workplace was because they could not manage without that medical card because it is a passport for many other services.  I am very pleased to accept the recommendation in full.  I expect the new income disregard to be brought in by the end of the year.  That, coupled with the removal of the necessity for the work to be rehabilitative in nature, should, hopefully, help fulfil two very important recommendations and make a real difference to people with disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500023#V01100","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1510758000,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I will be watching closely for that threshold to be changed.

This concern arises due to the way the current system operates because for persons on disability allowance to retain an automatic entitlement to the medical card, an earnings disregard is applied.  This means they can only have a weekly earning of up to &euro;120 per week.  This is doing exactly what the Deputy said.

The Government has taken action to address this and the consequent increase in demand for services.  Over the period in question, there has been a substantial parallel increase in awareness of mental well-being in society and a reduction in the stigma associated with mental health issues.<\/p>  <p>  In budget 2018, the Government provided almost &euro;60 million in additional mental health funding, including &euro;35 million for the development of new services.  This means the mental health budget has been increased by approximately &euro;200 million since 2012.  A Programme for a Partnership Government contains a clear commitment to increasing our mental health budget annually, as resources allow, in order to expand existing services.<\/p>  <p>  This new investment has facilitated the approval of around 1,500 new posts and a subsequent increase in mental health staffing numbers.  At the end of September 2017, there were 9,744 whole-time equivalents employed in the mental health division as opposed to 9,404 in December 2015.  The investment in question has also enabled the HSE to provide for an additional 130 undergraduate psychiatric nurses and 40 postgraduate psychiatric nurses each year.  In addition, the funding increase has made possible the introduction of 114 assistant psychology posts and 20 psychologist posts in primary care.  These will enhance early intervention-primary care counselling services for those under 18 in particular and relieve pressures on specialist child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  This new investment has also led to an increase in activity.  For example, the number of children attending CAMHS in 2016 was 12,386 while the expected number for 2017 is 14,365.<\/p>  <p>  While the substantial funding increase has helped to fund vital mental health services, it is important to ensure these services are delivered as efficiently and effectively as possible.  With this in mind, a number of policy initiatives are being progressed.  These include the development of a refreshed policy for mental health and the development of an implementation plan for the Connecting for Life suicide reduction strategy.  As well as these, I will be bringing the final recommendations of the national task force on youth mental health to Government in the coming weeks.  This initiative will help to develop resilience and coping mechanisms among children and young people.  The fourth policy initiative is the pathfinder project on youth mental health.

The HSE provides orthodontic treatment to those who have the greatest level of need and have been assessed and referred for treatment before their 16th birthday.  An orthodontic assessment determines if the referral meets the criteria for the service and, if so, what priority the patient is given.  Those with greatest clinical need are prioritised, which is appropriate, and are seen within one year.  Some patients will particularly benefit from treatment coinciding with their growth.  These patients are generally seen within 18 to 24 months.  While too many are waiting, it is important that we factor in the clinical view regarding treatment coinciding with a patient's growth and appropriate age.<\/p>  <p>  A Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to providing timely access to orthodontic care.  In order to address long waiting times, the HSE has procured orthodontic services in primary care from a number of private service providers and a budget of &euro;1 million per annum is being dedicated to this initiative, which commenced in 2016.  To date, 142 patients from Cork and Kerry have been treated under this initiative.

This will identify whether changes may be required to the current allocation of resources, including staff, in order to be more responsive to patients' needs.<\/p>  <p>  Nationally, the HSE is also working on a programme to upskill dental hygienists and dental nurses to become orthodontic therapists.

I accept that the provision of anomaly scanning is not uniform throughout the country.  However, we are working to address this.  I want to assure Deputy Troy of that.  The national maternity strategy is very clear that all women must have equal access to standardised ultrasound services.  The strategy will be implemented on a phased basis over the coming years - I have just published the first implementation plan - and this work will be led by the HSE national women and infants health programme.  This is a specific programme office within the HSE very similar to the way we delivered improvements in cancer services in the past.  Last month, I was pleased to launch the programme&rsquo;s detailed implementation plan. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that anomaly scans are available in each hospital group, as distinct from each hospital.  I am also advised that those maternity hospitals and units which currently provide anomaly scans accept referrals from other maternity units.  This occurs where the medical team in the referring maternity unit considers that such a scan is clinically indicated.  I am informed that the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar provides anomaly scans to women when clinically indicated to do so.<\/p><p>One of the current challenges to increasing access to anomaly scans is the recruitment of ultrasonographers.  In this context, it is expected that the establishment of maternity networks across hospital groups will assist in the development of a sustainable model that ensures all women can have access to anomaly scans routinely.  They are already happening where clinically indicated.  I think what the Deputy is asking me is when they will be available routinely for all women.  I am assured that the programme will continue to work with the maternity networks to assist in increasing access to anomaly scans for those maternity units that currently have limited availability.  The additional funding that will be provided for anomaly scanning in 2018 will be set out in detail in the national service plan, which I hope to publish in the coming weeks.  I assure the Deputy in the interests of clarity that specific funding will be provided for the recruitment of additional ultrasonographers in 2018.  The exact details will be outlined.  I expect, and the national women and infants health programme expects, that we will have more sonographers working in our health service next year.  That should enable us to further increase provision beyond just where clinically indicated and to offer anomaly scans on a routine basis.

He is right that the national maternity strategy states there must be equal access to standardised ultrasound services for every pregnant woman, not just where there is a potential risk to the child or the mother.  That followed the identification of a geographic inequity in the availability of 20-week foetal anomaly scans.  The Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar does not just serve Mullingar.  It serves all of Westmeath and Longford, and parts of Offaly, Meath, Louth and Roscommon.  It actually services quite a large geographical area.  I know this matter is a priority as part of the hospital business case for 2018.  I stand to be corrected but I am led to believe that the hospital has the highest rate of births outside Dublin.

I think it is right and proper that we start with clinical indications, in the interest of women's health and wellbeing, and that we make sure the scans are available in every hospital group, which is the current situation.  The regional hospital in Mullingar is doing an excellent job in that regard and I thank its staff for that.<\/p>  <p>  We will be looking at how we can deploy the extra ultrasonographers we will be hiring in 2018 to best ensure geographic equity.

The increased level of funding available to the health sector in 2018 seeks to address the challenges facing the health services into the future posed by demographic pressures, including a rise in chronic diseases and an ageing population, technological developments and health inflation.  These challenges are being addressed through the implementation of strategic initiatives such as ongoing initiatives to improve access and the continued focus on the shift to primary care, while continuing to address effective management of resources to ensure that services are delivered in line with the national service plan and within budget.<\/p>  <p>  Let us break down that figure of &euro;658 million, which I think is what the Deputy wants me to do.  Of the increase in funding, over &euro;200 million was provided for new developments, which will include expansion of existing services - things we are not doing this year and wish to do next year, and things we wish to do more.  It includes funding for the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, to reduce waiting lists, and a primary care fund.  It includes expansion of services in the areas of mental health, disability and home care.  The balance is available to maintain the existing level of services taking into account demographics, central pay decisions and other increases in cost.  The costs of central pay decisions including national pay increases and the nursing agreement is &euro;278 million in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  To summarise, that is &euro;278 million for central pay decisions and just over &euro;200 million for new developments, out of an increase of &euro;646 million.  The exact quantum of services to be delivered in 2018 will be set out in detail in the 2018 national service plan currently being prepared by the Health Service Executive, which will be published before the end of the year.  It is, however, not just about funding, but also about reform.  I will come back to that in a moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500027#Z00900","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1510760400,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I was going to say, &quot;Blah, blah, blah&quot; but actually the Minister did give a bit more detail, in fairness, to back up his assertions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500027#Z01000","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1510760400,"counter":383,"content":"<p>The Minister is on a roll.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500027#Z01100","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1510760400,"counter":384,"content":"<p>There is a credibility problem, however, with what he is saying.

The report is a genuine effort by Deputies on all sides of the House to agree there is a need for increased resources, but it is how one spends them.  If one continues to do everything in the acute hospital setting, it will continue to cost more money.

This is the reality of the so-called increased allocations, as against the actuality of waiting lists getting longer and being told to go back to the start while suffering chronic pain.  The evidence on the ground, despite the game of statistics and so on, is that the situation gets worse because the allocations are not sufficient to meet increased demands.

That is why it must be about reforming the system.  It has to be about looking at what we are doing in the acute hospital setting that we could do in the primary care setting.  For example, recently, we had the primary care eye review.  Ophthalmologists working in the community pointed out they can do much of what their counterparts do in hospitals.  This would free up hospitals to do more complex and expensive procedures.  High-volume and often relatively low-level complexity cases can be dealt with in primary care.  That is why we need to do more of that.  We need to shift more and I will show that when we publish the 2018 service plan.<\/p>  <p>  We are making progress with waiting lists.

It is now well established that children exposed to valproate in the womb have an increased risk of congenital malformations and developmental disorders.  In 2014, the European Medicines Agency, EMA, conducted a review of valproate and issued advice placing additional restrictions on the use of valproate in women and girls.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2017, the EMA's pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee initiated a new review of the use of valproate in the treatment of women and girls who are pregnant or of child-bearing age.  It is expected this review will be concluded before the end of the year.  When it is, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, will communicate its outcome and recommendations to Irish patients, health care professionals and relevant stakeholders, including the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE national clinical programme for epilepsy is developing a draft protocol for the effective management of women with epilepsy.  It includes prescribing guidance and detailed advice on the management of clinical issues relating to epilepsy in pregnancy.  This guide will be for consideration and approval by the HSE before the end of 2017.  The national clinical programme for epilepsy will consider the outcome of the EMA review when finalising this protocol.<\/p>  <p>  Patients taking valproate-containing medicines are advised not to stop taking these medicines.  If they have any concerns about their specific drug treatment and management of their condition, they should discuss these with a health care professional.<\/p>  <p>  Health-related therapy supports and interventions for children can be accessed through both the HSE's primary care services and its disability services.

The National Ambulance Service has embarked on a strategic reform programme to reconfigure the management and delivery of pre-hospital emergency care services.  The programme aims to deliver a service that is safe, responsive and fit for purpose through the development of a modern, clinically driven and nationally co-ordinated system supported by technology and data.  <\/p>  <p>  The National Ambulance Service capacity review was published in 2016 and examined overall ambulance resource levels and distribution against demand and activity.  It made several recommendations to improve performance and indicated the only practical way to improve first response times in rural areas is through voluntary community first responders schemes.  It is interesting that the first external review of our ambulance service specifically discussed voluntary community first responders schemes.  There are 22 such groups linked to the National Ambulance Service operating across Wicklow and I thank them for all their work. <\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government commits to additional annual investment in ambulances, personnel and vehicles.  A total of &euro;7.2 million in additional funding was provided in 2016 and an additional sum of &euro;3.6 million was made available in 2017.  I am happy to confirm that increased funding will be made available for more ambulances and paramedics in 2018.  The national service plan is due to be published in the coming weeks and the detail of the increased funding will be set out therein.  I appreciate the need for additional ambulance resources in the parts of Wicklow the Deputy referenced.  That will be considered by the National Ambulance Service in the context of putting together its plan for 2018.  The Government is providing additional funding.<\/p>  <p>  In Wicklow town there are two emergency ambulances during the day from Monday to Sunday, two during the night on Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays and one during the night on Wednesday and Thursdays.  In Arklow there is one emergency ambulance during the day on Mondays and from Wednesday to Sunday and one during the night from Monday to Sunday.  In Baltinglass there is one emergency ambulance during the day from Tuesday to Sunday and one during the night from Monday to Sunday.

The Minister knows the geography of west Wicklow as well as I do.  The cover for that area is provided by ambulances in Tallaght and Naas.  However, the service in Tallaght is closed on the same day as that in west Wicklow and the area is, therefore, relying on Naas at those times.  If one lives in the centre of the county one might have to wait up to an hour or an hour and a half.

The National Ambulance Service capacity review found there was a need in the eastern region, which covers Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow, for additional emergency resources, primarily rapid response vehicles.  Therefore, I expect that following the implementation of the national capacity review, the ambulance service will act upon that in the context of the forthcoming service plan because it is important we have an evidence base for all we do and the National Ambulance Service capacity review is very clear on the need to plug deficits in the eastern region, which includes County Wicklow and west Wicklow.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is right to praise the community first responders groups.

It is not enough, and I would be the first to agree with the Deputy on that and to share his concern, but it is a significant development towards that journey in that period.  I am not being political or facetious about this, but one should consider the journey we have come through in those ten years and the crisis with which we had to contend as a nation, losing the financial means to do so many things.  Then we had mass emigration, unemployment and so on so we lost much of our talent pool.  To be at 80% is therefore not the worst case scenario.  I am not saying that defensively; I am just putting a little perspective on our position.  We are at almost 80% in CHO 1 with the CAMHS team.

People wonder what the point is in the public process that they are encouraged to engage in when it is a forgone conclusion.  The decision is pretty much made in the Custom House.  Utterly disheartened people have contacted me.  Some say they are contemplating moving because of the mess that will be made of the town and the total disregard for the views of the public from which there have been thousands of submissions.  People have questioned the point of electing councillors when the real power lies with the council CEO and the Custom House.  This is not a rogue group of councillors.  They have respected the process and listened and engaged with the public but that has counted for nothing.  Democracy is sullied.  The sheer scale and extent of the development now provided for, the location of some of the development and the absence of supporting infrastructure and services are matters that people have real concerns about.  It is a pattern that people have got used to.  It is not a planning system that avoids chaos but one that creates chaos and then responds to it.  People in Celbridge are not opposed to new housing - far from it - but it is not enough on its own.<\/p><p>The directions the Minister of State made relate to two locations.  The first is Donaghcumper, a location of significant historic importance adjacent to the internationally important Castletown House.  An expert study commissioned by Kildare County Council in 2006, carried out by UCD's school of architecture, landscape and civil engineering, stated:<\/p><blockquote>This study has clarified the extraordinary degree of design and planning evident in the composite design of three demesnes; those of Castletown, St. Wolstan's and Donaghcumper.  With their key spinal town of Celbridge they form a remarkable instance of the quality and vision of eighteenth-century landscape design.<\/blockquote><p>This is at the heart of Celbridge and is why it is a historic town.  Following thousands of submissions from the public, people who value their heritage, the council rezoned the land in Donaghcumper demesne as strategic open space.  The council CEO had proposed zoning for a town centre extension.  The Minister of State has overruled the councillors and instead says that the Donaghcumper site is centrally located and is the most appropriate location for town centre zoning for future commercial retail and other related facilities.  This site is small, at 6.5 ha.  It is not a gigantic site but it is important.<\/p><p>If it was not of historic importance, this would be fine.  There is a great irony in that the Minister of State's Department, on 22 July 2009, expressed concerns at the potential of a previously proposed development and how it might impact on the character and setting of Castletown House and its designed landscape and protected views.  I quote from the correspondence from the Department at the time, which states the issues of particular concern would be the potential adverse effects on the built heritage and their settings which would include Castletown House, Donaghcumper House, the built heritage of the area, the built heritage of the town, protected structures and recorded monuments.  There is history to this site.  Some of the lands were zoned as residential and for town centre extension.  Planning applications followed in 2001.  They were approved by the council but there was a lengthy oral hearing when there was an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500031#DD00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1510762800,"counter":430,"content":"<p>The Deputy will have a further two minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500031#DD00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1510762800,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I am just finishing.

I thank all our colleagues who engaged with me over the months about this site and this development plan, including many councillors who have engaged through the system.  I also thank the residents, many hundreds of whom have emailed me personally or taken time to make submissions to the process.  That is part of it.  Everyone's submission was listened to, as was the council.  I have visited the site and spent time in the area, as well as at Castletown House, to look at the views and see how this would affect the overall area.  I take this part of my job very seriously.<\/p>  <p>  I have a statutory function under the planning code whereby I monitor statutory plans to ensure that they are consistent with established national planning policies and comply with the relevant legislative requirements.  Where this does not happen, the power to issue section 31 directions provides a safeguarding mechanism and is only used in a limited number of cases, relative to some 300 statutory development plans and local area plans across the State.  In the case of Celbridge, I used those powers on Friday, 10 November 2017.  The simple fact of the matter is that Celbridge is a strategically located town within that fast growing cluster of towns including Maynooth and Leixlip, and is earmarked to grow by about 10,000 people over the next five to ten years.  We have to ask if we want Celbridge and towns like it just to be dormitory towns, full of commuters but with no commercial heart.  Celbridge has a very weak, some say declining, but historic town centre.  All I am trying to do is to uphold national policy in ensuring that the one small area it can grow into is not lost forever.  If I did not do my job and allowed local planning policies to make these kinds of decisions, in the future those local communities would regret the situation they would find themselves in having to provide the shops and services they need at the edges of their towns and, worse than that, maybe not in those towns at all but in neighbouring towns.  It will be important to get the balance right on the development of the centre of Celbridge.  We will need to respect its historic urban and landscape character.  I believe we would benefit from really well designed new housing right in the centre, to give new life to it and create new footfall for its struggling main street, the vitality of which should be the key focus.  I emphasise that this is also to support that main centre.  I have been on that street and many businesses there have seen a decline in business over the years because people cannot access it.  This plan would put some housing right beside it and I support that.<\/p>  <p>  There will also be a new public park and riverside amenity, which will be a major attractor for the town centre.  We need to get working on putting this into practice.  The land that was previously zoned a number of years ago has much less housing.  There is also a portion of land that has been handed over which was owned by the local authority since 2012, which can be developed as a top-class amenity and park and protect the character of the landscape and the house and lands there.  Great efforts have been made to do this right.  I have seen previous planning applications and footage of what could have happened and the scale that could have happened.  We are not allowing for that or envisaging that here at all.  I look forward to working with Kildare County Council and others to make this vision happen and deliver it properly.<\/p>  <p>  The site offers an ideal opportunity to revitalise and regenerate the core of Celbridge for new and existing residents alike and to integrate sensitively with the recognised assets of the River Liffey, Castletown demesne and the historic main street.  The alternative would be the creation of more poor quality, car-based shopping and commercial developments that occupy peripheral locations and undermine the distinctive character and attraction of an important town like Celbridge.  My Department is ready to work with Kildare County Council to ensure that those lands to the south of the main street at Donaghcumper are developed in a manner and at a pace that will protect the commercial vitality of the town centre, the heritage value of the adjacent Castletown demesne and will enable the creation of a new riverside public amenity as set out in the local area plan.<\/p>  <p>  I have read all the submissions myself.  We have engaged with the OPW, which owns the house in question, since everyone has been asking that.  This is a zoning matter.  It is not a matter of planning permission and anyone who wants to develop that has to bring forward plans that are sustainable, pass all the tests and that will address all the concerns of the residents in Celbridge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500031#DD00700","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1510763400,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that I have spoken to the Minister of State on several occasions about this matter.  Celbridge has some 6,500 houses at the moment.  There are an additional 3,500 houses proposed over the next six years.  This is a nearly 70% increase.  The site we are discussing today is a very small site at the centre that is historical and critical to the heritage of the town.  It is the reason Celbridge is a heritage town and I question whether the national planning framework is being undermined by some of what is being proposed.  Kildare, for example, has a population of 220,000 people with 80,000 extra people proposed over the next six years.  We are not talking about a minor increase.  Like the Minister of State's own county, Kildare is one of the areas that has done the heavy lifting in respect of residential development over the years.  People engage with this process in their thousands.  They do it every time.  They did it with planning applications in the past and they have engaged at every stage of this process.  They have the right to make their views known, but they do not feel that their views were listened to and they feel that their councillors were disrespected in the view they took.  This is not just any site; this is an historically important site with an 18th century designed landscaped that is a reference point for Castletown House, of which people are rightly very proud.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State spoke of commercial viability.  That door is well closed.  There is a huge 24-hour Tesco, a Lidl, an Aldi and a big SuperValu all located outside the town core.

We believe this is an opportunity to save the town centre and its core.  This is why this land, as a key piece of town centre land, was zoned many years ago for much more increased development.  That, however, is not what this is about.  This is about trying to develop a plan that can support the town, the people who live around the town and new housing on the site.  Other housing was proposed for the outskirts of the town, which we have moved.  We are not inflicting more houses in Celbridge with the overall number of units.  It is wrong to say that.  We are looking for a better balance and we are looking to develop the core centre of the town.<\/p>  <p> I have seen areas where, as the Deputy said, retail units are on the edge of the town.  That does not support the town centre.  We are quite happy now, and I will write to Kildare County Council on this matter, to try to work with the council on developing this site on a proper, phased basis that will work with the existing commercial town centre to get the balance right.  Some new custom will be developed for those businesses through the new housing right in the centre of the town where people want to live.  People do not always want to drive a car constantly.  They will have a choice, with the opportunity to live beside a town centre, and to avail of all the services including the fabulous lands around Castletown House and the new park that hopefully will be developed by Kildare County Council.  The council owns the land and I urge the council to bring the development forward in a very sensitive way.  There is an ideal opportunity to do this right.  I have read the submissions of the owners of the Castletown House and I wish everyone else would read them also.  We try to respond to all the needs here.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that many of the residents have raised concerns and I believe that we have managed to address those issues.  With regard to some of the issues they were concerned about, compared to some of the maps that show how bad it could have been years ago with previous owners, I believe this plan is appropriate and is right.  It is my job to do that.  The national planning guidelines are there not to be paid lip-service, but to be used and implemented where we believe it is right.  I engage with local councils often, and they generally do a great job when it comes to planning.  In some cases, they do not always get it right.  In this case, we believe it was not aligned with national policies and we had to intervene to make changes.  It is not a decision that is taken easily and that is the reason I spent a lot of time on this decision.  I went there on numerous occasions and I walked the lands to be absolutely sure we were doing the right thing.  I am happy to work with all parties to develop it, but I will be clear that this is a zoning application, not a planning application.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500032#EE00200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traveller Accommodation Provision","time":1510763400,"counter":435,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500032#EE00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1510763400,"counter":436,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is aware that two very important reports on the issue of Travellers and Traveller accommodation were published in the past four weeks.

For example, the Housing Agency study shows that at the end of 2016, only 39% of the targets contained in the 2014-18 Traveller accommodation programmes across the State have been achieved.  This is very below target, and is substantially below previous programmes.  From the report and from our own experience, we know there are real problems in accessing land and securing Part VIII planning permission in local authorities.  This is due to opposition from the political system, communities or others.<\/p>  <p>  My own research shows the startling number of councils that were not drawing down any of their Traveller accommodation programme funding in 2015 and 2016.  Other councils make up that shortfall by drawing down more than was originally allocated.  There are counties that are simply refusing to draw down funding that is available to them for programmes they have actually agreed themselves.  It is remarkable.  I do not have more recent figures but as of July 2017 only 9% of Government funding allocated for Traveller accommodation this year has been drawn down - &euro;800,000 of &euro;9 million.<\/p>  <p>  The Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes Traveller survey also produced some startling figures.  One in three Travellers was forced to move in recent times.  For those Travellers who are under 25 years of age, it is one in five people.  This is a significant level of forced displacement.  A total of 40% of people surveyed answered that they were no longer a Traveller in a nomadic way because they had, essentially, been stopped through legal or other mechanisms.<\/p>  <p>  There is an increasing and unhappy reliance on the private rental sector, which is very insecure and for Travellers it presents additional forms of discrimination.  The survey showed a clear desire for secure accommodation close to family networks and in a range of accommodation types to suit their needs.<\/p>  <p>  I raise these points with the Minister of State today because, on the back of this information, we have a real opportunity - I know he shares this view - to come together as political parties.  Over the next year or so, as a result of the work I am sure the Minister of State is about to outline in his initial response, we can start to design out of our housing, planning and local government system the structural barriers, and in some cases the structural discrimination, experienced by the Traveller community in accessing quality and culturally specific accommodation.  If that is the Government's intention, it will have our full support and we will put aside any party political differences or any constituency interests to ensure we do the right thing by this important section of our community.<\/p>  <p>  It is important not only to remove those barriers that clearly exist, and the studies I have outlined highlight this, but to deal also with some new challenges especially the population growth in the Traveller community, the changing nature of family formations and the need to give Travellers, as we try to do with for wider community, real choice in meeting their accommodation needs.  For those Traveller families that want it, this means secure, appropriate and Traveller specific accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500032#EE00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1510763400,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin for raising this issue today and for all the discussion we have had around this topic.  I know the commitment is genuine in trying to address the issue.  I am happy to have the opportunity to update the House on the Traveller accommodation programme, TAP, and to review the next steps.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, housing authorities have statutory responsibility for the assessment of the accommodation needs of Travellers and the preparation, adoption and implementation of multi-annual Traveller accommodation programmes in their areas.  My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.  I am also trying to ensure the funding is spent. <\/p>  <p>  A Programme for a Partnership Government commits to establishing a special working group to audit the current delivery and implementation of local authorities&rsquo; Traveller accommodation plans and to consult with stakeholders on key areas of concern.  This commitment was underpinned in Rebuilding Ireland, which provided for the commissioning by the Housing Agency, on behalf of the Department, of an expert, independent review of capital and current funding for Traveller specific accommodation for the period 2000 to date, having regard to the targets contained in the local authority TAPs and the actual units delivered, the current status of the accommodation funded and the funding provided for accommodation maintenance and other supports.<\/p>  <p>  Following a tender process, a research company was selected by the Housing Agency to conduct the review.  The researchers gathered and analysed all TAPs to date and related data from the Department and other sources.  Based on this analysis, a series of surveys, specifically tailored to each local authority, was created.  Following analysis of outcomes from this survey phase, a number of key stakeholders were identified for consultation.  In all, 11 Traveller representative groups and seven local authorities were engaged by the researchers to explore issues arising from the earlier phase of research in greater detail.<\/p><p>Where targets were not met, the review provided an analysis of the underlying reasons, in order to identify the particular challenges that need to be addressed to underpin future progress.<\/p> <p> The report was finalised and submitted to the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee, NTACC, for consideration at its meeting on 28 August 2017.  The NTACC is a statutorily-appointed committee comprising key stakeholders, including Traveller representative groups, to advise me on Traveller accommodation matters.  On foot of its consideration of the report, the NTACC collectively agreed to advise me to establish an expert group to examine and make recommendations on issues regarding Traveller accommodation policy, strategy and implementation.  This in keeping with the programme for partnership Government and, as such, I have agreed to proceed with the establishment of the group.  I have also agreed that a review of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 should be part of the work of the expert group.  The composition, terms of reference and methodology of the group are currently being formulated with a view to it being put in place as soon as possible.  I am happy to engage around that process.<\/p> <p> I am aware of the national Traveller survey prepared by the philanthropic organisation, the Community Foundation for Ireland, the work of which I am familiar with in many other cases.  The foundation does a great deal of good work and I am happy to engage with it on this also.  The survey was not commissioned by my Department and is independent of the Government.  However, my Department has taken note of the survey outcomes and, where appropriate, relevant elements of the survey will be taken into account by both my Department and the NTACC in its future Traveller accommodation policy and strategy work.  I hope to have an opportunity myself to engage with the authors of the report.<\/p> <p> To underline the Government's commitment to providing safe, Traveller-specific appropriate accommodation to members of the Traveller community, &euro;9 million was announced for the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation in 2017.  This was an increase from &euro;5.5 million in 2016.  A further &euro;4.22 million will also be paid to local authorities for specific accommodation-related supports under the current budget.  These include salaries for social workers employed by housing authorities to engage with Travellers and their accommodation needs, caretaker salaries and site maintenance.  Additional funding of &euro;3 million was announced in the budget for Traveller-specific accommodation projects and developments in 2018, bringing the annual allocation to &euro;12 million.<\/p> <p> We hope to continue to increase the funding for this area in the years ahead, which is why I welcome the commitment from Deputy &Oacute; Broin and his party to work with us to review the policy and make changes where necessary as well as to ensure that we achieve our targets.  I accept that we are going to set higher targets as we allocate more money.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin on that.  However, we have to be able to change the way this is delivered to ensure we get the results on the ground across all relevant local authorities.  None of us is completely happy that every local authority is playing its part here.  It will require all Members working on a cross-party basis to address this and solve the problem.  We have a duty to do that.  As we discussed earlier, the current element of the budget for this year will certainly be spent.  We expect before the end of the year that the full capital spend will be drawn down.  It is approximately 67 units out of 90, which means there is a bit of work to do.  We hope to get it all spent and fully expect that will happen in the months ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500032#EE00500","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510764000,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and acknowledge, again, the commitment we have given to work with the Government on this to ensure we get the right result.  I welcome the establishment of the expert group and look forward to the announcement the Minister will make following the receipt of correspondence from the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee.  I welcome also the consultation that will form part of the work of the expert group.  The membership of the group is crucial in terms of expertise, independence and adequate buy-in from the Traveller community and its advocacy organisations.  I know the Minister of State accepts that.  I would like to see the Oireachtas housing committee involved in some formal way.  We will discuss that at the committee and come back to the expert group and the Minister of State with some recommendations early in the new year.<\/p>  <p>  It is very important that all of this work is done within 12 months.  If the group is established before the end of the year and really starts to work next year, not only its report and recommendations but any potential legislative changes should be got through by the end of next year in order that everything is in place as the framework through which the new batch of city and county councillors elected in 2019 will be working.  That does not mean we do not have to look very hard at planning permission and the issue of Part 8 provision, in particular for those local authorities which have a long history of failing to adhere to their own obligations. We need to look at greater involvement in decision-making by the Traveller community because they sometimes feel consultation is more of a box-ticking exercise than a real form of decision-making.  We must also look at the overall level of funding and move back towards the 2008 level of &euro;40 million.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister of State's comments on the 2017 spend.  I suspect, however, that there will still be local authorities which have not spent any or very little of their allocations while others will have taken up the shortfall.  We must get into the business of naming and shaming those local authorities publicly, which is why I have requested the information.  Those who are doing a good job should be commended but those who repeatedly fail should be named and shamed so that the public knows who is responsible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500033#FF00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1510764000,"counter":440,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked me at the end of his initial contribution about giving the Traveller community full choice, which is something I agree with completely.  The Government is committed to enabling all households to access good quality housing appropriate to household circumstances in their communities of choice.  It is open to Travellers to opt for any form of State-supported accommodation.  Traveller accommodation needs are addressed to a significant extent through mechanisms other than Traveller-specific projects, for example general social housing or the private rental sector with supports such as the housing assistance payment.  I accept, however, that while that is allowed for, it does not always happen or is not always easy.  We need to improve that choice.  It is there but it does not always happen.  We need to work on that, which is something about which I also agree with the Deputy.  Like members of any community, people want to have a choice, which is what we are trying to achieve through our Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness across all the sectors.  People should feel they have a choice no matter what their record, their community, or their age, including people of older years.  They have different circumstances and different choices.  We all know that choice is very limited for many groups of people due to the pressures on the housing sector.  We want to improve on that as well.<\/p>  <p>  The recently completed review of the Traveller accommodation programme gives us the factual information and will be a key platform for the special expert group to progress its work effectively.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin that it is important to get the expert group right.  I will take on board any advice in that regard.  The process is there at the moment such that names will come back to us.  We can then tease through that to ensure we have all the expertise.  There is a desire to get this right and find ways to spend our money and increase resources to deliver choice for people effectively and in such a way as to secure value for money for the taxpayer.  Every local authority must play its part.  That is key.  I share that view with the Deputy.  I see no reason this cannot happen within 12 months.  It is a very long timeframe.  We should be able to do it sooner if we can.  That will be our target.  It would be ideal to have this report and be up and running as soon as we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500033#FF00300","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","time":1510764000,"counter":441,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500033#FF00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1510764000,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I raise this issue on foot of the grave disquiet earlier in the year when the \"Prime Time\" programme, \"Living on the List\" unearthed the fact that the information on which we depend to know about the varying degrees of lists, the number of people on them and for how long they are waiting is not always collated correctly, efficiently or accurately.  I have always said that we are especially good at waiting lists.  We have 685,000 people on some list or other in our health services.  This cohort is from one half of the population, as the other half has private health insurance.  In effect, it is 685,000 people out of approximately 2.3 million or 2.4 million people who depend on the public health system.  Clearly, there is a huge difficulty in dealing with patients on waiting lists in a timely, effective and clinically sound manner.  On top of that, we are not collating the information correctly.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of the \"Prime Time Investigates\" programme, the National Treatment Purchase Fund was requested to audit waiting lists and come up with recommendations.  The key findings of the audit were exceptional and extraordinary.  The hospitals audited did not comply with national protocols on date capture.  The audit team found evidence of a combination of non-compliance and inconsistent practices in how date captures were being recorded across all hospitals for outpatient, inpatient, day-case and planned procedure pathways.  In some cases, the audit team found evidence of long delays in wait-listing patients, as well as retrospective wait-listing of patients.  As a consequence, there were implications for overall waiting list management, including incomplete tracking of patient journeys and incorrect waiting times.  All of this resulted in inaccurate reporting of patient waiting times at local and national level.<\/p>  <p>  The audit team observed a number of patients across all hospitals who had been directly listed on an inpatient or day-case waiting lists.  The findings are extraordinary in view of the fact that we at least assumed the information we were getting in the D&aacute;il was always accurate as to the number of people on waiting lists and how long they were waiting.  It was also assumed that information as to when they were transferred from one consultant to another was accurate.  Interestingly, the audit team found evidence that direct listed patients were either referred to the listing consultant by another hospital consultant or community physician, for example a community ophthalmologist, or seen by the listing consultant in another hospital.  The audit team observed variation in the management of referrals to ophthalmology services, in particular for cataract surgery.<\/p><p>&quot;Some referrals from community ophthalmologists were accepted onto an inpatient and day case waiting list, by-passing the outpatient service, whilst other patients referred from community ophthalmologists were placed on an outpatient waiting list to be seen prior to listing for their surgery.&quot;  In that case it was wholly inaccurate:<\/p><blockquote>The Audit Team found evidence of significant variance in the 'date placed on waiting list' as a result of the length of time between receipt of referral and the clinical decision to 'direct' list patients for cardiology and ophthalmology. As a result, there were inconsistencies in how patient wait times were recorded.<\/blockquote><p>This is highlighting the problems.  We need to ensure that the recommendations of the audit and quality assurance report presented to the Minister at the end of September, and carried out on behalf of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, are implemented and that we can now depend on wholly accurate information when we raise these issues in the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500033#FF00500","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510764600,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I will be taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris.  The \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme in February highlighted the deeply moving personal stories of people waiting for treatment in public hospitals.  Following the programme the Minister was determined that the health service must learn from those patients' experiences.  Patients deserve timely, effective and safe treatment from a compassionate and caring health service.<\/p>  <p>  For these reasons, the Minister asked the NTPF to examine waiting list practices in the hospitals highlighted in the programme.  The NTPF has now reported to me on its findings and last week the Minister published the findings of the special audit.  The NTPF's report has a number of actions to be implemented by the individual hospitals and across the public hospital system as a whole, to drive better performance in how waiting lists are managed in our hospitals.  Arising from the audit, the HSE has taken immediate steps to put in place a plan at national level that will focus on driving system-wide implementation of performance and process improvement in waiting list management.<\/p>  <p>  As part of this plan, the HSE will assess, review and oversee implementation of performance and process improvement to address the special audit findings across all hospitals.  Addressing the special audit report's recommendations will also be a priority for the HSE for the remainder of the year and will form a core pillar of the waiting list action plans for 2018 as well as the HSE's national service plan.  In addition, the Minister has asked the NTPF to develop a plan to extend the special audit process in 2018 to other public acute hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's commitment to addressing waiting times is clear.  Funding of &euro;20 million was allocated to the NTPF in 2017 for waiting list measures and for three months in a row we have seen reductions in the total numbers of patients on the inpatient-day case waiting lists.  To continue this strong focus on waiting lists, &euro;55 million will be allocated to the NTPF in 2018 for waiting list measures and a further &euro;10 million will be made available to the HSE for waiting lists, including scoliosis and paediatric orthopaedics.<\/p>  <p>  Addressing waiting lists is, however, not only a question of funding.  Since the \"Living on a List\" programme, several initiatives have been under way to reform and improve how our health service manages hospital waiting lists.  These initiatives seek to drive sustainable, multifaceted and innovative approaches in waiting list management.  These include a range of initiatives including a study ongoing by the NTPF working with Trinity College to examine international best practice in how waiting list information is collected and reported, and progressing towards more integrated approaches in waiting list management at hospital group level as part of the feasibility study recently carried on by the NTPF.  In addition, the HSE is undertaking a national waiting list validation project run by the HSE, to improve the quality of our waiting lists and get an up to date picture of how many patients are actually waiting for care so that the hospitals can plan better and manage waiting lists more efficiently.  Initiatives are also ongoing to develop capability in our hospital system in waiting list management best practice and to utilise technology to best effect to support more responsive, effective and efficient waiting list management.  The Minister is committed to the idea that the health service learns from the NTPF special audit and the experiences of the patients concerned in order to improve services for all patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500034#GG00200","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1510764600,"counter":445,"content":"<p>The key recommendations are the important points in this report.  Having unearthed what it did we need to address that.  The heading \"Date captures along the patient journey\" is critically important.  Under \"Direct referral\/direct listing of patients onto an inpatient and day case waiting list\" it states: \"The current pathways for managing patients who are 'direct' listed either as a result of a 'direct' referral from another hospital consultant, community physician or having been seen by the 'listing' consultant elsewhere should be reviewed by all hospitals.\"  That must be carried out immediately.  As a Deputy the Minister of State knows that when clinicians write \"urgent\" on a list it is meaningless.  I know of people being marked \"urgent\" for a hip or knee replacement who have to drag themselves around their kitchens and put rails in their houses so they can move around them.  There have been amazing instances of people being referred as \"urgent\" by their physician or their general practitioner which the system parks on a waiting list like any other.  We are debasing the word \"urgent\".  More important, we are debasing the patients who need this urgent treatment or diagnosis.  \"Clinical Prioritisation\" is recommendation No. 3: \"All hospitals should review their systems tracking capability to ensure that revisions to clinical priority are clearly documented and are visible from a waiting list management perspective.\"  That is a fundamentally important recommendation in this report, that they be clearly visible so the system will highlight clinical priorities which are deemed urgent, and that clinically urgent requirements do not get lost in a black hole.

Parkinson's is a progressive neurological disorder caused by the shortage of the chemical dopamine in the brain.  The diagnosis of a serious movement disorder can be very challenging.  It presents those affected with numerous emotions and obstacles and a combination of solutions are required, including care, support and information.  The management of common chronic diseases, such as Parkinson's, is now one of the most significant challenges our health care system faces.  It requires us to find ways of providing health care services to help patients and their families.<\/p><p>I hope that events such as this help to highlight the need for funding and services to be provided so that the patients can be partners in the management of their condition and cope better with it.  We know of almost 12,000 patients in the country, and approximately 600 of these are in Kerry.  In 2016, Dr. Richard Walsh, a consultant neurologist in Tallaght hospital, published a landmark Irish study on Parkinson's disease in partnership with the Parkinson's Association of Ireland.  The study showed that the number of people living with the disease in Ireland is predicted to double over the next 20 years but treatment in Ireland is shamefully well below international standards.<\/p> <p> Older people are some of the most vulnerable people in our society.  We have a large population moving into advancing years and living longer, which would give rise to a surge in Parkinson's diagnoses over the next 20 to 30 years.  It is critical that those of us in public life do our utmost to address the deficit in services for those with Parkinson's.<\/p> <p> A significant issue facing those with Parkinson's disease is the number of Parkinson's nurse specialists in Ireland.  We have five but the recommended number is between 27 and 30.  I remind the Minister of State that three of those nurse specialists are in Dublin and the other two are for the remainder of the country.  I ask the Minister of State to provide nursing specialists distributed fairly throughout the country.  We should have two in Kerry but we are well entitled to have one.<\/p> <p> Another issue is to secure an all Ireland deep brain stimulation service.  Deep brain stimulation is a device-aided therapy involving an implant into the brain.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health reviewed this and recommended a link with Northern Ireland to provide the surgery, with the Mater hospital in Dublin providing aftercare.

It is estimated that 700,000 persons in Ireland are affected by neurological disease, 6,000 of whom have been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.<\/p>  <p>  Working in collaboration with consultants, nurses, health and social care professionals, patient support groups, patients and carers, the national clinical programme for neurology has developed a model of care to address the need for the strategic development of neurology services.  The model of care, which was published in 2016, details a number of care pathways, one of which is the pathway for patients with Parkinson's disease.<\/p>  <p>  The patient pathway for Parkinson's outlines that the nature and severity of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and the rate at which it progresses will be individual.  Symptoms may take years to progress to a point where they cause major problems.  Drugs are the main treatment to help control the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.  These treatments are most effective when supported by access to multidisciplinary input from health and social care professions.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to nursing, the patient pathway also sets out the role of the clinical nurse specialist in the management of patients with Parkinson's disease.  This includes assessing the person with Parkinson's disease and identifying their needs, developing care plans and monitoring symptoms as well as providing lifestyle support.  As with all service developments, the implementation of the neurology model of care, including the Parkinson's patient pathway, will be addressed in the context of competing priorities for the limited service development funding.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive funds a range of community services and supports to enable each individual with a disability, including persons with Parkinson's disease, to achieve their full potential and maximise independence, including living as independently as possible.  Services are provided in a variety of community and residential settings in partnership with service users, their families and carers and a range of statutory, non-statutory, voluntary and community groups.  Services are provided either directly by the HSE or through a range of voluntary service providers.  The range of services provided includes assisted living services such as personal assistant and home support services.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to protecting the level of personal assistant and home support services available to people with disabilities.  In 2017, the HSE's priority is to provide 1.4 million hours of personal assistance to more than 2,000 people with disabilities, which is an increase of 100,000 hours over the 2016 target.  In 2017, the HSE will also provide 2.75 million hours of home support to adults and children with disabilities, an increase of 150,000 hours over the 2016 target.<\/p>  <p>  Therapy services for adults and children are generally delivered through primary care teams or community therapy services through specialist disability providers.  People with disabilities may also be eligible for medical or surgical aids and assistive devices that facilitate and maintain mobility and functional independence.  People with Parkinson's disease can benefit from therapeutic assistance, including physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy as well as a range of medical interventions.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that we are aware of the challenges facing people with Parkinson's disease and the Department of Health continues to work with the HSE to ensure the delivery of services to meet the needs of these patients.

There is a commitment in the programme for Government to publish an implementation plan, but investment will be critical and we need investment in this area.

Its president is Grace McCrae, and Connie Dillon and Brenda Edmonds are also involved.  Dr. Helena Moore, a neurologist in Tralee, does tremendous work for all of the Kerry patients who come to her.<\/p>  <p>  This is a serious problem.  These are people in trouble.  It is not a reversible disease.  Once someone presents with it, it progresses and get worse and worse day by day.  I ask the Minister of State please to take this to the Government and work to ensure we get fair play for people who present with this disorder.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500035#HH00300","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1510765200,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

No child should have to sleep on the streets.  No child should be sent to a Garda station in the middle of the night for want of a place to go.  No child should spend months on end with only a hotel room, shared with the rest of his or her family, to call home.  The referendum to put children's rights into the Constitution was passed five years ago.  It has to mean something to the most vulnerable children.  According to the latest figures, there are 3,124 children in homeless services.  Each one of them is vulnerable.  When a child's family finds itself homeless, there should be a recognition of the particular needs of that child and the housing authorities should have a duty to respond to those needs.<\/p><p>This simple Bill is designed to have a wide application.  When 12 families, with 30 children among them, presented as homeless in Dublin one night last summer, they were sent to a Garda station.  It was reported that at least one of those families slept in a park.  This led to Focus Ireland rightly calling for protection from such an outcome.  Its director of advocacy, Mike Allen, said at the time &quot;there must be a clear statutory responsibility that no family sleeps rough&quot;.  We drafted this Bill in response to that incident.  Having introduced it on First Stage in the D&aacute;il last summer, we are now using the Labour Party's Private Members' time to debate it on Second Stage.  I welcome the indications of support that have been received from other parties and Members.  There has previously been cross-party support on other aspects of the housing and homelessness crisis.  In light of the serious and complex nature of this issue, the best service we can give the people caught up in this crisis is to work together to bring solutions.<\/p><p>The purpose of this Bill is to oblige housing authorities to recognise a homeless family as a family unit and to have specific regard to the best interests of the children of homeless families in crisis accommodation situations.  The Housing Acts currently refer to a person as homeless if there is no accommodation available which the person &quot;together with any other person who normally resides with him or who might reasonably be expected to reside with him&quot; can reasonably be expected to occupy.  While a homeless person is entitled to apply to a housing authority for accommodation or other assistance, there is no explicit recognition in our current legislative scheme of the &quot;other person&quot; mentioned in the Housing Acts as a person in his or her own right with entitlements under law.  Specifically, there is no statutory recognition of the needs of a homeless family as a family unit.  Despite the passing of the constitutional amendment on children's rights, there is no statutory underpinning of the constitutional rights of homeless children.<\/p><p>Our intention is that requiring housing authorities to consider specifically the needs of families will affect how they make decisions in a broader range of circumstances.  A child who is living in a hotel room when he or she is learning to crawl and subsequently to walk is not having his or her needs as a child met.  A child who is living in a hotel room that is a long distance from his or her school and his or her friends is not having his or her needs as a child met.  Living in a hub does not allow a child to enjoy many of the normal freedoms needed by children.  It is intended that giving legislative force to the constitutional article on the rights of the child will have the effect of focusing the attention of the Government and the local authority sector on ensuring families spend the shortest possible time in inappropriate accommodation, including hotels and hubs.<\/p><p>Last Friday, I attended a seminar on family homelessness organised by Novas, which is a charity that works primarily in Limerick but also in other parts of the country.  At that seminar, Kate O'Loughlin gave evidence of her experience of living in a hotel with her four children and of going into labour with her fifth child while in the hotel.  She explained that she went into labour surrounded by her four other children while they stayed in emergency accommodation:<\/p><blockquote>So I was in the hotel room, in one double bed, pregnant, with all the kids, in the one bed, and I went into labour.  I'll never forget it.<\/blockquote><p>Thankfully, she was offered a home to bring baby Michael to after his birth.  Kate said it was like moving from darkness into sunshine.  One of the most traumatic experiences for the family was when Kate had to decide to send her daughter Ellie to live with friends because the hotel could only take three children.  I understand that this is the general position in hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation.  Kate described how Ellie was just eight years old when she want to live elsewhere:<\/p><blockquote>One day I looked over at Ellie and the tears were streaming down her face.  It was heartbreaking.  So I snuck her into the hotel room.  Myself and my daughter Ellie always had a great bond.  But then she just wasn't my Ellie anymore.  I felt like I was losing her.<\/blockquote><p>Getting a home brought the family back together.  Kate said:<\/p><blockquote>When we all sat down for our first cooked meal in the house, I could see the tears in Ellie's eyes.  She said, &quot;Mum, this is what I love - this is the best part of the day - we all get to sit down and have our dinner together&quot;.<\/blockquote><p>Many Deputies will have seen Kate and Ellie on RT&Eacute; news last Friday.  There are many other testimonies from families and those who work with them.  A Barnardos social worker who described the life of a two year old who was living in a hotel when she visited her at Christmas said that &quot;her entire world was the space between those two beds&quot;.  It is essential that these lived experiences of young children are not swept aside in the statistical analysis that represents so many human stories and damaged lives.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, all indications are that the situation is worsening and I refer to two reports published yesterday.  A report from <i>daft.ie<\/i>showed that rental prices are continuing to increase throughout the country while a report from the ESRI showed a continuing upward trend in the cost of homes.  Both reports predicted that homelessness will increase rather than decrease, which is a stark prospect.  I agree with those who say that increasing supply is crucial to reversing this unacceptable trend.  We need more social homes that are provided through local authorities and voluntary housing bodies.  We need more private homes that are affordable.  We cannot allow the market to ramp up when it suits and when profits are high.  Last year, the Labour Party introduced legislation that proposed a number of measures, including the implementation of the Kenny report to deter land hoarding at a time when house construction is needed.<\/p><p>We need to see a lot more urgency about getting some of this country's more than 180,000 empty homes back into use.  The Minister might confirm the indications from yesterday's Cabinet meeting that the Department of Finance is to be asked to produce a report on the feasibility of a vacant homes tax.  I understand the Minister has also spoken about this prospect.  While such a measure would be a start, a report will not cut the mustard.  It is long past time we had a strategy for using empty properties.  One of the few examples of successful programmes to revive empty homes is the local authority voids scheme, which we started in 2013.  This scheme has restored over 5,000 council houses and apartments that are now lived in.  There is a great deal of potential in empty homes that are in private ownership.  Many Deputies have spoken in this House about the urgent need to deal with this issue.  I have often referred to the Peter McVerry Trust's call for vacant homes officers to be deployed to ascertain proactively which houses are empty in each local authority area, who owns them and what can be done to bring them back into use.  We know this has worked well in Britain.  It is urgently needed here.  As Niamh Randall of the Simon Communities has said, this is the low-hanging fruit.  It is much quicker to restore a house that already exists, even if it needs some work to be done to it, than to build a house from scratch.  We need this low-hanging fruit to be brought back into use.<\/p><p>Another tentative move by the Government, which does not yet have much flesh on its bones, is the announcement in the Budget Statement that a redesigned role for NAMA is being examined.  Last year, the Labour Party proposed that NAMA should be refocused and merged with the Housing Finance Agency to address the serious shortage of supply of residential accommodation.<\/p><p>Its expertise, experience and resources should be put to use in this time of crisis given that the previous crisis for which it was established has been confronted.<\/p> <p> Leadership is required in respect of the current crisis.  It is not sufficient- and it is clear what is required is not being delivered quickly enough - to tell local authorities to ramp up construction.  Local authorities have nearly 700 sites suitable for housing between them.  There are approximately 30 or 40 more owned by other public bodies that are suitable for housing.  There is funding for the infrastructure such as the fund that has been set up but there is no blueprint and each council literally has to reinvent the wheel.  It must design a scheme for each one of those sites, send it to the Department and get approval.  As with all matters of this kind, things will go backwards and forwards but local authorities do not have an affordable housing scheme.  My party leader, Deputy Howlin, raised this issue this morning during Questions on Promised Legislation.<\/p> <p> We need a national affordable housing scheme as a matter of urgency in order to have the thousands of sites these sites can accommodate built.  Social housing, affordable housing and accommodation for affordable leasing and the kind of mixed tenure accommodation to which the Government has said it is committed can be built on these sites.  To date, however, delivery has been really slow because we do not have an affordable housing scheme.  We have not had a blueprint into which each local authority can simply link rather than having to invent its own scheme for every single site in its possession.<\/p> <p> Rapid build has a lot more potential to deliver quickly.  Last year, there were targets in Rebuilding Ireland that, of course, were not met but rapid build was set out as an opportunity to build houses quickly.  However, it certainly has not delivered that.  Many of us have been impressed with the &Oacute; Cualann model of co-operative housing.  &Oacute; Cualann entered into a relationship with the local authority where it got the sites for &euro;1,000, an arrangement with regard to infrastructure and buy in from people who were going to live in the houses.  It was able to provide very affordable homes in the Dublin area.  We know this can be extended to other parts of Dublin and other local authority areas.  Everybody has been very positive about that model as a way of delivering affordable housing.  Again, we need to see that moved forward.  We are not short of ideas.  What we are short of is action.<\/p> <p> I will briefly describe the provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 amends the Housing Act 1988 by inserting a new section 10A after section 10.  The new section is headed \"Homeless persons and children\" and applies where a request for accommodation or other assistance is made to a housing authority by or on behalf of a homeless person and another person who normally resides or who might reasonably be expected to reside, with the homeless person is a child.  In such a case, the housing authority must, when making a decision relating to the request - including one about the provision of interim or urgent assistance - recognise the persons concerned as a family unit and must regard the best interests of the child as a paramount consideration.  The housing authority must also have particular regard to the need by practical means to protect and assist families, including by providing them with safe accommodation, in order to support and encourage the effective functioning of families and the development, welfare and protection of children within a family home.  Section 2 provides, in standard form, for the short title and collective citation and construction of the Bill.<\/p> <p> We accept that the Bill is only one of the many actions that are needed in this area.  It will, however, give some protection to the most vulnerable victims of the housing shortage and I hope it will get the full support of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500037#NN00200","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510766700,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill from Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and the Labour Party and confirm that it is Fianna F&aacute;il's intention to support it and to impress upon the Government the need to address this matter within the existing Housing Act.  The reference to the State's intention to house applicants - the primary applicant and those who normally reside with him or her - is something that needs to be amended and we accept the need to do so.  We are also conscious of recent motions of a similar nature that came before the House and referred to the European Social Charter and housing.  The Government gave a commitment, not only on foot of a motion that was then before the House but also in its programme for Government, that those items be brought before the relevant committees with a view to advancing that issue.  The purpose of this commitment is to ensure that, in the context of the various mentions within our Constitution of housing and, in particular, to the family and children, the State is unified in its approach so that there might be no contradiction within the Constitution regarding these matters.  The 1916 Proclamation and the later Declaration of Independence refer to civil liberties and equal rights for all and to cherishing our children.  Unfortunately, that is not borne out in the figures for homelessness, particularly the 3,000 children not to mention the other 5,000 people in emergency accommodation who find themselves in this terrible predicament.<\/p>  <p>  There have been many debates here since this D&aacute;il was formed.  The Government's first task was the establishment of an all-party committee on housing to make recommendations to the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, regarding his efforts to bring forward a document, having consulted various stakeholders, that was reflective of this.  As was often said, it was a very worthwhile process.  There was good engagement with the relevant sectors, stakeholders and ourselves and recommendations emanated from our committee, many of which were taken on board and many of which were not.  It is the right and duty of Government to do as it wishes in that regard.  There was a period of reflection, the process had a chance to bed down and there was an opportunity for that policy to become a reality and for action to reflect the rhetoric spoken at the time.  Members on all sides of the House always said that it was about implementation and the Minister driving the Department, the Department driving local authorities and local authorities being beholden to the representatives in an effort to address this issue.  I was not unique in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the figures have consistently got worse so it is our duty to bring forward proposals and offer solutions and initiatives.  It is the duty of Government to recognise its failure, not to seek to give the impression, as was the case in recent days, that the figures, as stark as they are, are somehow normal.  They cannot and should not be construed as normal.  They should only serve as a means to redouble our efforts to ensure that the commitment which has been given on many occasions is honoured, that schemes relating to affordability or rapid-build units are honoured, that commitments relating to this process yield results and that people are held to account.<\/p>  <p>  We are at the coalface in respect of this matter by virtue of the constituency clinics we hold on a regular basis and the large numbers of representations we receive from people who find themselves in terrible and unfortunate predicaments.  I refer to those individuals who are living in rented private accommodation, those who are in receipt of HAP from the State, those who are languishing in the homes of their families or friends, those who are couch surfing, etc.  The Government has tried to give the general population the impression that this is somehow normal when one compares and contrasts matters as per an OECD report, on the first page of which it is stated that it should not to be used for the purpose of comparing the situation in different countries because many of the methodologies used to gather the data in the various countries are different.  It might be a report compiled this year but if we look at the material relating to Ireland, we can see that the 2015 figures are used and that the report does not take account of many circumstances in which people who are homeless or who are seeking help and assistance from the State find themselves.  It belittles those who spoke in favour of that being normal.  When one hears Fr. Peter McVerry or Brother Kevin Crowley on the radio earlier today expressing the frustration and anger they feel, it only serves to remind us that we need a much more inclusive approach and an understanding and recognition of failings in this area.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach spoke at his party's conference the weekend before last about his and his party's ability to be inclusive and work with other parties to ensure they achieve results.  In the same week he gave that speech, the House suggested a way to deal with the lack of inspection of private accommodation by local authorities following the overcrowding issue highlighted on \"Prime Time\".  The majority of the House supported the introduction of a new mechanism, such as an NCT-style system in which local authorities would be funded to vet properties for health and safety issues, fire safety and adherence to planning and building regulations.  The Government did not agree with that.  The Taoiseach should practice what he preaches and take on board the suggestions coming from the majority of the House.  He would then be in a position to tell the electorate the Government has been as inclusive as one would expect it to be considering the convoluted composition of the D&aacute;il and that it acts in accordance with an agreement between the two major parties to pursue various objectives in our economy and society and that results emanate from that.  To date we have not seen that.  I am only taking five minutes of the time allocated to my party so I do not have enough time to go through all I have proposed since the D&aacute;il came into being or more recently.   <\/p> <p> I was led to believe that &euro;245 million was spent on social housing by local authorities up to 1 November 2017.  I need the Minister to tell me how many units it delivered.  If it was 1,000, as was indicated, it could not correlate to &euro;245,000 per unit.  We can compare it with the likes of the &Oacute; Cualann housing body in Ballymun which can get State land for &euro;1,000 a site and offer houses for sale at &euro;140,000 to &euro;200,000.  People ask me what is affordable by today's standards.  That is affordable by today's standards.  It is something that should be replicated throughout the country.  It is the best model and best use of State lands I have heard of to date.  Many local authorities have said they have embarked on a path of seeking expressions of interest with regard to how such land can contribute to dealing with the crisis.  That has gone on for 12 or 18 months and there has been no progress.  In Meath, for example, historically sites were bought at an exorbitant price.  When such a site is brought to the market with a view to providing social and affordable units, the unit cost has to be recouped.  In that instance we are starting at &euro;100,000 and that is replicated again throughout the country.  I cannot go into greater detail on this Stage of the Bill.  However, I support the content of the Bill and the good faith behind it.  I hope all parties and none can come together to ensure the Housing Act to which the Bill refers will reflect the needs of children and families, which are of various natures these days, and that local authorities are given the authority to prioritise that in housing.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500038#OO00200","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510767300,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Jan O'Sullivan for introducing the Bill.  The Deputy is a colleague on the children's committee, where her voice is heard at all times representing the voice of the child.  That is what the Bill is about - the voice of the child and laws that govern matters concerning children.  The voice of the child is not considered by local authorities.  The Ombudsman for Children has said that under Irish law, there is no specific law providing for the voice of the child to be heard.  The person making the application has such a right but it does not cover the rights of the child.  Article 27 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC, provides for the right to food, clothing and a safe space.  That means a child must have a roof over his or her head.  A child's world should not revolve around two beds.  When one is a mother of kids and rears a family, one understands the value of having a roof over one's head.  We also have to acknowledge the right of children to be educated with their friends, to be able to travel to school in a community and to grow up in a community.  It is incumbent on the councils to look after people who present to them.  It is incumbent on them, when people present as homeless, not to tell them they have a good family and can place children with different family members while remaining on the housing list.  That is not correct.  At all times we must ensure the voice of the child is heard.  We had a referendum to enshrine the rights of the child into the Constitution but we are neglecting it.  When parents or guardians present as homeless, the voice and rights of children should be considered.  Does the child have a disability and does that come into consideration?  Are they part of a team or a club?  That voice needs to be heard.  Those receiving people as they present to the various county councils throughout the country must recognise it is not only the parents or guardians who are presenting but a whole family unit.  We have to recognise the value of that family unit.  That is what the Bill is about.  It is about acknowledging the value of the family and the child.

I commend Deputy Jan O'Sullivan on bringing it forward.  We have to be mindful of families when we speak about homelessness.  It is a difficult situation for anyone to be homeless but particularly for families with young children, especially children with special needs.  Sometimes they are left outside of the discussion which is particularly sad.  It is particularly sensitive for everyone involved in that situation.  They need to be given priority to assist them in having delivered some type of social housing or supports through whatever mechanism is possible.  We must go back to the root cause of the issue that brings us here this evening.  There are a number of different categories which we have all spoken about and which affect families, particularly those with young children and children with special needs.  Lack of supply is a massive issue at the moment.  We have to double our efforts to ensure we make greater attempts to bring supply into the market.  Supply affects everything.  We have engaged with the Minister on this issue on numerous occasions.  It is a massive problem on which we need to double our efforts.<\/p>  <p>  Evictions are another issue.  Some of the families we are talking about here this evening have children with special needs while others do not but it does not matter, as we are concerned with the family unit.  Families have been evicted by the banks as a result of mortgage arrears.  It is a massive problem.  We have brought forward a number of Bills to try to deal with that issue and to prevent homelessness.  The difficulty in accessing the private rental market is another problem because of the lack of supply.  Current market rents are very high and supports such as the HAP scheme are not adequate to deal with current levels of rent.  People cannot afford to pay the rent differential, which leads to homelessness.  It is a problem I have highlighted on a number of occasions here and we need a short-term solution to deal with it.  There are also families that meet the criteria to get on the housing list but get no support because they are marginally over the financial means threshold.  Those limits need to be reviewed because people are caught between two stools and are suffering.  Nobody is reaching out to them.  It is another issue for families.  My own local authority, Kildare County Council, which I deal with regularly, is doing its best under extremely difficult circumstances while being under-resourced.  It does not have the flexibility to give families priority in particular circumstances.  That is a problem that needs to be addressed.<\/p><p>Families with children are living with parents and other family members, which is causing all sorts of welfare and social problems.  We need to look at cases of families who have been on the housing list for a year.  One such case presented to me last week.  They have been on the housing list for a year and have a young child who is blind.  It is very sad.  They have been told it will be at least nine years before the local authority can deal with them as a family unit.  They were advised to find housing they can rent and were offered support through HAP.  However, they cannot get a unit because they need to access all the medical services and supports their child needs.  That is an issue.  If the local authority had a level of flexibility, it could consider prioritising housing that family given their child's needs.  I support this very timely Bill and I hope it gets the support of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500039#PP00300","speaker":"1324","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510767900,"counter":466,"content":"<p>Just over three minutes remain and we have three Deputies to speak, Deputies Murphy O'Mahony, Breathnach and O'Loughlin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500040#QQ00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1510767900,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Jan O'Sullivan for bringing the Bill before the House.

Homelessness and child homelessness will continue unless we offer a solution through improving housing supply.  A tiny 5% of all housing allocations across the country go towards homelessness.  To date this year, Louth County Council has housed 36 family units but in order to keep pace with those presenting we need initiatives in addition to housing supply.<\/p>  <p>  While I am an ardent advocate of all landlords partaking in the HAP scheme, the reality is that many landlords in the private rental sector are not co-operating with it.  Once again success has been achieved in Louth.  In this year alone an additional 48 families were placed in emergency accommodation through encouraging those reluctant HAP landlords and through more contact with letting agents.  My point is a proactive approach is needed by the homeless officers in the housing departments with letting agents.  When it is known that a family will have to vacate that property for the purpose of a sale, the local authority should be given the opportunity to discuss the purchase of such units.<\/p>  <p>  I have much more that I would like to say, but I will conclude.  Approved housing bodies employ approximately 6,500 staff.  If these were distributed among the local authorities, we could get back to building houses. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500040#QQ00400","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1510767900,"counter":469,"content":"<p>Before I call the Minister, I wish to make a point.

When I took up office, I made it clear that tackling issues of housing and homelessness would be a top priority for me and the Government.  As I have stated consistently in this House, one homeless individual or family is one too many.  A lot has been achieved in this regard in a short space of time but clearly, a lot more remains to be done.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the good intention behind Deputy O'Sullivan's Bill, intentions that I share and for that reason the Government is supporting her Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Homelessness is about people, not statistics.  Homelessness is about families and individuals in great difficulty and requiring great support.  I see that when I meet individuals and families who are experiencing homelessness.  They all have their own story and it is right that we help and support them.  While the existing system has proved successful in providing for the emergency accommodation needs of homeless families with children, we can always do more and we will.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Sullivan has presented a Bill that puts children at the centre of decision-making by a housing authority when a family including a child requests accommodation assistance.  The Bill requires the best interest of the child to be the paramount consideration, as does the Constitution, following an amendment that I am proud to say was put to the people by Fine Gael and Labour when in government.  Protecting the best interests of children is already at the centre of our approach to housing families requesting assistance for accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  It is why we ensure that any family presenting with children is housed safely overnight and why we seek to work with each family to address not just their accommodation needs but also their other support needs that may run alongside their immediate need for housing.<\/p>  <p>  This afternoon, I want to set out for the benefit of Members, exactly what happens where a family with a child presents to our services looking for accommodation assistance.  When I say our services, of course I am including Focus Ireland, the Simon Community and the Peter McVerry Trust, all of which are directed by the State to provide services to people in need of accommodation, in addition to the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and other local authority services.<\/p>  <p>  In most cases, our experience is that families at risk of homelessness will begin to engage with homeless services before their existing accommodation has become unavailable, whether that be days, weeks or months before they are actually homeless.  Where this can be done, it can help prevent homelessness because it allows the housing authority time to consider the various requirements of homeless families and to tailor supports and consider accommodation options.<\/p>  <p>  In many such cases homelessness can be prevented from occurring.  To date this year in the Dublin region, almost 600 households that engaged with the homeless executive at an early stage have avoided entering emergency accommodation and have secured a new private rented tenancy under the housing assistance payment scheme.<\/p>  <p>  State-funded prevention service is available through Threshold, which can provide support and advice to families at risk of homelessness and can examine for validity any notice to quit they might have received.  Furthermore the Dublin Region Homeless Executive's prevention officers will also work with the families presenting to consider if they are eligible for social housing and assist in the submission of an application if appropriate.  They will also engage with the landlord on the family's behalf on issues where advocacy can assist.<\/p>  <p>  However, often prevention is not possible and families will require immediate temporary accommodation.  As I have outlined, families requiring emergency accommodation will usually have already been in touch with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive prior to becoming homeless but even where they have not, we can still help them as I will now outline.  The executive's central placement service, which I visited recently, conducts face-to-face assessments with families on a daily basis until 4 p.m.  The executive's freefone helpline number operates from 2 p.m. to 1 a.m. Monday to Friday and 24 hours at the weekend.  Any family that has been previously in touch with the central placement service will have an existing reference number and consequently accommodation can be arranged for them via the freefone number if necessary.<\/p>  <p>  Where a family seeks out-of-hours homeless services for the first time, they will be referred to the Focus Ireland family homeless action team, which provides the contact point under a funded service level agreement with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.  The action team will consider the presenting family's immediate needs and will work with them to secure hotel accommodation for that night.  The next day, a more thorough assessment of the individual family's requirements will be conducted.  Following this assessment and information session, the family will be allocated a caseworker, who will work with the family throughout their homelessness episode with a view to ensuring that they avail of the available supports.  Occasionally it may not be possible to secure hotel accommodation for a family presenting late, particularly for larger families.  This can occur during peak season.  There are a number of contingency family units available in existing homeless facilities in such instances.<\/p>  <p>  Our focus is as follows: no child will fail to be accommodated.  The best interest of children is first and foremost a secure safe place to sleep and we will ensure this for any family who comes to us.  What happens next is just as important and I want to take the House through our supports for day two, day three and the days after that in providing the supports that families need.  We accommodate children and families in hotels as an alternative to them having nowhere to go.  However, let me be very clear that hotels are not a suitable or secure form of accommodation for families and especially for young children for anything other than a short period and as an emergency need.  I am absolutely committed to this objective.  I want to get to a point where no family presenting to a housing authority as homeless has to rely on hotel accommodation.<\/p><p>This is one of the key commitments contained in Rebuilding Ireland but in the interim we have to use this accommodation as an emergency first step.  I am pleased to say that the number of homeless families being so accommodated in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation in Dublin is falling; it is still too high but it is falling.  On the last day of September, a total of 690 homeless families were accommodated in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation.  That number is down from 871 such families recorded at the end of March.<\/p> <p> The number of families in emergency accommodation in the Dublin region reduced in both August and September, which is the first time in three years there has been a reduction in consecutive months.  We do not want families in hotels and, therefore, we are focused on providing more suitable transitional accommodation that is family friendly and has the services available to meet the development and welfare needs of a child, which a hotel clearly cannot.<\/p> <p> These family hubs are family-focused and are a better response than a hotel but they are still only a first response.  An amount of &euro;45 million in capital funding has been allocated for these family hubs.  There are now ten family hubs operational in the Dublin region and one in Limerick, providing temporary accommodation to approximately 300 families.  Works are progressing on the delivery of a further seven hub facilities which should become operational before the end of the year, providing temporary accommodation for a further 180 families.  Over the course of the coming two weeks I will open two new family hubs in Dublin alone.  A further five hubs are already scheduled for delivery in 2018 and they will cater for more than 230 additional families.<\/p> <p> These family focused facilities will offer family living arrangements with a greater level of stability than is possible in hotel accommodation, with the capacity to provide appropriate play space, cooking and laundry facilities, communal recreation space, while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured.  These arrangements facilitate more co-ordinated needs assessment and support planning, including on-site access to required services such as welfare, health, housing services and appropriate family supports.  However, this requires a whole of Government response.  Therefore, we have ensured that further additional family support services are being made available through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, such as a special provision under the existing community child care subvention programme of free child care for children from homeless families; Tusla&rsquo;s school completion programme is placing an emphasis on children from homeless families; schools with home school community liaison co-ordinators are proactively engaging with the parents from homeless families to assist access to any other supports that may be of assistance; and children in homeless accommodation are being prioritised within the school completion programme for services such as breakfast and homework clubs.<\/p> <p> This debate also requires that we acknowledge the significant activity that is, and has been, taking place to address issues of homelessness.  The long-term solution to the current homelessness challenge is to increase the supply of homes.  Accordingly, Rebuilding Ireland is designed to accelerate all types of housing supply; in particular, it seeks to increase the delivery of social housing by 50,000 additional homes over the period to 2021.  I could quote a number of other statistics but I know statistics can be cold comfort to people, be they individuals or families, who are facing this crisis in their personal lives.<\/p> <p> I thank the House for providing us with the opportunity to discuss this important issue.  We must always discuss it.  As Members of this House and people in public life, we must always keep this crisis in our focus because we know the very difficult circumstances that people are facing in these situations and we know our responsibilities to cater for those people, look after them and make sure we can help them through this crisis period into more secure, sustainable accommodation.<\/p> <p> I am aware of the values held by our society and the threat posed to these values by homelessness.  We are taking urgent action to tackle these issues.  That requires more than housing and buildings, we have to look at affordability and new schemes that will help people to secure their own accommodation for themselves.  That is why &euro;25 million was announced in the budget for a new affordability scheme.  To answer some of Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's questions, that is being developed as we speak.  It will be announced very shortly.  We have looked at the &Oacute; Cualann model, which we know is successful on a small scale.  We want to deliver that now at a greater scale and to secure those options for people who need our help.  Sometimes a small bit of help can go a very long way.<\/p> <p> With regard to the vacancy issue, we have established vacancy teams in each local authority in the country.  We have an empty homes unit in the Department since July of this year.  We have figures coming in from each local authority in the urban areas as to what vacancy potential they think is there.  We know it is low-hanging fruit.  By the end of the year I will have those figures from other local authorities around the country.<\/p> <p> In the budget announced for 2018, a new incentive scheme for bringing vacancy out of the private stock into private use was announced.  We also will be announcing changes to the repair and leave scheme to help bring vacancy into use for social housing purposes.  A report from the Department of Finance will be commissioned to examine the potential of introducing a vacancy tax to see how that could also work as a stick to try to get more vacant stock back into use.<\/p> <p> We recognise the problem of overcrowding, and Deputy Cowen referred to this.  We are not rejecting the fact that we need to do more in this area.  We have already announced ring-fenced funding for increased inspections next year.  It is not that we do not think that an NCT-style system for private rental accommodation might not be an option worth pursuing.  We believe that the option that is already being pursued by the Government might be a better, quicker and more powerful way of putting sanctions on rogue landlords - to call them landlords is a mistake - who seek to abuse people's human rights for their own personal profit.  It is correct to say that we are not short of ideas but we are not short of action either.  If we look at some of the figures, they will show there are improvements in many areas when it comes to the Rebuilding Ireland programme and other aspects of the challenge that we face, but other figures show that there have not been improvements and that matters have got worse.  We must recognise that.  We can learn from what others are doing but we can also learn the mistakes we have made ourselves on previous policy interventions that have not been successful.<\/p> <p> I will continue to drive our actions on behalf of the State, the taxpayer and every citizen and implement them with compassion because compassion and care is what is needed.  Homelessness is not normal.  We must never, nor will we ever, treat a homeless individual or homeless family as being normal.  We must always ensure that our interventions and supports that are put in place to help people in these very difficult times of crisis are put in place in a way that assures those individuals and families, and every other citizen in this State because we all have a stake in this, that we are meeting the housing and accommodation needs of our families and children.  We are doing that to provide dignity for everyone to help them in this time of crisis and to make sure that their welfare and care is always paramount in the work we do with the voluntary sector and the local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500040#QQ00700","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510768500,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Jan O'Sullivan for tabling this valuable legislation for our consideration.  I am happy to hear it will be supported by the Government.  This is not just a theoretical piece of legislation, it will have a real, practical impact.  The Deputy outlined some of the families she has dealt with in her constituency and elsewhere who have been affected by the lack of protection, the addressing of which this legislation will now provide.<\/p>  <p>  We all have experience of dealing with families who have presented as homeless seeking emergency accommodation who have been split up either, as the Deputy outlined, where children are left with extended family members or the two partners are split up and sent to opposite sides of the city with children split up, sometimes for lengthy periods of time.  That idea that the law would recognise the family unit is quite important in tackling that particular problem.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister's description of what happens when a family presents as homeless is not the experience that many families on a daily basis live through.  That is not to say this is not way it should be or is not the way it is for many families, but many people are coming to us telling us that their experience is different.  It is important that the Minister hears that and acknowledges it.<\/p>  <p>  There are many families who present and are told when they present that there is no emergency accommodation, and that is when they present early in the day and often day after day for several weeks on end.  They are given a list of hotels and told to self-accommodate.  To add to the stress of, for example, reaching a notice to quit date, they have to then ring a long list of hotels, day after day, to try to find emergency accommodation.  If they have nowhere to go that night, they have to ring the freefone number.  As the Minister is aware, on any given night, the freefone service might not be able to provide emergency accommodation, or the family might be genuinely fearful of the type of emergency accommodation they might end up with, late on a night, particularly in this city.  The in-take service will also advise that, on occasions, they have placed families in emergency accommodation and then the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive or the local authority after several days has instructed the in-take team to cease the payment for that family and they are then back out of the hotel.<\/p>  <p>  There is a problem for some of these families - I am not saying it is for all or for the majority of them - which needs to be addressed.  There is also a case of increasing numbers of young families who have lost private rental accommodation, have then gone into extended family accommodation where stress and strains force them out of that, and when they present to the emergency accommodation section of the local authorities they are simply sent away and not even given the options that I have just outlined.  There is an increasing trend of people coming from the extended family overcrowded stressful situation who have been turned away.  That is also creating a problem.<\/p>  <p>  It is very timely that we are having this general discussion on homelessness because it has been a very bad number of days for the public debate on homelessness, particularly from the point of view of the Government and State agencies.  The comments of the chair of the Housing Agency and the director of the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive are deeply unfortunate and have caused a real level of hurt among people in emergency accommodation and people who have experienced homelessness, and we heard some of that today, but, more worryingly, the idea that, for example, homelessness will always be with us or that homelessness is the result of bad behaviour displays a set of values which I thought were long gone from our understanding of homelessness and homeless services.<\/p><p>This betrays a Victorian attitude that somebody's being homeless is a result of their own decisions, bad lifestyle choices or character, as opposed to the result of a housing system that is designed in a particular way and cannot meet the needs of various groups of people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500041#RR00200","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510769100,"counter":475,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500042#SS00200","speaker":"1299"},{"type":"speech","time":1510769100,"counter":476,"content":"<p>For me, though, the most disturbing comments were those made by the Taoiseach at the weekend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500042#SS00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1510769100,"counter":477,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500042#SS00400","speaker":"1299"},{"type":"speech","time":1510769100,"counter":478,"content":"<p>In response to questions he said: \"By international standards, compared with our peers, we have a low level of homelessness.

There is not a shred of evidence in this report that allows the Taoiseach to make that claim.  It does not allow anybody to say that our level of homelessness is high or low.  On that basis, the Taoiseach should withdraw his comments.  It is not acceptable for the Taoiseach of the country to deliberately, which is what he is doing in my view, downplay the level of homelessness or to present the picture as something other than what it is.

This entitled Taoiseach has a feckless and dilettante attitude to the most vulnerable in society.  He is starting to believe his own propaganda and wants us to believe it too.  If we are prepared to be taken in by this spin, then the homeless crisis really is not a crisis - \"it is not as bad as it looks, lads\".  It is more important to the Government that we massage the figures and sweep the shame that is the homelessness crisis under the carpet.  It wants to present to the world a different image, one that ignores the realities of everyday life in Ireland and has no place for those left behind during the years of austerity.  It is an image that is as false and fake as the Government's effort to end this homelessness crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Fr. Peter McVerry is not talking down this country when he speaks of the homelessness crisis.  Neither I nor anyone else who works with the homeless, and sees the effects of homelessness on families, individuals and the community each day, intends to talk down the country.  If that is what the Minister genuinely thinks is happening, he should do something about ending this crisis.  He should allocate the resources required to end homelessness and divert them away from pet projects that benefit the few, usually the comfortable or well off.  It can be as simple as that.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Taoiseach step over the rough sleepers on their way to their respective offices from D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, as they pass the memorials to those homeless who have died a stone's throw from this Chamber, and as Christmas fast approaches, they should know that this is beyond urgent.  Something needs to be done about these problems and it is an emergency issue.  The Government should put its efforts into ending this crisis and stop trying to silence people.  The real problem is the homelessness crisis, not the coverage of it.  Hopefully this Bill will help correct an anomaly by recognising the family as a unit and will consolidate and protect the rights of children within the family unit who have unfortunately found themselves homeless.

That Molesworth Street building is the home of 593 companies which leads me to think we are looking at a vulture fund-style operation here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500042#SS01000","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1510769100,"counter":484,"content":"<p>That is all very well and it is very important, but we are talking about a Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500042#SS01100","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1510769100,"counter":485,"content":"<p>On the issue of the Bill-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500042#SS01200","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1510769100,"counter":486,"content":"<p>Everybody who has spoken so far has spoken on the wider issue of housing and homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500042#SS01300","speaker":"1348"},{"type":"speech","time":1510769100,"counter":487,"content":"<p>That is true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500042#SS01400","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1510769100,"counter":488,"content":"<p>We will be coming to Deputy Healy in a minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500042#SS01500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1510769100,"counter":489,"content":"<p>I believe that people and families who have notices to quit hanging over them should be included in the homelessness figures.  In this apartment block, we have young families with children who go to school in the vicinity.  One family I spoke to pays &euro;700 per month in rent.  They have gone out to look for alternative accommodation.  The prices being asked are from &euro;1,000 up to &euro;1,300.  There are queues going out the door at those properties.<\/p><p>Homelessness is a real threat for these families.  We are looking at mass evictions.  The reason for this is profiteering.  It is outrageous.  People should organise and fight against what is happening.  The Minister must close this loophole.  People with notices to quit hanging over them should be counted in the figures.  We will support this proposal.<\/p> <p> The Minister said that homelessness is not normal.  He is contradicting the chair of the Housing Agency.  If he really believes this, he should ask the chair to withdraw his comments.  Or are we looking at a game of good cop-bad cop, with the Taoiseach claiming the homelessness figures are low, the responsible Minister of State saying we will be viewed poorly internationally if people keep talking about homelessness and the chair of the Housing Agency saying the figures are normal?  There is an attempt to normalise and minimise the homelessness crisis.  It is cold, calculating and co-ordinated.  The Fine Gael Ministers involved should be ashamed of themselves.  However, I do not believe they will fool the people on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500042#SS01600","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510769700,"counter":491,"content":"<p>People Before Profit will support this good Bill.  Any measure that will keep families together in a crisis, such as that relating to homelessness, is good.<\/p>  <p>  The problem of homelessness seems to have no end.  For the Taoiseach to claim we have a situation of normality with homelessness is an insult to everybody's intelligence.  I accept that the Government is trying to address legacy issues relating to the homelessness crisis.  However, I cannot understand how anybody can believe that having over 8,000 people in emergency accommodation is normal.  It is abnormal; it is almost social whitewashing when claiming that this is normal practice in Ireland and across the world.  That is an indictment on our society, our housing system and international systems of housing people.  How can one find it normal that people are living on the streets when there is an abundance of housing?  How can it be normal for hundreds of families and children to live in emergency accommodation?  If anybody in the Government or an NGO finds that normal, he or she should resign immediately.<\/p>  <p>  There is a bubble in Leinster House where people think it is acceptable that families are in an emergency accommodation.  As a Deputy for the Dublin Mid West constituency, I see the problem every day.  It is an embarrassment that, in 21st century Ireland, people are living in emergency accommodation while the country is so wealthy and there is an abundance of housing.<\/p>  <p>  A new phenomenon has emerged whereby private landlords will ask potential tenants what level of HAP they are on.  If the potential tenant is on homeless HAP, the money the landlord gets is exorbitant.  For example, a one-bedroom flat in Clondalkin was recently rented for &euro;1,700.  That is criminal.  The people asking for this kind of money should be wearing balaclavas.  However, they will extort that money from tenants and the Government.  Private landlords are asking if people have homeless HAP meaning that other HAP recipients are being discriminated against.  The whole system is crazy.  When we find homelessness normal, we should walk out of this building because this place is no longer fit for purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017111500043#TT00200","speaker":"1299"},{"type":"speech","time":1510769700,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I support the Bill but I do so with a sense of nausea at the cynicism of the Labour Party in failing to recognise its contribution to the homelessness crisis through its policies.

When Labour was in government with an overwhelming majority, it actively brought in policies that created the crisis relating to housing and homelessness.

I did not interrupt them.  The truth must out on this matter.  We have again what we had in the time of Bertie Ahern, when we were told to take our own lives rather than whining.  We had the exact same language from a Fine Gael Minister of State earlier.  I read with horror what he said about our reputation abroad:<\/p><blockquote>Some of this narrative has seeped into international coverage of our housing system, and it is damaging to Ireland's international reputation that our social response to this issue is being portrayed as dysfunctional.<\/blockquote><p>The housing crisis is dysfunctional.

The Government created a housing crisis with its reliance on the private market, claiming that it would provide.  It has utterly failed to do so, however.  The Government stood over legislation which enshrined HAP as the only game in town.  When I was a member of Galway City Council, we were repeatedly told it was the only game in town.  HAP is taxpayers' money going into the landlords' pockets at a capped level.  In Galway city, as in other cities, no tenant can get a property at that capped level.  To add insult to injury, the tenant or applicant has to get extra money to top up the rent.  That used to be regarded as an under-the-counter payment whereas now it is a recognised official payment.  HAP applicants are struggling to pay rents way beyond their capacity.<\/p><p>Over the years, I watched this problem grow.
