While more work remains to be done in the County, it has made steady progress in job creation terms, with unemployment having decreased by 28% since 2011.  At the end of last year total State agency supported employment in Tipperary stood at 10,157.<\/p>  <p>  A key tool for supporting job creation and fostering enterprise in Tipperary is the Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative.  This was launched in January 2015 and remains a central pillar of the Government&rsquo;s work to create 135,000 new jobs outside of Dublin by 2020. Tipperary is covered by both the South East and Mid West Action Plans, with core objectives of both being an increase of 10-15% in the numbers employed by 2020 and the reduction of unemployment to within one percentage point of the State average. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The two regions in which Tipperary is situated have both made significant economic strides forward.  The South East has seen good growth in employment over the last five years, with an additional 33,600 in employment in Q2 2017 compared to Q1 2012. The Mid West has also performed strongly and was the third fastest growing region in the country in employment terms from Q2 2016 to Q2 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the two Action Plans for Tipperary involves a wide range of stakeholders, both local and national.  This includes representatives from the Local Authorities, the enterprise agencies and other key public and private sector stakeholders in Tipperary.  All have been strongly involved in, and remain key drivers of, both the South East and the Mid West Action Plans for Jobs. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the IDA, its strategy for 2015-2019 is aligned to our regional development goals and includes a commitment to increase foreign direct investment in every region outside\u00a0Dublin by 30% to 40% by 2019. I am pleased that the Agency&rsquo;s 2016 results show that progress is being made towards that end, with 52% of all jobs created by the Agency&rsquo;s clients last year based outside of Dublin. <\/p>  <p>  The IDA remains focused on attracting further FDI to Tipperary.  The Agency markets the northern and southern halves of the County respectively as parts of its national Mid-West and South East regions.  There are a total of 12 IDA client companies currently situated across the County,\u00a0collectively employing 3,368 people. Given the County&rsquo;s significant manufacturing base, and its particular profile as a home to medical devices companies, the IDA strongly promotes Tipperary as an excellent location for new FDI from that wider sector. <\/p>  <p>  The FDI base is complemented by a strong indigenous sector in both North and South Tipperary.\u00a0Enterprise Ireland\u00a0has 120 clients across the County and works closely with them &ndash; including from the Agency&rsquo;s office in Shannon &ndash; to drive export growth and job creation. Enterprise Ireland has also invested significantly in companies situated there, with businesses receiving grants totalling &euro;11.74 million from 2014-2016. Enterprise Ireland has funded as well five Community Enterprise Centres which provide important enterprise hubs in the county.<\/p>  <p>  At local level, the Tipperary Local Enterprise Office successfully secured funding for five projects funded under Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Competitive Fund for LEOs. Additionally, a project from within the county was awarded funding to assess the viability of establishing a Food Centre of Excellence for Tipperary under Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Community Enterprise Initiative Scheme 2016.<\/p>  <p>  While we remain determined to achieve further progress in Tipperary, the overall enterprise trend in the area is one of steady improvement.\u00a0My Department and\u00a0its Agencies will continue\u00a0to do\u00a0their utmost to ensure that the highest level of investment and job creation possible is secured for County Tipperary in the time ahead.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200040#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":9,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 5 to 13, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":10,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200040#WRA00900"},{"type":"question","counter":11,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[43028\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200040#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her plans to support the retail sector in advance of Brexit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":12,"content":"<p>I recognise that the impact of Brexit is one of the most immediate concerns facing the retail sector.<\/p>  <p>  As a result, my Department has ensured that Retail representatives have been included in all relevant stakeholder engagements on Brexit, including the Enterprise Forum on Brexit and Global Challenges. <\/p>  <p>  Brexit has also become a standing item on the agenda at meetings of the Retail Consultation Forum, which was set up in 2014 to provide a platform for engagement between the sector and Government.<\/p>  <p>  Membership of this Forum includes retail associations such as RGDATA, Retail Ireland, Retail Excellence, other bodies such as ISME, SFA and Chambers Ireland, a number of retailers, the City and County Managers Association, and relevant Government Departments.<\/p>  <p>  The Forum meets 3-4 times per year, with working groups meeting more often to progress the work programme. The current work programme is driven by the key concerns of the Forum members, which include developing skills in the sector, reducing business costs, town centre renewal, and the impacts of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  The Forum will meet next on the 20th of\u00a0November. At each of the last four meetings, since the announcement of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the European Union, Forum members have been briefed on the Government&rsquo;s approach to Brexit and work undertaken to date, and have had the opportunity to voice their concerns. <\/p>  <p>  At its last meeting on 12th June, the Forum discussed the progress of its working groups on Retail Skills, Town Centre Renewal, and Reducing Energy Costs. Members were also briefed on research being undertaken by my Department into the firm-level impacts of Brexit in Ireland&rsquo;s most exposed enterprise sectors, which will be completed by year end. This research is looking at the impact of the UK being outside of the European Single Market and Customs Union on firms, the associated implications for investment, and how this informs our approach to negotiations. A pilot of this research was undertaken from January to March in three sectors: wholesale\/retail, food\/drink, and computer consultancy.<\/p>  <p>  Participants in the pilot identified the following areas as being the top three areas of particular concern post-Brexit to the Wholesale \/ Retail Sector: tariffs and rules of origin, physical border and free movement of labour.<\/p>  <p>  Announcements made in Budget 2018 in addition\u00a0to a\u00a0number of initiatives developed by the Retail Consultation Forum, my Department and other Government Departments will strengthen the capability, competitiveness, and resilience of the retail sector to meet the challenges resulting from Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  For example, my Department has secured Budget funding for a new Brexit Loan Scheme which will provide affordable financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be in the future. The new Scheme will be delivered by the Strategic\u00a0Corporation of Ireland (SBCI)\u00a0through commercial lenders to get much needed working capital into Irish businesses.<\/p>  <p>  The new Brexit Loan Scheme aims to make up to &euro;300 million available to businesses with up to 499 employees at a proposed interest rate of 4%. Retail businesses that are adversely affected by or will be affected by Brexit are eligible under this scheme as long as they submit a business sustainability plan which demonstrates\u00a0how they plan to adapt, innovate or change in response to Brexit. I expect this scheme to be up and running by March 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The retail sector will also benefit from the increase in disposable income through taxation and social welfare measures. Another welcome announcement for the retail sector, among others, is the retention of the 9% VAT rate for the tourism and hospitality sector. I am keenly aware that this has knock-on benefits to retailers, in particular in the regions. <\/p>  <p>  Through the Retail Consultation Forum we are also focusing on building online capability. Through initiatives like the Trading Online Voucher scheme and work being done by the Retail and Skills Working Group, retailers will be supported in addressing digital skills gaps and moving into online trading. In line with this, under the Action Plan for Jobs, my Department is exploring the development of a pilot programme to support retailers to scale up their domestic and international online trading activity.<\/p>  <p>  We are providing stakeholders with the tools to address the demise of the high street through &ldquo;A Framework for Town Centre Renewal&rdquo;, launched in April this year.<\/p>  <p>  We are also assisting retailers to improve competitiveness by reducing their energy costs, through a pilot efficiency programme delivered through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Retailers also have access to supports such as the Enterprise Ireland Brexit SME Scorecard to assist with planning and preparation for Brexit; the business advice, training and capability building services provided by the LEOs and to Intertrade Ireland &ldquo;Brexit readiness workshops&rdquo; that are held around the country.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I also recognise that retailers are concerned about the impact of sterling fluctuations on Irish consumer sentiment; however the volume of retail sales is growing at a faster rate than the value of sales growth, which demonstrates that there continues to be heavy discounting by retailers and promotional activities to drive footfall and sales.<\/p>  <p>  Engagement with the sector will continue through the Retail Consultation Forum, bilateral engagements with sector representatives, and Brexit-focused stakeholder engagement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200040#WRA01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Workplace Relations Commission","counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200040#WRA01200"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[42766\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200040#WRA01300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos 86 to 90, inclusive, of 28 June 2017, if the Workplace Relations Commission has completed the investigation; if so, the results of same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":15,"content":"<p>In response to parliamentary questions asked by the deputy on 28 June 2017, I passed the information provided by the deputy at that time to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) for further investigation. \u00a0The Inspection and Enforcement Services of the WRC monitor employment conditions to ensure compliance with and, where necessary, the enforcement of employment rights legislation in Ireland.

This review is being undertaken in the context of global changes that are likely to have an immediate impact on Ireland's enterprise development, and specifically Brexit and potential policy changes under the new US administration. <\/p>  <p>  In addition the advances in digital technologies continue apace, opening up new market opportunities, spawning new global business models and impacting on every sector of the economy. Such advances can also pose challenges for companies in adopting technologies, whether in the factory or the customer experience centre, and reinforce the need for continuous skills development for those already in the workplace. While we are well placed to respond to these new developments and capture new opportunities, I am conscious that we need to work through, sector  by sector, the necessary responses whether that is at firm level, or through investment in our innovation system or education system and that we have effective collaboration between the key stakeholders. <\/p>  <p>  A senior-level Principal Officer forum has been established that includes representatives from a number of key economic government departments and the development agencies. Analysis of performance to date on the targets set shows good performance against the 30 metrics set out in Enterprise 2025 and solid progress on implementation of 56 strategic actions. A more comprehensive review of enterprise performance over the past decade, and since the publication of Enterprise 2025 has recently been completed. Informed by this evidence base, we will engage with industry and other stakeholders to debate the extent to which our priorities remain robust or need a greater emphasis in today's environment. <\/p>  <p>  While there is a need to have a change in emphasis in the context of the highly uncertain external environment, we are continuing to focus on getting the fundamentals of our enterprise policy right as the Government has demonstrated in the Budget 2018 announced on Tuesday this week - including our continued focus on export-led growth, underpinned by investments in innovation and skills to respond to a changing world and our continuing focus on enhancing competitiveness and productivity.

It provided for the engagement of up to\u00a035 additional personnel by the Agency\u00a0to deliver new\u00a0jobs\u00a0for people in Ireland. \u00a0Its other\u00a0key objectives included targeting new forms of foreign direct investment and broadening the geographic base from which the\u00a0Agency seeks and secures\u00a0overseas investment.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Since its inception, IDA Ireland has spent &euro;11.1m on the Winning Abroad Programme.\u00a0 This comprised an outlay of &euro;437,000 in 2014; &euro;3.86 million in 2015; &euro;3.86 million again in 2016; and &euro;2.93 million in 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The initiative has had a very positive impact in terms of job creation since its implementation, with a total of 3242 jobs having already been created.  Moreover, the IDA expects the Winning Abroad Programme to have helped create 14,000 new jobs over the wider period between 2014-2019. This is considerably ahead of the target of 10,000 jobs that was originally set by the Agency for this initiative. <\/p>  <p>  Another positive feature of Winning Abroad is that the jobs that are being created by the Programme are spread across a range of sectors.  This includes areas such as\u00a0life sciences, technology, digital media services, and financial services.\u00a0To date team members hired under the Winning Abroad Programme have contributed strongly to the Agency&rsquo;s overall results in these sectors, winning 140 investments in total.<\/p>  <p>  The excellent\u00a0value for money represented by the Winning Abroad Programme is not just measured in jobs created or investments won. Projects associated with the Programme have also made a significant overall contribution to the Irish economy, with those secured to date contributing &euro;160 million\u00a0in payroll,\u00a0&euro;61.7 million of which has been returned to the Exchequer\u00a0through taxes.\u00a0These figures are expected to increase even further over the time ahead. <\/p>  <p>  In light of the excellent performance - and the\u00a0value for money delivered -\u00a0by the Winning Abroad initiative, it was decided earlier this year to place it on a permanent footing through the regularisation of its 35 posts within IDA Ireland. This will ensure that our economy continues to benefit from the increased stream of investment and job creation that the programme has helped bring to Ireland. It will also help provide\u00a0the Agency with human resources it requires in the time ahead to seek and secure new investment opportunities abroad and to address the challenges and opportunities associated with Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  The IDA is now better equipped in staffing terms than ever before. The Winning Abroad Programme has boosted the IDA&rsquo;s permanent headcount by over 12%. This was in addition to the 10 additional Brexit posts that were sanctioned for the IDA as part of last year's budget. I am pleased that an additional &euro;700,000 in funding via Budget 2018 is now being provided so that the Agency can engage 10 more personnel to respond to the challenges and opportunities associated with Brexit.

It is therefore an important means by which the IDA can encourage and attract new investors to the country, especially to regional Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The IDA's regional property programme is another important mechanism that supports investment outside of our main urban areas. It helps to\u00a0ensure property solutions are in place for overseas companies considering investing or expanding, thereby encouraging FDI in regional Ireland. A number of\u00a0buildings\u00a0have already been constructed through the programme and 2018 will see the completion of further facilities in Galway, Athlone, Dundalk and Limerick.

Ireland is the 8th most competitive economy in the euro area and the 11th most competitive economy in the EU28.  Despite the fall in ranking, it is encouraging that the overall trajectory of Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness performance and scores in indices such as the WEF&rsquo;s in recent years is positive.

Both the nominal and real Harmonised Competitiveness Indicators are at relatively low levels by historic standards and recent data points to continued HCI competitiveness in Ireland. Most importantly, our improved competitiveness is reflected in strong employment growth across sectors and regions.

This incorporates an extensive suite of studies (both externally commissioned and in-house research) and surveys, addressing the key enterprise aspects of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  - In April my Department published the outputs from a series of structured engagements with companies (of different sizes, across different sectors and across the regions) and from a survey of a thousand SME business owners to \"Understand the Implications of Brexit for Irish SME&rsquo;s\".<\/p>  <p>  - A study analysing the \"Potential Impact of WTO Tariffs on Cross-Border Trade\" has been published in conjunction with InterTrade Ireland. This study provides an understanding of the impact of different trade and tariff regimes which might be imposed following Brexit, together with data on the extent and concentration of Cross Border Trade, including information on this trade by product and firm types, and barriers to exporting, all in the context of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of ongoing research commitments, the Department is currently working on:<\/p>  <p>  - A major study examining the \"Strategic Implications arising from EU-UK Trading Patterns\". This study will provide an evidence base on key trade and investment questions to inform Ireland&rsquo;s position as part of the wider negotiation on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU. It will quantify the possible impact of a range of Brexit scenarios on trade and investment and will provide significant data on possible sectoral impacts of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  - A study examining the \"Sectoral implications arising from Brexit\" focused on 18 sectors most exposed to the UK is underway and is due to be completed by end 2017. This research examines the implications at firm-level for Ireland&rsquo;s most exposed enterprise sectors of the UK being outside of the European Single Market and Customs Union. The study is expected to be completed by end 2017.<\/p>  <p>  - A study examining the \"Import Content of Irish Exports: Implications of Brexit for Inputs and Competitiveness\" and the extent to which Irish firms source intermediate inputs from the UK has just commenced. This research will provide empirical evidence on the import content of Irish firms&rsquo; exports, how firms &amp;amp; sectors may be exposed to changes in the trading environment after Brexit and the impact of Brexit on inputs, and competitiveness.<\/p>  <p>  - A study examining the \"Skills needs arising from the Potential Trading and Regulatory Implications of Brexit\" has commenced &ndash; with a particular focus on sectors such as logistics and freight. This research is being undertaken in my Department on behalf of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs. <\/p>  <p>  Informed by this evidence base and extensive stakeholder engagement, we are inputting to and helping to shape the Irish position in the negotiations regarding the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU. DBEI officials based in the Permanent Representation in Brussels, the Embassy London and at the WTO in Geneva are also essential to this work, engaging with other Member States and institutions and sharing intelligence with the wider Departmental system.<\/p>  <p>  At Ministerial and official level we are central to the diplomatic effort across Government engaging our EU partners including the European Commission, individual Member States and the European Parliament. <\/p>  <p>  This has led to a much greater understanding and appreciation across the EU of the uniqueness of Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with the UK and the potential impact of Brexit on Ireland &ndash; including the impacts at a sectoral level. <\/p>  <p>  We are also engaging with counterparts in the UK at Ministerial and official level to deepen bilateral contacts generally and to ensure that our concerns regarding the potential impact of Brexit on Irish enterprise in particular are well understood.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of our policy response, the focus has been to assess the possible implications and impacts of Brexit across policy areas of the Department and to ensure that the necessary supports are in place. <\/p>  <p>  We are leveraging the expertise and enhancing the capacity of our Enterprise Agencies to ensure that they are in the best possible position to address the needs of their client in relation to competitiveness, innovation and market diversification. This is being achieved through the provision of information, training and other supports. <\/p>  <p>  I have also\u00a0secured an additional &euro;3 million to enable the recruitment of a further 40-50 staff as part of DBEI 'Boots on the Ground'. This will bring the total additional Brexit related posts in the Department and across the Agencies to 100 in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is key in this regard. In responding to Brexit, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy is to support clients in sustaining and growing exports to the UK while also encouraging and supporting diversification into new markets outside the UK.<\/p>  <p>  EI is in regular contact with some 600 clients across all sectors who are most reliant on the UK market; there is a particular focus on sectors such as food, construction and engineering that are most exposed to the UK and which provide major employment across all the regions.<\/p>  <p>  EI&rsquo;s 'Brexit SME Scorecard' is an interactive online tool which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit. The tool prompts companies to consider the potential impact of Brexit across their business and provides suggested actions.<\/p>  <p>  EI has introduced a 'Be Prepared Grant' which offers up to &euro;5,000 in funding to support exporting client companies to research and develop a Brexit Action Plan.<\/p>  <p>  Likewise, the Local Enterprise Offices are key points of context for engagement with enterprise. The LEO&rsquo;s are organising local workshops, seminars and training to assist companies to better understand the challenges of Brexit. LEOs also have a range of supports to help clients to respond to those challenges, to become more competitive and to source new markets.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, we are targeting State supports to help vulnerable firms to adapt, in order to reinforce enterprise and employment, across all sectors and regions. In Budget 2018, a\u00a0new &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme was announced to\u00a0provide affordable financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be in the future. The new scheme is open to all trading SMEs and large firms employing less than 500. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, I have asked my officials to progress with the Department of Finance and the SBCI and EIB the development of a Longer-Term Loan Scheme, together with a new Business Advisory Hub service, which would focus on business development to allow enterprises to position them for a post-Brexit environment.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, there may also be sectoral opportunities as a result of Brexit. IDA continues to identify potential for mobile FDI in key sectors and actively pursue these opportunities including through targeted trade missions and rollout of advertising campaigns to promote Ireland&rsquo;s offering particularly in talent and tax.<\/p>  <p>  Financial Services is a key sector where we have strengths and opportunities. IDA is taking a targeted but realistic approach to pursuing these opportunities &ndash; this is being done in the context of upholding regulatory standards that apply in Ireland managed by the Central Bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200042#WRC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Skills Shortages","counter":105,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200042#WRC01100"},{"type":"question","counter":106,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[43326\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200042#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which she and her Department have continued to monitor the availability of the requisite skills in the workplace having particular regard to the skills requirements of the high tech industry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":107,"content":"<p>The\u00a0Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, through the Expert Group on Future Skills (EGFSN), continuously monitors and advises the Government on future skills requirements and associated labour market issues that impact on the national potential for employment growth. <\/p>  <p>  The EGFSN is an independent, non-statutory body, which includes representatives from the business community, trade unions, and a small number of Government Departments and agencies.

The AGSB was set up to give a greater voice in the development of policy to SMEs.  Issues negatively affecting the growth and development of SMEs are identified, and possible solutions are suggested by the Group.  My colleague, Minister of State for Trade, Employment, Business, EU Digital Single Market and Data Protection, Pat Breen TD, chairs the group and will ensure we continue to monitor current and impending impediments impacting on business. <\/p><p>Another formal structure is the Retail Consultation Forum. Given the importance of this sector to the economy it was established is to allow key issues of relevance to the retail sector to be discussed, with a view to identifying practical actions which could be taken by Government, or by industry itself, to support the sector with particular emphasis on achieving sustainable jobs growth in the sector.<\/p><p>As well as these formal structures, my Department regularly undertakes consultation exercises on various matters that are open to SMEs and their representative organisations to provide input.<\/p><p>Another method my Department uses to monitor any potential impediments to the business environment is Ireland&rsquo;s Small Business Act (SBA) Factsheet by the European Commission, the latest annual report being published in November 2016. The Small Business Act for Europe (SBA) is the EU&rsquo;s flagship policy initiative to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It comprises a set of policy measures organised around 10 principles. <\/p><p>2016 Report on Ireland:<\/p><p>This 2016 report shows once again that Ireland has one of the most SME friendly environments in the EU. <\/p><p>Ireland features among the top three performers in the EU in two of those ten principles:<\/p><p>- Skills &amp;amp; innovation of SMEs, and<\/p><p>- Single market (Single market refers to the integration and interaction of a countries administration and SME&rsquo;s to the Single Market). <\/p><p>Ireland performs well above the EU average in three other SBA areas:<\/p><p>- Entrepreneurship<\/p><p>- Second chance, and<\/p><p>- Responsive administration<\/p><p>In addition, my Department, as set out in the Action 166 of the APJ 2016, began monitoring a range of nationally and internationally available indicators to assess national performance across the entrepreneurship ecosystem in order to inform policy relating to new and growing businesses. <\/p><p>The reason behind this measurement exercise was to identify Ireland's international performance in each of the six fields in the ecosystem for entrepreneurship. They are:<\/p><p>1. Culture, human capital and education<\/p><p>2. Business environment and supports<\/p><p>3. Innovation<\/p><p>4. Access to finance<\/p><p>5. Entrepreneurial networks and mentoring<\/p><p>6. Access to markets<\/p><p>By assessing Ireland&rsquo;s performance in each field through a number of internationally respected entities, we can see the lay of the land in our ecosystem. <\/p><p>When viewed, the measurements show good to excellent performance in a number of fields, particularly Business Environment and Innovation. In the Access to Finance field, it appears that the SME sector, of which entrepreneurs are a cohort, rely heavily on reinvesting profits and inter trade lending. They appear to be below the mean, when compared to their EU counterparts, in accessing finance from banks. This impediment is being addressed by the SBCI and the Credit Guarantee Scheme. <\/p><p>Overall, the picture painted from the indicators shows that Ireland is a positive environment in which to create and operate a business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200042#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services Provision","counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200042#WRC01700"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[43328\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200042#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which she and her Department continue to encourage start up enterprises in all regions throughout the country; the issues to date identified as being likely to impede progress; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":113,"content":"<p>Enterprise Ireland supports companies in regional and rural areas to start, innovate and remain competitive in international markets, now and into the future. <\/p>  <p>  The 5,000 manufacturing and internationally traded services companies that Enterprise Ireland works with are a critical source of existing employment and job creation in every county in Ireland.

The LEOs can also offer advice and guidance in areas such as Local Authority rates, public procurement and other regulations affecting business.<\/p>  <p>  There are a range of supports available from the LEOs to assist start-ups. The LEOs can offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (10 employees or fewer) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities. These include feasibility grants (investigating the potential of a business idea) and priming grants (to part-fund a start-up). In 2016, over &euro;7 million in priming grants was approved for 357 new LEO clients across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Anyone with a viable business proposal can also use the LEOs to make an application to MicroFinance Ireland, which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-ups with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks. Successful applicants can avail of a more favourable interest rate from MFI if they make their application through the LEO.<\/p>  <p>  The LEOs attracted 1,471 applicants to the Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur (IBYE) 2018 competition by the closing date at the end of September 2017. IBYE is a programme run by the 31 LEOs with the support of my Department and Enterprise Ireland and is aimed at encouraging entrepreneurship as a career choice among young people. The competition is open to people between the ages of 18 and 35 with an innovative business idea and has an investment fund of up to &euro;2million. <\/p>  <p>  The LEOs also run promotional events such as the National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day and the Local Enterprise Week, which are aimed at, inter alia, promoting the LEO services and encouraging people to start or grow a business. These events are supplemented by LEO participation in other promotional events such as the National Ploughing Championships and the forthcoming Taking Care of Business event in Dublin Castle on 8 November.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200042#WRC01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Research and Development Supports","counter":114,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200042#WRC02000"},{"type":"question","counter":115,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[43329\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200042#WRC02100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which innovation continues to be a feature of enterprise and investment here; if she has satisfied herself that new enterprises have adequate access to innovation technology and-or appropriate assistance from the European Union; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":116,"content":"<p>Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) is globally recognised as the key economic differentiator and, as such, a very important feature of enterprise and investment in Ireland.Put simply, RDI enables Irish companies to make products and services that are innovative, competitive and more novel than those in global markets.

Improving competitiveness performance is a core focus of the work of my Department and wider Government policy and is particularly vital in light of the challenges posed by Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  The 2017\/2018 Global Competitiveness Report published by the World Economic Forum in September shows Ireland&rsquo;s ranking has fallen by 1 place this year. Despite the fall in ranking, Ireland continues to be the 8th most competitive economy in the euro area and the 11th most competitive economy in the EU28. The Institute for Management Development measure of competitiveness ranks Ireland 6th most competitive out of 63 countries and the 2nd most competitive in the Euro area. Ireland&rsquo;s performance reflects significant and continuous improvements in rankings related to economic performance, business efficiency, government efficiency and infrastructure. It is an important signal to international investors. The World Bank&rsquo;s Ease of Doing Business report currently ranks Ireland 18th out of 190 economies, ahead of the UK in terms of starting a business and paying taxes but behind in the overall rankings. <\/p>  <p>  Most importantly, our improved competitiveness is reflected in strong employment growth across sectors and regions. The strong performance of clients supported by the enterprise agencies in winning exports, market share and job creation in the face of intense global competition is to be commended and reflects the competitiveness of the environment in which to do business in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Recent reports by the National Competitiveness Council have highlighted the need to continually enhance competitiveness performance. I share the Council&rsquo;s view that to further improve competitiveness we must preserve fiscal sustainability, maximise investment in infrastructure and talent, maintain cost competitiveness, and drive innovation and productivity across all economic sectors. Global uncertainty, and Brexit in particular, has underlined the importance of building competitive advantage, generating an uplift in enterprise export competitiveness and continuing to harness the benefits from trade and the Single Market to secure sustainable jobs and growth. My objective is to ensure the economy is resilient at sectoral and enterprise level to deal with imminent competitiveness challenges and to build further on the progress we have made. <\/p>  <p>  Competitiveness is key to success in international markets and helping businesses to improve their competitiveness will remain a key focus for my Department.

Such violence is entirely unacceptable. It must be thoroughly investigated and its perpetrators brought to justice. <\/p>  <p>  I note that the President of Colombia has instructed the National Police and the Colombian Armed Forces to cooperate with the Colombian DPP to determine what occurred on 5 October and that the Colombian National Police have ordered the suspension of four of its officers in connection with the incident. I welcome this as a sign of the resolve of the Colombian government to ensure that the events are investigated in full. <\/p>  <p>  I am also deeply concerned at the attack which took place on 8 October against the United Nations-led humanitarian mission which travelled to the scene of the violence in Tumaco to investigate the shooting of civilians.  I urge the Government of Colombia to carry out a full investigation of this incident also. <\/p>  <p>  Tumaco is among the regions of Colombia which has suffered most the consequences of the country&rsquo;s conflict.  My Department has an ongoing commitment to supporting peace and human rights in this troubled region and officials from my Department visited the region in 2015 and 2016.  <\/p>  <p>  Incidences of violence and intimidation against local communities in the Departments of Cauca, Argelia and Nari&ntilde;o, and elsewhere in Colombia, as well as the continued presence of armed groups in such communities, remain a matter of great concern.  As well as ongoing exchanges with the Colombian authorities at Government-level, officials of my Department engage regularly with human rights defenders and civil society leaders active in Colombia, including those working in some of the communities most affected by conflict.  <\/p>  <p>  I reiterate that I am deeply concerned at the recent violent incidents, which must be thoroughly investigated. <\/p>  <p>  At the same time, I must acknowledge the extraordinary strides which have been made in the implementation of the peace process to date.  The full decommissioning of FARC weapons was complete by July 2017, eight months after the agreement was finalised.  A ceasefire with the country&rsquo;s second largest guerrilla group, the ELN, took effect at the beginning of October.  The peace process provides the framework in which the endemic violence and impunity which has afflicted Colombian society can successfully be addressed.  Ireland is committed to supporting its full implementation to ensure a future of peace for all Colombians. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200044#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":224,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200044#WRE01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200044#WRE01100"},{"type":"question","counter":224,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[43241\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200044#WRE01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress made in rolling out self catering and shared kitchen facilities in the Ballyhaunis, Athlone, Kinsale Road and Clonakilty Lodge centres similar to the facilities available at the Mosney direct provision centre; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":225,"content":"<p>Recommendation 4.75 from the Working Group Report to Government on Improvements to the Protection Process, including Direct Provision and Supports to Asylum Seekers, chaired by\u00a0Dr. Bryan McMahon\u00a0(formerly of the\u00a0High Court) recommended\u00a0that all families should have access to cooking facilities (whether in a self contained unit or through use of\u00a0a communal kitchen) in so far as is practicable.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government also recognises that &ldquo;Long durations in direct provision are acknowledged to have a negative impact on family life.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service. However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner. The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; is forecast at just over &euro;1.7 billion in 2017. <\/p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively. This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.<\/p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster (Versatis) is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010. The projected budget impact was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. Currently, over 25,000 patients are in receipt of this item. <\/p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of Versatis highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, between 5-10% of prescribing of this product is for the licensed indication of PHN. <\/p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for Versatis from 1 September 2017. This process supports the appropriate use of Versatis, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment. The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.<\/p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who receive antivirals for shingles are automatically approved for Versatis for three months. No action is required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy is notified of his or her approval status.<\/p><p>All patients who currently use Versatis have been identified and automatically registered on the HSE-PCRS system for three months and will continue to receive the treatment from their pharmacy until 30 November 2017. However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients will no longer get Versatis under the community drugs schemes. The HSE has produced information leaflets for patients and advised GPs on treatment alternatives. <\/p><p>In exceptional circumstances, the product may be approved for supply through the community schemes for unlicensed indications. GPs apply for reimbursement for unlicensed indications through the online system. The MMP reviews applications before a decision is made and communicated to the GP.<\/p><p>Full details of the Versatis review are available on the HSE website at .<\/p><p>As this is a matter for the HSE, I have no role in this decision in relation to individual treatments.

The Programme for Government and Sl&aacute;intecare commit to shifting the model of healthcare towards a more comprehensive and accessible primary care service in order to deliver better care close to home in communities across the country. The development of a new, modernised contract for the provision of general practitioner services will be a key element in facilitating this process. The aim is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions. <\/p>  <p>   Since 2015, negotiations have resulted in a number of service developments including the provision of free GP care to under 6's and over 70's, the introduction of a Diabetes Cycle of Care for adult GMS patients with Type 2 Diabetes and enhanced supports for rural GPs.  The next phase of discussions on a new GP contract is under way and I expect that the sustainability of general practice in rural areas will be considered in this context.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2018 has provided &euro;25 million new funding for primary care that will enable a range of initiatives to be progressed in 2018 which will focus on disease prevention, early intervention and GP care. I am hopeful that progress can be made over the coming months on service developments that can be introduced during 2018 and that we can then build on this with further resourcing in future years. I look forward to continued ongoing positive engagement with GP representatives in the months ahead. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, I would like to assure the Deputy of the Government's commitment to the continued development of GP capacity to ensure that patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future. I want to ensure that existing GP services are retained and that general practice remains an attractive career option for newly-qualified GPs.<\/p>  <p>  Efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practising GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible\/shared GMS\/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, as well as the introduction of an enhanced supports package for rural GP practices. Separately, the State is seeking to train more GPs to provide GP services to the population. In 2009, there were 120 GP training places and in 2017 there were 170 training places filled. The Government is committed to further increasing this number to 259 places annually in future years. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200045#WRF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Data","counter":273,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200045#WRF00500"},{"type":"question","counter":274,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[43232\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200045#WRF00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the data protection ramifications of the HSE asking a private company to carry out a discovery process of all HSE held information technology equipment and filing systems, including all information technology archiving and individual HSE email accounts and systems for the Grace Commission of Investigation have been fully examined; if this contract was put out to tender; if responsibility will rest with senior HSE management in the event of lost documentation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":275,"content":"<p>The HSE has responsibility for the data it holds and ensuring that it complies fully with its obligations under the Data Protection Act in respect of this data.

The Committee recommended that measures be adopted to cease the poor employment practice which gives rise to contracts of indefinite duration and risk to the public arising from provision of services by persons who are not appropriately qualified. The HSE is focused on implementing the recommendations of the Committee.<\/p><p>On 17 July 2017 National HR, HSE issued a detailed Circular &ldquo;<i>HR Circular 021\/2017 re Qualifications required for Consultant Posts<\/i>&rdquo;. The Circular reaffirmed the HSE&rsquo;s regulatory functions in relation to all consultant appointments in the public service in Ireland, including new and replacement posts, locum and temporary posts, contract type and qualifications to apply.

The Deputy will be familiar with the background to the closure of both the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant schemes in February 2013.  Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,700 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.<\/p><p>The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government <\/i>acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs.  The Government's legislative programme for 2017 includes the Health (Transport Support) Bill.  I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.  The proposals seek to ensure that:<\/p><p>-  There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;<\/p><p>-  There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;<\/p><p>-  Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and<\/p><p>-  The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>The draft General Scheme and Heads of Bill were circulated to other government Departments and have been the subject of consultation between the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  When the consultation with other relevant Departments has been completed, the next step will be to seek Government approval to the drafting of a Bill for the new Scheme.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.<\/p><p>Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges.

In February 2017 the HSE published the Report of the Committee established to undertake this work:- &lsquo;Successful Consultant Recruitment, Appointment and Retention&rsquo;. The Committee recommended that measures be adopted to cease the poor employment practice which gives rise to contracts of indefinite duration and risk to the public arising from provision of services by persons who are not appropriately qualified. The HSE is focused on implementing the recommendations of the Committee.<\/p>  <p>  On 17th July National HR, HSE issued a detailed Circular &ldquo;HR Circular 021\/2017 re Qualifications required for Consultant Posts&rdquo;. The Circular reaffirmed the HSE&rsquo;s regulatory functions in relation to all consultant appointments in the public service in Ireland, including new and replacement posts, locum and temporary posts, contract type and qualifications to apply. It stated that health service employers are required to seek the prior approval of the HSE before making a Consultant appointment (whether permanent or non-permanent) and to comply with the HSE Letter of Approval concerning any post in making an appointment. It also provided that a risk mitigation plan be put in place for each consultant post where the appointee does not hold the qualifications specified for the appointment, and this should include appropriate arrangements for senior clinical oversight as required. It also provided for the early termination of contracts of temporary\/locum doctors who do not hold the qualifications required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200046#WRG03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortality Data","counter":362,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200046#WRG03800"},{"type":"question","counter":363,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[43358\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101200046#WRG03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to provide mortality and morbidity information below county level here particularly in the context of the proposed health information and patient safety Bill; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that this breakdown of mortality and morbidity information below county levels is essential as a baseline for assessment of potential health risks to the public from environmental and other sources and is a requirement of EU member states under the Aarhus Convention; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":364,"content":"<p>The Department of Health has created the Public Health Information System (PHIS) to provide detailed information on mortality and morbidity at county level.

The Chinese General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) then carried out a systems audit in Ireland in January 2016.  In April 2017 together with the AQSIQ Minister Zhi Shuping, I signed a Protocol on the requirements for Frozen Beef to be exported from Ireland to China.

Works on those roads are funded from the local authority's own resources supplemented by State road grants.\u00a0 The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the relevant local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  The Department initiated a regional road bridge inspection programme in 2011 to assess the condition of bridges on the network and this has been followed up with a Bridge Rehabilitation Grant programme.  Under the Bridge Rehabilitation Grant scheme local authorities submit a list of bridges in order of priority for consideration for funding.  Within the constraints of the overall roads budget, allocations are made to local authorities for remedial bridge works.  Given the current spending constraints it is the Department's policy when grant applications are received from local authorities for bridge improvement works to prioritise rehabilitation works over widening projects and proposed new bridges. <\/p>  <p>  As regards higher cost bridge projects these have to be considered under the Specific Grant Programme.  This Grant Programme was curtailed significantly during the recession and while the Capital Plan 2016-2021 does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network it will take some years yet to reach the level required for the adequate maintenance and renewal of the network.  There is, therefore, limited scope at present for funding projects under the Specific Grant Programme. <\/p>  <p>  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under this Programme will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, with particular consideration given to higher cost Bridge Rehabilitation Works, significant safety schemes and improvement works that promote employment.

As there is a level of turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Forces which is higher than the rest of the public service, targeted recruitment has been and is currently taking place so as to maintain the agreed strength levels.  The level of turnover also reflects that a significant number of personnel leave before the completion of basic training. In 2017, the Defence Forces have been targeting an increase in the level of recruitment across the range of recruitment streams.  A total of 99 Cadets were recently inducted (on the 25th September 2017) of which, just over 20% were female.  General Service recruitment campaigns for both the Army and Naval Service were launched earlier this year.  These competitions have progressed and general service recruitment has commenced from these campaigns. A further General Service recruitment campaign was launched in late September.   <\/p>  <p>  As with other areas of the public service, challenges have arisen in relation to the recruitment and retention of certain skilled personnel, including Pilots and Air Traffic Controllers.
