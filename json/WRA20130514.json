The total number of people waiting on the out-patient waiting list as at 3 May 2013 is 376,751.  This is a reduction of 7,881 in comparison with the NTPF published figures to March 2013. The data also shows that of the total number of people waiting,  199,513 (52.6%) are waiting less than 6 months and 278,666 (almost 74%) are waiting less than 12 months.<\/p><p>All hospitals have been engaged in the process of validating outpatient waiting lists, which is anticipated to be complete by mid-May 2013. Reforming the delivery of outpatient services is being addressed through the Outpatient (OP) Service Performance Improvement Programme. This is a national programme, encompassing the HSE, SDU, the NTPF and all hospitals providing outpatient services, being implemented between 2012 and 2015. The overall aim of the programme is to ensure timely, appropriate access to OP services so that the most appropriate member of the clinical team sees the right patient at the right time. Key elements of this large programme of reform will include on-going validation of waiting lists, the systematic and standardised management of referrals from primary care, a reduction in unacceptably high &ldquo;do not attend&rdquo; rates and appropriate discharging from OP services when clinically appropriate to do so.<\/p><p>Neither my Department nor the HSE has a function in relation to the gathering of waiting list data for the private hospital sector.  Therefore, a comparison between public and private waiting lists is not available.  However, I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to focus its resources on reducing waiting lists in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to deliver rapid and equitable access to health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400057#WRB02700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Provision","counter":43,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400057#WRB02750"},{"type":"question","counter":44,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[22570\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400057#WRB02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the range of mental health services available for adults, adolescents and children across the Dublin\/North East Region; if he will outline plans for further developments already signed off on but yet to be introduced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1080","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":45,"content":"<p>The HSE Dublin North East Region (DNE) covers counties Louth, Meath, Cavan, Monaghan and Dublin North City and County.

This is embodied in the <i>National Disability Strategy,<\/i>which is the Government's overarching policy on the most effective combination of legislation, policies, institutional arrangements and services to support and reinforce equal participation for all people with disabilities.<\/p><p><br \/>  The National Disability Strategy Implementation Group, which I am chairing, is in the process of drawing up an <i>Implementation Plan<\/i>   specifying actions across a number of departments, including the Department of Health. The National Disability Authority is at an advanced stage in the development of Disability Indicators which will allow real measurement of how the actions contained in the Plan translate into an enhanced quality of life for people with disabilities.<\/p><p><br \/>  With regard to services and supports which are under the aegis of the Department of Health, the implementation of the recommendations set out in the <i>Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Review of Disability Services in Ireland<\/i> and the <i>VFM National Implementation Framework<\/i>   will enhance the quality of life of people with disabilities in the following ways: people with disabilities and their families will have more choice and flexibility in the services they receive and will have more control over how they access these services; services and supports will be tailored to meet individual need and will support greater independence and social inclusion; the move to individualised budgeting will be underpinned by a standardised needs assessment to ensure fairness and transparency in the way in which funding is allocated; supports and services will be delivered with greater equity, transparency and accountability and will be more cost effective.<\/p><p><br \/>  During 2013 the HSE will manage and direct migration towards a person-centred supports model through demonstration projects initiated by service providers as proof of concept, which will run in parallel with current services. Their suitability for wider application will then be evaluated. The implementation processes underway in respect of the <i>Congregated Settings Report<\/i> and the <i>New Directions<\/i>   (Adult Day Services) Report also fit within the overarching VFM implementation framework and will significantly enhance the lives of people with disabilities.<\/p><p><br \/>  A HSE-led National implementation Group is developing a national plan and change programme to progress the recommendations of the <i>Congregated Settings Report<\/i>   and transfer the 3,600 people with disabilities who live in these settings into the community over the next 7 years.  As part of this process &euro;1m has been transferred from the Health Vote to the Housing Vote to provide for the social housing costs of up to 150 people leaving institutions in 2013.<\/p><p><br \/>  The recommendations in <i>New Directions, <\/i>the Report of the National Working Group for the Review of HSE-funded Adult Day Services<i>,<\/i>is guiding the reconfiguration and modernization of HSE funded adult day services from a largely segregated group-delivered service to a personally chosen and socially inclusive model of supports. A National Implementation Working Group established by the HSE to oversee the implementation of the recommendations has developed a draft interim <i>Quality Standards Framework for Day Services<\/i>   with a  consultation process to commence in Quarter 3, 2013.<\/p><p><br \/>  One of the key commitments in the Programme for Government  in relation to children and adults with disabilities is to put the<i> National Standards for Residential Services for People with Disabilities <\/i>  on a statutory footing and ensure that the services are inspected by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA). The standards outline what is expected of a provider of services and what a person with a disability, his or her family, and the public can expect to receive from residential care services.  They seek to ensure that vulnerable people with disabilities in residential services are safeguarded and protected, and their quality of life is enhanced. <\/p><p>Each section of the <i>National Standards<\/i> outline the specific standards for adults and children which aim to enhance the potential of people living in residential services in addition to ensuring that their living space is of an appropriate standard.  The <i>Standards <\/i>  focus on outcomes which empower people with disabilities at the different stages of their lives to participate in, and contribute to, activities which help them realise their full potential.  I am pleased to say that I formally launched these standards earlier today.<\/p><p><br \/>  Work is also continuing in the Department of Health on both the <i>Registration and Inspection<\/i> and <i>Care and Welfare<\/i>  regulations required to bring the standards into law. These are being developed taking into account the lessons learned from the introduction of similar regulations for nursing homes. HIQA's additional staffing requirements have been approved and discussions on the resources required to commence the regulatory regime are well advanced.

Dealing with the current high levels of suicide and deliberate self-harm is a priority for this Government.  <i>Reach Out <\/i>our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention makes a number of recommendations in relation to fast track referrals to community-based mental health services, effective response to deliberate self-harm, training, stigma reduction, etc.  Consequently, the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) has developed a range of initiatives to support people who are suicidal and also supporting their families, friends and peers in recognising and responding appropriately to signs of emotional distress and suicidal thoughts.    <\/p><p><br \/>  Funding for suicide prevention is provided to the NOSP by the HSE from its overall budget for mental health.  The annual budget for suicide prevention increased this year to over &euro;13 million.  Over &euro;8 million of this is provided to the NOSP to fund voluntary and statutory agencies delivering services in the area of prevention, intervention, postvention and research.   The remaining &euro;5 million for suicide prevention is available regionally to fund HSE Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention, Self-Harm Liaison Nurses in Hospital Emergency Departments and local suicide prevention initiatives.<\/p><p><br \/>  The NOSP is reviewing its current activities to make the most of our available resources, including looking at best practice internationally to inform evidence-based policy decisions.  This will result in a revised strategic approach for 2013 and will inform the final phase of the <i>Reach Out <\/i>Strategy<i>, <\/i>  which runs until 2014.   I expect that the HSE will approve the revised approach in the very near future.<\/p><p><br \/>  A key part of the work of the NOSP is to create an awareness within the community of positive mental health and suicide prevention.  NOSP commissions major national media campaigns and also sponsors non-statutory partners in their health promotion work.  The major NOSP campaigns include '<i>Your Mental Health'<\/i> and <i>'Let Someone Know'<\/i>  .  It also funds campaigns targeted at specific groups within the community e.g. the farming community through Farm TV.   These programmes have been well evaluated in terms of impact.   The focus of these national campaigns is to assist the individual to understand the importance of looking after their mental health and to seek help at times of stress.<\/p><p><br \/>  The NOSP is also involved in media monitoring to ensure that safe messages are communicated through print media and has facilitated national standards on the reporting of suicide.  The NOSP has recently established a communication advisory group to assist with the development of a new communications strategy for suicide prevention and to promote positive mental health. <\/p><p><br \/>  Another function of the NOSP is to coordinate the activity of the many voluntary and statutory agencies that are engaged in suicide prevention activities.  Currently the NOSP funds 26 non-statutory agencies working in this area.  The relationship between NOSP and the non-statutory groups is framed in Service Level Agreements.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is vital that we ensure that this work is connected\/interlinked and avoids duplication, is evidence and needs based and offers value for money.  In order to get maximum benefit from the investment in suicide prevention and ensure a coordinated response to the needs of those at risk of or affected by suicide, the NOSP will continue to coordinate the work of the many different voluntary, statutory and non-statutory organisations working in this area.  By promoting cross-organisational collaboration, the development of networks and partnerships, skills sharing and service development, the NOSP hopes to maximise the impact of a suicide prevention and support network in Ireland, to ensure it reaches and responds effectively to people who are vulnerable.  The NOSP is currently working to integrate current programmes so as to reduce duplication within the sector, and provide a strategic framework for the coordination of the extensive range of actions in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400057#WRB04100","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":62,"content":"<p>Question No. 99 answered with Question No. 92.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Accident and Emergency Departments Waiting Times","counter":63,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400057#WRB04250"},{"type":"question","counter":64,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[22187\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400057#WRB04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will report on the current situation in the accident and emergency department of Beaumont Hospital, Dublin 9 in view of the fact that some citizens have been left waiting for more than 24 hours in accident and emergency for admission; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":65,"content":"<p>On my appointment as Minister for Health, I set out to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients being treated in our hospitals.

However, at the appointment stage this data may not be current and cannot be validated.  Accordingly, it is not possible to indicate the number of the successful candidates who were already employed by the HSE.  <\/p><p><br \/>  It is currently the responsibility of the HSE Regional Directors of Operations (RDO) to decide within the context of their current resources, whether to fill vacancies that may arise as a result of the appointment of an individual to the mental health development posts from 2012.  Each RDO has been asked to consider favourably the backfilling of posts vacated by the appointment of individuals to new mental health development posts to ensure that the objective of enhancing General Adult and Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health Teams will be maintained.<\/p><p><br \/>  As at 30th April, 2013, 383 of the 414 posts approved in 2012 have either been filled, are under offer or awaiting clearance.  The National Recruitment Service (NRS) of the HSE creates national panels in anticipation of vacancies.  On occasion however, it is difficult to fill some posts for various reasons including geographical location, international shortage of some grades, most notably clinical Psychologists etc.   The NRS  is currently working to ensure that  the remaining posts will be filled as soon as possible, subject to appropriately qualified candidates being available.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Budgetary pressures within the HSE delayed the full utilisation of the 2012 funding, but this sum is available again this year along with a further additional &euro;35m which was provided in Budget 2013 for the continued development of mental health services across a range of headings, including the further ongoing development of community services.  477 posts have been approved to implement these measures.<\/p><p><br \/>  Discussions took place within the HSE, and in consultation with the Department of Health, to finalise the allocation of these resources and commence recruitment.  In March, each of the four HSE regions were asked to submit a business case against each of the identified objectives detailing how the funding is to be spent and the type and number of WTE to be recruited.   The business cases were submitted to the Office of the Assistant National Director Mental Health and examined to ensure that they were within the scope of the agreed objectives approved by the HSE Senior Management Team; the funding came within the allocation to the Region; the WTEs were within the allocation; there was clarity about the types of post to be recruited. <\/p><p><br \/>  Approval has issued to two of the Regions, HSE Dublin North East and HSE South and it is expected that approval will issue to the remaining two HSE Regions shortly.   \u00a0When the Approval Letters issue, the Regional Directors of Operations will ensure that the necessary paperwork is submitted to the NRS and the recruitment process will commence.

The Report identifies that around 4,000 people (based on the 2008 census) with disabilities in Ireland live in congregated settings, defined as a residential setting where people live with ten or more people.  It found that not withstanding the commitment and initiative of dedicated staff and management, a significant number of people were still experiencing institutional living conditions where they lacked basic privacy and dignity and lived their lives apart from any community and families.  The HSE has established a National Implementation Group on Congregated Settings under the auspices of the National Consultative Forum, which is comprised of representatives from the HSE, Disability Umbrella Groups and service user representative organisations.  This group is developing the implementation plan that will be rolled out at a regional and local level in full consultation with the appropriate stakeholders. <\/p><p>  The implementation of the report poses significant challenges to many stake holders, including clients, families, disability service providers, the HSE, various Departments, statutory bodies and representative organisations.  It will require a need for a major change programme.  This radical change is not the sole responsibility of the HSE but rather a collaborative responsibility shared between the person with a disability, their family and carers, a multiplicity of agencies, the Government and society as a whole.  To ensure the needs of people transitioning from congregated settings are fully taken into account during the process, the model of care for individuals will be based on a person-centred plan.  This may change over time in line with an individual's needs and circumstances and the model of service delivery applicable at a particular time.  The Report recognises a seven-year timeframe for the implementation of its recommendations.  However, this timeframe should be treated with caution as there are a number of complexities involved due to multidimensional elements of implementation including, individual choice of accommodation, living arrangements and location, funding, and the future role of staff, training and skill mix.<\/p><p>  The National Housing Strategy for People with Disability 2011-2016 provides for Government policy in relation to the deinstitutionalisation of people with physical, intellectual and mental health disabilities.  This Strategy forms part of a coherent framework, in conjunction with the Government's mental health policy, A Vision for Change and the Report of the HSE Working Group on Congregated Settings, to support people with disabilities within communities with maximum independence and choice.  As part of this process, some &euro;1 million has been transferred from the Health Vote to the Housing Vote to provide for the ring-fenced social housing costs of up to 150 people leaving disability or mental health institutions in 2013.  Those units will be additional to the overall social housing supports which are expected to be delivered through all supply mechanisms in 2013.

This policy constitutes a fundamental element in the Government&rsquo;s health reform programme.  There has been no change to the Government&rsquo;s over-arching commitment to this goal.  This Government is the first in the history of the State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population.  Having examined the progress made in the universal GP care plan, it became clear that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition is likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic for a short-term arrangement.  Relatively complex primary legislation would be required in order to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of their having a particular illness.  The assessment system for such an approach would have to be robust, objective and auditable in order to have the confidence of this House as well as the general public.  This legislation would have to address how a person could be certified as having such an illness, and who could do this, and how to select the diagnostic basis for medical conditions.  As well as primary legislation, there would be a need for secondary legislation to give full effect to this approach for each condition.  While it would not be impossible to achieve this, it would take several months more to finalise the primary legislation, followed then by the preparation of statutory instruments.  In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population. <\/p><p>  The Cabinet Committee on Health has discussed the issues relating to the delay in the initial step of the roll-out of the universal GP service.  In doing so, it has considered the importance of weighing the balance between, on the one hand, resolving the legal issues but with a further delay and, on the other hand, with the need to bring forward an important Programme for Government commitment with the minimum of further delay.  No decision has been taken by the Cabinet Committee or by Government on changing the first step of the plan to extend GP care without fees to persons with chronic illnesses.  Instead, it has been agreed that we should prepare and set out a number of alternative options with regard to the phased implementation of a universal GP service without fees.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, and I expect to report back to the Cabinet Committee in the near future.  As part of this work, consideration will be given to the approaches, timing and financial implications of the phased implementation this universal health service.  The Government has already made clear its commitment to delivering on the implementation of a GP service for the entire population by providing additional financial resources in the two most recent budgets.  The HSE Vote now contains funding of &euro;30 million for this year for an initial phase of the provision of GP services as part of this Programme for Government commitment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400058#WRC02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":125,"content":"<p>Question No. 117 answered with Question No. 102.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":126,"content":"<p>Question No. 118 answered with Question No. 83.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Issues","counter":127,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400058#WRC02750"},{"type":"question","counter":128,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[22573\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400058#WRC02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 679 of 16 October 2012, the number of the 150 posts promised for child and adolescent mental health services that are now in place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1047","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":129,"content":"<p>In 2012, a special allocation of &euro;35 million was provided for mental health to be used primarily to further strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both adult and children's mental health services, to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention, to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care and to facilitate the transfer of mental health service users from institutional to community based care.

The health services has already achieved significant progress in &ldquo;doing more with less&rdquo; and in providing various flexibilities in line with the Croke Park agreement to date. There has been a significant reduction in the cost base of the health services over the last few years, and yet the level of service has either been maintained or increased.  We are cutting the cost of services, not the services.  Even after the considerable reduction in the cost base over the last few years, further substantial cost extraction is required, with &euro;781m in savings to be achieved this year. Significant savings have been targeted in relation to the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.  A new agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association will provide savings in excess of &euro;400m over the next three years.  This will mean significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, as well as a reduction in the drugs bill to the State.  <\/p><p>  The level of health services to be delivered within the available funding is set out in the Service Plan. The Plan also sets out the measures required to fund unavoidable pressures and commitments made under the Programme for Government. Significant reductions in drug expenditures will be required and maximising the potential for pay savings under the Croke Park Agreement is critical in achieving the savings target.  Every budget holder must achieve the expenditure targets set at the start of the year, and in line with the National Service Plan, the Regional Service Plans were prepared in the context of the challenges faced by the health services in terms of reduced staffing levels, and a reduced budget, combined with increasing demand for services. <\/p><p>  My Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE are working collaboratively on the Financial Improvement Programme with a view to strengthening the Health Service Executive's financial and performance management and reporting systems during 2013. Notwithstanding this, there is ongoing and intensive engagement each month between officials from my Department and the HSE in the context of regular monitoring of expenditure. The HSE's Performance Report, which is published every month, provides an overall analysis of key performance data from Finance, HR, Hospital and Primary &amp;amp; Community Services. The activity data reported is based on Performance Activity and Key Performance Indicators outlined in the HSE National Service Plan.<\/p><p>  The position at the end of the first quarter is showing a &euro;27m deficit in income and expenditure terms.  When account is taken of timing issues around the phasing of budgets and the shortfall in retirees to date , there is a core deficit of &euro;11m. Projections to year end based on 1st Quarter data are being finalised by the HSE at present, in tandem with the detailed assessment of performance. The scale of the risk and challenge in achieving financial breakeven by year end remains significant as predicted in the NSP 2013. and will increase if there is an absence of continued and improved flexibility under the Croke Park Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400059#WRD00600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":138,"content":"<p>Question No. 122 answered with Question No. 116.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":139,"content":"<p>Question No. 123 answered with Question No. 97.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Neuro-Rehabilitation Services Provision","counter":140,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400059#WRD00688"},{"type":"question","counter":141,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[22580\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400059#WRD00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if funding will be provided for the neuro-rehabilitation plan published in 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":142,"content":"<p>The Department of Health and the Health Service Executive (HSE) have developed and published the \"National Policy and Strategy for the provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011 - 2015\".

The HSE is continuing to work with hospitals in preparation for the monitoring process against the National Standards which will be commenced by HIQA later this year. <\/p><p>  Effective service delivery requires processes to ensure that there will be sufficient staff available at the right time and with the right skills to deliver high-quality care.  The focus of health service management is on ensuring that all critical and essential services are protected and are provided in a safe manner.<\/p><p>  The Government has determined that, in line with its commitment to reduce the size of the public service, health sector employment numbers must be reduced substantially in 2013 and 2014.  Spending on health services will also have to be very tightly controlled. However, the HSE can make critical staff appointments when necessary.  <\/p><p>  The Public Service Agreement has been crucial to the health service&rsquo;s ability to manage through the very difficult circumstances of recent years.  The flexibility and adaptability shown by staff has meant that even with reducing staff numbers, service levels have largely been maintained and indeed performance in relation to Emergency Departments and hospital waiting lists has markedly improved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400059#WRD01800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres Provision","counter":158,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400059#WRD01850"},{"type":"question","counter":159,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[22556\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400059#WRD01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a progress report on the proposal to develop a primary care centre at Carrickmacross, County Monaghan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":160,"qnumday":629,"qnumall":"[22412\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400059#WRD02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 235 of 2 May 2013, if he will provide a progress report on the proposal to develop a primary care centre at Carrickmacross, County Monaghan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":161,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 629 together.<\/p><p>  The delivery of primary care infrastructure is a dynamic process and must take account of changing circumstances including the feasibility of implementing the delivery of the centres by means of lease, direct- build or PPP.

As with previous Budgets, the difficult financial position facing the Exchequer will obviously require very careful management across all areas of expenditure.<\/p><p>  There has been a significant reduction in the cost base of the health services over the last few years, and yet the level of service has either been maintained or increased.  We are cutting the cost of services, not the services.  This has been, and will continue to be, achieved through efficiencies and re-configuration under the existing Croke Park Agreement. Significant savings have been achieved to date in relation to the cost of pharmaceuticals and professional fees, thereby reducing the cost of the PCRS without affecting the clients.  The agreement reached with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) will provide savings in excess of &euro;400m over the next three years.  This will mean significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, as well as a reduction in the drugs bill to the State. <\/p><p>  The reductions in the cost base over the last number of years have largely been required to meet unavoidable pressures within the health system, along with Programme for Government commitments, for which no additional funding was available from the Central Exchequer.

Following detailed consideration of the project management and governance structures required to deliver the project as quickly as possible and to the highest quality, I intend to restructure the NPHDB so that its sole focus is on planning, designing, building and equipping the new hospital. I am currently considering the necessary appointments to the NPHDB to ensure that it has the expertise needed to deal with this very large and complex capital project. <\/p><p>  In the interim, senior  officials from my Department and the HSE were appointed to the NPHDB in January 2013. The priorities for this transitional Board has been on reconciling the brief with the new site, site preparation, close-out of existing contracts and new procurement processes.  A joint group involving the HSE and St James's Hospital are meeting regularly to progress the enabling and decant work required; a shared services group is in place focusing on identifying the facilities which can be shared so as to optimise the build; and a review of urgent care centre(s) configuration is underway and is expected to be complete within the coming weeks. The latter is key to finalising the scale of the facilities required on the St James's campus and informing the design. <\/p><p>  Work on developing a detailed project timeline is continuing, recognising the urgency and priority attached to the project, as well as its scale and complexity.  In the short-term, the contract notice for the procurement of a new design team is expected to be published in the coming weeks. The aim is to have the new design team in place as soon as possible, while complying in the tendering process with EU directives and national guidelines on procurement. The aim is to secure planning permission by December 2014.  <\/p><p>  In addition to a new building, the new children's hospital entails the coming together of three existing paediatric hospitals (Temple Street, Crumlin and Tallaght). An important step in this regard is the establishment of a Children's Hospital Group, involving the three hospitals.  The Group will have a non-statutory Board of Direction which will oversee the integration of services across the three hospitals. The Children's Hospital Group will also act as client for the capital project, and will lead on service transfer planning, human resource planning, philanthropy etc., functions which were previously within the remit of the NPHDB.  Dr Jim Browne has been appointed as its Chair, and will work closely with the Chairs of the three existing hospitals, who have welcomed his appointment. <\/p><p>  This project is of huge importance for the provision of acute paediatric services for all children in Ireland and is a priority for me and for this Government.

In the case of Community Nursing Units, these include challenges regarding staffing, funding and the age and structure of its units.   For 2013 the quantum and type of health services to be delivered within the available funding has been set out in the HSE National Service Plan. Minister Reilly approved and laid a copy of the Plan before both Houses of the Oireachtas earlier this year.<\/p><p><br \/>  If it becomes necessary for an older person to move to a nursing home, their safety and well-being is of paramount concern.  We have to ensure that the highest standards of care are provided to all residents in a safe and secure environment, and that we meet the needs of those who require our services in the very best way possible. I believe that patient safety and quality assurance in nursing homes is secured by setting quality standards, reinforced by Regulations that specify how the best services possible can be delivered in an effective and appropriate way. The National Quality Standards referred to by the Deputy apply to all nursing homes, both public and private.<\/p><p><br \/>  Recent capital investment has brought about a significant improvement in the standard of facilities across all care programmes including Services for Older People.<b><\/b>Between 2006 and 2012 approximately <b>&euro;508m<\/b> capital funding was invested in infrastructure, including CNUs, which supports the delivery of Services for Older People.  In order to comply on an on-going basis with regulatory requirements, the HSE is now concentrating on the refurbishment and upgrade of existing accommodation.  Accommodation which requires the least investment to comply with the regulatory requirements will be refurbished first. This will achieve the greatest number of compliant beds for the available funding.<\/p><p><br \/>  Any capital development must be considered in the context of the multi-annual HSE capital programme which is developed over a rolling five year period.  In drawing up its capital programme, the HSE is required to prioritise capital infrastructure within its overall capital funding allocation, taking into account the programme's capital commitments and costs of completion over the multi-annual period.

While the Framework focusses in particular on the role of nine smaller hospitals, including St Colmcille's,  which have been the subject of particular attention from the Health Information and Quality Authority, the principles behind it will apply to all smaller hospitals.  In developing the Framework, the Government is clear that (i) there is an important future role for smaller hospitals, in which they will provide services for more patients, not fewer; (ii) no acute hospital will close, and (iii) safety issues in all acute hospitals, large or small, must be fully addressed, by providing the right type of service, for the right patient in the right setting.

The development of the service will require additional resources for Beaumont and these plans will be progressed through the HSE 2014 Estimates Process. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400059#WRD03900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":191,"content":"<p>Question No. 142 answered with Question No. 113.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Promotion","counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400060#WRE00150"},{"type":"question","counter":194,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[21535\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400060#WRE00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"in view of the fact that the link between high sugary soft drink consumption and type-2 diabetes has been firmly established in both American and European studies, the steps he will take to highlight, educate and bring about a change in consumption habits; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1038","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":195,"content":"<p>The Minister is aware of the studies suggesting the link between high sugary soft drink consumption and type-2 diabetes.  For this reason he proposed a tax on Sugar Sweetened Drinks and undertook to have a Health Impact Assessment (HIA) on the potential effects of such a tax on the health of the Irish people, including those in disadvantaged circumstances.  The Working Group who oversaw the Health Impact Assessment were broadly of the view that there was evidence to suggest that Sugar Sweetened Drinks are associated with weight gain and that a Sugar Sweetened Drinks levy should not be seen as a revenue generating issue but rather a measure to change behaviour.  They agreed that if this tax were implemented there would be a need for good monitoring and evaluation.<\/p><p>  The Minister launched the Department of Health's revised Healthy Eating Guidelines in 2012 which are a tool to help inform the general public about the food and drink choices required for a healthy lifestyle and set out in plain and simple language the food servings the Irish population need to consume to maintain health and wellbeing.  These guidelines strictly limit high fat, high salt and high sugar foods and drinks from the Top Shelf of the Food Pyramid.  The Special Action Group on Obesity is currently considering measures to support the use of the Healthy Eating Guidelines.

Tax is charged, subject to certain exemptions and reliefs, on the amount inherited by the donee, the person receiving the inheritance. CAT is long established and forms part of the tax system.  Capital taxation is designed to apply a tax to the capital as distinct from the income of a person. The case for the taxation of capital rests mainly on considerations of equity and social justice. The object of the present system of capital taxation in Ireland, which consists of Capital Acquisitions Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Discretionary Trust Tax, Domicile Levy and now also Local Property Tax, is to ensure equity in the tax system and to reduce inequalities in the distribution of wealth.<\/p><p>  The taxation of capital raises substantial tax revenue for the exchequer and is also preferable from the point of view of its impact on the economy to an increase in employment taxes such as income tax.<\/p><p>  It is appropriate for CAT to be charged on an inheritance as provided for.

Notwithstanding the economic arguments in favour of liability, the group on balance did not favour creating a circular flow of payments.  However, the Government felt there could be issues of equity and proportionality in the differing treatment of privately owned properties and properties that are occupied by local authority tenants.  While reform of the local authority differential rents system would contribute to horizontal equity between local authority tenants and low income owners, anomalies could arise in cases where local authorities own and rent out a property in an otherwise privately owned housing estate.  The tenant in such a local authority property would not be subject to the LPT, but the owners of other properties would be subject to it.  The Deputy may be aware that the Household Charge was not payable in respect of houses owned by local authorities.  My intention in making local authorities liable for the payment of LPT was to address such anomalies.  Section 7 of the Act therefore provides that local authorities will be liable to pay the LPT on their properties in the same way as any other residential property owner, unless the properties in question are used to accommodate people with special housing needs such as the elderly or people with disabilities.

The transferee does not have a liability to capital gains tax in respect of the transfer. However, he or she might have a liability to gift tax in respect of the transfer. Any capital gains tax paid by the transferor in respect of the transfer is allowed as a credit against the gift tax payable, but the credit is clawed back where the asset is disposed of within 2 years of the gift.

Grouping properties into valuation bands, with the rate applying at the mid-point of the bands &ndash; in effect creating fixed sum and certain charges for each band &ndash; can ease the valuation challenges.  In devising the bands, a balance should be struck between the width of the bands and avoiding substantial liability differences between adjacent bands.  The wider the band, the easier it is to carry out a self-assessment, but very wide bands run the risk of creating inequities between taxpayers as well as compliance challenges.  The 2009 Commission on Taxation proposed five bands of &euro;150,000 width up to &euro;750,000; from &euro;750,000 to &euro;1 million; from &euro;1 million to &euro;1.5 million; and assessment on actual value over &euro;1.5 million. The Thornhill Group recommended the creation of a sufficient number of taxation bands to allow property owners to place their properties in an appropriate valuation band with reasonable confidence. Taking account of all aspects, the Thornhill Group recommended an initial band of &euro;0 to &euro;100,000; bands of &euro;50,000 in width for properties valued between &euro;100,001 and &euro;1,000,000; and no banding on properties over &euro;1 million with the tax liabilities determined on the self-assessed actual value.

The Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 puts the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the performance of their functions on a fully statutory basis. <\/p><p>  As I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, most recently in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 87 (20652\/13) and 92 (20686\/13) on 1 May, liable persons who have not yet received an LPT Return from Revenue must still self-assess the amount of LPT due, complete and file their LPT Return by the relevant deadline and pay the tax due.  In my previous replies I also indicated that the logistics of ensuring that the chosen payment option can be activated in good time for the July payment date determines the closing date for paper return filing of 7 May 2013.  The e-filing closing date of 28 May 2013 is the de facto extension.<\/p><p>  While the due date for filing paper Returns has now passed, a number of options are available to property owners for filing their Returns electronically by the 28 May filing deadline. Depending on the customer&rsquo;s requirements, one of the following options will address their particular needs.  For property owners for whom e-filing is not practical, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the legislation provides that another person may file an LPT Return online on their behalf.  A further option includes contacting the LPT helpline on 1890 200 255 (mobile phone users can contact the helpline on 01 702 3049) to file a Return online.  Where, due to recent publicity about the attempted mis-use of credit card details, a property owner does not wish to give their credit or debit card details over the phone, if they own a single property, they can file online through the LPT helpline and opt to make their payment through deduction at source from their salary, occupational pension or pension from the Department of Social Protection, by cheque or in cash to one of three service providers.  It should also be noted that the credit card holder will not be held liable where the card is used without their proper authorisation.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, property owners who either have no internet access or are unable to read or write can also visit their local Revenue office where computers and assistance to file online will be available.<\/p><p>  As to difficulties being experienced by people attempting to contact the LPT helpline at 1890 200 255, I am assured by Revenue that only a small number of access issues have been reported since the service commenced on 6 March in comparison to the very high volumes of satisfied callers.  Since commencement, the helpline has handled in excess of 300,000 calls, with peak days experiencing 15,000 &ndash; 20,000 calls.  Any difficulties that may have been experienced by some people were clearly as a result of the high volumes on particular days coming up to the 7 May deadline for paper filers.  In response to the demand, Revenue extended the opening hours of the helpdesk from 9am\/5pm to 8am\/8pm on weekdays and commenced Saturday opening from 9am to 5pm.  Extra operators were also deployed to ensure that the necessary resources were in place to deal with the very high volumes of calls.  Revenue will continue to monitor the situation and make whatever adjustments are necessary to ensure there is sufficient capacity on the helpline to meet demand up to the 28 May filing deadline.  Details of the LPT helpline&rsquo;s extended opening hours for the period prior to this deadline are already posted on the Revenue website.<\/p><p>  Given the range of options that have been made available by Revenue to assist people experiencing any difficulty in meeting their LPT obligations, and the fact that owners of residential properties have already filed in excess of 700,000 returns and utilised the different payment options, I am very satisfied with the current arrangements that Revenue has in place.  Therefore, I do not propose, nor is it practicable given the logistics involved, to extend the closing date or consider that any changes to Revenue&rsquo;s procedures are required in the run-up to the online LPT Return filing date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400061#WRF02400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Income Statistics","counter":289,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400061#WRF02450"},{"type":"question","counter":290,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[22231\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400061#WRF02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 73 of 2 May 2013, if he will set out the incomes and income tax distributions in a format matching the income bands in a table in the published reports he refers to in his reply and citing the table title, in order that a reliable comparison can be made with previous years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1178","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":291,"content":"<p>As requested by the deputy I have been provided by the Revenue Commissioners with reformatted tables of projected income levels and numbers of income earners for the income tax years 2011 and 2012 and these are as follows.

The register was developed using data drawn from a range of sources including Revenue's own databases, the Household Charge database from the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA), Non-Principal Private Residence Charge data, Private Residential Tenancies Board data, information from the Department of Social Protection, and data from utility companies.  As I previously indicated to the House, the Register was used to issue LPT correspondence to property owners.  I am advised that there are a number of possible reasons why property owners who registered for and paid the Household Charge did not receive a LPT Return.  These include:<\/p><p>- The version of the Household Charge database that was used to create the LPT Register was updated to January 2013.  Properties which were added to the database after this date would not have been provided to Revenue.  Revenue now has a more up-to-date version of the Household Charge database and will be using that to refresh the LPT Register in due course.<\/p><p>- The Household charge database included properties not liable for LPT - for example, bedsits - which were not added to the LPT Register.<\/p><p>- Where a property was identified as being in the ownership of a local authority or approved housing body, these were excluded from the general issue of LPT Returns to property owners.<\/p><p>- Returns were issued to the owner's address held on Revenue's system. In some cases this may have been different to the owner's address recorded on the Household Charge database.<\/p><p>- In some cases it was not possible to identify the relevant owner of the property from the Household Charge database.  For example, in some instances the charge on a property was paid using a payment card in a different name, in which case the data supplied to Revenue was the payer's name, not the owner's.<\/p><p><br \/>  Given the complexity of the process of developing the LPT Register from scratch through the matching of multiple data sources, it was always likely that in a small number of cases, people would either receive an LPT Return in error or, possibly not receive one at all.  I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners forewarned taxpayers about this.<\/p><p><br \/>  In particular, for those who had not received an LPT Return, Revenue has been highlighting in its extensive media campaign that as LPT is a self-assessed tax, in common with other self-assessed taxes certain responsibilities rest with the taxpayer even where they have not received a communication from Revenue.<\/p><p><br \/>  I have also re-enforced that point to the House on a number of occasions, most recently in my replies to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 87 (20652\/13) and 92 (20686\/13) on 1 May, that liable persons who have not yet received a Return from Revenue must still self-assess the amount of LPT due, complete and file their LPT Return, and pay the tax due.

I disagree that continuing problems are being faced by people in fairly valuing their properties.  Property owners have already filed in excess of 700,000 LPT Returns and have made their self-assessment of the valuation band in the course of filing these Returns.  I am satisfied that the arrangements are working very well and property owners are engaging fully with their LPT obligations.<\/p><p>  Based on the information provided by the Deputy in this question, it is not possible to provide a definitive reply to the issues raised.  However, the following will be of relevance.  <\/p><p>  As previously advised, the Revenue Commissioners have provided on their website and in their &ldquo;Guide to LPT&rdquo; a variety of sources to help property owners establish the market value for their residential property.  This includes the Residential Property Price Register as well as other property websites and information from local estate agents and newspapers.  Revenue&rsquo;s online interactive valuation guidance provides average indicative valuations for residential properties, based on the property type, age and location and uses data from the Residential Property Price Index (produced by the Central Statistics Office) to adjust for property price changes.  Given that property prices have broadly stabilised in recent months, any recent changes in values are small, therefore the Revenue valuation guidance offers a very good starting point to identifying current market prices for property owners.  <\/p><p>  I am further advised that the Residential Property Price Register provides sales prices for residential properties sold since 2010 and is updated regularly, to include more recent sales of properties.  The Property Price Register shows the date of sale and property owners can use this date to judge how useful a sale is in assisting them in valuing their residential property.  Clearly, the more recent the sales details, the better for the property owners in making their self-assessments.  In addition, for the purposes of LPT, properties under &euro;1 million are organised into valuation bands, with an initial band of &euro;0 to &euro;100,000 and 18 bands from &euro;100,001 to &euro;1 million with a range of &euro;50,000 in each band.  The first returns were filed in late March and, in the two-month period from then until the end of May, any change in property values in the context of the value band system is extremely unlikely to cause concerns for those early filers who made an honest and reasonable assessment of their property valuation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400062#WRG03400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBRC Liquidation","counter":374,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400062#WRG03450"},{"type":"question","counter":375,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[22704\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400062#WRG03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the cost to the taxpayer of the recent sale of the Quinn Building, Johnstown, Navan, to Meath County Council.","asker":"1080","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":376,"content":"<p>I have been advised by the Special Liquidators that the Quinn building was sold directly by the Quinn Group and is not pledged or held as security by IBRC.

Their &ldquo;Strategy on Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011-2013)&rdquo; includes a wide range of measures designed to identify and target those engaged in the supply or sale of illicit tobacco products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible.  This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, the development of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring optimum deployment of resources at both point of importation and within the country.   <\/p><p>  A key element of Revenue&rsquo;s work against the illicit trade within the country is targeted action in relation to markets, fairs and other locations where illicit products are known to be sold.  This includes high visibility patrols aimed at disrupting the sale or supply of illicit tobacco products at those locations.  In addition, covert surveillance and test purchasing are carried out to gather intelligence, with a view to identifying and prosecuting the suppliers and sellers of illicit products in the areas concerned.<\/p><p>  This ongoing work is complemented each year by a number of countrywide &ldquo;blitz&rdquo; operations, focused on particular aspects of the illicit trade.  Four operations of this kind were carried out during 2012, resulting in the seizure of 1.9 million cigarettes and over 1 tonne of tobacco, 17 vehicles were also seized in the course of those operations, and 2 arrests were made.<\/p><p>  There is extensive co-operation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating the illicit trade, and the relevant agencies in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market.<\/p><p>  Considerable success is being achieved against the selling of illicit cigarettes and other tobacco products. During 2012, there were 75 convictions, resulting in the imposition of 21 custodial sentences, some of which were suspended, and fines amounting to &euro;153,050.

The Inter-Departmental Expert Group on the Design of a Property Tax (the &ldquo;Thornhill Group&rdquo;) recommended against allowances for Stamp Duty because such allowances would not be targeted at need, and this recommendation was accepted by the Government.  The LPT legislation provides for a system of deferrals which is targeted at cases of need.  There is provision for deferral of LPT for income stressed households who are meeting high levels of mortgage interest.  Full details of the LPT deferral options can be found in the answer to Parliamentary Question No. 69 of 25 April (Reference No. 19631\/13) and on www.revenue.ie.<\/p><p>  This Government is committed to helping address the problems faced by those that bought homes at the height of the property boom between 2004 and 2008.  In this regard, in Budget 2012, I fulfilled the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the rate of mortgage interest relief to 30 per cent for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period.  Mortgage holders will qualify for the increased rate if they made their first mortgage interest payment in the period 2004 to 2008 or if they drew down their mortgage in that period.   The relief is available up to and including the tax year 2017 on the interest paid on qualifying home loans taken out between 1 January 2004 and before 1 January 2013.<\/p><p>  There are no specific exemptions from LPT for those whose properties are susceptible to flooding.  The LPT is a self-assessed tax and therefore it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  Issues such as a potential liability to flooding would be one of the factors that a property owner would take into account in valuing their property.

Appointments are made where it is deemed to be the most appropriate outcome for both the customer and the bank.  The appointment of a Receiver is currently pending on 29 BTL properties (14 accounts).  A forecast for 2013 is not advisable. <\/p><p>- A Receiver is appointed by the bank and operates as an agent of the borrower, assuming the role of property landlord in many respects.  The Receiver collects rent from the tenant(s) and passes it to the bank, together with attending to any property related issues the tenant may have (in accordance with the Lease Agreement).  The appointment of a Receiver should not negatively impact the tenant(s) as the Receiver effectively steps into the shoes of the landlord.  The appointment is more likely than not to benefit a tenant as maintenance issues\/concerns are more more likely to be attended to in a timely manner. <\/p><p><b>AIB<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  In the year to date 2013 the number of rent receivers appointed by AIB in respect of buy to let properties is in the low single digits.  The number of properties affected by these appointments is not tracked as rent receivers are appointed at a customer level rather than on a property basis.  Currently, AIB has no specific targets for the number of rent receivers expected to be appointed over the remainder of 2013.  The appointment of a rent receiver has no impact on the tenants. <\/p><p><b>BOI<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  In our 2012 Annual Report we disclosed a number of 1,100 rent receiver cases.  This included formal appointments in place and appointments pending at end December 2012.  We will give a market update on numbers at the time of release of our interims and cannot speculate for the remainder of 2013. <\/p><p>- The receiver notifies the tenant of their appointment and requirement to pay rent to the receiver.<\/p><p>- Any issues relating to the property, e.g. repairs will be dealt with by the receiver.<\/p><p>- The tenant is not required to leave the property unless the minimum notice period based on their rights as tenants has been provided.<\/p><p>- <i>The main impact on a tenant is that they pay their rent to the receiver and not to the landlord.

This is similar to the position for the Household Charge, which applied to a building (including a house, flat, maisonette, or apartment) which was occupied or suitable for occupation as a separate dwelling.   <\/p><p>  If a residential property is suitable for use as a dwelling but is unoccupied, it is still liable to LPT, which will be calculated based on the valuation of the property.  However, if the property is not suitable for use as a dwelling, it is not liable for LPT.  Where a property owner considers her\/his property is not suitable for use as a dwelling, s\/he is obliged to notify the Revenue Commissioners as soon as possible after receiving her\/his LPT Return.  The owner must also include relevant supporting documentation; for example, an engineer&rsquo;s report.  Based on the information provided by the property owner, Revenue will consider the claim and make a decision on the matter.<\/p><p>  Section 10(2) of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that a residential property shall be exempt from LPT where it is situated in an unfinished housing estate.  Section 10(1) of the Act defines an &ldquo;unfinished housing estate&rdquo; as a development of two or more buildings that is specified in a list prescribed under section 10(3) of the Act by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government for the purposes of the Act.  Section 10(4) of the Act prescribes a range of circumstances to which that Minister shall have regard for the purposes of that section.<\/p><p>  The Minister for the Environment Community and Local Government has prescribed and published this list, which is set out in the schedule to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013 and was compiled by local authorities utilising the categorisation employed for the purposes of the National Housing Survey 2012.  The Survey was carried out over the course of summer 2012 by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in conjunction with local authorities and the Housing Agency. <\/p><p>  The categorisation methodology for the survey was different to that which was used in 2011 and which provided the basis for the waiver from the Household Charge.  That earlier categorisation related largely to the level of on-site activity at the time the 2011 survey was carried out and had less to do with the physical character of a development.  The 2012 survey was based purely and objectively on the actual state of completion of a development.  Only developments that were deemed by local authorities to be in a &ldquo;seriously problematic condition&rdquo;, regardless of whether a developer was on or off site, were included.  <\/p><p>  For purposes of preparing the final list of developments to which the exemption from the LPT would apply, local authorities were asked by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to confirm or update the then existing list as appropriate.  I stress that the decision as to whether an estate is on the list of unfinished estates is in the ambit of local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and not in the ambit of the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p><p>  In addition to the above, section 10A of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 as amended provides for a temporary exemption of at least three consecutive years from the charge to Local Property Tax (LPT) for residential properties that have been certified as having &ldquo;significant pyritic damage&rdquo;.<\/p><p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Pyrite Exemption) Regulations 2013, which were signed earlier this month by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, set out the methodology for the assessment of dwellings to establish significant pyritic damage.  The Regulations require that homeowners demonstrate significant pyritic damage in accordance with the recently published standard by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, I.S. 398 &ndash; Reactive Pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1.  This standard provides guidance on the building condition assessment, as well as on the sampling and testing to be carried out to establish the presence of significant pyritic damage.<\/p><p>  To be eligible for an exemption from the LPT, a homeowner must obtain a certificate, from a competent person, confirming the presence of significant pyritic damage on the basis of a building condition assessment in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013 and having regard to the outcome of the testing and classification of the sub-floor hardcore material carried out in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013.  Eligibility for an exemption will be determined by reference to the presence of significant pyritic damage in the relevant property concerned.<\/p><p>  Conscious of the need to reduce costs to affected homeowners, the regulations provide for the use, where feasible, of the results from testing of the sub-floor hardcore undertaken prior to the publication of I.S. 398-1:2013, to classify the hardcore material if the testing that has already been carried out is in accordance with, or equivalent to, the test methods provided in I.S. 398-1:2013, and this has been validated as such by a competent person.<\/p><p>  A Building Condition Assessment in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013 will be required to be carried out by a competent person irrespective of when the testing is, or was, carried out.<\/p><p>  A homeowner cannot claim the exemption until the relevant certificate has been issued in respect of the residential property.  He or she should notify the Revenue Commissioners at that stage to claim the exemption.  Special arrangements will apply in respect of 2013 and 2014 to facilitate homeowners in claiming an exemption.  While homeowners who do not have the relevant certificate on the first liability date of 1 May 2013 (liability date for 2013), or by 1 November 2013 (liability date for 2014), will be required to pay LPT for those periods, they will be able to reclaim the tax paid if they obtain the certificate by 31 December 2013 and notify the Revenue Commissioners in writing on or before 31 January 2014.  As an alternative to such retrospective treatment they can opt to start the period of exemption from the liability date following the issue of the certificate.<\/p><p>  For those properties that are not exempt, LPT is a self-assessment tax so it is a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  The condition of the property would be one of the factors that a property owner would take into account in valuing her\/his property.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400063#WRH02200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":420,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400063#WRH02300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Redundancies","counter":419,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400063#WRH02250"},{"type":"question","counter":420,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[22168\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400063#WRH02300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if persons in the public service who are employed in more than one location are eligible for the enhanced redundancy payment in respect of one of their locations of work while continuing in the education system while working at another location; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":421,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[22170\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400063#WRH02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if teachers who have teaching hours in more than one location are eligible to obtain the enhanced redundancy package in respect of one of their locations while continuing to teach for other hours at a different location and still continue to work in the education system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":422,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 223 and 232 together.<\/p><p>  The collective agreement on enhanced redundancy payments to public servants provides that public servants who accept an ex-gratia redundancy payment will not be eligible for re-employment in the public service for a period of two years from termination of the employment.

Specifically, the service works in partnership with parents of pre-school children with hearing impairment, visiting their homes and\/or meeting them in groups to inform, advise and offer guidance in matters pertaining to their education and overall development and in helping their children to derive maximum benefit from the educational opportunities available.<\/p><p>  My Department, through the Higher Education Authority (HEA), has established and funds a Centre for Deaf Studies in Trinity College, Dublin which provides diploma courses for ISL\/English interpreters, deaf tutors and in deaf studies.  The course modules deal with issues such as sign linguistics, bi-lingualism and socio-linguistics of sign language.  The course is delivered in seminar sessions\/group work and the award of the diploma is based on continued assessment and a project and course design.<\/p><p>  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has published Policy Advice on the Education of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children in Ireland, which makes a number of recommendations for the improvement of educational provision for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children.  This policy advice is available on the NCSE's website www.ncse.ie.  My Department has established a working group which will consider and implement the recommendations of this report in accordance with available resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400064#WRJ02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"University Libraries","counter":497,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400064#WRJ02950"},{"type":"question","counter":498,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[22323\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400064#WRJ03000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding the use of university libraries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":499,"content":"<p>As I have indicated in responses to previous questions from the Deputy on this matter, universities are autonomous statutory bodies and the management and operation of their facilities are entirely the responsibility of the college authorities.

The core function of the redeployment panels at primary level is to enable the redeployment of teachers who are surplus in one school to another school that has a vacancy. Under the panel arrangements, the most junior eligible permanent teacher in a school with surplus teaching staff is placed on the panel for redeployment to another school.   Responsibility for running schools on a day-to-day basis is devolved from the patron to the board of management and this was statutorily underpinned by Section 14 of the Education Act 1998.<\/p><p>  Section 24 of the Education Act 1998 provides that the appointment, suspension and dismissal of teachers are the responsibility of boards of management.<\/p><p>  Under Circulars 59\/2009 (VEC schools) and 60\/2009 (all other schools) procedures were agreed relating to both professional competence issues and procedures relating to work, conduct and matters other than professional competence.

Only when the informal procedures are unsuccessful in addressing professional competence issues are the formal stages invoked which may at the end of the process have recourse to disciplinary action (up to and including dismissal).<\/p><p>  Matters of conduct follow a similarly staged procedure. However, in the cases of serious misconduct at work or a threat to health and safety to children or other personnel in the school the stages outlined above do not normally apply and a teacher may be dismissed without recourse to the previous stages.

There are no decisions or proposals on the table regarding cuts in child benefit.<\/p><p>  Research shows that high quality pre-school education delivers lasting benefits in terms of better academic attainment and socio-behavioural outcomes, particularly for children from minority groups and low-income families. The evidence is that it can help close the gap in social development and literacy and numeracy achievement between children from socially advantaged and disadvantaged backgrounds.<\/p><p>  Based on this, I declared my support in principle for an extension of the universal free pre-school year.

These inspectors have received specialist training in relation to management of risks and enforcement of relevant legislation at petrol stations, generally supplied by the UK Association for Petroleum and Explosives Administration (APEA) who run such courses for a range of stakeholders in the UK, including regulators, designers, local authority fire services, and petrol station operators etc.  A specialist bespoke training course in LPG installations at Forecourts was held in the HSA and attended by ADR inspectors in 2012.  ADR inspectors also attended a seminar last year organised by the Irish branch of the APEA, at which a range of Irish stakeholders, including Fire Officers, operators of petrol stations, etc., attended.<\/p><p><br \/>  As part of its on-going maintenance of technical expertise in this area, the HSA maintains a corporate membership of the APEA, which includes a supply of regular information bulletins and technical information relating to petroleum storage.  If the Deputy has any concerns regarding a particular station, or allegations of breaches of any of the workplace health and safety regulatory requirements by a station owner, he could bring them to the attention of the Health and Safety Authority through its Workplace Contact Unit in the first place (see , email  or Locall 1890 289 389) who will advise on appropriate follow-up action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRM00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights Issues","counter":659,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRM00450"},{"type":"question","counter":660,"qnumday":306,"qnumall":"[22224\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRM00500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the measures in place to ensure that parliamentary staff in the Houses of the Oireachtas enjoy the same protections from employment law as well as due process to prevent summary dismissal from Deputies.","asker":"954","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":661,"content":"<p>The Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007 apply to all employees, subject to the exceptions set out in section 2 of the 1977 Act (as amended).

The Acts protect employees from being unfairly dismissed by laying down criteria by which the fairness or otherwise of dismissals are judged.  The Acts also provide an adjudication system and then redress for an employee whose dismissal has been found to be unfair.  To qualify to take a case under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, an employee is normally expected to have at least one year's continuous service with the employer, with some exceptions.  Also, the Acts do not generally apply to the non-renewal of a a Fixed-Term contract which has reached the expiry date in the contract or do not apply to the non-renewal of a Specified-Purpose contract which has been completed in line with the contract, provided that this exclusion from the Acts is expressly stated in a written contract of employment.

Issues regarding childcare fall within the remit of my colleague Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  Issues regarding employment rights fall within my remit.  The term &quot;au-pair&quot; is not defined in Irish employment rights legislation.  A genuine au pair placement falls outside the scope of the employer-employee relationship.  I am aware that the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) has encountered individuals described as &quot;au pairs&quot; who have been found to be domestic employees and as such are fully protected by the State's employment rights legislation.  In these instances NERA investigates employers who are using the term &quot;au pair&quot; to avoid their statutory obligations under employment law.  Where the employment status of an individual is in question, the provisions of the &quot;Code of Practice Determining the Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals&quot; are used in order to determine the employment status of the relationship.  Ireland's body of employment rights legislation protects all employees legally employed on an employer-employee basis in Ireland.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment in another person's home, on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees.  Where a person has concerns that employees may be exploited or are receiving less than their statutory entitlement, the matter may be reported to NERA for investigation.

This means that there will be a standard State Pension age of 66 years for everyone from 1 January 2014.  The 2011 Act also provided for further changes in State pension age to come into force in 2021 and 2028 when the State pension age will be raised to 67 years and 68 years respectively.  With regard to retirement ages in employment, there is no statutory retirement age for employees in the private sector in Ireland.  A contract of employment will generally contain a retirement age but this is a matter of contract between the relevant parties.  The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has made rulings in a series of age-discrimination cases concerning Directive 2000\/78\/EC, which prohibit discrimination in employment and occupation on various grounds, including age.  The CJEU has clarified that mandatory retirement ages may be set down if, within the context of national law, they are objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate social policy aim.

The enterprise development agencies under the aegis of my Department are at the forefront of implementing the Action Plan for Jobs across all our regions, including the Longford\/Westmeath area.  Against this policy background, and as previously outlined to the Deputy in my reply to Question No. 292 on Tuesday 18 December 2012, I consider that it is not practicable or effective to establish jobs task forces, except in exceptional circumstances, having regard to the State's current limited resources.  In 2012, 1,557 people were employed on a full time basis in Enterprise Ireland (EI) client companies in Co. Longford (an increase of 46 from 2011) and 2,352 people were employed on a full time basis in EI client companies in Co. Westmeath (an increase of 171 from 2011).  In 2012, &euro;1.33 million was paid by EI to companies in Co. Longford and &euro;1.01 million was paid to companies in Westmeath for job creation and retention and business development purposes.  To date in 2013, EI has held\/launched: An Export Awareness Event in Athlone through its new Potential Exporters Division and a Call for Proposals under the Midlands Competitive Feasibility Fund.  Nine applicants &ndash; including one from Longford and four from Westmeath - were successful in winning funding and are currently progressing with their start-ups.  This new Fund provides funding of up to &euro;25,000 per project.  The 2013 New Frontiers Programme is currently underway.  14 start-up companies participated in the 2012 Programme receiving targeted financial support of &euro;15,000 per start-up.<\/p><p>  For IDA Ireland, the key sectors of focus for the midlands Region are Life Sciences, Information and Communications Technologies and High Value Services Activities.  The Region currently facilitates the presence of a large number of multinational companies who have invested over the years, span multiple sectors and employ significant amounts of people.  In addition to attracting new Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), IDA also works closely with its existing client companies with a view to getting them to upgrade and consolidate their existing businesses.  Longford and Westmeath County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) can, subject to certain eligibility criteria, also support individuals, firms and community groups employing less than ten people, provided that the proposed projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability.  In 2012, Longford CEB paid out over &euro;250,000 in grant assistance to 31 projects and 585 people participated in Longford CEB assisted training courses, while Westmeath CEB paid out over &euro;460,000 in grant assistance to 36 projects and 718 people participated in Westmeath CEB assisted training courses.<\/p><p>  An important action, in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 is the creation of a First-Stop-Shop at local level for the support of small and micro business will bring local enterprise support into an integrated national network of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) delivering enterprise policy to the highest standards, offering seamless progression for small business with potential to the existing national programmes run by EI, such as the dlands Competitive Feasibility Fund.  Pending the introduction of the LEOs, Longford and Westmeath CEBs will continue to support Enterprise Development in their areas and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development at county level.

The proposed National Step Change Initiative is intended to position Ireland's Manufacturing Sector for growth and will involve actions at both the level of the firm and also in terms of enhancing the wider business environment.  Specifically,  it is envisaged that work will be undertaken on enhancing productivity; strengthening the international reach of companies; strengthening innovative capabilities and developing connections (including enhancing sub-supply opportunities); and strengthening cross-sectoral collaboration.  A wide range of actions to drive this Step Change are recommended in the Strategy and these involve initiatives by the Development Agencies and other bodies.  Key Actions have been incorporated into the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs 2013, with specific timelines for delivery.  My Department will be to the fore in driving the actions and we will be assisted by the Manufacturing Development Forum, which provided valuable advice and insights into the development of the Strategy and which will continue to assist the process.  In relation to the medical devices industry, which has a thriving indigenous base, in addition to the multinational companies located here, I am very conscious that sub-supply opportunities in that sector represent a significant benefit to be pursued.  I would also like to record, that in addition to developing the Manufacturing Strategy, the Government have also initiated research on the specific skills needs of the Manufacturing Sector up to 2020, and this work was completed recently by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs and Forf&aacute;s.

The relief under Section 472A, known as the Revenue Job Assist scheme, allows qualifying employees, in addition to their normal tax credits, to claim certain income deductions, including additional deductions for qualifying children, for the three year period after taking up employment.  Section 88A provides an associated tax incentive for employers.  Employers may claim a double deduction in computing the profits of the trade or profession in respect of the first three years wages paid to qualifying employees.  This double deduction may also be claimed in respect of the employers PRSI contribution on such wages.  In order to qualify for the scheme, an individual must be unemployed for at least 12 continuous months prior to the date of commencement of the employment.  They must also be in receipt of certain payments from the Department of Social Protection or signing for PRSI credits.

This is in line with wider Government policies and objectives such as better public services, better and more effective ePayments and is aligned to the objectives of the National Payments Plan published by the Central Bank recently.  The progression to electronic payments is a critical element of the National Payments Plan which aims to reduce the very high levels of cash usage in the Irish economy, thereby contributing to improved national competitiveness.  All welfare customers paid through the post office network are paid in cash.  This is an inherently expensive means of paying customers.  This approach is inefficient, costly and imposes security risks on customers and staff alike who handle, distribute and receive these monies.  The Government needs to move to more modern approaches for distributing these vast sums of money to customers weekly.  The current contract with An Post expires at the end of 2013.  In this context, the Department is undertaking two public procurement competitions for the delivery of welfare payments and will provide for progression over time from cash to electronic payment methods.  The first procurement for over the counter cash services for social welfare customers commenced in December 2012 and is now well advanced.  This will replace the existing service contract with An Post and will ensure continuity in the delivery of cash payments to the Department's almost 1 million cash payment customers.  I anticipate a contract for these services will be signed by the summer and will provide similar services to customers to those they currently enjoy.  In addition, and to further support the migration towards electronic payments, the Department will be procuring an ePayment solution(s) to complement the existing facility to make payments directly into customers&rsquo; accounts in financial institutions. It is anticipated that notification regarding this procurement will issue by end June 2013.  Public sector contracts for the supply of products and services are generally subject to a competitive tendering process.  This ensures that the taxpayer receives value for money and ensures that all potential suppliers are given the opportunity to put forward the most efficient, effective and competitive solutions for consideration and evaluation.  The award of public sector contracts with a significant financial value is subject to various EU Directives.  Because of the financial value of this particular service, the Department was required to publicly invite tenders for the new contract to deliver social welfare payments when the current contract with An Post expires at the end of this year.<\/p><p>  I am conscious of the important role of the post offices around the country, notably the extent to which it is now a one-stop shop where people can pay bills, purchase mobile phone top ups, use the passport application facility, pay local property tax and carry out a range of banking and other financial services.  The Government has stated its commitment to maintaining the post office network in the Programme for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRM03600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights Issues","counter":707,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRM03650"},{"type":"question","counter":708,"qnumday":322,"qnumall":"[22636\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRM03700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"in view of the successful European Court case taken by former Waterford Crystal workers in respect of their pension rights, if she will ensure pension payments to these workers at the same level as their British counterparts 90%; if she will ensure that future pension payments are protected for workers in similar circumstances; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"960","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":709,"content":"<p>The ruling by the European Court of Justice was in response to a reference by the High Court seeking clarification of the interpretation of European law emanating from EU Directive 2008\/94EC on the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer.

It was for that reason that the Government last year adopted the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy with a view to giving greater public recognition to carers and their work.  <\/p><p>  Carers receive significant income supports from my Department so that people can continue living at home.  Expenditure on carers has increased significantly in recent years.  In 2013 it is estimated to be &euro;776 million compared with an estimated outturn of &euro;771 million in 2012.  The expenditure on carers in 2012 included: &euro;509 million on carer&rsquo;s allowance; &euro;24 million on carer&rsquo;s benefit; &euro;135 million on the respite care grant and; &euro;103 million on domiciliary care allowance. <\/p><p>  Carers also receive a free travel pass at an annual cost of &euro;6 million and carers who reside with the care recipient are eligible for the household benefits package at an annual cost of approximately &euro;30 million.  The revised rate of the respite care grant of &euro;1,375 will still be more than what it was in 2006 when the rate was &euro;1,200.<\/p><p>  The respite care grant is paid to more than 70,000 people each year, with some 5,000 people in receipt of more than one grant as they care for more than one person.  Almost 54,000 people are in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance and 27,000 in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  There are also 1,700 in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit.  Some 5,000 carers not in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s payment also receive the grant.  <\/p><p>  The supports to carers from my Department are among the highest rates of income support in Europe. A person getting certain qualifying payments and also providing full-time care and attention to another person can keep their main social welfare payment and receive a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance as well. The half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance was protected in Budget 2013.  <\/p><p>  The respite care grant is available to all full-time carers regardless of their means while the income disregard and means test for carers allowance is the most generous in the social welfare system. A couple under 66 with two children, earning a joint annual income of  up to &euro;35,400 can qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance while a couple earning &euro;59,300 will still qualify for the minimum rate.

To illustrate this, in 2011, social transfers reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children from 51 per cent to 16 per cent; this is amongst the best performance of all member states in the EU. <\/p><p>  The assessment finds that households with children lost around 1 per cent of disposable income, slightly more than the average loss of 0.8 per cent.  This reflected the reduction in child income supports (child benefit and back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance) and the impact of the reduction of the earnings threshold for recipients of the One Parent Family Payment (OFP) from &euro;130 per week to &euro;110 per week (which was announced in a previous Budget).<\/p><p>  However, the analysis did not, for technical reasons, take into account the additional &euro;20.75 million which was provided for services for low income children, including an Area Based Approach to Child Poverty, school meals and after-school child care.  <\/p><p>  In this regard, Budget 2013 contained a measure to provide 6,000 additional after-school child care places to people who have been long-term unemployed or were former recipients of OFP and who have received a job offer or significantly increased their part-time hours. The provision of good quality, affordable child care is one of the most important ways in which we help people get back to work.  In the first phase, up to 500 child care places are being made available in seven local offices: Tralee, Mullingar, Dundalk, Cork City, Finglas, King&rsquo;s Inn and Limerick City (Dominic Street).  <\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s priority in Budget 2013 was to maintain the basic weekly rates of social welfare income support payments including the personal weekly rate OFP and this was achieved.  In addition, there were no changes to the family income supplement, fuel allowance and the level of weekly increase payable for qualified children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRO00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":791,"content":"<p>Question No. 354 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Appeals","counter":792,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRO00950"},{"type":"question","counter":793,"qnumday":355,"qnumall":"[22695\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRO01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding a domiciliary care allowance appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork.","asker":"993","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":794,"content":"<p>An application for domiciliary care allowance was received from the person concerned on the 21st September 2012.

The corresponding allocation to the Citizens Information Board in 2012 was &euro;46.8 million of which some &euro;18.3 million was allocated to MABS and &euro;14.6 million for the Citizens Information Services.<\/p><p>  The Citizens Information Board is responsible for ensuring that all appropriate governance arrangements are in place in relation to the expenditure of these public funds.  It is essential that this significant amount of public monies is carefully monitored and properly accounted for, in terms of financial accountability, effective performance and excellent delivery of quality services to the customer and taxpayer, who ultimately funds these services. The Board is responsible for ensuring that all appropriate governance arrangements are in place in relation to the expenditure of these public funds.<\/p><p>  An important element of assessing accountability is through the formal arrangement of Service Level Agreements. These are annual contracts between the CIB and the 96 separate companies, which provide the services for which the Citizens information Board has responsibility, including the 42 local Citizens Information Services and the 53 MABS companies.  These contracts are agreed by the governing board of the Citizens Information Board and cover standard items such as service delivery, governance, financial controls, HR practices, reporting, evaluation, monitoring etc. This enables the Board to ensure that excellent service and best value is achieved across the wide range of services it provides.<\/p><p>  With regard to the 2013 Agreement the CIB met with the representative forums of MABS and CIS to discuss issues raised. To date, some 40 CIS companies and 19 MABS companies have signed the contract and are fully compliant with the governance and accountability requirements. <\/p><p>  The Citizens Information Board is engaging with the remaining companies to resolve outstanding matters and following consultation with the MABS and CIS network is bringing forward a longer term contract to govern the period to end 2016.  I am confident this will secure the agreement of all and would like to assure the Deputy that there is no risk to service delivery and all parties are fully engaged in ensuring that the excellent service to those most in need continues as required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRO02600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":817,"content":"<p>Question No. 364 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":818,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRO02750"},{"type":"question","counter":819,"qnumday":365,"qnumall":"[22881\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRO02800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the individual amount of overtime paid in the case of each political\/Ministerial appointee for the period 2007 to date in 2013 relative to her office and the office of the Minister of State; if such payments were made to the Secretary General and advisors, and if so, the amounts for the same period.","asker":"965","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":820,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the individual amount of overtime paid in the case of each political\/Ministerial appointee for the period 2007 to date in 2013 relative to my Department, is set out in tabular statement below.<\/p><p>No overtime has been paid to the Special Advisers or the Secretary Generals within the Department of Social Protection during the period 2007 to date in 2013 as these posts are not overtime grades.<\/p><p>All overtime, travel and subsistence payments are subject to the general regulations governing the payment of overtime, travel and subsistence.<\/p><p><b>MINISTER JOAN BURTON,T.D.

The estimated expenditure on child benefit in 2013 is around &euro;1.9 billion and it is currently paid to around 611,000 families in respect of some 1.16 million children. <\/p><p>  The Government is conscious that child benefit, as a universal payment, can be an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment. The social protection system also provides assistance to low income families with children through the payment of qualified child increases on primary social welfare payments and through the family income supplement payment. Both of these provide a level of assistance which is directly or indirectly linked with a household&rsquo;s income situation.<\/p><p>  Achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including child benefit, raises complex issues about the effectiveness and the efficiency of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes can be achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and its report on this issue was published in February.<\/p><p>  This report makes important recommendations on how child benefit could be maintained as a universal payment while reforming the current system of child and family income supports so as to better target those who need these supports most. Given the range of complex issues involved, including fiscal, operational and legal considerations, as well as the implications for reforms in terms of child poverty and employment incentive outcomes, the Government has made no decision at this time on the core recommendations of the report.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that the report will now contribute to the policy debate on the matter. In considering the proposals to reform the structure of child and family income support payments, including the balance between income supports and services, such as childcare, I expect that Government will also take into account further work by the Advisory Group on the issue of social protection and taxation supports for working age persons and more general developments in the budgetary and fiscal situation. <\/p><p>  The provision of childcare services, such as those supported by the Early Childhood Care and Education scheme, is primarily a policy matter for my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Frances Fitzgerald T.D.  However, any proposal to fund additional childcare services from cuts to the child benefit scheme would require a Government decision within an overall budgetary context on which no indications can be given at the present time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRP01200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":856,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRP01300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme Relocation Options","counter":855,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRP01250"},{"type":"question","counter":856,"qnumday":379,"qnumall":"[22167\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRP01300","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"when persons with turbary rights on a bog (details supplied) in County Laois will be granted rights at an alternative location; the number of persons who are still waiting for this matter to be resolved in this area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":857,"content":"<p>55 applications for compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme have been received and acknowledged by my Department in respect of the raised bog special area of conservation referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question. 10 of these applicants have expressed an interest in relocation to a non-designated bog. 40 payments and 5 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of the applications received. <\/p><p>  Bord na M&oacute;na undertook a preliminary assessment of a potential relocation site for those applicants who have expressed an interest in relocation, on behalf of my Department.

Expert scientific advice available showed that the marine survival of salmon in the North Atlantic has decreased significantly in the previous decades.  It was in this context and to afford every protection to the remaining stocks that the decision to cease indiscriminate mixed stock fishing was taken.  <\/p><p>  In 2007, I understand that a Salmon Hardship Scheme of &euro;25m was established to address any hardship experienced by affected commercial salmon licence holders.  In addition, I also understand that a further &euro;5m was allocated to a Community Support Scheme which was directed primarily at those communities where commercial salmon fishing had been a well-established activity and where its withdrawal demonstrably impacted on the economic and social fabric.  <\/p><p>  On foot of the decision to prioritise conservation the harvest of salmon by any means is restricted to those individual stocks of rivers that are judged by the scientific advice as meeting their conservation limits.  Commercial fishing and recreational angling can continue only where there is a scientifically identified exploitable surplus within the genetically discrete stock in each individual river.  Overall the estimate of total Irish spawning salmon over the past decade is only 52% of that in the 1970&rsquo;s.<\/p><p>  In this regard, and in the mixed stock context pertaining as stocks migrate during the at sea phase of their life-cycle, it is not possible to identify the discrete stocks of salmon emanating from individual rivers which are above their conservation limit.  Such mixed stock fishing activity would be irresponsible in that the possibility of disaggregating those genetically individual river stocks (including stocks from other countries) within a large mixed migratory body of fish is impossible.  To permit targeting of such mixed stocks would expose vulnerable individual river stocks, which are not meeting conservation limits, to indiscriminate and unsustainable harvesting.

This is equivalent to 31,925 Gigawatt hours (GWh) or a reduction in annual CO2 emissions of around 7.7 Mega tonnes (Mt).  Recognising that Government must lead by example, we are committed to achieving a 33% reduction in public sector energy use by 2020.  <\/p><p>  The second Action Plan follows a similar approach to its predecessor, identifying realisable but ambitious actions across six areas: Public Sector, Residential, Business, Transport, Energy Supply, and Cross-Sectoral.  The Plan contains 97 actions, each of which will play a part in securing a more sustainable energy future for Ireland.  Of the 97 actions, the following five will play an integral role in the delivery of the national target:  <\/p><p>  1. In the Public sector, we will introduce a series of obligations on public sector bodies to address consumption, procurement and reporting of energy use.  <\/p><p>  As part of our Action Plan for Jobs commitments, we will issue in June this year a mandate to public sector organisations with an annual energy spend of &euro;500,000 or more, to go to the market to identify solutions for the delivery of energy reduction services.  In 2010-2011 the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and my Department developed and launched a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system to record each individual public body&rsquo;s progress towards the 33% target.  A database of over 30,000 meters has been established to enable the accurate gathering of public sector data.  This database is being developed with linkages to the National Procurement service and will lead to better procurement of energy supplies for the public sector.  A report on public sector consumption will be published later this year.  <\/p><p>  2. We will institute a national Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) process to deliver innovative models of retrofitting and financing of energy efficiency measures in the commercial and public sectors.  <\/p><p>  Work on the National Energy Performance Contracting Policy Framework, which will standardise energy performance contracting in Ireland and provide a robust process for establishing investment-ready projects, is well advanced and the first version of the Framework will be published shortly.  The Framework will be underpinned by an Energy Efficiency Fund, to which Government has already committed &euro;35 million in the 2013 Budget as seed capital. <\/p><p>  3. We will introduce an appropriate Pay-As-You-Save (PAYS) model for Ireland to replace existing exchequer supports for domestic and non-domestic energy efficiency upgrade measures.<\/p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to roll out a Better Energy Financing (formerly known as Pay-As-You-Save) energy retrofit scheme for domestic buildings after 2013.  The Better Energy Financing (BEF) model proposes that the current suite of Exchequer funded grants for energy efficiency measures, excluding the low-income housing retrofit programme, will be replaced by a new financing scheme open to the residential and non-residential sectors.  This scheme will allow consumers to secure upfront financing for energy efficiency upgrades, the repayment of which will be funded from savings on their energy bill generated from the retrofit.<\/p><p>  My Department has put in place a project team to design a replacement retrofit financing scheme under the direction of a Project Board representing key state and industry stakeholders.  Project resources have been drawn from industry experts and elsewhere in the public sector.  It is planned that the design of the scheme will be developed over the coming months and that a public consultation process will be undertaken later this year.  <\/p><p>  4. The Better Energy programme will deliver energy efficiency improvements across a number of sectors including energy saving targets for energy suppliers.  <\/p><p>  The NEEAP emphasises the role of market actors in facilitating the delivery of energy savings, with the introduction of energy saving targets for energy suppliers a key measure underpinning the delivery of the 2020 energy saving target.  A move to a market-based programme is a logical step in mainstreaming energy efficiency within the energy supply sector in line with EU ambitions.  <\/p><p>  To date 18 energy supply companies have signed voluntary energy savings agreements, with a programmatic target of 875GWh for the period 2011-2013.  I am currently considering proposals for the period beyond 2013.<\/p><p>  5. A Cross-Departmental Implementation Group will soon be established to ensure that all the actions contained in this Plan are delivered.  <\/p><p>  The Implementation Group, chaired by my Department, has been established and is meeting quarterly to ensure delivery of the actions contained in the NEEAP.  It comprises representatives from a number of key stakeholders who are responsible for leading or supporting the progression of key sectoral actions in pursuit of our NEEAP goals.  The Implementation Group will report to Government regularly on progress.  <\/p><p>  Should all measures detailed in the plan reach their full potential by 2020 it is estimated that a potential reduction in energy spend across all sectors of approximately &euro;2.36 billion (at 2011 prices) will be realised.  A very significant element of this will be Exchequer savings in the public sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRQ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Issues","counter":912,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRQ01050"},{"type":"question","counter":913,"qnumday":400,"qnumall":"[22349\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRQ01100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will outline the way he is supporting the Digital Hub Development Agency and the National Digital Research Centre; the potential for these services to create jobs in the digital enterprise sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1064","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":914,"content":"<p>The Digital Hub currently supports approximately 64 companies which between them employ over 805 people, making a significant contribution to job creation.

Ireland&rsquo;s priority is the safety of the Irish people and the protection of our environment, including the shared marine environment of the Irish Sea. <\/p><p>  The UK published its draft Energy National Policy Statement in November 2009, which signalled its intention to construct ten new nuclear power stations at sites judged as potentially suitable. This was subsequently revised in October 2010 when the number of planned stations was reduced to eight, following the dropping of two sites originally proposed for Cumbria, near the existing Sellafield facility.  Since the original announcement in 2009, Ireland has written twice at ministerial level to the UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change outlining concerns about potential environmental impacts in Ireland and in the Irish Sea. The key issues of concern include the assessments by the UK of effects on the environment, management of radioactive waste, and the rationale underpinning the proposed justification decision for new nuclear facilities. This engagement at ministerial level has been supported and informed by a continuing dialogue at official level where Irish officials engage, and raise concerns where appropriate, with UK counterparts directly engaged in the development and implementation of the plans. <\/p><p>  I note the legal proceedings being brought by An Taisce in relation to Hinkley Point and I respect the rights of An Taisce, as an independent body, to take such a course of action.

No. 326 of 2012), which were given effect following a public consultation process, provide for a ban on the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of bituminous (or &quot;smoky&quot;) fuel inside specified ban areas.  The Regulations introduced some improved and updated provisions that will help to ensure that the smoky coal ban remains fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of residential fuels.\u00a0 These are as follows:   <\/p><p>- most existing smoky coal ban area boundaries were revised to take recent urban development into account;<\/p><p>- seven new\u00a0towns were added to the ban from May 2013 - Greystones, Letterkenny, Mullingar, Navan, Newbridge, Portlaoise and Wicklow Town; and<\/p><p>- a prohibition on the burning of bituminous fuel to complement the established ban on marketing, sale and distribution.\u00a0<\/p><p><br \/>  The single focus of the previous regulations on prohibiting the sale, as distinct from the burning, of &quot;smoky&quot; coal meant that the burning of such coal inside ban areas undermined the intent and purpose of the ban and the supply of such fuel was known to be facilitated by businesses that had established premises just outside ban area boundaries to serve ban area residents as their main market.  The revised boundaries and prohibition on the burning of smoky coal inside ban areas support the effectiveness of the ban in the areas concerned by restricting such activities and hence closing the loophole.  These updated provisions were broadly welcomed by the EPA, local authorities and the import and supply industry, on the basis that they provide for more effective legislation.  My Department continues to meet regularly with the EPA, local authorities and the industry representatives to discuss the ongoing implementation and enforcement of the Regulations.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the case of new towns that were added to the ban, a lead-in period of eight months was provided to allow local authorities and fuel retailers time to adapt as necessary to the new regulatory requirements in preparation for the switch-over to smokeless fuels.  Following the inclusion of these areas, the smoky coal ban applies in all towns with a population greater than 15,000 people.  This provides for greater consistency in urban air quality standards throughout the State by extending the cleaner air benefits of the ban to all large towns.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Regulations also require that all smoky coal sold outside ban areas for residential use outside those areas must have a sulphur content of no more than 0.7%.\u00a0 This compares to a maximum permitted sulphur content of 2% for bituminous coal sold in Northern Ireland. <font color=\"#333333\"> &amp;#8206;<\/font>Coal bagging operators and certain solid fuel suppliers trading in smoky coal must demonstrate the compliance of their product with the 0.7% sulphur limit and be registered with the EPA.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland has prepared an annual traceability audit system, known as SWiFT 7, for demonstrating compliance.  All retailers who trade in smoky coal must ensure that their suppliers are registered with the EPA and must hold a record to this effect with their supplier's registration number. <\/p><p><br \/>  Despite these regulatory improvements, I recognise that different standards applying to coal between separate jurisdictions presents a continuing challenge for enforcement.

Where any borrower, either from a local authority or from a private financial institution, is facing difficulties in meeting mortgage repayments, they should engage proactively and constructively with the lender to seek to achieve an agreed solution.  The services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service are also available to such borrowers and support is available through the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme.<\/p><p>Local authorities have long been the lenders of last resort servicing the housing loans needs of less affluent members of society.  In the present economic circumstances it is to be anticipated that the ability of some borrowers to service housing loans may become restricted and that a number of loans may fall into arrears.  Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers, and they have demonstrated sensitivity over the years in dealing with such cases.  In March 2010 my Department issued guidelines to local authorities, based upon the Central Bank's first Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, which continued the tradition of handling arrears in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.<br \/>  To reflect the content of the Central Bank's revised Code of Conduct &ndash; which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt &ndash; my Department issued updated guidance in June 2012 to local authorities in consultation with the County and City Managers Association.  This will further enable local authorities to provide a range of flexible repayment options for households in difficulty.  In particular, the introduction of a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which closely mirrors the suite of options available in the commercial sector, presents borrowers in difficulty with a range of alternative payment agreements, including those referred to in the Question, which can be accessed to ease the particular circumstances of each case.  This process features a standard set of options including, in cases of certain unsustainable mortgages, the facility of mortgage-to-rent.  Local authorities have been restructuring loans for some time using their own internal practices. The introduction of these revised guidelines standardises the approach across the whole sector, introduces a systematic structure to this area and provides borrowers with a transparent and accessible model for arrears resolution.<\/p><p>Regarding the level of repossessions in the last three years, my Department publishes a wide range of housing statistics which can be found at <i>www.environ.ie.<\/i>  The total numbers of forced and voluntary repossessions obtained by local authorities in 2010, 2011 and 2012 are set out in the following table.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Forced<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>54<\/td><td>73<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Voluntary<\/td><td>73<\/td><td>49<\/td><td>64<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRS02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":1079,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRS02900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Status","counter":1078,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRS02850"},{"type":"question","counter":1079,"qnumday":457,"qnumall":"[22151\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRS02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the opportunities for appeal or reconsideration of an application, either within his Department or through the courts, that exist for a person (details supplied) who has been issued with a deportation order; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1045","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1080,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned arrived in the State on 8th November 2003 as a short-term visitor.

For example, the security initiatives undertaken by the Operational Security Group (OSG)  have made it more difficult for prisoners to engage in illegal activities while in prison.  These initiatives include the introduction of passive and active drug detection dogs and the installation of airport style security including scanners and x-ray machines.

To support the achievement of these aims, the Act provides for the establishment of an independent Charities Regulatory Authority.<\/p><p>  I am aware of the recent Prime Time programme which reported, amongst other things, on the issue of theft from charity clothing banks.  Theft is an offence contrary to section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.  A person convicted upon indictment of theft is liable to imprisonment for up to 10 years and\/or an unlimited fine.<\/p><p>  I am also concerned about the reported practice of some collectors of clothing who convey the impression in their promotional literature that they are collecting on behalf of a charity, when this may not actually be the case.  This may lead some people to donate to such collections in the belief that they are supporting a charity and helping to alleviate hardship. This is unfair both to donors whose intention in donating such items is to help those in need, and to bona fide charities that may lose out on donations as a result. It is an offence under section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001 to make gain or cause loss to others by deception.<\/p><p>  In addition to these existing measures under the Criminal Justice Acts, while the Charities Act 2009 does not deal directly with the regulation of Irish charity clothing banks or collections, it does contain measures aimed at preventing the abuse of charitable status. Under section 46 of the Charities Act, it is an offence for an organisation that is not a registered charity to describe itself or its activities in such terms as would cause members of the public to reasonably believe that it is a charitable organisation. This section cannot be commenced until the statutory Register of Charities, also provided for under the Charities Act, is in place.<\/p><p>  While further implementation of the Charities Act and creation of the Register of Charities have been delayed for financial reasons, the Government remains committed to progressing the implementation of the Act and putting in place a dedicated regulatory framework for charities in line with the provisions of the Act. My Department has been examining how best this can be done in the current financial climate.  As part of this work, my Department recently undertook a consultation on key issues, including the creation of the Register of Charities. The submissions received are currently being reviewed and I look forward to publishing the results in due course and giving a further indication of the Government's timeframe for the introduction of an operational Charities Regulatory Authority and full implementation of the Charities Act 2009.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRT03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Remuneration","counter":1150,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRT03550"},{"type":"question","counter":1151,"qnumday":482,"qnumall":"[22793\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRT03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of personnel in whole-time equivalent terms in his Department and in bodies under the aegis of his Department in each of the following earnings brackets: less than &euro;20,000, &euro;20,001 to &euro;30,000, &euro;30,001 to &euro;40,000, &euro;40,001 to &euro;50,000, &euro;50,001 to &euro;60,000, &euro;60,001 to &euro;70,000, &euro;70,001 to &euro;80,000, &euro;80,001 to &euro;90,000, &euro;90,001 to &euro;100,000, &euro;100,000 to &euro;125,000, &euro;125,001 to &euro;150,000, &euro;150,001 to &euro;175,000, &euro;175,001 to &euro;200,000, &euro;200,001 to &euro;250,000, &euro;250,001 to &euro;300,000, &euro;300,001 to &euro;350,000, &euro;350,001 to &euro;400,000, &euro;400,001 to &euro;450,000, &euro;450,001 to &euro;500,000, and more than &euro;500,000.","asker":"1178","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1152,"content":"<p>The information sought by the Deputy in respect of staff of my Department and agencies under its aegis is set out in the following table.

The evidence in relation to mixed fisheries across western waters indicates a consistently high level of discards and presents a significant problem for all EU Member States  involved in fishing EU waters.<\/p><p>  Finding practical and implementable solutions to the wasteful practice of discarding fish is a major component of the current reform proposals for the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).

I have prioritised securing final agreement between the EU Fisheries Council and the Parliament on reform of the CFP throughout the Irish EU Presidency and we are making considerable progress in this regard.

This was the first publication of its kind and placed Ireland firmly to the fore in the debate on eliminating discards and assisted in advancing the case for a phased elimination of discards as part of the CFP reform package.

The package of measures expect to provide a modernised and simplified, more risked-based approach to the protection of health and more efficient control mechanisms to ensure the effective application of the rules guiding the operation of the food chain.<\/p><p>  As it stands, the current body of EU legislation covering the food chain consists of almost 70 separate pieces of legislation. The package of reform proposes to reduce this down to 5 pieces of legislation. These are: Plant Health, Animal Health, Plant Reproductive Material, Official Controls and Financing Regulations. It is anticipated that the new streamlined legislation proposals would reduce the red-tape on processes and procedures for farmers, breeders and food business operators to make it easier for them to carry on business.<\/p><p>  The regulation proposed for the commercial plant and seed sector differs very little from those rules already in operation, apart from the introduction of a more streamlined certification process. Importantly though, the regulation proposes to reduce the administrative burden on micro-enterprises, such as small seed processors who would be exempted by-and-large from all mandatory registration and control charges. Private gardeners and amateur growers would not be affected by these proposed regulations and would be able to continue to exchange seed as before.<\/p><p>  It is anticipated that the new regime will not be in place before 2016.

The store lamb trade failed to take off in Autumn 2012, largely driven by a poor pasture conditions (limited grass, forage) and lack of confidence on the part of store lamb finishers who were reluctant to buy expensive feed. Demand within the traditional markets for light lamb (Portugal and indirectly Spain) has also been poor over the last two years due to the economic downturn in these regions. Indeed total imports of sheep meat into Portugal and Spain have fallen by 26% and 42% respectively.<\/p><p>  Bearing in mind the difficulties in recent times with these two outlets, the industry and Bord Bia are exploring additional new markets for light lambs for 2013.  These markets include France and the UK, which are the core export markets for Irish lamb, and Sweden, Belgium and Germany, which have been delivering positive growth over the last 2-3 years.  However it must be recognised that light lambs (&amp;lt;13kg) are generally not favoured by consumers in these regions and it is likely that lambs will need to be finished up to a weight of 17kg+.   I understand that Bord Bia has been discussing with the industry on how this could best be done, for example overwinter the lambs and dispose of them in the following Spring. <\/p><p>  Research can also be used to assist light lamb producers to bring the carcass to an acceptable weight specification. The Teagasc BETTER farm programme has a number of hill farms around the country. The aim of this programme is to establish focal points for the on-farm implementation, development and evaluation of technology that is relevant to hill sheep farmers. Close collaboration between Teagasc Researchers &amp;amp; Advisers with these farms aims to help improve profitability of hill sheep production.<\/p><p>  The recently launched Sheep Technology Adoption Programme (STAP) contains a measure designed to help improve the weight, quality and thus price of hill lambs.<\/p><p>  My Department is providing significant funding to Sheep Ireland to help deliver on the significant profit potential that breed improvement can deliver.

A general co-financing rate of 53% is proposed but this rate may rise to a maximum of 80% for measures such as farm and business development, co-operation activities, Leader projects, and other measures. Environmental type measures may be co-funded up to 75%. The exchequer funding percentage that will be required to draw down the available EU funding will depend firstly on the types of measures that will be included in the Programme and secondly on the co-financing rate that is agreed with the EU Commission for these measures. <\/p><p>  As regards the minimum spend for certain measures, the proposal provides that at least 5% EAFRD funding must be reserved for Leader while the Common Provisions Regulation provides that 7% of EAFRD funding must be allocated under a national performance reserve.

The EU Sugar Regime underwent a radical reform in 2005 following major EU decisions to restructure the industry. A temporary restructuring scheme was introduced with the aim of reducing EU sugar production. Greencore, the holder of the entire Irish sugar quota, availed of this voluntary scheme, dismantled its facilities and ceased production in 2006. Ireland secured &euro;353million as part of the reform package of which &euro;220million went to beet growers, &euro;127million to Greencore and &euro;6million to machinery contractors.<\/p><p><br \/>  Post reform, production in the EU is now concentrated in 18 Member States. The present regime runs from 1 September 2006 to the 30 September 2015. There is no mechanism under the present EU Regulations which would allow for the re-instatement of the sugar quota for the growing of sugar beet in Ireland for the production of sugar. Of course, sugar beet is still grown in Ireland as a fodder crop.<\/p><p><br \/>  In 2011 I met with two separate groups which had conducted feasibility studies, into the possibility of rebuilding a new sugar industry in the country. At both meetings, I stated that any venture to develop a combined sugar\/bioethanol production facility would have to be a commercial proposition, financed in total by investors and interested parties and make sound economic sense in order to be viable. <\/p><p><br \/>  I also further suggested to both groups, the desirability of there being only one single proposition in play, as both studies had indicated a potential for only one such viable project and both groups had appeared to accept the reasonableness of this position at the time. Only recently, I re-stated that any business plan for a new venture in this area, would need to be competitive and that it would have to justify the very substantial investment to build a new facility.<\/p><p><br \/>  In recent discussions at the Council of Agriculture Ministers, which I am chairing under our EU Presidency responsibilities, a deep divide emerged between one group of Member States, including Ireland, which favoured abolition of quotas in 2015 and another group of Member States which wished to extend quotas to 2020 and beyond. As current President of the Council, I made a compromise proposal that garnered the support of a large majority of Member States, to extend the quota regime for a further two years until 30 September 2017 when it will finally cease.  This is the formal negotiating mandate for the Agriculture Council, as we enter the final phase of the ongoing CAP Reform negotiations<i>. <\/i>  The compromise has been welcomed strongly by those who want to re-establish a sugar industry in Ireland. It is my job to ensure that Ireland either has a quota or alternatively can produce sugar in the absence of EU quotas. I would, however, encourage caution on making decisions to planting sugar beet crops or any other investments until we know when Ireland will have the capacity to produce sugar again and when the regime is likely to end.<\/p><p><br \/>  The European Parliament is in favour of extending quotas to 2020. The Council is now in detailed trilogue discussions between the EU Commission and the Parliament on the general CAP Reform package, including the future of the EU Sugar Regime, and I will do everything I can to ensure that we end the Sugar Quota Regime in the EU as soon as possible, so that revival efforts here can get off the ground, as long as the commercial case can be made for them. I am hopeful that I can bring these talks to a successful conclusion before the end of Ireland's Presidency role on 30 June next. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRW05300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Grants","counter":1362,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRW05400"},{"type":"question","counter":1363,"qnumday":552,"qnumall":"[22808\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRW05500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a forestry payment will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1364,"content":"<p>Our records show that the applicant is registered with the Department&rsquo;s Online Services since May 2012.

Issues relating to control of rushes must, therefore, be seen in this overall context.  Farmers can keep grassland in GAEC by conducting an agricultural activity on it, such as grazing, harvesting forage crops, or by topping.  Grasslands continue to be eligible where it is evident that the stocking rate on the land is sufficient and, for example, keeps rushes under control and avoids their proliferation.  In such situations, the reality is there may not be a necessity to cut rushes.

The regulations covering production include the European Communities (Hygiene of Foodstuffs) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 369 of 2006), and the European Communities (General Food Law) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No 747 of 2007).<\/p><p>  Bottled water plants also come within the definition of food business operators under EU legislation and, as such, must meet the requirements set down in EC Regulation (EC) 852\/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs which was transposed into national law in 2006. Consequently the operators of water production\/bottling plants must ensure that they meet the high food safety standards set out in the legislation. <\/p><p>  In addition to the general hygiene requirements above at the processing plants, there are separate requirements in relation to bottled water. These are set down in the European Communities (Natural Mineral Waters, Spring Waters and Other Waters in Bottles or Containers) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No 225 of 2007). These requirements include microbiological, chemical and labelling parameters, including sale descriptions. There is on-going testing of all bottled water facilities and the frequency of testing increases in line with production volumes. Business operators must put in place a safety management system which ensures the water is safe for consumption and meets all legal requirements.<\/p><p>  The enforcement of food law is a matter for the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).   Bottled water plants are inspected by Environmental Health Services (EHS) from the Health Service Executive (HSE) operating under a Service Contract with the FSAI and are inspected regularly. Samples are taken and tested generally as part of routine inspections &ndash; the EHS are supported by the HSE&rsquo;s network of official microbiological and chemical laboratories in this regard. <\/p><p>  In December 2011, the FSAI released the results of a major survey of the microbiological safety and quality of bottled water in Ireland. It showed a significant improvement in the microbiological quality of bottled water since the previous survey was conducted in 2007. When samples were tested against all four of the microbiological standards in the legislation, 2% were found to be unsatisfactory (compared to 7% of similar samples in the 2007 survey).   In addition, where non-compliances were detected, manufacturers were required to take immediate corrective actions.<\/p><p>  In collaboration with the FSAI, the HSE organises annual programmes of testing for all foods on sale in Ireland, including bottled water. In 2012 the HSE, as part of the annual surveillance programme, completed 410 analyses on samples of bottled water. No recalls were required during the year.<\/p><p>  The FSAI and EHS have worked with the bottled water industry in Ireland to develop guidance on safe and hygienic production of bottled water resulting in an updated national hygiene standard available through the National Standards Authority of Ireland. The FSAI and HSE continue to monitor production sites and retail outlets and to investigate customer complaints.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRY01800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Staffing","counter":1430,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRY01850"},{"type":"question","counter":1431,"qnumday":574,"qnumall":"[22411\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRY01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he intends to allow dental health nurses in the Dublin area apply for the planned new targeted voluntary redundancy scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1432,"content":"<p>The health service is required to achieve a workforce of 98,955 whole time equivalents (WTEs) by the end of 2013.

The HSE remains seriously concerned regarding the situation in relation to delayed discharges since the New Year. Delayed Discharges impede the operational functioning of a hospital, and exposes the mainly older persons concerned to the inappropriate risks of acute hospital stays e.g. hospital acquired infections.  Higher numbers of delayed discharges can also be associated with extended waits in the Emergency Department.  There is a body of international evidence that demonstrates that longer ED waits is also associated with poorer mortality and morbidity outcomes for patients.  It is essential that this issue is successfully addressed.  In response to this growth, number of actions have been initiated.  These include the establishment by me of a ministerial Task Force to deliver substantial improvements in delayed discharges, including a review of the operational arrangements associated with the &lsquo;Fair Deal&rsquo; scheme.<\/p><p>  Senior personnel have been tasked with improving cross hospital-community process issues, focusing first on the &lsquo;longest waiting&rsquo; delayed discharges (&amp;gt;100 days).  The aim is to remove all local barriers to discharge and identify those matters which require action at a national level. The management teams have been making good progress with respect to these tasks and it is intended to quickly roll-out this structure to all areas.  <\/p><p>  New reporting systems and processes have also been introduced. A HSE web-based database that allows tracking at patient level (on an anonymous basis) is in the implementation phase in a number of hospital sites.  In addition, the current categorisation of reasons for delay has been reviewed. New categories, which should give enhanced data on the blocks to discharge, are due for implementation nationally on May 20.  The data captured through the web-based system will facilitate revised metrics for each hospital.

This means that on-duty ambulance crews are at their stations or in their vehicles during a shift, rather than having to be summoned to the station in the event of a call-out. Therefore, crews can respond to an emergency call immediately, instead of the average time of over 20 minutes for a vehicle to leave the station under on-call. This change, which was sought by both staff and the NAS, has obvious benefits for patients and response times and represents a clear improvement in service. <\/p><p>  The NAS intends to introduce on-duty rostering and dynamic deployment of emergency resources, on a phased basis, across the entire Cork and Kerry region. So far, on-duty and dynamic deployment arrangements have been successfully introduced across County Cork, most recently in West Cork. <\/p><p>  The NAS informs me that planning for the next phase, in South Kerry, can now be progressed. This phase will include ambulance stations in Caherciveen, Killarney and Kenmare.

However, if a private designated bed is not available and a private in-patient is accommodated in a public bed, the maintenance charge is currently not levied, although the private in-patient continues to pay the fees of his\/her hospital consultant.<\/p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General has reported that 45% of in-patients treated privately by their consultants were not charged for their maintenance costs because they were not occupying private-designated beds.  This situation represents a significant loss of income to the public hospital system and an indirect subsidy to private insurance companies, who cover most private patients.  I believe that this situation cannot continue and that the new charge makes sense. Up to now insurers have enjoyed a significant subsidy, where these private patients have only paid a standard &euro;75 charge per night even though they have seen their consultant privately.<\/p><p>  The gap between the cost of providing this service to private in-patients and the amount that public hospitals are currently allowed to raise is estimated to be about a quarter of a billion euro. The subsidy is equivalent to the cost of running a hospital the size of the Mater, or the cost of treating over 30,000 public patients every year. While everyone is entitled to use a public hospital, some people chose to be treated privately, in which case they have chosen to pay the consultant and the hospital. The Government believes that users of private services should pay for the costs of providing these services even when they are provided by a public hospital.<\/p><p>  As part of Budget 2013, the Government announced that it would raise &euro;60m in 2013 under this heading, and &euro;115m in a full year. This represents a modest phasing in of the charge &ndash; as called for by the insurers themselves - and is a relatively modest extra cost on an industry that pays out some &euro;2 billion in claims costs every year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRAA04600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":1568,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRAA04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1569,"qnumday":627,"qnumall":"[22400\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRAA04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding an application for a medical card in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 15; if same will be expedited; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1570,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

The overarching aim of the Programme is to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with asthma in Ireland and to improve clinical outcomes and the quality of life of all patients with asthma.  A key component is the improved management of people with asthma in primary care, thereby, avoiding emergency attendance at General Practitioner (GP) out-of-hours services, at hospital emergency departments and in-patient admission services.<\/p><p><br \/>  The initial focus of the work of the Programme has been primarily on:<blockquote>- The development and implementation of national asthma guidelines based on international best practice for acute and ongoing asthma management and national asthma education initiatives for patients and health care professionals; and<br \/><br \/>- The organisation and better integration of national asthma services at primary and secondary care levels through the development of a national model of care.<\/blockquote>The acute adult and Paediatric asthma guidelines and associated care pathways, treatment protocols and care bundles have now been developed for use in primary and secondary care settings.  The acute adult asthma guidelines, which are available online at <i>www.hse.ie<\/i>  , are currently being revised.<\/p><p><br \/>  The National Asthma Programme is currently working on developing a National Model of Care for Asthma.  The National Clinic Lead for Asthma, supported by the programme's GP Lead, have responsibility in the HSE for the development of the model of care for asthma.  The Integrated Services Directorate has operational responsibility for implementation of the programme, supported by the Clinical Strategy &amp;amp; Programmes Directorate.  The proposed implementation plan will detail how physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals will work with engaged patients to make the clinical decisions most appropriate to the patient's circumstances; while collaborating with specialist colleagues in providing a safe, seamless patient experience within the health system in Ireland.  This is a key deliverable of the National Asthma Programme for 2013.  The National Asthma Progmamme had to prioritise the submission of the Adult Asthma Emergency Guidelines to the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee which had a deadline of March 2013.  The Model of Care for Asthma will be ready for stakeholder consultation by the end of quarter 2.  It is anticipated that it will be completed by the end of quarter 3 this year.<\/p><p><br \/>  As 85% of asthma is managed in primary care without the requirement for hospital specialist services, the National Asthma Programme is currently undertaking work to look at providing a yearly programme of assessment for asthma in primary care called Chronic Disease Watch - Asthma (also referred to as <i>Asthma Check<\/i>).  The development of <i>Asthma Check<\/i>   is being done in conjunction with the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP).  <i>Asthma Check<\/i> outlines the step-by-step process for implementation of guideline based asthma management in primary care to deliver optimal outcomes for patients.  The aim being to facilitate the implementation of best practice asthma guidelines in primary care in order to improve asthma control.  This will reduce acute exacerbations and thus their associated overall costs with fewer hospital bed days and less time off school \/ work.  It will also ensure that patients with asthma maximize their quality of life.<\/p><p><br \/>  The National Asthma Programme expects that savings would be made in, GP out-of-hours visits, Emergency Department attendances and bed days used by implementing the programme.  In addition, a 10% reduction in asthma deaths each year is targeted by the programme.  Consideration is being given to carrying out an economic analysis of the implementation of the acute asthma guidelines with the support of HIQA.  I am satisfied that good progress can be made in the ongoing development of the National Asthma Programme in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRBB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asthma Incidence","counter":1593,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRBB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1594,"qnumday":637,"qnumall":"[22466\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRBB00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his Department's estimate of the number of persons here who suffer from asthma; the number of these who are covered by a medical card; the way these figures have been determined; and if it is possible to derive an accurate estimate from PCRS data.","asker":"1178","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1595,"content":"<p>The HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service has advised that it does not currently collect information regarding an applicant's illness.

The number of assessment reports received in 2012 was 3,505 which is over 400 applications more than in 2010.  It is worth noting that in the period 2010-2012 over 8,200 reports were completed.  While the HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process given the number and complexity of cases, it is endeavouring to address the issue from available resources.<\/p><p>  While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.  The HSE has issued guidance to its staff that where there is a delay in the assessment process, this should not affect the delivery of necessary and appropriate interventions identified for a particular child.<\/p><p>  In addition targeted action plans have been put in place since early 2011.  Measures have included: prioritising assessments, holding additional clinics, contracting the private sector to conduct assessments and reconfiguring resources to target areas of greatest need.  These plans are monitored on a monthly basis by the HSE centrally.<\/p><p>  Following the publication of a report commissioned from the National Disability Authority by the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive, a major emphasis is being placed on reconfiguring disability services for children into geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams as part of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme which is underway.  The NDA report indicated that where integrated teams were operating, the assessment of need process ran more smoothly.  It found that there was no one single solution to remove all of the challenges to operating a statutory assessment of need.  A meeting involving the Department, the HSE and the NDA has been arranged for early June to discuss the Report further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRDD00800","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Services Provision","counter":1698,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRDD00850"},{"type":"question","counter":1699,"qnumday":684,"qnumall":"[22823\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRDD00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the major collective effect of the cuts to personal assistants and the mobility allowance for children and adults with a disability; and if he will reverse these cuts.","asker":"1017","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1700,"content":"<p>The Government currently provides funding of over &euro;1.5 billion to the Disability Services Programme, through the Health Service Executive's (HSE) National Service Plan for 2013 and is committed to protecting frontline services for people with disabilities to the greatest possible extent.

These reforms will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for medicines resulting in savings for taxpayers and patients.  The Bill passed Report Stage on the 9th of May and will return to the Seanad on the 22nd of May.  It is hoped that the Bill will complete its passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas shortly thereafter.  It is not possible, at this juncture, to provide accurate figures regarding potential savings resulting from the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing, as these depend on various factors including prevailing prices, number of competitors, availability of substitute products, and market dynamics.<\/p><p>  Following intensive negotiations involving the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), the HSE and the Department of Health, a major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded in October last.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs; a lowering of the drugs bill to the State; timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400m over 3 years.  &euro;210 million from the gross savings will make available new drugs to patients over 3 years.  Thus, the deal will result in a net reduction in the HSE expenditure on drugs of about &euro;190m.<\/p><p>  The Department of Health and the HSE have also successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs.  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.<\/p><p>In addition, the recently established HSE Medicines Management Programme has identified &lsquo;preferred drugs&rsquo; for prescribers when prescribing Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) or statin medication for patients.  This is the first time that the State has introduced a preferred drug initiative.  PPIs are prescribed for patients with peptic ulcer disease and\/or reflux and statin medication is for high cholesterol.  The preferred PPI is Lansoprazole and the preferred statin is Simvastatin.  The HSE is asking doctors to prescribe these preferred drugs in order to save money, both for patients who pay for their medication and to deliver savings of an estimated &euro;15million for the taxpayer.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, the European Commission has completed its eighth review of the EU-IMF financial assistance programme for Ireland and has published the technical report by the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs (ECFIN) which assesses programme implementation by the Irish authorities.  The report published on 28th January 2013 identifies areas where the joint EC-ECB-IMF mission considers that further efficiencies could be achieved in the health system.  This includes compulsory prescription by active ingredient rather than by brand name with exceptions only for 'non-substitutability' cases.  The implications of this recommendation are being examined by my Department at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRDD03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services, Cost of Medicines","counter":1731,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRDD03150"},{"type":"question","counter":1732,"qnumday":697,"qnumall":"[23013\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRDD03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which drug costs have fluctuated in each of the past five years to date; the way this has affected the budgetary situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1733,"qnumday":698,"qnumall":"[23014\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400067#WRDD03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which a rise in costs of any particular or specific drugs has been identified over the past five years to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1734,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 697 and 698 together.<\/p><p>The costs of drugs and medicines for the last 5 years are set out in the table below (corresponding figures for 2012 are not yet available).<\/p><p><table><tr><th> -<\/th><th><div><b>2011<\/b><b>(000s)<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>2010<\/b><b>(000s)<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>2009<\/b><b>(000s)<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>2008<\/b><b>(000s)<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>2007<\/b><b>(000s)<\/b><\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Cost of Drugs and Medicines<\/td><td><br \/><br \/>&euro;1,467,575<\/td><td><br \/><br \/>&euro;1,533,619<\/td><td><br \/><br \/>&euro;1,659,931<\/td><td><br \/><br \/>&euro;1,595,089<\/td><td><br \/><br \/>&euro;1,480,201<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>There has been a general price freeze in operation in Ireland for medicines since the mid 1990's.

The Irish Medicines Board has indicated that as of 12 May 2013 there are 49 cases with a clinical diagnosis of narcolepsy, with symptom development post pandemic vaccination.  There are a number of cases still under investigation. The majority of cases are in the five to twenty two years age group. The Health Service Executive has responsibility for health service delivery and at my request, the HSE developed a range of appropriate services and supports to address the needs of this group.  Together, the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills provide a very comprehensive range of services and supports to those affected.<\/p><p>  These supports and services include access to rapid diagnosis, clear treatment pathways, temporary medical cards and reimbursement of expenses incurred. This includes expenses for counselling services for individuals and also for families of children affected by narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination,  in cases where such services are not already available through the HSE.  Multi-disciplinary assessments which allow for appropriate individualised health and educational supports to be put in place are ongoing.  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is also engaging with the HSE and with the individual schools and parents of children concerned to identify and provide educational supports for the children and adolescents affected.<\/p><p>  The HSE's advocacy unit is in regular contact with the support group SOUND and last met representatives of the group on 28 February 2013.

There are now over 3,500 individual gatherings confirmed on the Gathering website. These include clan gatherings, festivals, special sporting events and concerts taking place all across the country throughout the year.

It was for that reason that the Government last year adopted the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy with a view to giving greater public recognition to carers and their work.  <\/p><p>  Carers receive significant income supports from my Department so that people can continue living at home.  Expenditure on carers has increased significantly in recent years.  In 2013 it is estimated to be &euro;776 million compared with an estimated outturn of &euro;771 million in 2012.  The expenditure on carers in 2012 included: &euro;509 million on carer&rsquo;s allowance; &euro;24 million on carer&rsquo;s benefit; &euro;135 million on the respite care grant and; &euro;103 million on domiciliary care allowance. <\/p><p>  Carers also receive a free travel pass at an annual cost of &euro;6 million and carers who reside with the care recipient are eligible for the household benefits package at an annual cost of approximately &euro;30 million.  The revised rate of the respite care grant of &euro;1,375 will still be more than what it was in 2006 when the rate was &euro;1,200.<\/p><p>  The respite care grant is paid to more than 70,000 people each year, with some 5,000 people in receipt of more than one grant as they care for more than one person.  Almost 54,000 people are in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance and 27,000 in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  There are also 1,700 in receipt of carer&rsquo;s benefit.  Some 5,000 carers not in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s payment also receive the grant.  <\/p><p>  The supports to carers from my Department are among the highest rates of income support in Europe. A person getting certain qualifying payments and also providing full-time care and attention to another person can keep their main social welfare payment and receive a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance as well. The half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance was protected in Budget 2013.  <\/p><p>  The respite care grant is available to all full-time carers regardless of their means while the income disregard and means test for carers allowance is the most generous in the social welfare system. A couple under 66 with two children, earning a joint annual income of  up to &euro;35,400 can qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance while a couple earning &euro;59,300 will still qualify for the minimum rate.

To illustrate this, in 2011, social transfers reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children from 51 per cent to 16 per cent; this is amongst the best performance of all member states in the EU. <\/p><p>  The assessment finds that households with children lost around 1 per cent of disposable income, slightly more than the average loss of 0.8 per cent.  This reflected the reduction in child income supports (child benefit and back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance) and the impact of the reduction of the earnings threshold for recipients of the One Parent Family Payment (OFP) from &euro;130 per week to &euro;110 per week (which was announced in a previous Budget).<\/p><p>  However, the analysis did not, for technical reasons, take into account the additional &euro;20.75 million which was provided for services for low income children, including an Area Based Approach to Child Poverty, school meals and after-school child care.  <\/p><p>  In this regard, Budget 2013 contained a measure to provide 6,000 additional after-school child care places to people who have been long-term unemployed or were former recipients of OFP and who have received a job offer or significantly increased their part-time hours. The provision of good quality, affordable child care is one of the most important ways in which we help people get back to work.  In the first phase, up to 500 child care places are being made available in seven local offices: Tralee, Mullingar, Dundalk, Cork City, Finglas, King&rsquo;s Inn and Limerick City (Dominic Street).  <\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s priority in Budget 2013 was to maintain the basic weekly rates of social welfare income support payments including the personal weekly rate OFP and this was achieved.  In addition, there were no changes to the family income supplement, fuel allowance and the level of weekly increase payable for qualified children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRO00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1971,"content":"<p>Question No. 354 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Appeals","counter":1972,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRO00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1973,"qnumday":355,"qnumall":"[22695\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRO01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding a domiciliary care allowance appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork.","asker":"993","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1974,"content":"<p>An application for domiciliary care allowance was received from the person concerned on the 21st September 2012.

The corresponding allocation to the Citizens Information Board in 2012 was &euro;46.8 million of which some &euro;18.3 million was allocated to MABS and &euro;14.6 million for the Citizens Information Services.<\/p><p>  The Citizens Information Board is responsible for ensuring that all appropriate governance arrangements are in place in relation to the expenditure of these public funds.  It is essential that this significant amount of public monies is carefully monitored and properly accounted for, in terms of financial accountability, effective performance and excellent delivery of quality services to the customer and taxpayer, who ultimately funds these services. The Board is responsible for ensuring that all appropriate governance arrangements are in place in relation to the expenditure of these public funds.<\/p><p>  An important element of assessing accountability is through the formal arrangement of Service Level Agreements. These are annual contracts between the CIB and the 96 separate companies, which provide the services for which the Citizens information Board has responsibility, including the 42 local Citizens Information Services and the 53 MABS companies.  These contracts are agreed by the governing board of the Citizens Information Board and cover standard items such as service delivery, governance, financial controls, HR practices, reporting, evaluation, monitoring etc. This enables the Board to ensure that excellent service and best value is achieved across the wide range of services it provides.<\/p><p>  With regard to the 2013 Agreement the CIB met with the representative forums of MABS and CIS to discuss issues raised. To date, some 40 CIS companies and 19 MABS companies have signed the contract and are fully compliant with the governance and accountability requirements. <\/p><p>  The Citizens Information Board is engaging with the remaining companies to resolve outstanding matters and following consultation with the MABS and CIS network is bringing forward a longer term contract to govern the period to end 2016.  I am confident this will secure the agreement of all and would like to assure the Deputy that there is no risk to service delivery and all parties are fully engaged in ensuring that the excellent service to those most in need continues as required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRO02600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1997,"content":"<p>Question No. 364 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1998,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRO02750"},{"type":"question","counter":1999,"qnumday":365,"qnumall":"[22881\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRO02800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the individual amount of overtime paid in the case of each political\/Ministerial appointee for the period 2007 to date in 2013 relative to her office and the office of the Minister of State; if such payments were made to the Secretary General and advisors, and if so, the amounts for the same period.","asker":"965","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":2000,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the individual amount of overtime paid in the case of each political\/Ministerial appointee for the period 2007 to date in 2013 relative to my Department, is set out in tabular statement below.<\/p><p>No overtime has been paid to the Special Advisers or the Secretary Generals within the Department of Social Protection during the period 2007 to date in 2013 as these posts are not overtime grades.<\/p><p>All overtime, travel and subsistence payments are subject to the general regulations governing the payment of overtime, travel and subsistence.<\/p><p><b>MINISTER JOAN BURTON,T.D.

The estimated expenditure on child benefit in 2013 is around &euro;1.9 billion and it is currently paid to around 611,000 families in respect of some 1.16 million children. <\/p><p>  The Government is conscious that child benefit, as a universal payment, can be an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment. The social protection system also provides assistance to low income families with children through the payment of qualified child increases on primary social welfare payments and through the family income supplement payment. Both of these provide a level of assistance which is directly or indirectly linked with a household&rsquo;s income situation.<\/p><p>  Achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including child benefit, raises complex issues about the effectiveness and the efficiency of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes can be achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and its report on this issue was published in February.<\/p><p>  This report makes important recommendations on how child benefit could be maintained as a universal payment while reforming the current system of child and family income supports so as to better target those who need these supports most. Given the range of complex issues involved, including fiscal, operational and legal considerations, as well as the implications for reforms in terms of child poverty and employment incentive outcomes, the Government has made no decision at this time on the core recommendations of the report.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that the report will now contribute to the policy debate on the matter. In considering the proposals to reform the structure of child and family income support payments, including the balance between income supports and services, such as childcare, I expect that Government will also take into account further work by the Advisory Group on the issue of social protection and taxation supports for working age persons and more general developments in the budgetary and fiscal situation. <\/p><p>  The provision of childcare services, such as those supported by the Early Childhood Care and Education scheme, is primarily a policy matter for my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Frances Fitzgerald T.D.  However, any proposal to fund additional childcare services from cuts to the child benefit scheme would require a Government decision within an overall budgetary context on which no indications can be given at the present time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRP01200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":2036,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRP01300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme Relocation Options","counter":2035,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRP01250"},{"type":"question","counter":2036,"qnumday":379,"qnumall":"[22167\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRP01300","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"when persons with turbary rights on a bog (details supplied) in County Laois will be granted rights at an alternative location; the number of persons who are still waiting for this matter to be resolved in this area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":2037,"content":"<p>55 applications for compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme have been received and acknowledged by my Department in respect of the raised bog special area of conservation referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question. 10 of these applicants have expressed an interest in relocation to a non-designated bog. 40 payments and 5 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of the applications received. <\/p><p>  Bord na M&oacute;na undertook a preliminary assessment of a potential relocation site for those applicants who have expressed an interest in relocation, on behalf of my Department.

Expert scientific advice available showed that the marine survival of salmon in the North Atlantic has decreased significantly in the previous decades.  It was in this context and to afford every protection to the remaining stocks that the decision to cease indiscriminate mixed stock fishing was taken.  <\/p><p>  In 2007, I understand that a Salmon Hardship Scheme of &euro;25m was established to address any hardship experienced by affected commercial salmon licence holders.  In addition, I also understand that a further &euro;5m was allocated to a Community Support Scheme which was directed primarily at those communities where commercial salmon fishing had been a well-established activity and where its withdrawal demonstrably impacted on the economic and social fabric.  <\/p><p>  On foot of the decision to prioritise conservation the harvest of salmon by any means is restricted to those individual stocks of rivers that are judged by the scientific advice as meeting their conservation limits.  Commercial fishing and recreational angling can continue only where there is a scientifically identified exploitable surplus within the genetically discrete stock in each individual river.  Overall the estimate of total Irish spawning salmon over the past decade is only 52% of that in the 1970&rsquo;s.<\/p><p>  In this regard, and in the mixed stock context pertaining as stocks migrate during the at sea phase of their life-cycle, it is not possible to identify the discrete stocks of salmon emanating from individual rivers which are above their conservation limit.  Such mixed stock fishing activity would be irresponsible in that the possibility of disaggregating those genetically individual river stocks (including stocks from other countries) within a large mixed migratory body of fish is impossible.  To permit targeting of such mixed stocks would expose vulnerable individual river stocks, which are not meeting conservation limits, to indiscriminate and unsustainable harvesting.

This is equivalent to 31,925 Gigawatt hours (GWh) or a reduction in annual CO2 emissions of around 7.7 Mega tonnes (Mt).  Recognising that Government must lead by example, we are committed to achieving a 33% reduction in public sector energy use by 2020.  <\/p><p>  The second Action Plan follows a similar approach to its predecessor, identifying realisable but ambitious actions across six areas: Public Sector, Residential, Business, Transport, Energy Supply, and Cross-Sectoral.  The Plan contains 97 actions, each of which will play a part in securing a more sustainable energy future for Ireland.  Of the 97 actions, the following five will play an integral role in the delivery of the national target:  <\/p><p>  1. In the Public sector, we will introduce a series of obligations on public sector bodies to address consumption, procurement and reporting of energy use.  <\/p><p>  As part of our Action Plan for Jobs commitments, we will issue in June this year a mandate to public sector organisations with an annual energy spend of &euro;500,000 or more, to go to the market to identify solutions for the delivery of energy reduction services.  In 2010-2011 the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and my Department developed and launched a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system to record each individual public body&rsquo;s progress towards the 33% target.  A database of over 30,000 meters has been established to enable the accurate gathering of public sector data.  This database is being developed with linkages to the National Procurement service and will lead to better procurement of energy supplies for the public sector.  A report on public sector consumption will be published later this year.  <\/p><p>  2. We will institute a national Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) process to deliver innovative models of retrofitting and financing of energy efficiency measures in the commercial and public sectors.  <\/p><p>  Work on the National Energy Performance Contracting Policy Framework, which will standardise energy performance contracting in Ireland and provide a robust process for establishing investment-ready projects, is well advanced and the first version of the Framework will be published shortly.  The Framework will be underpinned by an Energy Efficiency Fund, to which Government has already committed &euro;35 million in the 2013 Budget as seed capital. <\/p><p>  3. We will introduce an appropriate Pay-As-You-Save (PAYS) model for Ireland to replace existing exchequer supports for domestic and non-domestic energy efficiency upgrade measures.<\/p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to roll out a Better Energy Financing (formerly known as Pay-As-You-Save) energy retrofit scheme for domestic buildings after 2013.  The Better Energy Financing (BEF) model proposes that the current suite of Exchequer funded grants for energy efficiency measures, excluding the low-income housing retrofit programme, will be replaced by a new financing scheme open to the residential and non-residential sectors.  This scheme will allow consumers to secure upfront financing for energy efficiency upgrades, the repayment of which will be funded from savings on their energy bill generated from the retrofit.<\/p><p>  My Department has put in place a project team to design a replacement retrofit financing scheme under the direction of a Project Board representing key state and industry stakeholders.  Project resources have been drawn from industry experts and elsewhere in the public sector.  It is planned that the design of the scheme will be developed over the coming months and that a public consultation process will be undertaken later this year.  <\/p><p>  4. The Better Energy programme will deliver energy efficiency improvements across a number of sectors including energy saving targets for energy suppliers.  <\/p><p>  The NEEAP emphasises the role of market actors in facilitating the delivery of energy savings, with the introduction of energy saving targets for energy suppliers a key measure underpinning the delivery of the 2020 energy saving target.  A move to a market-based programme is a logical step in mainstreaming energy efficiency within the energy supply sector in line with EU ambitions.  <\/p><p>  To date 18 energy supply companies have signed voluntary energy savings agreements, with a programmatic target of 875GWh for the period 2011-2013.  I am currently considering proposals for the period beyond 2013.<\/p><p>  5. A Cross-Departmental Implementation Group will soon be established to ensure that all the actions contained in this Plan are delivered.  <\/p><p>  The Implementation Group, chaired by my Department, has been established and is meeting quarterly to ensure delivery of the actions contained in the NEEAP.  It comprises representatives from a number of key stakeholders who are responsible for leading or supporting the progression of key sectoral actions in pursuit of our NEEAP goals.  The Implementation Group will report to Government regularly on progress.  <\/p><p>  Should all measures detailed in the plan reach their full potential by 2020 it is estimated that a potential reduction in energy spend across all sectors of approximately &euro;2.36 billion (at 2011 prices) will be realised.  A very significant element of this will be Exchequer savings in the public sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRQ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Issues","counter":2092,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRQ01050"},{"type":"question","counter":2093,"qnumday":400,"qnumall":"[22349\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRQ01100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will outline the way he is supporting the Digital Hub Development Agency and the National Digital Research Centre; the potential for these services to create jobs in the digital enterprise sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1064","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":2094,"content":"<p>The Digital Hub currently supports approximately 64 companies which between them employ over 805 people, making a significant contribution to job creation.

Ireland&rsquo;s priority is the safety of the Irish people and the protection of our environment, including the shared marine environment of the Irish Sea. <\/p><p>  The UK published its draft Energy National Policy Statement in November 2009, which signalled its intention to construct ten new nuclear power stations at sites judged as potentially suitable. This was subsequently revised in October 2010 when the number of planned stations was reduced to eight, following the dropping of two sites originally proposed for Cumbria, near the existing Sellafield facility.  Since the original announcement in 2009, Ireland has written twice at ministerial level to the UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change outlining concerns about potential environmental impacts in Ireland and in the Irish Sea. The key issues of concern include the assessments by the UK of effects on the environment, management of radioactive waste, and the rationale underpinning the proposed justification decision for new nuclear facilities. This engagement at ministerial level has been supported and informed by a continuing dialogue at official level where Irish officials engage, and raise concerns where appropriate, with UK counterparts directly engaged in the development and implementation of the plans. <\/p><p>  I note the legal proceedings being brought by An Taisce in relation to Hinkley Point and I respect the rights of An Taisce, as an independent body, to take such a course of action.

No. 326 of 2012), which were given effect following a public consultation process, provide for a ban on the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of bituminous (or &quot;smoky&quot;) fuel inside specified ban areas.  The Regulations introduced some improved and updated provisions that will help to ensure that the smoky coal ban remains fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of residential fuels.\u00a0 These are as follows:   <\/p><p>- most existing smoky coal ban area boundaries were revised to take recent urban development into account;<\/p><p>- seven new\u00a0towns were added to the ban from May 2013 - Greystones, Letterkenny, Mullingar, Navan, Newbridge, Portlaoise and Wicklow Town; and<\/p><p>- a prohibition on the burning of bituminous fuel to complement the established ban on marketing, sale and distribution.\u00a0<\/p><p><br \/>  The single focus of the previous regulations on prohibiting the sale, as distinct from the burning, of &quot;smoky&quot; coal meant that the burning of such coal inside ban areas undermined the intent and purpose of the ban and the supply of such fuel was known to be facilitated by businesses that had established premises just outside ban area boundaries to serve ban area residents as their main market.  The revised boundaries and prohibition on the burning of smoky coal inside ban areas support the effectiveness of the ban in the areas concerned by restricting such activities and hence closing the loophole.  These updated provisions were broadly welcomed by the EPA, local authorities and the import and supply industry, on the basis that they provide for more effective legislation.  My Department continues to meet regularly with the EPA, local authorities and the industry representatives to discuss the ongoing implementation and enforcement of the Regulations.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the case of new towns that were added to the ban, a lead-in period of eight months was provided to allow local authorities and fuel retailers time to adapt as necessary to the new regulatory requirements in preparation for the switch-over to smokeless fuels.  Following the inclusion of these areas, the smoky coal ban applies in all towns with a population greater than 15,000 people.  This provides for greater consistency in urban air quality standards throughout the State by extending the cleaner air benefits of the ban to all large towns.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Regulations also require that all smoky coal sold outside ban areas for residential use outside those areas must have a sulphur content of no more than 0.7%.\u00a0 This compares to a maximum permitted sulphur content of 2% for bituminous coal sold in Northern Ireland. <font color=\"#333333\"> &amp;#8206;<\/font>Coal bagging operators and certain solid fuel suppliers trading in smoky coal must demonstrate the compliance of their product with the 0.7% sulphur limit and be registered with the EPA.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland has prepared an annual traceability audit system, known as SWiFT 7, for demonstrating compliance.  All retailers who trade in smoky coal must ensure that their suppliers are registered with the EPA and must hold a record to this effect with their supplier's registration number. <\/p><p><br \/>  Despite these regulatory improvements, I recognise that different standards applying to coal between separate jurisdictions presents a continuing challenge for enforcement.

Where any borrower, either from a local authority or from a private financial institution, is facing difficulties in meeting mortgage repayments, they should engage proactively and constructively with the lender to seek to achieve an agreed solution.  The services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service are also available to such borrowers and support is available through the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme.<\/p><p>Local authorities have long been the lenders of last resort servicing the housing loans needs of less affluent members of society.  In the present economic circumstances it is to be anticipated that the ability of some borrowers to service housing loans may become restricted and that a number of loans may fall into arrears.  Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers, and they have demonstrated sensitivity over the years in dealing with such cases.  In March 2010 my Department issued guidelines to local authorities, based upon the Central Bank's first Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, which continued the tradition of handling arrears in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.<br \/>  To reflect the content of the Central Bank's revised Code of Conduct &ndash; which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt &ndash; my Department issued updated guidance in June 2012 to local authorities in consultation with the County and City Managers Association.  This will further enable local authorities to provide a range of flexible repayment options for households in difficulty.  In particular, the introduction of a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which closely mirrors the suite of options available in the commercial sector, presents borrowers in difficulty with a range of alternative payment agreements, including those referred to in the Question, which can be accessed to ease the particular circumstances of each case.  This process features a standard set of options including, in cases of certain unsustainable mortgages, the facility of mortgage-to-rent.  Local authorities have been restructuring loans for some time using their own internal practices. The introduction of these revised guidelines standardises the approach across the whole sector, introduces a systematic structure to this area and provides borrowers with a transparent and accessible model for arrears resolution.<\/p><p>Regarding the level of repossessions in the last three years, my Department publishes a wide range of housing statistics which can be found at <i>www.environ.ie.<\/i>  The total numbers of forced and voluntary repossessions obtained by local authorities in 2010, 2011 and 2012 are set out in the following table.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Forced<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>54<\/td><td>73<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Voluntary<\/td><td>73<\/td><td>49<\/td><td>64<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRS02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":2259,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRS02900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Status","counter":2258,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRS02850"},{"type":"question","counter":2259,"qnumday":457,"qnumall":"[22151\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRS02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the opportunities for appeal or reconsideration of an application, either within his Department or through the courts, that exist for a person (details supplied) who has been issued with a deportation order; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1045","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2260,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned arrived in the State on 8th November 2003 as a short-term visitor.

For example, the security initiatives undertaken by the Operational Security Group (OSG)  have made it more difficult for prisoners to engage in illegal activities while in prison.  These initiatives include the introduction of passive and active drug detection dogs and the installation of airport style security including scanners and x-ray machines.

To support the achievement of these aims, the Act provides for the establishment of an independent Charities Regulatory Authority.<\/p><p>  I am aware of the recent Prime Time programme which reported, amongst other things, on the issue of theft from charity clothing banks.  Theft is an offence contrary to section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.  A person convicted upon indictment of theft is liable to imprisonment for up to 10 years and\/or an unlimited fine.<\/p><p>  I am also concerned about the reported practice of some collectors of clothing who convey the impression in their promotional literature that they are collecting on behalf of a charity, when this may not actually be the case.  This may lead some people to donate to such collections in the belief that they are supporting a charity and helping to alleviate hardship. This is unfair both to donors whose intention in donating such items is to help those in need, and to bona fide charities that may lose out on donations as a result. It is an offence under section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001 to make gain or cause loss to others by deception.<\/p><p>  In addition to these existing measures under the Criminal Justice Acts, while the Charities Act 2009 does not deal directly with the regulation of Irish charity clothing banks or collections, it does contain measures aimed at preventing the abuse of charitable status. Under section 46 of the Charities Act, it is an offence for an organisation that is not a registered charity to describe itself or its activities in such terms as would cause members of the public to reasonably believe that it is a charitable organisation. This section cannot be commenced until the statutory Register of Charities, also provided for under the Charities Act, is in place.<\/p><p>  While further implementation of the Charities Act and creation of the Register of Charities have been delayed for financial reasons, the Government remains committed to progressing the implementation of the Act and putting in place a dedicated regulatory framework for charities in line with the provisions of the Act. My Department has been examining how best this can be done in the current financial climate.  As part of this work, my Department recently undertook a consultation on key issues, including the creation of the Register of Charities. The submissions received are currently being reviewed and I look forward to publishing the results in due course and giving a further indication of the Government's timeframe for the introduction of an operational Charities Regulatory Authority and full implementation of the Charities Act 2009.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRT03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Remuneration","counter":2330,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRT03550"},{"type":"question","counter":2331,"qnumday":482,"qnumall":"[22793\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRT03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of personnel in whole-time equivalent terms in his Department and in bodies under the aegis of his Department in each of the following earnings brackets: less than &euro;20,000, &euro;20,001 to &euro;30,000, &euro;30,001 to &euro;40,000, &euro;40,001 to &euro;50,000, &euro;50,001 to &euro;60,000, &euro;60,001 to &euro;70,000, &euro;70,001 to &euro;80,000, &euro;80,001 to &euro;90,000, &euro;90,001 to &euro;100,000, &euro;100,000 to &euro;125,000, &euro;125,001 to &euro;150,000, &euro;150,001 to &euro;175,000, &euro;175,001 to &euro;200,000, &euro;200,001 to &euro;250,000, &euro;250,001 to &euro;300,000, &euro;300,001 to &euro;350,000, &euro;350,001 to &euro;400,000, &euro;400,001 to &euro;450,000, &euro;450,001 to &euro;500,000, and more than &euro;500,000.","asker":"1178","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2332,"content":"<p>The information sought by the Deputy in respect of staff of my Department and agencies under its aegis is set out in the following table.

The evidence in relation to mixed fisheries across western waters indicates a consistently high level of discards and presents a significant problem for all EU Member States  involved in fishing EU waters.<\/p><p>  Finding practical and implementable solutions to the wasteful practice of discarding fish is a major component of the current reform proposals for the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).

I have prioritised securing final agreement between the EU Fisheries Council and the Parliament on reform of the CFP throughout the Irish EU Presidency and we are making considerable progress in this regard.  The Fisheries Council which commenced yesterday and continues today is seeking to agree a compromise package on the CFP reform, including in relation to dealing with discards, with a view to finalising negotiations with the EU Parliament and the Commission before the end of the Irish Presidency.<\/p><p>  Ireland has been to the forefront in the drive to reduce and eliminate discards for many years and I was delighted to launch an Irish &ldquo;discard&rdquo; atlas in 2011, which is a detailed compendium of discards by the Irish Fleet targeting whitefish on a stock by stock and area by area basis.  This was the first publication of its kind and placed Ireland firmly to the fore in the debate on eliminating discards and assisted in advancing the case for a phased elimination of discards as part of the CFP reform package.

The package of measures expect to provide a modernised and simplified, more risked-based approach to the protection of health and more efficient control mechanisms to ensure the effective application of the rules guiding the operation of the food chain.<\/p><p>  As it stands, the current body of EU legislation covering the food chain consists of almost 70 separate pieces of legislation. The package of reform proposes to reduce this down to 5 pieces of legislation. These are: Plant Health, Animal Health, Plant Reproductive Material, Official Controls and Financing Regulations. It is anticipated that the new streamlined legislation proposals would reduce the red-tape on processes and procedures for farmers, breeders and food business operators to make it easier for them to carry on business.<\/p><p>  The regulation proposed for the commercial plant and seed sector differs very little from those rules already in operation, apart from the introduction of a more streamlined certification process. Importantly though, the regulation proposes to reduce the administrative burden on micro-enterprises, such as small seed processors who would be exempted by-and-large from all mandatory registration and control charges. Private gardeners and amateur growers would not be affected by these proposed regulations and would be able to continue to exchange seed as before.<\/p><p>  It is anticipated that the new regime will not be in place before 2016.

The store lamb trade failed to take off in Autumn 2012, largely driven by a poor pasture conditions (limited grass, forage) and lack of confidence on the part of store lamb finishers who were reluctant to buy expensive feed. Demand within the traditional markets for light lamb (Portugal and indirectly Spain) has also been poor over the last two years due to the economic downturn in these regions. Indeed total imports of sheep meat into Portugal and Spain have fallen by 26% and 42% respectively.<\/p><p>  Bearing in mind the difficulties in recent times with these two outlets, the industry and Bord Bia are exploring additional new markets for light lambs for 2013.  These markets include France and the UK, which are the core export markets for Irish lamb, and Sweden, Belgium and Germany, which have been delivering positive growth over the last 2-3 years.  However it must be recognised that light lambs (&amp;lt;13kg) are generally not favoured by consumers in these regions and it is likely that lambs will need to be finished up to a weight of 17kg+.   I understand that Bord Bia has been discussing with the industry on how this could best be done, for example overwinter the lambs and dispose of them in the following Spring. <\/p><p>  Research can also be used to assist light lamb producers to bring the carcass to an acceptable weight specification. The Teagasc BETTER farm programme has a number of hill farms around the country. The aim of this programme is to establish focal points for the on-farm implementation, development and evaluation of technology that is relevant to hill sheep farmers. Close collaboration between Teagasc Researchers &amp;amp; Advisers with these farms aims to help improve profitability of hill sheep production.<\/p><p>  The recently launched Sheep Technology Adoption Programme (STAP) contains a measure designed to help improve the weight, quality and thus price of hill lambs.<\/p><p>  My Department is providing significant funding to Sheep Ireland to help deliver on the significant profit potential that breed improvement can deliver.

A general co-financing rate of 53% is proposed but this rate may rise to a maximum of 80% for measures such as farm and business development, co-operation activities, Leader projects, and other measures. Environmental type measures may be co-funded up to 75%. The exchequer funding percentage that will be required to draw down the available EU funding will depend firstly on the types of measures that will be included in the Programme and secondly on the co-financing rate that is agreed with the EU Commission for these measures. <\/p><p>  As regards the minimum spend for certain measures, the proposal provides that at least 5% EAFRD funding must be reserved for Leader while the Common Provisions Regulation provides that 7% of EAFRD funding must be allocated under a national performance reserve.

The EU Sugar Regime underwent a radical reform in 2005 following major EU decisions to restructure the industry. A temporary restructuring scheme was introduced with the aim of reducing EU sugar production. Greencore, the holder of the entire Irish sugar quota, availed of this voluntary scheme, dismantled its facilities and ceased production in 2006. Ireland secured &euro;353million as part of the reform package of which &euro;220million went to beet growers, &euro;127million to Greencore and &euro;6million to machinery contractors.<\/p><p><br \/>  Post reform, production in the EU is now concentrated in 18 Member States. The present regime runs from 1 September 2006 to the 30 September 2015. There is no mechanism under the present EU Regulations which would allow for the re-instatement of the sugar quota for the growing of sugar beet in Ireland for the production of sugar. Of course, sugar beet is still grown in Ireland as a fodder crop.<\/p><p><br \/>  In 2011 I met with two separate groups which had conducted feasibility studies, into the possibility of rebuilding a new sugar industry in the country. At both meetings, I stated that any venture to develop a combined sugar\/bioethanol production facility would have to be a commercial proposition, financed in total by investors and interested parties and make sound economic sense in order to be viable. <\/p><p><br \/>  I also further suggested to both groups, the desirability of there being only one single proposition in play, as both studies had indicated a potential for only one such viable project and both groups had appeared to accept the reasonableness of this position at the time. Only recently, I re-stated that any business plan for a new venture in this area, would need to be competitive and that it would have to justify the very substantial investment to build a new facility.<\/p><p><br \/>  In recent discussions at the Council of Agriculture Ministers, which I am chairing under our EU Presidency responsibilities, a deep divide emerged between one group of Member States, including Ireland, which favoured abolition of quotas in 2015 and another group of Member States which wished to extend quotas to 2020 and beyond. As current President of the Council, I made a compromise proposal that garnered the support of a large majority of Member States, to extend the quota regime for a further two years until 30 September 2017 when it will finally cease.  This is the formal negotiating mandate for the Agriculture Council, as we enter the final phase of the ongoing CAP Reform negotiations<i>. <\/i>  The compromise has been welcomed strongly by those who want to re-establish a sugar industry in Ireland. It is my job to ensure that Ireland either has a quota or alternatively can produce sugar in the absence of EU quotas. I would, however, encourage caution on making decisions to planting sugar beet crops or any other investments until we know when Ireland will have the capacity to produce sugar again and when the regime is likely to end.<\/p><p><br \/>  The European Parliament is in favour of extending quotas to 2020. The Council is now in detailed trilogue discussions between the EU Commission and the Parliament on the general CAP Reform package, including the future of the EU Sugar Regime, and I will do everything I can to ensure that we end the Sugar Quota Regime in the EU as soon as possible, so that revival efforts here can get off the ground, as long as the commercial case can be made for them. I am hopeful that I can bring these talks to a successful conclusion before the end of Ireland's Presidency role on 30 June next. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRW05300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Grants","counter":2542,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRW05400"},{"type":"question","counter":2543,"qnumday":552,"qnumall":"[22808\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRW05500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a forestry payment will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2544,"content":"<p>Our records show that the applicant is registered with the Department&rsquo;s Online Services since May 2012.

Issues relating to control of rushes must, therefore, be seen in this overall context.  Farmers can keep grassland in GAEC by conducting an agricultural activity on it, such as grazing, harvesting forage crops, or by topping.  Grasslands continue to be eligible where it is evident that the stocking rate on the land is sufficient and, for example, keeps rushes under control and avoids their proliferation.  In such situations, the reality is there may not be a necessity to cut rushes.

The regulations covering production include the European Communities (Hygiene of Foodstuffs) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 369 of 2006), and the European Communities (General Food Law) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No 747 of 2007).<\/p><p>  Bottled water plants also come within the definition of food business operators under EU legislation and, as such, must meet the requirements set down in EC Regulation (EC) 852\/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs which was transposed into national law in 2006. Consequently the operators of water production\/bottling plants must ensure that they meet the high food safety standards set out in the legislation. <\/p><p>  In addition to the general hygiene requirements above at the processing plants, there are separate requirements in relation to bottled water. These are set down in the European Communities (Natural Mineral Waters, Spring Waters and Other Waters in Bottles or Containers) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No 225 of 2007). These requirements include microbiological, chemical and labelling parameters, including sale descriptions. There is on-going testing of all bottled water facilities and the frequency of testing increases in line with production volumes. Business operators must put in place a safety management system which ensures the water is safe for consumption and meets all legal requirements.<\/p><p>  The enforcement of food law is a matter for the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).   Bottled water plants are inspected by Environmental Health Services (EHS) from the Health Service Executive (HSE) operating under a Service Contract with the FSAI and are inspected regularly. Samples are taken and tested generally as part of routine inspections &ndash; the EHS are supported by the HSE&rsquo;s network of official microbiological and chemical laboratories in this regard. <\/p><p>  In December 2011, the FSAI released the results of a major survey of the microbiological safety and quality of bottled water in Ireland. It showed a significant improvement in the microbiological quality of bottled water since the previous survey was conducted in 2007. When samples were tested against all four of the microbiological standards in the legislation, 2% were found to be unsatisfactory (compared to 7% of similar samples in the 2007 survey).   In addition, where non-compliances were detected, manufacturers were required to take immediate corrective actions.<\/p><p>  In collaboration with the FSAI, the HSE organises annual programmes of testing for all foods on sale in Ireland, including bottled water. In 2012 the HSE, as part of the annual surveillance programme, completed 410 analyses on samples of bottled water. No recalls were required during the year.<\/p><p>  The FSAI and EHS have worked with the bottled water industry in Ireland to develop guidance on safe and hygienic production of bottled water resulting in an updated national hygiene standard available through the National Standards Authority of Ireland. The FSAI and HSE continue to monitor production sites and retail outlets and to investigate customer complaints.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRY01800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Staffing","counter":2610,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRY01850"},{"type":"question","counter":2611,"qnumday":574,"qnumall":"[22411\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRY01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he intends to allow dental health nurses in the Dublin area apply for the planned new targeted voluntary redundancy scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2612,"content":"<p>The health service is required to achieve a workforce of 98,955 whole time equivalents (WTEs) by the end of 2013.

The HSE remains seriously concerned regarding the situation in relation to delayed discharges since the New Year. Delayed Discharges impede the operational functioning of a hospital, and exposes the mainly older persons concerned to the inappropriate risks of acute hospital stays e.g. hospital acquired infections.  Higher numbers of delayed discharges can also be associated with extended waits in the Emergency Department.  There is a body of international evidence that demonstrates that longer ED waits is also associated with poorer mortality and morbidity outcomes for patients.  It is essential that this issue is successfully addressed.  In response to this growth, number of actions have been initiated.  These include the establishment by me of a ministerial Task Force to deliver substantial improvements in delayed discharges, including a review of the operational arrangements associated with the &lsquo;Fair Deal&rsquo; scheme.<\/p><p>  Senior personnel have been tasked with improving cross hospital-community process issues, focusing first on the &lsquo;longest waiting&rsquo; delayed discharges (&amp;gt;100 days).  The aim is to remove all local barriers to discharge and identify those matters which require action at a national level. The management teams have been making good progress with respect to these tasks and it is intended to quickly roll-out this structure to all areas.  <\/p><p>  New reporting systems and processes have also been introduced. A HSE web-based database that allows tracking at patient level (on an anonymous basis) is in the implementation phase in a number of hospital sites.  In addition, the current categorisation of reasons for delay has been reviewed. New categories, which should give enhanced data on the blocks to discharge, are due for implementation nationally on May 20.  The data captured through the web-based system will facilitate revised metrics for each hospital.

This means that on-duty ambulance crews are at their stations or in their vehicles during a shift, rather than having to be summoned to the station in the event of a call-out. Therefore, crews can respond to an emergency call immediately, instead of the average time of over 20 minutes for a vehicle to leave the station under on-call. This change, which was sought by both staff and the NAS, has obvious benefits for patients and response times and represents a clear improvement in service. <\/p><p>  The NAS intends to introduce on-duty rostering and dynamic deployment of emergency resources, on a phased basis, across the entire Cork and Kerry region. So far, on-duty and dynamic deployment arrangements have been successfully introduced across County Cork, most recently in West Cork. <\/p><p>  The NAS informs me that planning for the next phase, in South Kerry, can now be progressed. This phase will include ambulance stations in Caherciveen, Killarney and Kenmare. As in each phase to date, any decisions on the best model of service for South Kerry will be preceded by detailed consideration of activity, geography, demographics, location of acute hospitals and other facilities, supporting services, wider NAS developments and learning from previous phases, as well as public, clinical and community leader engagement.<\/p><p>  The HSE is currently considering the most appropriate model of service delivery for South Kerry, to replace the current on-call, static deployment model and the operation of resources in isolation.

However, if a private designated bed is not available and a private in-patient is accommodated in a public bed, the maintenance charge is currently not levied, although the private in-patient continues to pay the fees of his\/her hospital consultant.<\/p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General has reported that 45% of in-patients treated privately by their consultants were not charged for their maintenance costs because they were not occupying private-designated beds.  This situation represents a significant loss of income to the public hospital system and an indirect subsidy to private insurance companies, who cover most private patients.  I believe that this situation cannot continue and that the new charge makes sense. Up to now insurers have enjoyed a significant subsidy, where these private patients have only paid a standard &euro;75 charge per night even though they have seen their consultant privately.<\/p><p>  The gap between the cost of providing this service to private in-patients and the amount that public hospitals are currently allowed to raise is estimated to be about a quarter of a billion euro. The subsidy is equivalent to the cost of running a hospital the size of the Mater, or the cost of treating over 30,000 public patients every year. While everyone is entitled to use a public hospital, some people chose to be treated privately, in which case they have chosen to pay the consultant and the hospital. The Government believes that users of private services should pay for the costs of providing these services even when they are provided by a public hospital.<\/p><p>  As part of Budget 2013, the Government announced that it would raise &euro;60m in 2013 under this heading, and &euro;115m in a full year. This represents a modest phasing in of the charge &ndash; as called for by the insurers themselves - and is a relatively modest extra cost on an industry that pays out some &euro;2 billion in claims costs every year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRAA04600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":2748,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRAA04700"},{"type":"question","counter":2749,"qnumday":627,"qnumall":"[22400\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRAA04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding an application for a medical card in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 15; if same will be expedited; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2750,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

The overarching aim of the Programme is to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with asthma in Ireland and to improve clinical outcomes and the quality of life of all patients with asthma.  A key component is the improved management of people with asthma in primary care, thereby, avoiding emergency attendance at General Practitioner (GP) out-of-hours services, at hospital emergency departments and in-patient admission services.<\/p><p><br \/>  The initial focus of the work of the Programme has been primarily on:<blockquote>- The development and implementation of national asthma guidelines based on international best practice for acute and ongoing asthma management and national asthma education initiatives for patients and health care professionals; and<br \/><br \/>- The organisation and better integration of national asthma services at primary and secondary care levels through the development of a national model of care.<\/blockquote>The acute adult and Paediatric asthma guidelines and associated care pathways, treatment protocols and care bundles have now been developed for use in primary and secondary care settings.  The acute adult asthma guidelines, which are available online at <i>www.hse.ie<\/i>  , are currently being revised.<\/p><p><br \/>  The National Asthma Programme is currently working on developing a National Model of Care for Asthma.  The National Clinic Lead for Asthma, supported by the programme's GP Lead, have responsibility in the HSE for the development of the model of care for asthma.  The Integrated Services Directorate has operational responsibility for implementation of the programme, supported by the Clinical Strategy &amp;amp; Programmes Directorate.  The proposed implementation plan will detail how physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals will work with engaged patients to make the clinical decisions most appropriate to the patient's circumstances; while collaborating with specialist colleagues in providing a safe, seamless patient experience within the health system in Ireland.  This is a key deliverable of the National Asthma Programme for 2013.  The National Asthma Progmamme had to prioritise the submission of the Adult Asthma Emergency Guidelines to the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee which had a deadline of March 2013.  The Model of Care for Asthma will be ready for stakeholder consultation by the end of quarter 2.  It is anticipated that it will be completed by the end of quarter 3 this year.<\/p><p><br \/>  As 85% of asthma is managed in primary care without the requirement for hospital specialist services, the National Asthma Programme is currently undertaking work to look at providing a yearly programme of assessment for asthma in primary care called Chronic Disease Watch - Asthma (also referred to as <i>Asthma Check<\/i>).  The development of <i>Asthma Check<\/i>   is being done in conjunction with the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP).  <i>Asthma Check<\/i> outlines the step-by-step process for implementation of guideline based asthma management in primary care to deliver optimal outcomes for patients.  The aim being to facilitate the implementation of best practice asthma guidelines in primary care in order to improve asthma control.  This will reduce acute exacerbations and thus their associated overall costs with fewer hospital bed days and less time off school \/ work.  It will also ensure that patients with asthma maximize their quality of life.<\/p><p><br \/>  The National Asthma Programme expects that savings would be made in, GP out-of-hours visits, Emergency Department attendances and bed days used by implementing the programme.  In addition, a 10% reduction in asthma deaths each year is targeted by the programme.  Consideration is being given to carrying out an economic analysis of the implementation of the acute asthma guidelines with the support of HIQA.  I am satisfied that good progress can be made in the ongoing development of the National Asthma Programme in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRBB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asthma Incidence","counter":2773,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRBB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":2774,"qnumday":637,"qnumall":"[22466\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRBB00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his Department's estimate of the number of persons here who suffer from asthma; the number of these who are covered by a medical card; the way these figures have been determined; and if it is possible to derive an accurate estimate from PCRS data.","asker":"1178","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2775,"content":"<p>The HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service has advised that it does not currently collect information regarding an applicant's illness.

The number of assessment reports received in 2012 was 3,505 which is over 400 applications more than in 2010.  It is worth noting that in the period 2010-2012 over 8,200 reports were completed.  While the HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process given the number and complexity of cases, it is endeavouring to address the issue from available resources.<\/p><p>  While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.  The HSE has issued guidance to its staff that where there is a delay in the assessment process, this should not affect the delivery of necessary and appropriate interventions identified for a particular child.<\/p><p>  In addition targeted action plans have been put in place since early 2011.  Measures have included: prioritising assessments, holding additional clinics, contracting the private sector to conduct assessments and reconfiguring resources to target areas of greatest need.  These plans are monitored on a monthly basis by the HSE centrally.<\/p><p>  Following the publication of a report commissioned from the National Disability Authority by the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive, a major emphasis is being placed on reconfiguring disability services for children into geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams as part of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme which is underway.  The NDA report indicated that where integrated teams were operating, the assessment of need process ran more smoothly.  It found that there was no one single solution to remove all of the challenges to operating a statutory assessment of need.  A meeting involving the Department, the HSE and the NDA has been arranged for early June to discuss the Report further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRDD00800","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Services Provision","counter":2878,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRDD00850"},{"type":"question","counter":2879,"qnumday":684,"qnumall":"[22823\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRDD00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the major collective effect of the cuts to personal assistants and the mobility allowance for children and adults with a disability; and if he will reverse these cuts.","asker":"1017","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2880,"content":"<p>The Government currently provides funding of over &euro;1.5 billion to the Disability Services Programme, through the Health Service Executive's (HSE) National Service Plan for 2013 and is committed to protecting frontline services for people with disabilities to the greatest possible extent.

These reforms will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for medicines resulting in savings for taxpayers and patients.  The Bill passed Report Stage on the 9th of May and will return to the Seanad on the 22nd of May.  It is hoped that the Bill will complete its passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas shortly thereafter.  It is not possible, at this juncture, to provide accurate figures regarding potential savings resulting from the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing, as these depend on various factors including prevailing prices, number of competitors, availability of substitute products, and market dynamics.<\/p><p>  Following intensive negotiations involving the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), the HSE and the Department of Health, a major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded in October last.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs; a lowering of the drugs bill to the State; timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400m over 3 years.  &euro;210 million from the gross savings will make available new drugs to patients over 3 years.  Thus, the deal will result in a net reduction in the HSE expenditure on drugs of about &euro;190m.<\/p><p>  The Department of Health and the HSE have also successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs.  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.<\/p><p>In addition, the recently established HSE Medicines Management Programme has identified &lsquo;preferred drugs&rsquo; for prescribers when prescribing Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) or statin medication for patients.  This is the first time that the State has introduced a preferred drug initiative.  PPIs are prescribed for patients with peptic ulcer disease and\/or reflux and statin medication is for high cholesterol.  The preferred PPI is Lansoprazole and the preferred statin is Simvastatin.  The HSE is asking doctors to prescribe these preferred drugs in order to save money, both for patients who pay for their medication and to deliver savings of an estimated &euro;15million for the taxpayer.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, the European Commission has completed its eighth review of the EU-IMF financial assistance programme for Ireland and has published the technical report by the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs (ECFIN) which assesses programme implementation by the Irish authorities.  The report published on 28th January 2013 identifies areas where the joint EC-ECB-IMF mission considers that further efficiencies could be achieved in the health system.  This includes compulsory prescription by active ingredient rather than by brand name with exceptions only for 'non-substitutability' cases.  The implications of this recommendation are being examined by my Department at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRDD03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services, Cost of Medicines","counter":2911,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRDD03150"},{"type":"question","counter":2912,"qnumday":697,"qnumall":"[23013\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRDD03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which drug costs have fluctuated in each of the past five years to date; the way this has affected the budgetary situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":2913,"qnumday":698,"qnumall":"[23014\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400069#WRDD03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which a rise in costs of any particular or specific drugs has been identified over the past five years to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2914,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 697 and 698 together.<\/p><p>The costs of drugs and medicines for the last 5 years are set out in the table below (corresponding figures for 2012 are not yet available).<\/p><p><table><tr><th> -<\/th><th><div><b>2011<\/b><b>(000s)<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>2010<\/b><b>(000s)<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>2009<\/b><b>(000s)<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>2008<\/b><b>(000s)<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>2007<\/b><b>(000s)<\/b><\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Cost of Drugs and Medicines<\/td><td><br \/><br \/>&euro;1,467,575<\/td><td><br \/><br \/>&euro;1,533,619<\/td><td><br \/><br \/>&euro;1,659,931<\/td><td><br \/><br \/>&euro;1,595,089<\/td><td><br \/><br \/>&euro;1,480,201<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>There has been a general price freeze in operation in Ireland for medicines since the mid 1990's.

The Irish Medicines Board has indicated that as of 12 May 2013 there are 49 cases with a clinical diagnosis of narcolepsy, with symptom development post pandemic vaccination.  There are a number of cases still under investigation. The majority of cases are in the five to twenty two years age group. The Health Service Executive has responsibility for health service delivery and at my request, the HSE developed a range of appropriate services and supports to address the needs of this group.  Together, the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills provide a very comprehensive range of services and supports to those affected.<\/p><p>  These supports and services include access to rapid diagnosis, clear treatment pathways, temporary medical cards and reimbursement of expenses incurred. This includes expenses for counselling services for individuals and also for families of children affected by narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination,  in cases where such services are not already available through the HSE.  Multi-disciplinary assessments which allow for appropriate individualised health and educational supports to be put in place are ongoing.  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is also engaging with the HSE and with the individual schools and parents of children concerned to identify and provide educational supports for the children and adolescents affected.<\/p><p>  The HSE's advocacy unit is in regular contact with the support group SOUND and last met representatives of the group on 28 February 2013.

There are now over 3,500 individual gatherings confirmed on the Gathering website. These include clan gatherings, festivals, special sporting events and concerts taking place all across the country throughout the year.

However, following publication of the necessary statutory Orders in advance of construction, the Minister for Regional Development&rsquo;s decision to proceed with the\u00a0A5 was challenged by a group known as the Alternative A5 Alliance.<\/p><p>  While the Northern High Court rejected the majority of the applicants&rsquo; grounds of challenge,\u00a0one was upheld.\u00a0 The judge found that an appropriate assessment under the Habitats Directive should have been carried out on the scheme.\u00a0 On that basis at a further hearing on 8 April 2013 the judge confirmed he would quash the Orders relating to the A5 scheme.<\/p><p>  The project was discussed at the North South Ministerial Council Transport Sectoral on 17 April and the Minister for Regional Development now plans to undertake the environmental assessment required under the Habitats Directive.

The estimated expenditure on child benefit in 2013 is around &euro;1.9 billion and it is currently paid to around 611,000 families in respect of some 1.16 million children. <\/p><p>  The Government is conscious that child benefit, as a universal payment, can be an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment. The social protection system also provides assistance to low income families with children through the payment of qualified child increases on primary social welfare payments and through the family income supplement payment. Both of these provide a level of assistance which is directly or indirectly linked with a household&rsquo;s income situation.<\/p><p>  Achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including child benefit, raises complex issues about the effectiveness and the efficiency of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes can be achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and its report on this issue was published in February.<\/p><p>  This report makes important recommendations on how child benefit could be maintained as a universal payment while reforming the current system of child and family income supports so as to better target those who need these supports most. Given the range of complex issues involved, including fiscal, operational and legal considerations, as well as the implications for reforms in terms of child poverty and employment incentive outcomes, the Government has made no decision at this time on the core recommendations of the report.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that the report will now contribute to the policy debate on the matter. In considering the proposals to reform the structure of child and family income support payments, including the balance between income supports and services, such as childcare, I expect that Government will also take into account further work by the Advisory Group on the issue of social protection and taxation supports for working age persons and more general developments in the budgetary and fiscal situation. <\/p><p>  The provision of childcare services, such as those supported by the Early Childhood Care and Education scheme, is primarily a policy matter for my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Frances Fitzgerald T.D.  However, any proposal to fund additional childcare services from cuts to the child benefit scheme would require a Government decision within an overall budgetary context on which no indications can be given at the present time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400070#WRP01200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":3095,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400070#WRP01300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme Relocation Options","counter":3094,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400070#WRP01250"},{"type":"question","counter":3095,"qnumday":379,"qnumall":"[22167\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400070#WRP01300","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"when persons with turbary rights on a bog (details supplied) in County Laois will be granted rights at an alternative location; the number of persons who are still waiting for this matter to be resolved in this area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":3096,"content":"<p>55 applications for compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme have been received and acknowledged by my Department in respect of the raised bog special area of conservation referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question. 10 of these applicants have expressed an interest in relocation to a non-designated bog. 40 payments and 5 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of the applications received. <\/p><p>  Bord na M&oacute;na undertook a preliminary assessment of a potential relocation site for those applicants who have expressed an interest in relocation, on behalf of my Department.

This is equivalent to 31,925 Gigawatt hours (GWh) or a reduction in annual CO2 emissions of around 7.7 Mega tonnes (Mt).  Recognising that Government must lead by example, we are committed to achieving a 33% reduction in public sector energy use by 2020.  <\/p><p>  The second Action Plan follows a similar approach to its predecessor, identifying realisable but ambitious actions across six areas: Public Sector, Residential, Business, Transport, Energy Supply, and Cross-Sectoral.  The Plan contains 97 actions, each of which will play a part in securing a more sustainable energy future for Ireland.  Of the 97 actions, the following five will play an integral role in the delivery of the national target:  <\/p><p>  1. In the Public sector, we will introduce a series of obligations on public sector bodies to address consumption, procurement and reporting of energy use.  <\/p><p>  As part of our Action Plan for Jobs commitments, we will issue in June this year a mandate to public sector organisations with an annual energy spend of &euro;500,000 or more, to go to the market to identify solutions for the delivery of energy reduction services.  In 2010-2011 the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and my Department developed and launched a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system to record each individual public body&rsquo;s progress towards the 33% target.  A database of over 30,000 meters has been established to enable the accurate gathering of public sector data.  This database is being developed with linkages to the National Procurement service and will lead to better procurement of energy supplies for the public sector.  A report on public sector consumption will be published later this year.  <\/p><p>  2. We will institute a national Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) process to deliver innovative models of retrofitting and financing of energy efficiency measures in the commercial and public sectors.  <\/p><p>  Work on the National Energy Performance Contracting Policy Framework, which will standardise energy performance contracting in Ireland and provide a robust process for establishing investment-ready projects, is well advanced and the first version of the Framework will be published shortly.  The Framework will be underpinned by an Energy Efficiency Fund, to which Government has already committed &euro;35 million in the 2013 Budget as seed capital. <\/p><p>  3. We will introduce an appropriate Pay-As-You-Save (PAYS) model for Ireland to replace existing exchequer supports for domestic and non-domestic energy efficiency upgrade measures.<\/p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to roll out a Better Energy Financing (formerly known as Pay-As-You-Save) energy retrofit scheme for domestic buildings after 2013.  The Better Energy Financing (BEF) model proposes that the current suite of Exchequer funded grants for energy efficiency measures, excluding the low-income housing retrofit programme, will be replaced by a new financing scheme open to the residential and non-residential sectors.  This scheme will allow consumers to secure upfront financing for energy efficiency upgrades, the repayment of which will be funded from savings on their energy bill generated from the retrofit.<\/p><p>  My Department has put in place a project team to design a replacement retrofit financing scheme under the direction of a Project Board representing key state and industry stakeholders.  Project resources have been drawn from industry experts and elsewhere in the public sector.  It is planned that the design of the scheme will be developed over the coming months and that a public consultation process will be undertaken later this year.  <\/p><p>  4. The Better Energy programme will deliver energy efficiency improvements across a number of sectors including energy saving targets for energy suppliers.  <\/p><p>  The NEEAP emphasises the role of market actors in facilitating the delivery of energy savings, with the introduction of energy saving targets for energy suppliers a key measure underpinning the delivery of the 2020 energy saving target.  A move to a market-based programme is a logical step in mainstreaming energy efficiency within the energy supply sector in line with EU ambitions.  <\/p><p>  To date 18 energy supply companies have signed voluntary energy savings agreements, with a programmatic target of 875GWh for the period 2011-2013.  I am currently considering proposals for the period beyond 2013.<\/p><p>  5. A Cross-Departmental Implementation Group will soon be established to ensure that all the actions contained in this Plan are delivered.  <\/p><p>  The Implementation Group, chaired by my Department, has been established and is meeting quarterly to ensure delivery of the actions contained in the NEEAP.

Ireland&rsquo;s priority is the safety of the Irish people and the protection of our environment, including the shared marine environment of the Irish Sea. <\/p><p>  The UK published its draft Energy National Policy Statement in November 2009, which signalled its intention to construct ten new nuclear power stations at sites judged as potentially suitable. This was subsequently revised in October 2010 when the number of planned stations was reduced to eight, following the dropping of two sites originally proposed for Cumbria, near the existing Sellafield facility.  Since the original announcement in 2009, Ireland has written twice at ministerial level to the UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change outlining concerns about potential environmental impacts in Ireland and in the Irish Sea. The key issues of concern include the assessments by the UK of effects on the environment, management of radioactive waste, and the rationale underpinning the proposed justification decision for new nuclear facilities. This engagement at ministerial level has been supported and informed by a continuing dialogue at official level where Irish officials engage, and raise concerns where appropriate, with UK counterparts directly engaged in the development and implementation of the plans. <\/p><p>  I note the legal proceedings being brought by An Taisce in relation to Hinkley Point and I respect the rights of An Taisce, as an independent body, to take such a course of action.

This assessment will consider both routine operations and a range of postulated accident scenarios at the plants.

Given the current economic situation and the high level of unemployment, the LCDP is more relevant than ever insofar as it creates employment opportunities and gives those most distant from the labour market the skills to access training and jobs.

Approximately 40% of the LCDP budget is allocated to the goal, and under it, a range of services are delivered and supported.  These are diverse and range from employment mediation supports, programmes to reduce youth unemployment, actions designed to engage with employers to promote local job opportunities, labour market focused education and training supports, supports for social enterprise, and the delivery of services for individuals who are seeking to set up their own business.<\/p><p>The Programme is delivered at a local level by the national network of local development companies (LDCs).

No. 326 of 2012), which were given effect following a public consultation process, provide for a ban on the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of bituminous (or &quot;smoky&quot;) fuel inside specified ban areas.  The Regulations introduced some improved and updated provisions that will help to ensure that the smoky coal ban remains fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of residential fuels.\u00a0 These are as follows:   <\/p><p>- most existing smoky coal ban area boundaries were revised to take recent urban development into account;<\/p><p>- seven new\u00a0towns were added to the ban from May 2013 - Greystones, Letterkenny, Mullingar, Navan, Newbridge, Portlaoise and Wicklow Town; and<\/p><p>- a prohibition on the burning of bituminous fuel to complement the established ban on marketing, sale and distribution.\u00a0<\/p><p><br \/>  The single focus of the previous regulations on prohibiting the sale, as distinct from the burning, of &quot;smoky&quot; coal meant that the burning of such coal inside ban areas undermined the intent and purpose of the ban and the supply of such fuel was known to be facilitated by businesses that had established premises just outside ban area boundaries to serve ban area residents as their main market.  The revised boundaries and prohibition on the burning of smoky coal inside ban areas support the effectiveness of the ban in the areas concerned by restricting such activities and hence closing the loophole.  These updated provisions were broadly welcomed by the EPA, local authorities and the import and supply industry, on the basis that they provide for more effective legislation.  My Department continues to meet regularly with the EPA, local authorities and the industry representatives to discuss the ongoing implementation and enforcement of the Regulations.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the case of new towns that were added to the ban, a lead-in period of eight months was provided to allow local authorities and fuel retailers time to adapt as necessary to the new regulatory requirements in preparation for the switch-over to smokeless fuels.  Following the inclusion of these areas, the smoky coal ban applies in all towns with a population greater than 15,000 people.  This provides for greater consistency in urban air quality standards throughout the State by extending the cleaner air benefits of the ban to all large towns.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Regulations also require that all smoky coal sold outside ban areas for residential use outside those areas must have a sulphur content of no more than 0.7%.\u00a0 This compares to a maximum permitted sulphur content of 2% for bituminous coal sold in Northern Ireland. <font color=\"#333333\"> &amp;#8206;<\/font>Coal bagging operators and certain solid fuel suppliers trading in smoky coal must demonstrate the compliance of their product with the 0.7% sulphur limit and be registered with the EPA.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland has prepared an annual traceability audit system, known as SWiFT 7, for demonstrating compliance.  All retailers who trade in smoky coal must ensure that their suppliers are registered with the EPA and must hold a record to this effect with their supplier's registration number. <\/p><p><br \/>  Despite these regulatory improvements, I recognise that different standards applying to coal between separate jurisdictions presents a continuing challenge for enforcement.  On 6 May I announced that a joint North-South study is being commissioned to examine air pollution from residential smoky coal and to consider the potential policy options to reduce such emissions. <font color=\"#333333\"> <\/font>A closer alignment of solid fuel policy and legislation on an all-island basis would aid enforcement, eliminate unfair competitive advantage, protect air quality and allow the benefits derived from the ban to potentially be further extended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRS00600","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Remuneration","counter":3285,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRS00650"},{"type":"question","counter":3286,"qnumday":445,"qnumall":"[22788\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRS00700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of personnel in whole-time equivalent terms in his Department and in bodies under the aegis of his Department in each of the following earnings brackets: less than &euro;20,000, &euro;20,001 to &euro;30,000, &euro;30,001 to &euro;40,000, &euro;40,001 to &euro;50,000, &euro;50,001 to &euro;60,000, &euro;60,001 to &euro;70,000, &euro;70,001 to &euro;80,000, &euro;80,001 to &euro;90,000, &euro;90,001 to &euro;100,000, &euro;100,000 to &euro;125,000, &euro;125,001 to &euro;150,000, &euro;150,001 to &euro;175,000, &euro;175,001 to &euro;200,000, &euro;200,001 to &euro;250,000, &euro;250,001 to &euro;300,000, &euro;300,001 to &euro;350,000, &euro;350,001 to &euro;400,000, &euro;400,001 to &euro;450,000, &euro;450,001 to &euro;500,000, and more than &euro;500,000.","asker":"1178","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":3287,"content":"<p>The information requested in respect of my Department is set out in the following table.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Salary Range<\/th><th>Number of Staff WTE*<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&amp;gt; &euro;500,000<\/td><td>0.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;450,001 - &euro;500,000<\/td><td>0.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;400,001 - &euro;450,000<\/td><td>0.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;350,001 - &euro;400,000<\/td><td>0.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;300,001 - &euro;350,000<\/td><td>0.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;250,001 - &euro;300,000<\/td><td>0.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;200,001 - &euro;250,000<\/td><td>0.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;175,001 - &euro;200,000 <\/td><td>1.00**<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;150,000 - &euro;175,000<\/td><td>0.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;125,001 - &euro;150,000<\/td><td>7.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;100,001 - &euro;125,000<\/td><td>16.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;90,001 - &euro;100,000<\/td><td>44.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;80,001 - &euro;90,000<\/td><td>52.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;70,001 - &euro;80,000<\/td><td>103.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;60,001 - &euro;70,000<\/td><td>32.20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;50,001 - &euro;60,000<\/td><td>172.46<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;40,001 - &euro;50,000<\/td><td>155.10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;30,001 - &euro;40,000<\/td><td>120.16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;20,001 - &euro;30,000<\/td><td>64.95<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&amp;lt; &euro;20,000<\/td><td>11.25<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>* Denotes whole time equivalent.<\/p><p>** The current salary of the Secretary General of my Department is &euro;215,590 per annum.

Where any borrower, either from a local authority or from a private financial institution, is facing difficulties in meeting mortgage repayments, they should engage proactively and constructively with the lender to seek to achieve an agreed solution.  The services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service are also available to such borrowers and support is available through the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme.<\/p><p>Local authorities have long been the lenders of last resort servicing the housing loans needs of less affluent members of society.  In the present economic circumstances it is to be anticipated that the ability of some borrowers to service housing loans may become restricted and that a number of loans may fall into arrears.  Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers, and they have demonstrated sensitivity over the years in dealing with such cases.  In March 2010 my Department issued guidelines to local authorities, based upon the Central Bank's first Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, which continued the tradition of handling arrears in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.<br \/>  To reflect the content of the Central Bank's revised Code of Conduct &ndash; which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt &ndash; my Department issued updated guidance in June 2012 to local authorities in consultation with the County and City Managers Association.  This will further enable local authorities to provide a range of flexible repayment options for households in difficulty.  In particular, the introduction of a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which closely mirrors the suite of options available in the commercial sector, presents borrowers in difficulty with a range of alternative payment agreements, including those referred to in the Question, which can be accessed to ease the particular circumstances of each case.  This process features a standard set of options including, in cases of certain unsustainable mortgages, the facility of mortgage-to-rent.  Local authorities have been restructuring loans for some time using their own internal practices. The introduction of these revised guidelines standardises the approach across the whole sector, introduces a systematic structure to this area and provides borrowers with a transparent and accessible model for arrears resolution.<\/p><p>Regarding the level of repossessions in the last three years, my Department publishes a wide range of housing statistics which can be found at <i>www.environ.ie.<\/i>  The total numbers of forced and voluntary repossessions obtained by local authorities in 2010, 2011 and 2012 are set out in the following table.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Forced<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>54<\/td><td>73<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Voluntary<\/td><td>73<\/td><td>49<\/td><td>64<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRS02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":3318,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRS02900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Status","counter":3317,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRS02850"},{"type":"question","counter":3318,"qnumday":457,"qnumall":"[22151\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRS02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the opportunities for appeal or reconsideration of an application, either within his Department or through the courts, that exist for a person (details supplied) who has been issued with a deportation order; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1045","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3319,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned arrived in the State on 8th November 2003 as a short-term visitor.

To support the achievement of these aims, the Act provides for the establishment of an independent Charities Regulatory Authority.<\/p><p>  I am aware of the recent Prime Time programme which reported, amongst other things, on the issue of theft from charity clothing banks.  Theft is an offence contrary to section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.  A person convicted upon indictment of theft is liable to imprisonment for up to 10 years and\/or an unlimited fine.<\/p><p>  I am also concerned about the reported practice of some collectors of clothing who convey the impression in their promotional literature that they are collecting on behalf of a charity, when this may not actually be the case.  This may lead some people to donate to such collections in the belief that they are supporting a charity and helping to alleviate hardship. This is unfair both to donors whose intention in donating such items is to help those in need, and to bona fide charities that may lose out on donations as a result. It is an offence under section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001 to make gain or cause loss to others by deception.<\/p><p>  In addition to these existing measures under the Criminal Justice Acts, while the Charities Act 2009 does not deal directly with the regulation of Irish charity clothing banks or collections, it does contain measures aimed at preventing the abuse of charitable status. Under section 46 of the Charities Act, it is an offence for an organisation that is not a registered charity to describe itself or its activities in such terms as would cause members of the public to reasonably believe that it is a charitable organisation. This section cannot be commenced until the statutory Register of Charities, also provided for under the Charities Act, is in place.<\/p><p>  While further implementation of the Charities Act and creation of the Register of Charities have been delayed for financial reasons, the Government remains committed to progressing the implementation of the Act and putting in place a dedicated regulatory framework for charities in line with the provisions of the Act. My Department has been examining how best this can be done in the current financial climate.  As part of this work, my Department recently undertook a consultation on key issues, including the creation of the Register of Charities. The submissions received are currently being reviewed and I look forward to publishing the results in due course and giving a further indication of the Government's timeframe for the introduction of an operational Charities Regulatory Authority and full implementation of the Charities Act 2009.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRT03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Remuneration","counter":3389,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRT03550"},{"type":"question","counter":3390,"qnumday":482,"qnumall":"[22793\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRT03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of personnel in whole-time equivalent terms in his Department and in bodies under the aegis of his Department in each of the following earnings brackets: less than &euro;20,000, &euro;20,001 to &euro;30,000, &euro;30,001 to &euro;40,000, &euro;40,001 to &euro;50,000, &euro;50,001 to &euro;60,000, &euro;60,001 to &euro;70,000, &euro;70,001 to &euro;80,000, &euro;80,001 to &euro;90,000, &euro;90,001 to &euro;100,000, &euro;100,000 to &euro;125,000, &euro;125,001 to &euro;150,000, &euro;150,001 to &euro;175,000, &euro;175,001 to &euro;200,000, &euro;200,001 to &euro;250,000, &euro;250,001 to &euro;300,000, &euro;300,001 to &euro;350,000, &euro;350,001 to &euro;400,000, &euro;400,001 to &euro;450,000, &euro;450,001 to &euro;500,000, and more than &euro;500,000.","asker":"1178","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":3391,"content":"<p>The information sought by the Deputy in respect of staff of my Department and agencies under its aegis is set out in the following table.

The evidence in relation to mixed fisheries across western waters indicates a consistently high level of discards and presents a significant problem for all EU Member States  involved in fishing EU waters.<\/p><p>  Finding practical and implementable solutions to the wasteful practice of discarding fish is a major component of the current reform proposals for the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).

I have prioritised securing final agreement between the EU Fisheries Council and the Parliament on reform of the CFP throughout the Irish EU Presidency and we are making considerable progress in this regard.  The Fisheries Council which commenced yesterday and continues today is seeking to agree a compromise package on the CFP reform, including in relation to dealing with discards, with a view to finalising negotiations with the EU Parliament and the Commission before the end of the Irish Presidency.<\/p><p>  Ireland has been to the forefront in the drive to reduce and eliminate discards for many years and I was delighted to launch an Irish &ldquo;discard&rdquo; atlas in 2011, which is a detailed compendium of discards by the Irish Fleet targeting whitefish on a stock by stock and area by area basis.  This was the first publication of its kind and placed Ireland firmly to the fore in the debate on eliminating discards and assisted in advancing the case for a phased elimination of discards as part of the CFP reform package. I have urged other Member States to produce similar publications for their fleet.   It can be expected that discard levels are similar for similar fleets operating in the same fisheries across the EU.<\/p><p>  In relation to sea bass, the EU Commission has not yet advised if it intends to pursue a TAC and quota regime for sea bass for 2014.

The store lamb trade failed to take off in Autumn 2012, largely driven by a poor pasture conditions (limited grass, forage) and lack of confidence on the part of store lamb finishers who were reluctant to buy expensive feed. Demand within the traditional markets for light lamb (Portugal and indirectly Spain) has also been poor over the last two years due to the economic downturn in these regions. Indeed total imports of sheep meat into Portugal and Spain have fallen by 26% and 42% respectively.<\/p><p>  Bearing in mind the difficulties in recent times with these two outlets, the industry and Bord Bia are exploring additional new markets for light lambs for 2013.  These markets include France and the UK, which are the core export markets for Irish lamb, and Sweden, Belgium and Germany, which have been delivering positive growth over the last 2-3 years.  However it must be recognised that light lambs (&amp;lt;13kg) are generally not favoured by consumers in these regions and it is likely that lambs will need to be finished up to a weight of 17kg+.   I understand that Bord Bia has been discussing with the industry on how this could best be done, for example overwinter the lambs and dispose of them in the following Spring. <\/p><p>  Research can also be used to assist light lamb producers to bring the carcass to an acceptable weight specification. The Teagasc BETTER farm programme has a number of hill farms around the country. The aim of this programme is to establish focal points for the on-farm implementation, development and evaluation of technology that is relevant to hill sheep farmers. Close collaboration between Teagasc Researchers &amp;amp; Advisers with these farms aims to help improve profitability of hill sheep production.<\/p><p>  The recently launched Sheep Technology Adoption Programme (STAP) contains a measure designed to help improve the weight, quality and thus price of hill lambs.<\/p><p>  My Department is providing significant funding to Sheep Ireland to help deliver on the significant profit potential that breed improvement can deliver. A number of hill flocks are involved in data recording initiatives which will help identify the most profitable animals to breed from. <\/p><p>  All of these initiatives should help hill farmers in dealing with the vagaries of the market and in matching specification with market requirements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRV04700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":3548,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRW00100"},{"type":"question","counter":3549,"qnumday":534,"qnumall":"[22538\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRW00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the expected total expenditure under the agri-environment schemes under the common agriculture policy programme 2007-2013; the percentage of this that will be co-funded by the Exchequer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":3550,"content":"<p>Expenditure on agri - environment schemes over the period 2007 to 2013 is estimated at &euro;2.015 billion, details as follows: -<\/p><p><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>REPs<\/th><th>AEOS<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>&euro;m.<\/td><td>&euro;m.<\/td><td>&euro;m.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2007<\/td><td>311.750<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>311.750<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>312.080<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>312.080<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>341.123<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>341.123<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>321.864<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>321.864<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>260.952<\/td><td>14.107<\/td><td>275.059<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>198.266<\/td><td>54.947<\/td><td>253.213<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013 estimated<\/td><td>148.575<\/td><td>51.800<\/td><td>200.375<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Estimated Total 2007 to 2013<\/td><td>1,894.610<\/td><td>120.854<\/td><td>2,015.464<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>When EU co funding is taken into account, the net Exchequer cost of funding eligible expenditure on REPs and AEOS agri environment measures is, subject to EU funding limitations, 45% and 25% respectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRW00300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":3551,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRW00400"},{"type":"question","counter":3552,"qnumday":535,"qnumall":"[22539\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRW00500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the expected total expenditure under the disadvantaged area scheme under the common agriculture policy programme 2007-2013; the percentage of this that will be co-funded by the Exchequer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":3553,"qnumday":542,"qnumall":"[22546\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRW00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the total expenditure under the disadvantaged area scheme each year under the disadvantaged area scheme 2007 to 2013; the expected expenditure under this scheme this year including any payments under the 2013 scheme that will be paid in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":3554,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 535 and 542 together.<\/p><p>Total provision available under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme as provided for in the Rural Development Programme 2007 &ndash; 2013 is &euro;1,799M.

The EU Sugar Regime underwent a radical reform in 2005 following major EU decisions to restructure the industry. A temporary restructuring scheme was introduced with the aim of reducing EU sugar production. Greencore, the holder of the entire Irish sugar quota, availed of this voluntary scheme, dismantled its facilities and ceased production in 2006. Ireland secured &euro;353million as part of the reform package of which &euro;220million went to beet growers, &euro;127million to Greencore and &euro;6million to machinery contractors.<\/p><p><br \/>  Post reform, production in the EU is now concentrated in 18 Member States. The present regime runs from 1 September 2006 to the 30 September 2015. There is no mechanism under the present EU Regulations which would allow for the re-instatement of the sugar quota for the growing of sugar beet in Ireland for the production of sugar. Of course, sugar beet is still grown in Ireland as a fodder crop.<\/p><p><br \/>  In 2011 I met with two separate groups which had conducted feasibility studies, into the possibility of rebuilding a new sugar industry in the country. At both meetings, I stated that any venture to develop a combined sugar\/bioethanol production facility would have to be a commercial proposition, financed in total by investors and interested parties and make sound economic sense in order to be viable. <\/p><p><br \/>  I also further suggested to both groups, the desirability of there being only one single proposition in play, as both studies had indicated a potential for only one such viable project and both groups had appeared to accept the reasonableness of this position at the time. Only recently, I re-stated that any business plan for a new venture in this area, would need to be competitive and that it would have to justify the very substantial investment to build a new facility.<\/p><p><br \/>  In recent discussions at the Council of Agriculture Ministers, which I am chairing under our EU Presidency responsibilities, a deep divide emerged between one group of Member States, including Ireland, which favoured abolition of quotas in 2015 and another group of Member States which wished to extend quotas to 2020 and beyond. As current President of the Council, I made a compromise proposal that garnered the support of a large majority of Member States, to extend the quota regime for a further two years until 30 September 2017 when it will finally cease.  This is the formal negotiating mandate for the Agriculture Council, as we enter the final phase of the ongoing CAP Reform negotiations<i>. <\/i>  The compromise has been welcomed strongly by those who want to re-establish a sugar industry in Ireland. It is my job to ensure that Ireland either has a quota or alternatively can produce sugar in the absence of EU quotas. I would, however, encourage caution on making decisions to planting sugar beet crops or any other investments until we know when Ireland will have the capacity to produce sugar again and when the regime is likely to end.<\/p><p><br \/>  The European Parliament is in favour of extending quotas to 2020. The Council is now in detailed trilogue discussions between the EU Commission and the Parliament on the general CAP Reform package, including the future of the EU Sugar Regime, and I will do everything I can to ensure that we end the Sugar Quota Regime in the EU as soon as possible, so that revival efforts here can get off the ground, as long as the commercial case can be made for them. I am hopeful that I can bring these talks to a successful conclusion before the end of Ireland's Presidency role on 30 June next. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRW05300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Grants","counter":3601,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRW05400"},{"type":"question","counter":3602,"qnumday":552,"qnumall":"[22808\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRW05500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a forestry payment will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":3603,"content":"<p>Our records show that the applicant is registered with the Department&rsquo;s Online Services since May 2012.

This inspection regime covers both the eligibility of land declared to drawn down payments and also cross compliance aspects, to ensure adherence with EU regulatory requirements in the areas of public, animal and plant health, environment and animal welfare.<\/p><p>  In order to be eligible under the single payment scheme and other area based schemes, an applicant must ensure that all agricultural land is maintained in good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC.  Issues relating to control of rushes must, therefore, be seen in this overall context.  Farmers can keep grassland in GAEC by conducting an agricultural activity on it, such as grazing, harvesting forage crops, or by topping.  Grasslands continue to be eligible where it is evident that the stocking rate on the land is sufficient and, for example, keeps rushes under control and avoids their proliferation.  In such situations, the reality is there may not be a necessity to cut rushes.  However, where a farmer cuts rushes as part of management practice, with the exception of certain designated lands, there are no restrictions on when this is done, enabling the task to be carried out at any time throughout the year once conditions are suitable.<\/p><p>  I am acutely aware of the weather related difficulties being experienced by farmers and of their concern in respect of their ability to meet the various compliance requirements.  When conducting inspections, my Department&rsquo;s personnel take prevailing weather conditions into account.  For example, where the practice is to cut rushes and it has not been possible to top them in the current year, inspectors will take a broader assessment including whether there is evidence that they have been cut in previous years.<\/p><p>  Where land is deemed ineligible, this, in the main, is a result of the inclusion of ineligible areas or features and where it is not being used for an agricultural purpose.

The regulations covering production include the European Communities (Hygiene of Foodstuffs) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 369 of 2006), and the European Communities (General Food Law) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No 747 of 2007).<\/p><p>  Bottled water plants also come within the definition of food business operators under EU legislation and, as such, must meet the requirements set down in EC Regulation (EC) 852\/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs which was transposed into national law in 2006. Consequently the operators of water production\/bottling plants must ensure that they meet the high food safety standards set out in the legislation. <\/p><p>  In addition to the general hygiene requirements above at the processing plants, there are separate requirements in relation to bottled water. These are set down in the European Communities (Natural Mineral Waters, Spring Waters and Other Waters in Bottles or Containers) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No 225 of 2007). These requirements include microbiological, chemical and labelling parameters, including sale descriptions. There is on-going testing of all bottled water facilities and the frequency of testing increases in line with production volumes. Business operators must put in place a safety management system which ensures the water is safe for consumption and meets all legal requirements.<\/p><p>  The enforcement of food law is a matter for the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).   Bottled water plants are inspected by Environmental Health Services (EHS) from the Health Service Executive (HSE) operating under a Service Contract with the FSAI and are inspected regularly. Samples are taken and tested generally as part of routine inspections &ndash; the EHS are supported by the HSE&rsquo;s network of official microbiological and chemical laboratories in this regard. <\/p><p>  In December 2011, the FSAI released the results of a major survey of the microbiological safety and quality of bottled water in Ireland. It showed a significant improvement in the microbiological quality of bottled water since the previous survey was conducted in 2007. When samples were tested against all four of the microbiological standards in the legislation, 2% were found to be unsatisfactory (compared to 7% of similar samples in the 2007 survey).   In addition, where non-compliances were detected, manufacturers were required to take immediate corrective actions.<\/p><p>  In collaboration with the FSAI, the HSE organises annual programmes of testing for all foods on sale in Ireland, including bottled water. In 2012 the HSE, as part of the annual surveillance programme, completed 410 analyses on samples of bottled water. No recalls were required during the year.<\/p><p>  The FSAI and EHS have worked with the bottled water industry in Ireland to develop guidance on safe and hygienic production of bottled water resulting in an updated national hygiene standard available through the National Standards Authority of Ireland. The FSAI and HSE continue to monitor production sites and retail outlets and to investigate customer complaints.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRY01800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Staffing","counter":3669,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRY01850"},{"type":"question","counter":3670,"qnumday":574,"qnumall":"[22411\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRY01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he intends to allow dental health nurses in the Dublin area apply for the planned new targeted voluntary redundancy scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3671,"content":"<p>The health service is required to achieve a workforce of 98,955 whole time equivalents (WTEs) by the end of 2013.

The dossier is complex but work is progressing well.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Presidency team aims to complete a first examination of this entire Proposal by the end of the Irish Presidency.  The Irish Presidency team has also been working outside of Council Working Party meetings to review the technical annexes of the Proposal. A number of informal meetings have taken place with Ms. Glenis Willmott MEP, rapporteur on this dossier.<\/p><p><br \/>  There have also been 5 meetings of the Council Working Party on Pharmaceuticals &amp;amp; Medical Devices dedicated to examination of the two large Proposals on Medical Devices and In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices.  These are challenging and technical dossiers consisting of approximately 200 articles and nearly 30 annexes.  Good progress has been made to date and the Presidency's intention is to examine a substantial number of chapters of both proposals in parallel during the Presidency. The Presidency team has also convened a number of meetings of medical devices experts in Brussels to review and improve a number of technical annexes of the Proposals, and has held informal meetings with the EP rapporteurs on these dossiers, Ms. Dagmar Roth Behrendt MEP and Dr. Peter Liese MEP.<\/p><p><br \/>  Both proposals will be on the agenda for the EPSCO meeting in June where it is proposed to present Presidency Progress Reports on the Clinical Trials and Medical Devices Proposals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRZ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cross-Border Health Initiatives","counter":3723,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRZ01225"},{"type":"question","counter":3724,"qnumday":594,"qnumall":"[22221\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRZ01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will confirm that the European Commission&rsquo;s Proposal for a decision on serious cross-border threats to health remains a priority for the Irish EU Presidency; if he will provide a detailed update on the current status of this proposal; if the proposal will be discussed at forthcoming meetings of the Working Party on Public Health in May and June 2013; if, in view of the recent horse meat scandal, the specific issue of contaminated foodstuffs will be discussed in relation to the proposal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1078","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3725,"content":"<p>The proposal on Serious Cross Border Threats to Health is a priority for the Irish Presidency and I am happy to advise that after 3 months of intense negotiations with the European Parliament agreement was reached last week on this important piece of public health legislation.<\/p><p>  The Decision will help Member States prepare for and protect citizens against future cross border threats including pandemics and environmental disasters.

The HSE remains seriously concerned regarding the situation in relation to delayed discharges since the New Year. Delayed Discharges impede the operational functioning of a hospital, and exposes the mainly older persons concerned to the inappropriate risks of acute hospital stays e.g. hospital acquired infections.  Higher numbers of delayed discharges can also be associated with extended waits in the Emergency Department.  There is a body of international evidence that demonstrates that longer ED waits is also associated with poorer mortality and morbidity outcomes for patients.  It is essential that this issue is successfully addressed.  In response to this growth, number of actions have been initiated.  These include the establishment by me of a ministerial Task Force to deliver substantial improvements in delayed discharges, including a review of the operational arrangements associated with the &lsquo;Fair Deal&rsquo; scheme.<\/p><p>  Senior personnel have been tasked with improving cross hospital-community process issues, focusing first on the &lsquo;longest waiting&rsquo; delayed discharges (&amp;gt;100 days).  The aim is to remove all local barriers to discharge and identify those matters which require action at a national level. The management teams have been making good progress with respect to these tasks and it is intended to quickly roll-out this structure to all areas.  <\/p><p>  New reporting systems and processes have also been introduced. A HSE web-based database that allows tracking at patient level (on an anonymous basis) is in the implementation phase in a number of hospital sites.  In addition, the current categorisation of reasons for delay has been reviewed. New categories, which should give enhanced data on the blocks to discharge, are due for implementation nationally on May 20.  The data captured through the web-based system will facilitate revised metrics for each hospital.  There will be a greater emphasis on reducing the bed days lost to delayed discharges, with targets established on a site-by-site basis.  <\/p><p>  As issues relating to specific matters taken to address delayed discharges from Galway\/Roscommon University Hospital Group are operational matters for the HSE, I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRZ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Home Services","counter":3743,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRZ02650"},{"type":"question","counter":3744,"qnumday":603,"qnumall":"[22274\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRZ02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the steps he is taking to address delays in obtaining a fair deal nursing home bed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3745,"content":"<p>The HSE is responsible for the operation and administration of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.

This means that on-duty ambulance crews are at their stations or in their vehicles during a shift, rather than having to be summoned to the station in the event of a call-out. Therefore, crews can respond to an emergency call immediately, instead of the average time of over 20 minutes for a vehicle to leave the station under on-call. This change, which was sought by both staff and the NAS, has obvious benefits for patients and response times and represents a clear improvement in service. <\/p><p>  The NAS intends to introduce on-duty rostering and dynamic deployment of emergency resources, on a phased basis, across the entire Cork and Kerry region. So far, on-duty and dynamic deployment arrangements have been successfully introduced across County Cork, most recently in West Cork. <\/p><p>  The NAS informs me that planning for the next phase, in South Kerry, can now be progressed. This phase will include ambulance stations in Caherciveen, Killarney and Kenmare. As in each phase to date, any decisions on the best model of service for South Kerry will be preceded by detailed consideration of activity, geography, demographics, location of acute hospitals and other facilities, supporting services, wider NAS developments and learning from previous phases, as well as public, clinical and community leader engagement.<\/p><p>  The HSE is currently considering the most appropriate model of service delivery for South Kerry, to replace the current on-call, static deployment model and the operation of resources in isolation.  No decisions have so far been made and a number of matters need to be progressed before deliberations in relation to South Kerry can be finalised. These include public, staff and clinical (including GP) consultations, continuing national reconfiguration of the control and dispatch system and the ongoing roll-out of the Intermediate Care Service for inter-facility patient transport in the region.  A final model will emerge once this process is completed. <\/p><p>  In light of the above, all stakeholders should take advantage of the opportunity to participate in the consultation process, as the most effective and appropriate forum to engage with the HSE and the NAS in relation to proposals for changes in emergency service delivery in South Kerry.   <\/p><p>  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRAA04100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3802,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 624 and 625 answered with Question No. 620.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Insurance Company Payments","counter":3803,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRAA04300"},{"type":"question","counter":3804,"qnumday":626,"qnumall":"[22397\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRAA04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views regarding the introduction of an automatic levy on the use of beds in a public hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":3805,"qnumday":711,"qnumall":"[23040\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRAA04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding private health insurance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3806,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 626 and 711 together.<\/p><p>  Private in-patients in public hospitals are subject to maintenance charges that generally range from &euro;586 to &euro;1,046 per day when they are accommodated in a private designated bed.  However, if a private designated bed is not available and a private in-patient is accommodated in a public bed, the maintenance charge is currently not levied, although the private in-patient continues to pay the fees of his\/her hospital consultant.<\/p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General has reported that 45% of in-patients treated privately by their consultants were not charged for their maintenance costs because they were not occupying private-designated beds.  This situation represents a significant loss of income to the public hospital system and an indirect subsidy to private insurance companies, who cover most private patients.  I believe that this situation cannot continue and that the new charge makes sense. Up to now insurers have enjoyed a significant subsidy, where these private patients have only paid a standard &euro;75 charge per night even though they have seen their consultant privately.<\/p><p>  The gap between the cost of providing this service to private in-patients and the amount that public hospitals are currently allowed to raise is estimated to be about a quarter of a billion euro. The subsidy is equivalent to the cost of running a hospital the size of the Mater, or the cost of treating over 30,000 public patients every year. While everyone is entitled to use a public hospital, some people chose to be treated privately, in which case they have chosen to pay the consultant and the hospital. The Government believes that users of private services should pay for the costs of providing these services even when they are provided by a public hospital.<\/p><p>  As part of Budget 2013, the Government announced that it would raise &euro;60m in 2013 under this heading, and &euro;115m in a full year. This represents a modest phasing in of the charge &ndash; as called for by the insurers themselves - and is a relatively modest extra cost on an industry that pays out some &euro;2 billion in claims costs every year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRAA04600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":3807,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRAA04700"},{"type":"question","counter":3808,"qnumday":627,"qnumall":"[22400\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRAA04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding an application for a medical card in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 15; if same will be expedited; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3809,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

The overarching aim of the Programme is to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with asthma in Ireland and to improve clinical outcomes and the quality of life of all patients with asthma.  A key component is the improved management of people with asthma in primary care, thereby, avoiding emergency attendance at General Practitioner (GP) out-of-hours services, at hospital emergency departments and in-patient admission services.<\/p><p><br \/>  The initial focus of the work of the Programme has been primarily on:<blockquote>- The development and implementation of national asthma guidelines based on international best practice for acute and ongoing asthma management and national asthma education initiatives for patients and health care professionals; and<br \/><br \/>- The organisation and better integration of national asthma services at primary and secondary care levels through the development of a national model of care.<\/blockquote>The acute adult and Paediatric asthma guidelines and associated care pathways, treatment protocols and care bundles have now been developed for use in primary and secondary care settings.  The acute adult asthma guidelines, which are available online at <i>www.hse.ie<\/i>  , are currently being revised.<\/p><p><br \/>  The National Asthma Programme is currently working on developing a National Model of Care for Asthma.  The National Clinic Lead for Asthma, supported by the programme's GP Lead, have responsibility in the HSE for the development of the model of care for asthma.  The Integrated Services Directorate has operational responsibility for implementation of the programme, supported by the Clinical Strategy &amp;amp; Programmes Directorate.  The proposed implementation plan will detail how physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals will work with engaged patients to make the clinical decisions most appropriate to the patient's circumstances; while collaborating with specialist colleagues in providing a safe, seamless patient experience within the health system in Ireland.  This is a key deliverable of the National Asthma Programme for 2013.  The National Asthma Progmamme had to prioritise the submission of the Adult Asthma Emergency Guidelines to the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee which had a deadline of March 2013.  The Model of Care for Asthma will be ready for stakeholder consultation by the end of quarter 2.  It is anticipated that it will be completed by the end of quarter 3 this year.<\/p><p><br \/>  As 85% of asthma is managed in primary care without the requirement for hospital specialist services, the National Asthma Programme is currently undertaking work to look at providing a yearly programme of assessment for asthma in primary care called Chronic Disease Watch - Asthma (also referred to as <i>Asthma Check<\/i>).  The development of <i>Asthma Check<\/i>   is being done in conjunction with the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP).  <i>Asthma Check<\/i> outlines the step-by-step process for implementation of guideline based asthma management in primary care to deliver optimal outcomes for patients.  The aim being to facilitate the implementation of best practice asthma guidelines in primary care in order to improve asthma control.  This will reduce acute exacerbations and thus their associated overall costs with fewer hospital bed days and less time off school \/ work.  It will also ensure that patients with asthma maximize their quality of life.<\/p><p><br \/>  The National Asthma Programme expects that savings would be made in, GP out-of-hours visits, Emergency Department attendances and bed days used by implementing the programme.  In addition, a 10% reduction in asthma deaths each year is targeted by the programme.  Consideration is being given to carrying out an economic analysis of the implementation of the acute asthma guidelines with the support of HIQA.  I am satisfied that good progress can be made in the ongoing development of the National Asthma Programme in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRBB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asthma Incidence","counter":3832,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRBB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":3833,"qnumday":637,"qnumall":"[22466\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400071#WRBB00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his Department's estimate of the number of persons here who suffer from asthma; the number of these who are covered by a medical card; the way these figures have been determined; and if it is possible to derive an accurate estimate from PCRS data.","asker":"1178","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3834,"content":"<p>The HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service has advised that it does not currently collect information regarding an applicant's illness.

The Report includes recommendations for a revision of the National Pandemic Plan (2007) and provides advice on operational arrangements for any future pandemic.  A Working Group will be established to begin this process.<\/p><p>  The purpose of a plan is to limit the effects of a potential pandemic and to inform the public about pandemic influenza, explain what the Government and health services are doing to prepare for a possible pandemic, and give information on what members of the public need to do if there is a pandemic.  The health service response to the threat of an influenza pandemic is based on eight core elements: communications strategy, telephone hotline, responsibilities of the public, surveillance, antiviral drugs, pandemic vaccine, reorganisation of the health services and essential supplies.<\/p><p>  Agreement to improve the European Union health security framework was secured by the Irish Presidency last week.  The Decision will help Member States prepare for, and protect citizens against, possible future pandemics.  The agreement strengthens risk preparedness and response planning, provides a legal basis for the Health Security Committee, improves access to pharmaceutical products, including vaccines, for Member States, and will result in clearer risk and crisis communication to the public and healthcare professionals.  A crucial aspect of the agreement is the establishment of a legal basis for the coordination of vaccine procurement across the EU.  This will provide more equitable access to vaccines and may reduce costs associated with vaccine procurement.

In 2008, the then Government decided, in the light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.<\/p><p>  Part 2 of the Disability Act, inter alia, provides for an assessment of the needs of eligible applicants occasioned by their disability to be commenced within three months of receipt of an application and completed within a further three months.<\/p><p>  There has been a very significant rise in overall activity around the assessment process in recent years in respect of the children now encompassed by the process.  The number of assessment reports received in 2012 was 3,505 which is over 400 applications more than in 2010.  It is worth noting that in the period 2010-2012 over 8,200 reports were completed.  While the HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process given the number and complexity of cases, it is endeavouring to address the issue from available resources.<\/p><p>  While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.  The HSE has issued guidance to its staff that where there is a delay in the assessment process, this should not affect the delivery of necessary and appropriate interventions identified for a particular child.<\/p><p>  In addition targeted action plans have been put in place since early 2011.  Measures have included: prioritising assessments, holding additional clinics, contracting the private sector to conduct assessments and reconfiguring resources to target areas of greatest need.  These plans are monitored on a monthly basis by the HSE centrally.<\/p><p>  Following the publication of a report commissioned from the National Disability Authority by the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive, a major emphasis is being placed on reconfiguring disability services for children into geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams as part of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme which is underway.  The NDA report indicated that where integrated teams were operating, the assessment of need process ran more smoothly.  It found that there was no one single solution to remove all of the challenges to operating a statutory assessment of need.

The Government is also conscious of the position of the Ombudsman that the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant schemes are illegal in the context of the Equal Status Acts.

These reforms will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for medicines resulting in savings for taxpayers and patients.  The Bill passed Report Stage on the 9th of May and will return to the Seanad on the 22nd of May.  It is hoped that the Bill will complete its passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas shortly thereafter.  It is not possible, at this juncture, to provide accurate figures regarding potential savings resulting from the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing, as these depend on various factors including prevailing prices, number of competitors, availability of substitute products, and market dynamics.<\/p><p>  Following intensive negotiations involving the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), the HSE and the Department of Health, a major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded in October last.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs; a lowering of the drugs bill to the State; timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400m over 3 years.  &euro;210 million from the gross savings will make available new drugs to patients over 3 years.  Thus, the deal will result in a net reduction in the HSE expenditure on drugs of about &euro;190m.<\/p><p>  The Department of Health and the HSE have also successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs.  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.<\/p><p>In addition, the recently established HSE Medicines Management Programme has identified &lsquo;preferred drugs&rsquo; for prescribers when prescribing Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) or statin medication for patients.  This is the first time that the State has introduced a preferred drug initiative.  PPIs are prescribed for patients with peptic ulcer disease and\/or reflux and statin medication is for high cholesterol.  The preferred PPI is Lansoprazole and the preferred statin is Simvastatin.  The HSE is asking doctors to prescribe these preferred drugs in order to save money, both for patients who pay for their medication and to deliver savings of an estimated &euro;15million for the taxpayer.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, the European Commission has completed its eighth review of the EU-IMF financial assistance programme for Ireland and has published the technical report by the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs (ECFIN) which assesses programme implementation by the Irish authorities.  The report published on 28th January 2013 identifies areas where the joint EC-ECB-IMF mission considers that further efficiencies could be achieved in the health system.  This includes compulsory prescription by active ingredient rather than by brand name with exceptions only for 'non-substitutability' cases.

My priority is to ensure that those affected by narcolepsy, with symptom onset post pandemic vaccination are provided with a range of services and supports to meet their health needs.   The Irish Medicines Board has indicated that as of 12 May 2013 there are 49 cases with a clinical diagnosis of narcolepsy, with symptom development post pandemic vaccination.  There are a number of cases still under investigation. The majority of cases are in the five to twenty two years age group. The Health Service Executive has responsibility for health service delivery and at my request, the HSE developed a range of appropriate services and supports to address the needs of this group.  Together, the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills provide a very comprehensive range of services and supports to those affected.<\/p><p>  These supports and services include access to rapid diagnosis, clear treatment pathways, temporary medical cards and reimbursement of expenses incurred. This includes expenses for counselling services for individuals and also for families of children affected by narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination,  in cases where such services are not already available through the HSE.  Multi-disciplinary assessments which allow for appropriate individualised health and educational supports to be put in place are ongoing.  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is also engaging with the HSE and with the individual schools and parents of children concerned to identify and provide educational supports for the children and adolescents affected.<\/p><p>  The HSE's advocacy unit is in regular contact with the support group SOUND and last met representatives of the group on 28 February 2013.  Through regional co-ordinators the HSE also has frequent contact with individual members of SOUND to assist them in service access and reimbursement of expenses.   On March 22 the HSE held an information day to ensure those affected were fully aware of all of the the services available.  My Department is considering all possible supports which may need to be put in place for those affected by narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination.  I would like to assure the Deputy that this matter continues to be a priority for my Department.

Ireland&rsquo;s priority is the safety of the Irish people and the protection of our environment, including the shared marine environment of the Irish Sea. <\/p><p>  The UK published its draft Energy National Policy Statement in November 2009, which signalled its intention to construct ten new nuclear power stations at sites judged as potentially suitable. This was subsequently revised in October 2010 when the number of planned stations was reduced to eight, following the dropping of two sites originally proposed for Cumbria, near the existing Sellafield facility.  Since the original announcement in 2009, Ireland has written twice at ministerial level to the UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change outlining concerns about potential environmental impacts in Ireland and in the Irish Sea. The key issues of concern include the assessments by the UK of effects on the environment, management of radioactive waste, and the rationale underpinning the proposed justification decision for new nuclear facilities. This engagement at ministerial level has been supported and informed by a continuing dialogue at official level where Irish officials engage, and raise concerns where appropriate, with UK counterparts directly engaged in the development and implementation of the plans. <\/p><p>  I note the legal proceedings being brought by An Taisce in relation to Hinkley Point and I respect the rights of An Taisce, as an independent body, to take such a course of action. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII), in accordance with its statutory advisory role to the Government, was requested by my Department to complete an assessment of the potential radiological impacts on Ireland from the programme of new nuclear power plants in the UK, including the plant at Hinkley Point. This assessment will consider both routine operations and a range of postulated accident scenarios at the plants. I understand that the Report will be completed imminently, and will be made publicly available. I am advised that the RPII will then provide briefings for interested parties. I will consider the position having read the RPII report.<\/p><p>  Finally, under the EURATOM Treaty the UK was required to satisfy the European Commission that the development at Hinkley Point would not be likely to result in radioactive contamination of the water, soil or airspace of another Member State.

As a result, capital spending on housing programmes is subject to constraint over the short-term.<\/p><p>  On 22 February 2013, I announced capital allocations to local authorities under the suite of Grants for Older People and People with a Disability amounting to &euro;42.750 million. In allocating the available funding across all 34 city and county councils I did so in as transparent and as fair a way as possible.  In framing the 2013 allocations, my Department wrote to each local authority requesting details of the numbers and value of grants where work had been approved to commence. Between them, local authorities reported contractual commitments in respect of approved grants totalling &euro;18 million.

It is a key tool of Government in providing supports for the &lsquo;harder to reach&rsquo; in the most disadvantaged areas and communities.  Given the current economic situation and the high level of unemployment, the LCDP is more relevant than ever insofar as it creates employment opportunities and gives those most distant from the labour market the skills to access training and jobs. The Programme has four high level goals focusing on supporting activities that enhance access to services, provides education and lifelong learning supports for individuals, employment supports for individuals and supports for community development activities.<\/p><p>Goal 3 of the LCDP is the primary goal that delivers employment services. Approximately 40% of the LCDP budget is allocated to the goal, and under it, a range of services are delivered and supported.  These are diverse and range from employment mediation supports, programmes to reduce youth unemployment, actions designed to engage with employers to promote local job opportunities, labour market focused education and training supports, supports for social enterprise, and the delivery of services for individuals who are seeking to set up their own business.<\/p><p>The Programme is delivered at a local level by the national network of local development companies (LDCs).

No. 326 of 2012), which were given effect following a public consultation process, provide for a ban on the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of bituminous (or &quot;smoky&quot;) fuel inside specified ban areas.  The Regulations introduced some improved and updated provisions that will help to ensure that the smoky coal ban remains fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of residential fuels.\u00a0 These are as follows:   <\/p><p>- most existing smoky coal ban area boundaries were revised to take recent urban development into account;<\/p><p>- seven new\u00a0towns were added to the ban from May 2013 - Greystones, Letterkenny, Mullingar, Navan, Newbridge, Portlaoise and Wicklow Town; and<\/p><p>- a prohibition on the burning of bituminous fuel to complement the established ban on marketing, sale and distribution.\u00a0<\/p><p><br \/>  The single focus of the previous regulations on prohibiting the sale, as distinct from the burning, of &quot;smoky&quot; coal meant that the burning of such coal inside ban areas undermined the intent and purpose of the ban and the supply of such fuel was known to be facilitated by businesses that had established premises just outside ban area boundaries to serve ban area residents as their main market.  The revised boundaries and prohibition on the burning of smoky coal inside ban areas support the effectiveness of the ban in the areas concerned by restricting such activities and hence closing the loophole.  These updated provisions were broadly welcomed by the EPA, local authorities and the import and supply industry, on the basis that they provide for more effective legislation.  My Department continues to meet regularly with the EPA, local authorities and the industry representatives to discuss the ongoing implementation and enforcement of the Regulations.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the case of new towns that were added to the ban, a lead-in period of eight months was provided to allow local authorities and fuel retailers time to adapt as necessary to the new regulatory requirements in preparation for the switch-over to smokeless fuels.  Following the inclusion of these areas, the smoky coal ban applies in all towns with a population greater than 15,000 people.  This provides for greater consistency in urban air quality standards throughout the State by extending the cleaner air benefits of the ban to all large towns.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Regulations also require that all smoky coal sold outside ban areas for residential use outside those areas must have a sulphur content of no more than 0.7%.\u00a0 This compares to a maximum permitted sulphur content of 2% for bituminous coal sold in Northern Ireland. <font color=\"#333333\"> &amp;#8206;<\/font>Coal bagging operators and certain solid fuel suppliers trading in smoky coal must demonstrate the compliance of their product with the 0.7% sulphur limit and be registered with the EPA.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland has prepared an annual traceability audit system, known as SWiFT 7, for demonstrating compliance.  All retailers who trade in smoky coal must ensure that their suppliers are registered with the EPA and must hold a record to this effect with their supplier's registration number. <\/p><p><br \/>  Despite these regulatory improvements, I recognise that different standards applying to coal between separate jurisdictions presents a continuing challenge for enforcement.  On 6 May I announced that a joint North-South study is being commissioned to examine air pollution from residential smoky coal and to consider the potential policy options to reduce such emissions. <font color=\"#333333\"> <\/font>A closer alignment of solid fuel policy and legislation on an all-island basis would aid enforcement, eliminate unfair competitive advantage, protect air quality and allow the benefits derived from the ban to potentially be further extended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRS00600","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Remuneration","counter":4213,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRS00650"},{"type":"question","counter":4214,"qnumday":445,"qnumall":"[22788\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRS00700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of personnel in whole-time equivalent terms in his Department and in bodies under the aegis of his Department in each of the following earnings brackets: less than &euro;20,000, &euro;20,001 to &euro;30,000, &euro;30,001 to &euro;40,000, &euro;40,001 to &euro;50,000, &euro;50,001 to &euro;60,000, &euro;60,001 to &euro;70,000, &euro;70,001 to &euro;80,000, &euro;80,001 to &euro;90,000, &euro;90,001 to &euro;100,000, &euro;100,000 to &euro;125,000, &euro;125,001 to &euro;150,000, &euro;150,001 to &euro;175,000, &euro;175,001 to &euro;200,000, &euro;200,001 to &euro;250,000, &euro;250,001 to &euro;300,000, &euro;300,001 to &euro;350,000, &euro;350,001 to &euro;400,000, &euro;400,001 to &euro;450,000, &euro;450,001 to &euro;500,000, and more than &euro;500,000.","asker":"1178","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":4215,"content":"<p>The information requested in respect of my Department is set out in the following table.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Salary Range<\/th><th>Number of Staff WTE*<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&amp;gt; &euro;500,000<\/td><td>0.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;450,001 - &euro;500,000<\/td><td>0.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;400,001 - &euro;450,000<\/td><td>0.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;350,001 - &euro;400,000<\/td><td>0.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;300,001 - &euro;350,000<\/td><td>0.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;250,001 - &euro;300,000<\/td><td>0.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;200,001 - &euro;250,000<\/td><td>0.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;175,001 - &euro;200,000 <\/td><td>1.00**<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;150,000 - &euro;175,000<\/td><td>0.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;125,001 - &euro;150,000<\/td><td>7.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;100,001 - &euro;125,000<\/td><td>16.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;90,001 - &euro;100,000<\/td><td>44.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;80,001 - &euro;90,000<\/td><td>52.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;70,001 - &euro;80,000<\/td><td>103.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;60,001 - &euro;70,000<\/td><td>32.20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;50,001 - &euro;60,000<\/td><td>172.46<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;40,001 - &euro;50,000<\/td><td>155.10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;30,001 - &euro;40,000<\/td><td>120.16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;20,001 - &euro;30,000<\/td><td>64.95<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&amp;lt; &euro;20,000<\/td><td>11.25<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>* Denotes whole time equivalent.<\/p><p>** The current salary of the Secretary General of my Department is &euro;215,590 per annum.

Where any borrower, either from a local authority or from a private financial institution, is facing difficulties in meeting mortgage repayments, they should engage proactively and constructively with the lender to seek to achieve an agreed solution.  The services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service are also available to such borrowers and support is available through the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme.<\/p><p>Local authorities have long been the lenders of last resort servicing the housing loans needs of less affluent members of society.  In the present economic circumstances it is to be anticipated that the ability of some borrowers to service housing loans may become restricted and that a number of loans may fall into arrears.  Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers, and they have demonstrated sensitivity over the years in dealing with such cases.  In March 2010 my Department issued guidelines to local authorities, based upon the Central Bank's first Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, which continued the tradition of handling arrears in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.<br \/>  To reflect the content of the Central Bank's revised Code of Conduct &ndash; which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt &ndash; my Department issued updated guidance in June 2012 to local authorities in consultation with the County and City Managers Association.  This will further enable local authorities to provide a range of flexible repayment options for households in difficulty.  In particular, the introduction of a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which closely mirrors the suite of options available in the commercial sector, presents borrowers in difficulty with a range of alternative payment agreements, including those referred to in the Question, which can be accessed to ease the particular circumstances of each case.  This process features a standard set of options including, in cases of certain unsustainable mortgages, the facility of mortgage-to-rent.  Local authorities have been restructuring loans for some time using their own internal practices. The introduction of these revised guidelines standardises the approach across the whole sector, introduces a systematic structure to this area and provides borrowers with a transparent and accessible model for arrears resolution.<\/p><p>Regarding the level of repossessions in the last three years, my Department publishes a wide range of housing statistics which can be found at <i>www.environ.ie.<\/i>  The total numbers of forced and voluntary repossessions obtained by local authorities in 2010, 2011 and 2012 are set out in the following table.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Forced<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>54<\/td><td>73<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Voluntary<\/td><td>73<\/td><td>49<\/td><td>64<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRS02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":4246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRS02900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Status","counter":4245,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRS02850"},{"type":"question","counter":4246,"qnumday":457,"qnumall":"[22151\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRS02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the opportunities for appeal or reconsideration of an application, either within his Department or through the courts, that exist for a person (details supplied) who has been issued with a deportation order; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1045","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":4247,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned arrived in the State on 8th November 2003 as a short-term visitor.

To support the achievement of these aims, the Act provides for the establishment of an independent Charities Regulatory Authority.<\/p><p>  I am aware of the recent Prime Time programme which reported, amongst other things, on the issue of theft from charity clothing banks.  Theft is an offence contrary to section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.  A person convicted upon indictment of theft is liable to imprisonment for up to 10 years and\/or an unlimited fine.<\/p><p>  I am also concerned about the reported practice of some collectors of clothing who convey the impression in their promotional literature that they are collecting on behalf of a charity, when this may not actually be the case.  This may lead some people to donate to such collections in the belief that they are supporting a charity and helping to alleviate hardship. This is unfair both to donors whose intention in donating such items is to help those in need, and to bona fide charities that may lose out on donations as a result. It is an offence under section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001 to make gain or cause loss to others by deception.<\/p><p>  In addition to these existing measures under the Criminal Justice Acts, while the Charities Act 2009 does not deal directly with the regulation of Irish charity clothing banks or collections, it does contain measures aimed at preventing the abuse of charitable status. Under section 46 of the Charities Act, it is an offence for an organisation that is not a registered charity to describe itself or its activities in such terms as would cause members of the public to reasonably believe that it is a charitable organisation. This section cannot be commenced until the statutory Register of Charities, also provided for under the Charities Act, is in place.<\/p><p>  While further implementation of the Charities Act and creation of the Register of Charities have been delayed for financial reasons, the Government remains committed to progressing the implementation of the Act and putting in place a dedicated regulatory framework for charities in line with the provisions of the Act. My Department has been examining how best this can be done in the current financial climate.  As part of this work, my Department recently undertook a consultation on key issues, including the creation of the Register of Charities. The submissions received are currently being reviewed and I look forward to publishing the results in due course and giving a further indication of the Government's timeframe for the introduction of an operational Charities Regulatory Authority and full implementation of the Charities Act 2009.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRT03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Remuneration","counter":4317,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRT03550"},{"type":"question","counter":4318,"qnumday":482,"qnumall":"[22793\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRT03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of personnel in whole-time equivalent terms in his Department and in bodies under the aegis of his Department in each of the following earnings brackets: less than &euro;20,000, &euro;20,001 to &euro;30,000, &euro;30,001 to &euro;40,000, &euro;40,001 to &euro;50,000, &euro;50,001 to &euro;60,000, &euro;60,001 to &euro;70,000, &euro;70,001 to &euro;80,000, &euro;80,001 to &euro;90,000, &euro;90,001 to &euro;100,000, &euro;100,000 to &euro;125,000, &euro;125,001 to &euro;150,000, &euro;150,001 to &euro;175,000, &euro;175,001 to &euro;200,000, &euro;200,001 to &euro;250,000, &euro;250,001 to &euro;300,000, &euro;300,001 to &euro;350,000, &euro;350,001 to &euro;400,000, &euro;400,001 to &euro;450,000, &euro;450,001 to &euro;500,000, and more than &euro;500,000.","asker":"1178","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":4319,"content":"<p>The information sought by the Deputy in respect of staff of my Department and agencies under its aegis is set out in the following table.

The evidence in relation to mixed fisheries across western waters indicates a consistently high level of discards and presents a significant problem for all EU Member States  involved in fishing EU waters.<\/p><p>  Finding practical and implementable solutions to the wasteful practice of discarding fish is a major component of the current reform proposals for the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). Since taking up office as Marine Minister, I have worked tirelessly to influence and drive a change in policy which will urgently lead to an end to discarding. I have prioritised securing final agreement between the EU Fisheries Council and the Parliament on reform of the CFP throughout the Irish EU Presidency and we are making considerable progress in this regard.  The Fisheries Council which commenced yesterday and continues today is seeking to agree a compromise package on the CFP reform, including in relation to dealing with discards, with a view to finalising negotiations with the EU Parliament and the Commission before the end of the Irish Presidency.<\/p><p>  Ireland has been to the forefront in the drive to reduce and eliminate discards for many years and I was delighted to launch an Irish &ldquo;discard&rdquo; atlas in 2011, which is a detailed compendium of discards by the Irish Fleet targeting whitefish on a stock by stock and area by area basis.  This was the first publication of its kind and placed Ireland firmly to the fore in the debate on eliminating discards and assisted in advancing the case for a phased elimination of discards as part of the CFP reform package. I have urged other Member States to produce similar publications for their fleet.   It can be expected that discard levels are similar for similar fleets operating in the same fisheries across the EU.<\/p><p>  In relation to sea bass, the EU Commission has not yet advised if it intends to pursue a TAC and quota regime for sea bass for 2014.

The store lamb trade failed to take off in Autumn 2012, largely driven by a poor pasture conditions (limited grass, forage) and lack of confidence on the part of store lamb finishers who were reluctant to buy expensive feed. Demand within the traditional markets for light lamb (Portugal and indirectly Spain) has also been poor over the last two years due to the economic downturn in these regions. Indeed total imports of sheep meat into Portugal and Spain have fallen by 26% and 42% respectively.<\/p><p>  Bearing in mind the difficulties in recent times with these two outlets, the industry and Bord Bia are exploring additional new markets for light lambs for 2013.  These markets include France and the UK, which are the core export markets for Irish lamb, and Sweden, Belgium and Germany, which have been delivering positive growth over the last 2-3 years.  However it must be recognised that light lambs (&amp;lt;13kg) are generally not favoured by consumers in these regions and it is likely that lambs will need to be finished up to a weight of 17kg+.   I understand that Bord Bia has been discussing with the industry on how this could best be done, for example overwinter the lambs and dispose of them in the following Spring. <\/p><p>  Research can also be used to assist light lamb producers to bring the carcass to an acceptable weight specification. The Teagasc BETTER farm programme has a number of hill farms around the country. The aim of this programme is to establish focal points for the on-farm implementation, development and evaluation of technology that is relevant to hill sheep farmers. Close collaboration between Teagasc Researchers &amp;amp; Advisers with these farms aims to help improve profitability of hill sheep production.<\/p><p>  The recently launched Sheep Technology Adoption Programme (STAP) contains a measure designed to help improve the weight, quality and thus price of hill lambs.<\/p><p>  My Department is providing significant funding to Sheep Ireland to help deliver on the significant profit potential that breed improvement can deliver. A number of hill flocks are involved in data recording initiatives which will help identify the most profitable animals to breed from. <\/p><p>  All of these initiatives should help hill farmers in dealing with the vagaries of the market and in matching specification with market requirements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRV04700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":4476,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRW00100"},{"type":"question","counter":4477,"qnumday":534,"qnumall":"[22538\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRW00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the expected total expenditure under the agri-environment schemes under the common agriculture policy programme 2007-2013; the percentage of this that will be co-funded by the Exchequer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":4478,"content":"<p>Expenditure on agri - environment schemes over the period 2007 to 2013 is estimated at &euro;2.015 billion, details as follows: -<\/p><p><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>REPs<\/th><th>AEOS<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>&euro;m.<\/td><td>&euro;m.<\/td><td>&euro;m.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2007<\/td><td>311.750<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>311.750<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>312.080<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>312.080<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>341.123<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>341.123<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>321.864<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>321.864<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>260.952<\/td><td>14.107<\/td><td>275.059<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>198.266<\/td><td>54.947<\/td><td>253.213<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013 estimated<\/td><td>148.575<\/td><td>51.800<\/td><td>200.375<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Estimated Total 2007 to 2013<\/td><td>1,894.610<\/td><td>120.854<\/td><td>2,015.464<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>When EU co funding is taken into account, the net Exchequer cost of funding eligible expenditure on REPs and AEOS agri environment measures is, subject to EU funding limitations, 45% and 25% respectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRW00300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":4479,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRW00400"},{"type":"question","counter":4480,"qnumday":535,"qnumall":"[22539\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRW00500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the expected total expenditure under the disadvantaged area scheme under the common agriculture policy programme 2007-2013; the percentage of this that will be co-funded by the Exchequer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":4481,"qnumday":542,"qnumall":"[22546\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRW00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the total expenditure under the disadvantaged area scheme each year under the disadvantaged area scheme 2007 to 2013; the expected expenditure under this scheme this year including any payments under the 2013 scheme that will be paid in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":4482,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 535 and 542 together.<\/p><p>Total provision available under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme as provided for in the Rural Development Programme 2007 &ndash; 2013 is &euro;1,799M.

The EU Sugar Regime underwent a radical reform in 2005 following major EU decisions to restructure the industry. A temporary restructuring scheme was introduced with the aim of reducing EU sugar production. Greencore, the holder of the entire Irish sugar quota, availed of this voluntary scheme, dismantled its facilities and ceased production in 2006. Ireland secured &euro;353million as part of the reform package of which &euro;220million went to beet growers, &euro;127million to Greencore and &euro;6million to machinery contractors.<\/p><p><br \/>  Post reform, production in the EU is now concentrated in 18 Member States. The present regime runs from 1 September 2006 to the 30 September 2015. There is no mechanism under the present EU Regulations which would allow for the re-instatement of the sugar quota for the growing of sugar beet in Ireland for the production of sugar. Of course, sugar beet is still grown in Ireland as a fodder crop.<\/p><p><br \/>  In 2011 I met with two separate groups which had conducted feasibility studies, into the possibility of rebuilding a new sugar industry in the country. At both meetings, I stated that any venture to develop a combined sugar\/bioethanol production facility would have to be a commercial proposition, financed in total by investors and interested parties and make sound economic sense in order to be viable. <\/p><p><br \/>  I also further suggested to both groups, the desirability of there being only one single proposition in play, as both studies had indicated a potential for only one such viable project and both groups had appeared to accept the reasonableness of this position at the time. Only recently, I re-stated that any business plan for a new venture in this area, would need to be competitive and that it would have to justify the very substantial investment to build a new facility.<\/p><p><br \/>  In recent discussions at the Council of Agriculture Ministers, which I am chairing under our EU Presidency responsibilities, a deep divide emerged between one group of Member States, including Ireland, which favoured abolition of quotas in 2015 and another group of Member States which wished to extend quotas to 2020 and beyond. As current President of the Council, I made a compromise proposal that garnered the support of a large majority of Member States, to extend the quota regime for a further two years until 30 September 2017 when it will finally cease.  This is the formal negotiating mandate for the Agriculture Council, as we enter the final phase of the ongoing CAP Reform negotiations<i>. <\/i>  The compromise has been welcomed strongly by those who want to re-establish a sugar industry in Ireland. It is my job to ensure that Ireland either has a quota or alternatively can produce sugar in the absence of EU quotas. I would, however, encourage caution on making decisions to planting sugar beet crops or any other investments until we know when Ireland will have the capacity to produce sugar again and when the regime is likely to end.<\/p><p><br \/>  The European Parliament is in favour of extending quotas to 2020. The Council is now in detailed trilogue discussions between the EU Commission and the Parliament on the general CAP Reform package, including the future of the EU Sugar Regime, and I will do everything I can to ensure that we end the Sugar Quota Regime in the EU as soon as possible, so that revival efforts here can get off the ground, as long as the commercial case can be made for them. I am hopeful that I can bring these talks to a successful conclusion before the end of Ireland's Presidency role on 30 June next. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRW05300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Grants","counter":4529,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRW05400"},{"type":"question","counter":4530,"qnumday":552,"qnumall":"[22808\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRW05500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a forestry payment will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":4531,"content":"<p>Our records show that the applicant is registered with the Department&rsquo;s Online Services since May 2012.

This inspection regime covers both the eligibility of land declared to drawn down payments and also cross compliance aspects, to ensure adherence with EU regulatory requirements in the areas of public, animal and plant health, environment and animal welfare.<\/p><p>  In order to be eligible under the single payment scheme and other area based schemes, an applicant must ensure that all agricultural land is maintained in good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC.  Issues relating to control of rushes must, therefore, be seen in this overall context.  Farmers can keep grassland in GAEC by conducting an agricultural activity on it, such as grazing, harvesting forage crops, or by topping.  Grasslands continue to be eligible where it is evident that the stocking rate on the land is sufficient and, for example, keeps rushes under control and avoids their proliferation.  In such situations, the reality is there may not be a necessity to cut rushes.  However, where a farmer cuts rushes as part of management practice, with the exception of certain designated lands, there are no restrictions on when this is done, enabling the task to be carried out at any time throughout the year once conditions are suitable.<\/p><p>  I am acutely aware of the weather related difficulties being experienced by farmers and of their concern in respect of their ability to meet the various compliance requirements.  When conducting inspections, my Department&rsquo;s personnel take prevailing weather conditions into account.  For example, where the practice is to cut rushes and it has not been possible to top them in the current year, inspectors will take a broader assessment including whether there is evidence that they have been cut in previous years.<\/p><p>  Where land is deemed ineligible, this, in the main, is a result of the inclusion of ineligible areas or features and where it is not being used for an agricultural purpose.

The regulations covering production include the European Communities (Hygiene of Foodstuffs) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 369 of 2006), and the European Communities (General Food Law) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No 747 of 2007).<\/p><p>  Bottled water plants also come within the definition of food business operators under EU legislation and, as such, must meet the requirements set down in EC Regulation (EC) 852\/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs which was transposed into national law in 2006. Consequently the operators of water production\/bottling plants must ensure that they meet the high food safety standards set out in the legislation. <\/p><p>  In addition to the general hygiene requirements above at the processing plants, there are separate requirements in relation to bottled water. These are set down in the European Communities (Natural Mineral Waters, Spring Waters and Other Waters in Bottles or Containers) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No 225 of 2007). These requirements include microbiological, chemical and labelling parameters, including sale descriptions. There is on-going testing of all bottled water facilities and the frequency of testing increases in line with production volumes. Business operators must put in place a safety management system which ensures the water is safe for consumption and meets all legal requirements.<\/p><p>  The enforcement of food law is a matter for the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).   Bottled water plants are inspected by Environmental Health Services (EHS) from the Health Service Executive (HSE) operating under a Service Contract with the FSAI and are inspected regularly. Samples are taken and tested generally as part of routine inspections &ndash; the EHS are supported by the HSE&rsquo;s network of official microbiological and chemical laboratories in this regard. <\/p><p>  In December 2011, the FSAI released the results of a major survey of the microbiological safety and quality of bottled water in Ireland. It showed a significant improvement in the microbiological quality of bottled water since the previous survey was conducted in 2007. When samples were tested against all four of the microbiological standards in the legislation, 2% were found to be unsatisfactory (compared to 7% of similar samples in the 2007 survey).   In addition, where non-compliances were detected, manufacturers were required to take immediate corrective actions.<\/p><p>  In collaboration with the FSAI, the HSE organises annual programmes of testing for all foods on sale in Ireland, including bottled water. In 2012 the HSE, as part of the annual surveillance programme, completed 410 analyses on samples of bottled water. No recalls were required during the year.<\/p><p>  The FSAI and EHS have worked with the bottled water industry in Ireland to develop guidance on safe and hygienic production of bottled water resulting in an updated national hygiene standard available through the National Standards Authority of Ireland. The FSAI and HSE continue to monitor production sites and retail outlets and to investigate customer complaints.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRY01800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Staffing","counter":4597,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRY01850"},{"type":"question","counter":4598,"qnumday":574,"qnumall":"[22411\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRY01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he intends to allow dental health nurses in the Dublin area apply for the planned new targeted voluntary redundancy scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":4599,"content":"<p>The health service is required to achieve a workforce of 98,955 whole time equivalents (WTEs) by the end of 2013.

The dossier is complex but work is progressing well.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Presidency team aims to complete a first examination of this entire Proposal by the end of the Irish Presidency.  The Irish Presidency team has also been working outside of Council Working Party meetings to review the technical annexes of the Proposal. A number of informal meetings have taken place with Ms. Glenis Willmott MEP, rapporteur on this dossier.<\/p><p><br \/>  There have also been 5 meetings of the Council Working Party on Pharmaceuticals &amp;amp; Medical Devices dedicated to examination of the two large Proposals on Medical Devices and In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices.  These are challenging and technical dossiers consisting of approximately 200 articles and nearly 30 annexes.  Good progress has been made to date and the Presidency's intention is to examine a substantial number of chapters of both proposals in parallel during the Presidency. The Presidency team has also convened a number of meetings of medical devices experts in Brussels to review and improve a number of technical annexes of the Proposals, and has held informal meetings with the EP rapporteurs on these dossiers, Ms. Dagmar Roth Behrendt MEP and Dr. Peter Liese MEP.<\/p><p><br \/>  Both proposals will be on the agenda for the EPSCO meeting in June where it is proposed to present Presidency Progress Reports on the Clinical Trials and Medical Devices Proposals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRZ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cross-Border Health Initiatives","counter":4651,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRZ01225"},{"type":"question","counter":4652,"qnumday":594,"qnumall":"[22221\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRZ01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will confirm that the European Commission&rsquo;s Proposal for a decision on serious cross-border threats to health remains a priority for the Irish EU Presidency; if he will provide a detailed update on the current status of this proposal; if the proposal will be discussed at forthcoming meetings of the Working Party on Public Health in May and June 2013; if, in view of the recent horse meat scandal, the specific issue of contaminated foodstuffs will be discussed in relation to the proposal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1078","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":4653,"content":"<p>The proposal on Serious Cross Border Threats to Health is a priority for the Irish Presidency and I am happy to advise that after 3 months of intense negotiations with the European Parliament agreement was reached last week on this important piece of public health legislation.<\/p><p>  The Decision will help Member States prepare for and protect citizens against future cross border threats including pandemics and environmental disasters.

The HSE remains seriously concerned regarding the situation in relation to delayed discharges since the New Year. Delayed Discharges impede the operational functioning of a hospital, and exposes the mainly older persons concerned to the inappropriate risks of acute hospital stays e.g. hospital acquired infections.  Higher numbers of delayed discharges can also be associated with extended waits in the Emergency Department.  There is a body of international evidence that demonstrates that longer ED waits is also associated with poorer mortality and morbidity outcomes for patients.  It is essential that this issue is successfully addressed.  In response to this growth, number of actions have been initiated.  These include the establishment by me of a ministerial Task Force to deliver substantial improvements in delayed discharges, including a review of the operational arrangements associated with the &lsquo;Fair Deal&rsquo; scheme.<\/p><p>  Senior personnel have been tasked with improving cross hospital-community process issues, focusing first on the &lsquo;longest waiting&rsquo; delayed discharges (&amp;gt;100 days).  The aim is to remove all local barriers to discharge and identify those matters which require action at a national level. The management teams have been making good progress with respect to these tasks and it is intended to quickly roll-out this structure to all areas.  <\/p><p>  New reporting systems and processes have also been introduced. A HSE web-based database that allows tracking at patient level (on an anonymous basis) is in the implementation phase in a number of hospital sites.  In addition, the current categorisation of reasons for delay has been reviewed. New categories, which should give enhanced data on the blocks to discharge, are due for implementation nationally on May 20.  The data captured through the web-based system will facilitate revised metrics for each hospital.  There will be a greater emphasis on reducing the bed days lost to delayed discharges, with targets established on a site-by-site basis.  <\/p><p>  As issues relating to specific matters taken to address delayed discharges from Galway\/Roscommon University Hospital Group are operational matters for the HSE, I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRZ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Home Services","counter":4671,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRZ02650"},{"type":"question","counter":4672,"qnumday":603,"qnumall":"[22274\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRZ02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the steps he is taking to address delays in obtaining a fair deal nursing home bed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":4673,"content":"<p>The HSE is responsible for the operation and administration of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.

This means that on-duty ambulance crews are at their stations or in their vehicles during a shift, rather than having to be summoned to the station in the event of a call-out. Therefore, crews can respond to an emergency call immediately, instead of the average time of over 20 minutes for a vehicle to leave the station under on-call. This change, which was sought by both staff and the NAS, has obvious benefits for patients and response times and represents a clear improvement in service. <\/p><p>  The NAS intends to introduce on-duty rostering and dynamic deployment of emergency resources, on a phased basis, across the entire Cork and Kerry region. So far, on-duty and dynamic deployment arrangements have been successfully introduced across County Cork, most recently in West Cork. <\/p><p>  The NAS informs me that planning for the next phase, in South Kerry, can now be progressed. This phase will include ambulance stations in Caherciveen, Killarney and Kenmare. As in each phase to date, any decisions on the best model of service for South Kerry will be preceded by detailed consideration of activity, geography, demographics, location of acute hospitals and other facilities, supporting services, wider NAS developments and learning from previous phases, as well as public, clinical and community leader engagement.<\/p><p>  The HSE is currently considering the most appropriate model of service delivery for South Kerry, to replace the current on-call, static deployment model and the operation of resources in isolation.  No decisions have so far been made and a number of matters need to be progressed before deliberations in relation to South Kerry can be finalised. These include public, staff and clinical (including GP) consultations, continuing national reconfiguration of the control and dispatch system and the ongoing roll-out of the Intermediate Care Service for inter-facility patient transport in the region.  A final model will emerge once this process is completed. <\/p><p>  In light of the above, all stakeholders should take advantage of the opportunity to participate in the consultation process, as the most effective and appropriate forum to engage with the HSE and the NAS in relation to proposals for changes in emergency service delivery in South Kerry.   <\/p><p>  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRAA04100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":4730,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 624 and 625 answered with Question No. 620.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Insurance Company Payments","counter":4731,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRAA04300"},{"type":"question","counter":4732,"qnumday":626,"qnumall":"[22397\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRAA04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views regarding the introduction of an automatic levy on the use of beds in a public hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":4733,"qnumday":711,"qnumall":"[23040\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRAA04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding private health insurance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":4734,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 626 and 711 together.<\/p><p>  Private in-patients in public hospitals are subject to maintenance charges that generally range from &euro;586 to &euro;1,046 per day when they are accommodated in a private designated bed.  However, if a private designated bed is not available and a private in-patient is accommodated in a public bed, the maintenance charge is currently not levied, although the private in-patient continues to pay the fees of his\/her hospital consultant.<\/p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General has reported that 45% of in-patients treated privately by their consultants were not charged for their maintenance costs because they were not occupying private-designated beds.  This situation represents a significant loss of income to the public hospital system and an indirect subsidy to private insurance companies, who cover most private patients.  I believe that this situation cannot continue and that the new charge makes sense. Up to now insurers have enjoyed a significant subsidy, where these private patients have only paid a standard &euro;75 charge per night even though they have seen their consultant privately.<\/p><p>  The gap between the cost of providing this service to private in-patients and the amount that public hospitals are currently allowed to raise is estimated to be about a quarter of a billion euro. The subsidy is equivalent to the cost of running a hospital the size of the Mater, or the cost of treating over 30,000 public patients every year. While everyone is entitled to use a public hospital, some people chose to be treated privately, in which case they have chosen to pay the consultant and the hospital. The Government believes that users of private services should pay for the costs of providing these services even when they are provided by a public hospital.<\/p><p>  As part of Budget 2013, the Government announced that it would raise &euro;60m in 2013 under this heading, and &euro;115m in a full year. This represents a modest phasing in of the charge &ndash; as called for by the insurers themselves - and is a relatively modest extra cost on an industry that pays out some &euro;2 billion in claims costs every year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRAA04600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":4735,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRAA04700"},{"type":"question","counter":4736,"qnumday":627,"qnumall":"[22400\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRAA04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding an application for a medical card in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 15; if same will be expedited; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":4737,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

The overarching aim of the Programme is to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with asthma in Ireland and to improve clinical outcomes and the quality of life of all patients with asthma.  A key component is the improved management of people with asthma in primary care, thereby, avoiding emergency attendance at General Practitioner (GP) out-of-hours services, at hospital emergency departments and in-patient admission services.<\/p><p><br \/>  The initial focus of the work of the Programme has been primarily on:<blockquote>- The development and implementation of national asthma guidelines based on international best practice for acute and ongoing asthma management and national asthma education initiatives for patients and health care professionals; and<br \/><br \/>- The organisation and better integration of national asthma services at primary and secondary care levels through the development of a national model of care.<\/blockquote>The acute adult and Paediatric asthma guidelines and associated care pathways, treatment protocols and care bundles have now been developed for use in primary and secondary care settings.  The acute adult asthma guidelines, which are available online at <i>www.hse.ie<\/i>  , are currently being revised.<\/p><p><br \/>  The National Asthma Programme is currently working on developing a National Model of Care for Asthma.  The National Clinic Lead for Asthma, supported by the programme's GP Lead, have responsibility in the HSE for the development of the model of care for asthma.  The Integrated Services Directorate has operational responsibility for implementation of the programme, supported by the Clinical Strategy &amp;amp; Programmes Directorate.  The proposed implementation plan will detail how physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals will work with engaged patients to make the clinical decisions most appropriate to the patient's circumstances; while collaborating with specialist colleagues in providing a safe, seamless patient experience within the health system in Ireland.  This is a key deliverable of the National Asthma Programme for 2013.  The National Asthma Progmamme had to prioritise the submission of the Adult Asthma Emergency Guidelines to the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee which had a deadline of March 2013.  The Model of Care for Asthma will be ready for stakeholder consultation by the end of quarter 2.  It is anticipated that it will be completed by the end of quarter 3 this year.<\/p><p><br \/>  As 85% of asthma is managed in primary care without the requirement for hospital specialist services, the National Asthma Programme is currently undertaking work to look at providing a yearly programme of assessment for asthma in primary care called Chronic Disease Watch - Asthma (also referred to as <i>Asthma Check<\/i>).  The development of <i>Asthma Check<\/i>   is being done in conjunction with the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP).  <i>Asthma Check<\/i> outlines the step-by-step process for implementation of guideline based asthma management in primary care to deliver optimal outcomes for patients.  The aim being to facilitate the implementation of best practice asthma guidelines in primary care in order to improve asthma control.  This will reduce acute exacerbations and thus their associated overall costs with fewer hospital bed days and less time off school \/ work.  It will also ensure that patients with asthma maximize their quality of life.<\/p><p><br \/>  The National Asthma Programme expects that savings would be made in, GP out-of-hours visits, Emergency Department attendances and bed days used by implementing the programme.  In addition, a 10% reduction in asthma deaths each year is targeted by the programme.  Consideration is being given to carrying out an economic analysis of the implementation of the acute asthma guidelines with the support of HIQA.  I am satisfied that good progress can be made in the ongoing development of the National Asthma Programme in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRBB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asthma Incidence","counter":4760,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRBB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":4761,"qnumday":637,"qnumall":"[22466\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400073#WRBB00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his Department's estimate of the number of persons here who suffer from asthma; the number of these who are covered by a medical card; the way these figures have been determined; and if it is possible to derive an accurate estimate from PCRS data.","asker":"1178","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":4762,"content":"<p>The HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service has advised that it does not currently collect information regarding an applicant's illness.

The Report includes recommendations for a revision of the National Pandemic Plan (2007) and provides advice on operational arrangements for any future pandemic.  A Working Group will be established to begin this process.<\/p><p>  The purpose of a plan is to limit the effects of a potential pandemic and to inform the public about pandemic influenza, explain what the Government and health services are doing to prepare for a possible pandemic, and give information on what members of the public need to do if there is a pandemic.  The health service response to the threat of an influenza pandemic is based on eight core elements: communications strategy, telephone hotline, responsibilities of the public, surveillance, antiviral drugs, pandemic vaccine, reorganisation of the health services and essential supplies.<\/p><p>  Agreement to improve the European Union health security framework was secured by the Irish Presidency last week.  The Decision will help Member States prepare for, and protect citizens against, possible future pandemics.  The agreement strengthens risk preparedness and response planning, provides a legal basis for the Health Security Committee, improves access to pharmaceutical products, including vaccines, for Member States, and will result in clearer risk and crisis communication to the public and healthcare professionals.  A crucial aspect of the agreement is the establishment of a legal basis for the coordination of vaccine procurement across the EU.  This will provide more equitable access to vaccines and may reduce costs associated with vaccine procurement.

In 2008, the then Government decided, in the light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.<\/p><p>  Part 2 of the Disability Act, inter alia, provides for an assessment of the needs of eligible applicants occasioned by their disability to be commenced within three months of receipt of an application and completed within a further three months.<\/p><p>  There has been a very significant rise in overall activity around the assessment process in recent years in respect of the children now encompassed by the process.  The number of assessment reports received in 2012 was 3,505 which is over 400 applications more than in 2010.  It is worth noting that in the period 2010-2012 over 8,200 reports were completed.  While the HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process given the number and complexity of cases, it is endeavouring to address the issue from available resources.<\/p><p>  While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.  The HSE has issued guidance to its staff that where there is a delay in the assessment process, this should not affect the delivery of necessary and appropriate interventions identified for a particular child.<\/p><p>  In addition targeted action plans have been put in place since early 2011.  Measures have included: prioritising assessments, holding additional clinics, contracting the private sector to conduct assessments and reconfiguring resources to target areas of greatest need.  These plans are monitored on a monthly basis by the HSE centrally.<\/p><p>  Following the publication of a report commissioned from the National Disability Authority by the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive, a major emphasis is being placed on reconfiguring disability services for children into geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams as part of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme which is underway.  The NDA report indicated that where integrated teams were operating, the assessment of need process ran more smoothly.  It found that there was no one single solution to remove all of the challenges to operating a statutory assessment of need.

The Government is also conscious of the position of the Ombudsman that the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant schemes are illegal in the context of the Equal Status Acts.

These reforms will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for medicines resulting in savings for taxpayers and patients.  The Bill passed Report Stage on the 9th of May and will return to the Seanad on the 22nd of May.  It is hoped that the Bill will complete its passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas shortly thereafter.  It is not possible, at this juncture, to provide accurate figures regarding potential savings resulting from the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing, as these depend on various factors including prevailing prices, number of competitors, availability of substitute products, and market dynamics.<\/p><p>  Following intensive negotiations involving the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), the HSE and the Department of Health, a major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded in October last.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs; a lowering of the drugs bill to the State; timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400m over 3 years.  &euro;210 million from the gross savings will make available new drugs to patients over 3 years.  Thus, the deal will result in a net reduction in the HSE expenditure on drugs of about &euro;190m.<\/p><p>  The Department of Health and the HSE have also successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs.  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.<\/p><p>In addition, the recently established HSE Medicines Management Programme has identified &lsquo;preferred drugs&rsquo; for prescribers when prescribing Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) or statin medication for patients.  This is the first time that the State has introduced a preferred drug initiative.  PPIs are prescribed for patients with peptic ulcer disease and\/or reflux and statin medication is for high cholesterol.  The preferred PPI is Lansoprazole and the preferred statin is Simvastatin.  The HSE is asking doctors to prescribe these preferred drugs in order to save money, both for patients who pay for their medication and to deliver savings of an estimated &euro;15million for the taxpayer.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, the European Commission has completed its eighth review of the EU-IMF financial assistance programme for Ireland and has published the technical report by the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs (ECFIN) which assesses programme implementation by the Irish authorities.  The report published on 28th January 2013 identifies areas where the joint EC-ECB-IMF mission considers that further efficiencies could be achieved in the health system.  This includes compulsory prescription by active ingredient rather than by brand name with exceptions only for 'non-substitutability' cases.

My priority is to ensure that those affected by narcolepsy, with symptom onset post pandemic vaccination are provided with a range of services and supports to meet their health needs.   The Irish Medicines Board has indicated that as of 12 May 2013 there are 49 cases with a clinical diagnosis of narcolepsy, with symptom development post pandemic vaccination.  There are a number of cases still under investigation. The majority of cases are in the five to twenty two years age group. The Health Service Executive has responsibility for health service delivery and at my request, the HSE developed a range of appropriate services and supports to address the needs of this group.  Together, the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills provide a very comprehensive range of services and supports to those affected.<\/p><p>  These supports and services include access to rapid diagnosis, clear treatment pathways, temporary medical cards and reimbursement of expenses incurred. This includes expenses for counselling services for individuals and also for families of children affected by narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination,  in cases where such services are not already available through the HSE.  Multi-disciplinary assessments which allow for appropriate individualised health and educational supports to be put in place are ongoing.  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is also engaging with the HSE and with the individual schools and parents of children concerned to identify and provide educational supports for the children and adolescents affected.<\/p><p>  The HSE's advocacy unit is in regular contact with the support group SOUND and last met representatives of the group on 28 February 2013.  Through regional co-ordinators the HSE also has frequent contact with individual members of SOUND to assist them in service access and reimbursement of expenses.   On March 22 the HSE held an information day to ensure those affected were fully aware of all of the the services available.  My Department is considering all possible supports which may need to be put in place for those affected by narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination.  I would like to assure the Deputy that this matter continues to be a priority for my Department.

Rivalries and feuds which develop on the outside continue inside of prison.  Prison management must ensure that the various factions are kept apart and, as far as possible, that gang members do not have influence over other inmates in the prisons or criminal activities on the outside.<\/p><p>  Gang members are managed on a daily basis through segregation and separation throughout the prison system.  Membership\/allegiance of these criminal gangs fluctuates on a continuous basis with some persons breaking links and others becoming affiliated.<\/p><p>  I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that a number of initiatives have been introduced with a view to preventing identified gang leaders from conducting criminal activities while in custody and also to prevent them exerting inappropriate influence over other persons.  For example, the security initiatives undertaken by the Operational Security Group (OSG)  have made it more difficult for prisoners to engage in illegal activities while in prison.  These initiatives include the introduction of passive and active drug detection dogs and the installation of airport style security including scanners and x-ray machines.  Core functions of this group include gathering and collating intelligence information on criminal gang members in custody, carrying out intelligence led searches and preventing the flow of contraband (including mobile phones) into the prisons.<\/p><p>  In addition, there is regular contact between the Prison Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to discuss security issues including the operation of criminal gangs.

To support the achievement of these aims, the Act provides for the establishment of an independent Charities Regulatory Authority.<\/p><p>  I am aware of the recent Prime Time programme which reported, amongst other things, on the issue of theft from charity clothing banks.  Theft is an offence contrary to section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.  A person convicted upon indictment of theft is liable to imprisonment for up to 10 years and\/or an unlimited fine.<\/p><p>  I am also concerned about the reported practice of some collectors of clothing who convey the impression in their promotional literature that they are collecting on behalf of a charity, when this may not actually be the case.  This may lead some people to donate to such collections in the belief that they are supporting a charity and helping to alleviate hardship. This is unfair both to donors whose intention in donating such items is to help those in need, and to bona fide charities that may lose out on donations as a result. It is an offence under section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001 to make gain or cause loss to others by deception.<\/p><p>  In addition to these existing measures under the Criminal Justice Acts, while the Charities Act 2009 does not deal directly with the regulation of Irish charity clothing banks or collections, it does contain measures aimed at preventing the abuse of charitable status. Under section 46 of the Charities Act, it is an offence for an organisation that is not a registered charity to describe itself or its activities in such terms as would cause members of the public to reasonably believe that it is a charitable organisation. This section cannot be commenced until the statutory Register of Charities, also provided for under the Charities Act, is in place.<\/p><p>  While further implementation of the Charities Act and creation of the Register of Charities have been delayed for financial reasons, the Government remains committed to progressing the implementation of the Act and putting in place a dedicated regulatory framework for charities in line with the provisions of the Act. My Department has been examining how best this can be done in the current financial climate.

I have prioritised securing final agreement between the EU Fisheries Council and the Parliament on reform of the CFP throughout the Irish EU Presidency and we are making considerable progress in this regard.

This was the first publication of its kind and placed Ireland firmly to the fore in the debate on eliminating discards and assisted in advancing the case for a phased elimination of discards as part of the CFP reform package.

I am pleased to note that since the introduction of this Scheme that significant quantities of fodder have been imported and are reaching those in most need.<\/p><p>  Following the issue of approximately 1,500 AEOS payments valued at &euro;1.6m over the last two weeks days, close to a further 600 AEOS payments valued at close to &euro;1.5 million will issue this week. Both AEOS 1 and 2 payments will continue to issue in the weeks ahead as outstanding queries are resolved. This will bring the total paid out in respect of the 2012 application period to just over &euro;40m.<\/p><p>  To date approximately 29,200 of the remaining 30,200 REPS 4 participants have been paid a total of &euro;167m in respect of the 2012 application period.  An additional &euro;1m will issue this week to a further 200 REPS 4 farmers.<\/p><p>  I am, of course, keeping the situation under review in light of the ongoing situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400076#WRV04500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sheepmeat Sector","counter":5268,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400076#WRV04550"},{"type":"question","counter":5269,"qnumday":533,"qnumall":"[22537\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400076#WRV04600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the work done by his Department and the agencies operating under the aegis of his Department, particularly An Bord Bia, to find new markets for light hill lambs next Autumn; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":5270,"content":"<p>The market performance of the sheep sector, in common with other agricultural sectors, is a function of supply and demand.<\/p><p>  I am aware that market conditions for light lamb were particularly challenging last year.<\/p><p>  There are two main outlets for light lambs (i) Store lamb trade and (ii) Exports to Mediterranean countries.  The store lamb trade failed to take off in Autumn 2012, largely driven by a poor pasture conditions (limited grass, forage) and lack of confidence on the part of store lamb finishers who were reluctant to buy expensive feed. Demand within the traditional markets for light lamb (Portugal and indirectly Spain) has also been poor over the last two years due to the economic downturn in these regions. Indeed total imports of sheep meat into Portugal and Spain have fallen by 26% and 42% respectively.<\/p><p>  Bearing in mind the difficulties in recent times with these two outlets, the industry and Bord Bia are exploring additional new markets for light lambs for 2013.  These markets include France and the UK, which are the core export markets for Irish lamb, and Sweden, Belgium and Germany, which have been delivering positive growth over the last 2-3 years.  However it must be recognised that light lambs (&amp;lt;13kg) are generally not favoured by consumers in these regions and it is likely that lambs will need to be finished up to a weight of 17kg+.   I understand that Bord Bia has been discussing with the industry on how this could best be done, for example overwinter the lambs and dispose of them in the following Spring. <\/p><p>  Research can also be used to assist light lamb producers to bring the carcass to an acceptable weight specification. The Teagasc BETTER farm programme has a number of hill farms around the country. The aim of this programme is to establish focal points for the on-farm implementation, development and evaluation of technology that is relevant to hill sheep farmers. Close collaboration between Teagasc Researchers &amp;amp; Advisers with these farms aims to help improve profitability of hill sheep production.<\/p><p>  The recently launched Sheep Technology Adoption Programme (STAP) contains a measure designed to help improve the weight, quality and thus price of hill lambs.<\/p><p>  My Department is providing significant funding to Sheep Ireland to help deliver on the significant profit potential that breed improvement can deliver. A number of hill flocks are involved in data recording initiatives which will help identify the most profitable animals to breed from. <\/p><p>  All of these initiatives should help hill farmers in dealing with the vagaries of the market and in matching specification with market requirements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400076#WRV04700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":5272,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400077#WRW00100"},{"type":"question","counter":5273,"qnumday":534,"qnumall":"[22538\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400077#WRW00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the expected total expenditure under the agri-environment schemes under the common agriculture policy programme 2007-2013; the percentage of this that will be co-funded by the Exchequer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":5274,"content":"<p>Expenditure on agri - environment schemes over the period 2007 to 2013 is estimated at &euro;2.015 billion, details as follows: -<\/p><p><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>REPs<\/th><th>AEOS<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>&euro;m.<\/td><td>&euro;m.<\/td><td>&euro;m.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2007<\/td><td>311.750<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>311.750<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>312.080<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>312.080<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>341.123<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>341.123<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>321.864<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>321.864<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>260.952<\/td><td>14.107<\/td><td>275.059<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>198.266<\/td><td>54.947<\/td><td>253.213<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013 estimated<\/td><td>148.575<\/td><td>51.800<\/td><td>200.375<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Estimated Total 2007 to 2013<\/td><td>1,894.610<\/td><td>120.854<\/td><td>2,015.464<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>When EU co funding is taken into account, the net Exchequer cost of funding eligible expenditure on REPs and AEOS agri environment measures is, subject to EU funding limitations, 45% and 25% respectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400077#WRW00300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":5275,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400077#WRW00400"},{"type":"question","counter":5276,"qnumday":535,"qnumall":"[22539\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400077#WRW00500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the expected total expenditure under the disadvantaged area scheme under the common agriculture policy programme 2007-2013; the percentage of this that will be co-funded by the Exchequer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":5277,"qnumday":542,"qnumall":"[22546\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400077#WRW00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the total expenditure under the disadvantaged area scheme each year under the disadvantaged area scheme 2007 to 2013; the expected expenditure under this scheme this year including any payments under the 2013 scheme that will be paid in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":5278,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 535 and 542 together.<\/p><p>Total provision available under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme as provided for in the Rural Development Programme 2007 &ndash; 2013 is &euro;1,799M.

The EU Sugar Regime underwent a radical reform in 2005 following major EU decisions to restructure the industry. A temporary restructuring scheme was introduced with the aim of reducing EU sugar production. Greencore, the holder of the entire Irish sugar quota, availed of this voluntary scheme, dismantled its facilities and ceased production in 2006. Ireland secured &euro;353million as part of the reform package of which &euro;220million went to beet growers, &euro;127million to Greencore and &euro;6million to machinery contractors.<\/p><p><br \/>  Post reform, production in the EU is now concentrated in 18 Member States. The present regime runs from 1 September 2006 to the 30 September 2015. There is no mechanism under the present EU Regulations which would allow for the re-instatement of the sugar quota for the growing of sugar beet in Ireland for the production of sugar. Of course, sugar beet is still grown in Ireland as a fodder crop.<\/p><p><br \/>  In 2011 I met with two separate groups which had conducted feasibility studies, into the possibility of rebuilding a new sugar industry in the country. At both meetings, I stated that any venture to develop a combined sugar\/bioethanol production facility would have to be a commercial proposition, financed in total by investors and interested parties and make sound economic sense in order to be viable. <\/p><p><br \/>  I also further suggested to both groups, the desirability of there being only one single proposition in play, as both studies had indicated a potential for only one such viable project and both groups had appeared to accept the reasonableness of this position at the time. Only recently, I re-stated that any business plan for a new venture in this area, would need to be competitive and that it would have to justify the very substantial investment to build a new facility.<\/p><p><br \/>  In recent discussions at the Council of Agriculture Ministers, which I am chairing under our EU Presidency responsibilities, a deep divide emerged between one group of Member States, including Ireland, which favoured abolition of quotas in 2015 and another group of Member States which wished to extend quotas to 2020 and beyond. As current President of the Council, I made a compromise proposal that garnered the support of a large majority of Member States, to extend the quota regime for a further two years until 30 September 2017 when it will finally cease.  This is the formal negotiating mandate for the Agriculture Council, as we enter the final phase of the ongoing CAP Reform negotiations<i>. <\/i>  The compromise has been welcomed strongly by those who want to re-establish a sugar industry in Ireland. It is my job to ensure that Ireland either has a quota or alternatively can produce sugar in the absence of EU quotas. I would, however, encourage caution on making decisions to planting sugar beet crops or any other investments until we know when Ireland will have the capacity to produce sugar again and when the regime is likely to end.<\/p><p><br \/>  The European Parliament is in favour of extending quotas to 2020. The Council is now in detailed trilogue discussions between the EU Commission and the Parliament on the general CAP Reform package, including the future of the EU Sugar Regime, and I will do everything I can to ensure that we end the Sugar Quota Regime in the EU as soon as possible, so that revival efforts here can get off the ground, as long as the commercial case can be made for them. I am hopeful that I can bring these talks to a successful conclusion before the end of Ireland's Presidency role on 30 June next. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400077#WRW05300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Grants","counter":5325,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400077#WRW05400"},{"type":"question","counter":5326,"qnumday":552,"qnumall":"[22808\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400077#WRW05500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a forestry payment will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":5327,"content":"<p>Our records show that the applicant is registered with the Department&rsquo;s Online Services since May 2012.

This resulted in &euro;22.6 million being allocated in 2005.  From 2006 onwards, the national reserve was replenished only from unused expired entitlements which reverted to the fund.

This inspection regime covers both the eligibility of land declared to drawn down payments and also cross compliance aspects, to ensure adherence with EU regulatory requirements in the areas of public, animal and plant health, environment and animal welfare.<\/p><p>  In order to be eligible under the single payment scheme and other area based schemes, an applicant must ensure that all agricultural land is maintained in good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC.  Issues relating to control of rushes must, therefore, be seen in this overall context.  Farmers can keep grassland in GAEC by conducting an agricultural activity on it, such as grazing, harvesting forage crops, or by topping.  Grasslands continue to be eligible where it is evident that the stocking rate on the land is sufficient and, for example, keeps rushes under control and avoids their proliferation.  In such situations, the reality is there may not be a necessity to cut rushes.  However, where a farmer cuts rushes as part of management practice, with the exception of certain designated lands, there are no restrictions on when this is done, enabling the task to be carried out at any time throughout the year once conditions are suitable.<\/p><p>  I am acutely aware of the weather related difficulties being experienced by farmers and of their concern in respect of their ability to meet the various compliance requirements.  When conducting inspections, my Department&rsquo;s personnel take prevailing weather conditions into account.  For example, where the practice is to cut rushes and it has not been possible to top them in the current year, inspectors will take a broader assessment including whether there is evidence that they have been cut in previous years.<\/p><p>  Where land is deemed ineligible, this, in the main, is a result of the inclusion of ineligible areas or features and where it is not being used for an agricultural purpose. In cases where land with rushes is rejected, it will be seen that this is due to the broader issue of insufficient agricultural activity being undertaken on it to keep it in GAEC.  My Department therefore does not maintain records specifically on the presence of rushes since the issue has to be seen in the broader context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400078#WRX01200","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Grants","counter":5359,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400078#WRX01250"},{"type":"question","counter":5360,"qnumday":563,"qnumall":"[23037\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400078#WRX01300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will expedite a forestry grant payment in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":5361,"content":"<p>This applicant&rsquo;s annual forestry premium for 2013 was paid on 10 May 2013.

The regulations covering production include the European Communities (Hygiene of Foodstuffs) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 369 of 2006), and the European Communities (General Food Law) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No 747 of 2007).<\/p><p>  Bottled water plants also come within the definition of food business operators under EU legislation and, as such, must meet the requirements set down in EC Regulation (EC) 852\/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs which was transposed into national law in 2006. Consequently the operators of water production\/bottling plants must ensure that they meet the high food safety standards set out in the legislation. <\/p><p>  In addition to the general hygiene requirements above at the processing plants, there are separate requirements in relation to bottled water. These are set down in the European Communities (Natural Mineral Waters, Spring Waters and Other Waters in Bottles or Containers) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No 225 of 2007). These requirements include microbiological, chemical and labelling parameters, including sale descriptions. There is on-going testing of all bottled water facilities and the frequency of testing increases in line with production volumes. Business operators must put in place a safety management system which ensures the water is safe for consumption and meets all legal requirements.<\/p><p>  The enforcement of food law is a matter for the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).   Bottled water plants are inspected by Environmental Health Services (EHS) from the Health Service Executive (HSE) operating under a Service Contract with the FSAI and are inspected regularly. Samples are taken and tested generally as part of routine inspections &ndash; the EHS are supported by the HSE&rsquo;s network of official microbiological and chemical laboratories in this regard. <\/p><p>  In December 2011, the FSAI released the results of a major survey of the microbiological safety and quality of bottled water in Ireland. It showed a significant improvement in the microbiological quality of bottled water since the previous survey was conducted in 2007. When samples were tested against all four of the microbiological standards in the legislation, 2% were found to be unsatisfactory (compared to 7% of similar samples in the 2007 survey).   In addition, where non-compliances were detected, manufacturers were required to take immediate corrective actions.<\/p><p>  In collaboration with the FSAI, the HSE organises annual programmes of testing for all foods on sale in Ireland, including bottled water. In 2012 the HSE, as part of the annual surveillance programme, completed 410 analyses on samples of bottled water. No recalls were required during the year.<\/p><p>  The FSAI and EHS have worked with the bottled water industry in Ireland to develop guidance on safe and hygienic production of bottled water resulting in an updated national hygiene standard available through the National Standards Authority of Ireland. The FSAI and HSE continue to monitor production sites and retail outlets and to investigate customer complaints.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400079#WRY01800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Staffing","counter":5393,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400079#WRY01850"},{"type":"question","counter":5394,"qnumday":574,"qnumall":"[22411\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400079#WRY01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he intends to allow dental health nurses in the Dublin area apply for the planned new targeted voluntary redundancy scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":5395,"content":"<p>The health service is required to achieve a workforce of 98,955 whole time equivalents (WTEs) by the end of 2013.

The HSE remains seriously concerned regarding the situation in relation to delayed discharges since the New Year. Delayed Discharges impede the operational functioning of a hospital, and exposes the mainly older persons concerned to the inappropriate risks of acute hospital stays e.g. hospital acquired infections.  Higher numbers of delayed discharges can also be associated with extended waits in the Emergency Department.  There is a body of international evidence that demonstrates that longer ED waits is also associated with poorer mortality and morbidity outcomes for patients.  It is essential that this issue is successfully addressed.  In response to this growth, number of actions have been initiated.  These include the establishment by me of a ministerial Task Force to deliver substantial improvements in delayed discharges, including a review of the operational arrangements associated with the &lsquo;Fair Deal&rsquo; scheme.<\/p><p>  Senior personnel have been tasked with improving cross hospital-community process issues, focusing first on the &lsquo;longest waiting&rsquo; delayed discharges (&amp;gt;100 days).  The aim is to remove all local barriers to discharge and identify those matters which require action at a national level. The management teams have been making good progress with respect to these tasks and it is intended to quickly roll-out this structure to all areas.  <\/p><p>  New reporting systems and processes have also been introduced. A HSE web-based database that allows tracking at patient level (on an anonymous basis) is in the implementation phase in a number of hospital sites.  In addition, the current categorisation of reasons for delay has been reviewed. New categories, which should give enhanced data on the blocks to discharge, are due for implementation nationally on May 20.  The data captured through the web-based system will facilitate revised metrics for each hospital.

This means that on-duty ambulance crews are at their stations or in their vehicles during a shift, rather than having to be summoned to the station in the event of a call-out. Therefore, crews can respond to an emergency call immediately, instead of the average time of over 20 minutes for a vehicle to leave the station under on-call. This change, which was sought by both staff and the NAS, has obvious benefits for patients and response times and represents a clear improvement in service. <\/p><p>  The NAS intends to introduce on-duty rostering and dynamic deployment of emergency resources, on a phased basis, across the entire Cork and Kerry region. So far, on-duty and dynamic deployment arrangements have been successfully introduced across County Cork, most recently in West Cork. <\/p><p>  The NAS informs me that planning for the next phase, in South Kerry, can now be progressed. This phase will include ambulance stations in Caherciveen, Killarney and Kenmare. As in each phase to date, any decisions on the best model of service for South Kerry will be preceded by detailed consideration of activity, geography, demographics, location of acute hospitals and other facilities, supporting services, wider NAS developments and learning from previous phases, as well as public, clinical and community leader engagement.<\/p><p>  The HSE is currently considering the most appropriate model of service delivery for South Kerry, to replace the current on-call, static deployment model and the operation of resources in isolation.

However, if a private designated bed is not available and a private in-patient is accommodated in a public bed, the maintenance charge is currently not levied, although the private in-patient continues to pay the fees of his\/her hospital consultant.<\/p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General has reported that 45% of in-patients treated privately by their consultants were not charged for their maintenance costs because they were not occupying private-designated beds.  This situation represents a significant loss of income to the public hospital system and an indirect subsidy to private insurance companies, who cover most private patients.  I believe that this situation cannot continue and that the new charge makes sense. Up to now insurers have enjoyed a significant subsidy, where these private patients have only paid a standard &euro;75 charge per night even though they have seen their consultant privately.<\/p><p>  The gap between the cost of providing this service to private in-patients and the amount that public hospitals are currently allowed to raise is estimated to be about a quarter of a billion euro. The subsidy is equivalent to the cost of running a hospital the size of the Mater, or the cost of treating over 30,000 public patients every year. While everyone is entitled to use a public hospital, some people chose to be treated privately, in which case they have chosen to pay the consultant and the hospital. The Government believes that users of private services should pay for the costs of providing these services even when they are provided by a public hospital.<\/p><p>  As part of Budget 2013, the Government announced that it would raise &euro;60m in 2013 under this heading, and &euro;115m in a full year. This represents a modest phasing in of the charge &ndash; as called for by the insurers themselves - and is a relatively modest extra cost on an industry that pays out some &euro;2 billion in claims costs every year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400081#WRAA04600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":5531,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400081#WRAA04700"},{"type":"question","counter":5532,"qnumday":627,"qnumall":"[22400\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400081#WRAA04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding an application for a medical card in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 15; if same will be expedited; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1175","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":5533,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

The overarching aim of the Programme is to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with asthma in Ireland and to improve clinical outcomes and the quality of life of all patients with asthma.  A key component is the improved management of people with asthma in primary care, thereby, avoiding emergency attendance at General Practitioner (GP) out-of-hours services, at hospital emergency departments and in-patient admission services.<\/p><p><br \/>  The initial focus of the work of the Programme has been primarily on:<blockquote>- The development and implementation of national asthma guidelines based on international best practice for acute and ongoing asthma management and national asthma education initiatives for patients and health care professionals; and<br \/><br \/>- The organisation and better integration of national asthma services at primary and secondary care levels through the development of a national model of care.<\/blockquote>The acute adult and Paediatric asthma guidelines and associated care pathways, treatment protocols and care bundles have now been developed for use in primary and secondary care settings.  The acute adult asthma guidelines, which are available online at <i>www.hse.ie<\/i>  , are currently being revised.<\/p><p><br \/>  The National Asthma Programme is currently working on developing a National Model of Care for Asthma.  The National Clinic Lead for Asthma, supported by the programme's GP Lead, have responsibility in the HSE for the development of the model of care for asthma.  The Integrated Services Directorate has operational responsibility for implementation of the programme, supported by the Clinical Strategy &amp;amp; Programmes Directorate.  The proposed implementation plan will detail how physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals will work with engaged patients to make the clinical decisions most appropriate to the patient's circumstances; while collaborating with specialist colleagues in providing a safe, seamless patient experience within the health system in Ireland.  This is a key deliverable of the National Asthma Programme for 2013.  The National Asthma Progmamme had to prioritise the submission of the Adult Asthma Emergency Guidelines to the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee which had a deadline of March 2013.  The Model of Care for Asthma will be ready for stakeholder consultation by the end of quarter 2.  It is anticipated that it will be completed by the end of quarter 3 this year.<\/p><p><br \/>  As 85% of asthma is managed in primary care without the requirement for hospital specialist services, the National Asthma Programme is currently undertaking work to look at providing a yearly programme of assessment for asthma in primary care called Chronic Disease Watch - Asthma (also referred to as <i>Asthma Check<\/i>).  The development of <i>Asthma Check<\/i>   is being done in conjunction with the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP).  <i>Asthma Check<\/i> outlines the step-by-step process for implementation of guideline based asthma management in primary care to deliver optimal outcomes for patients.  The aim being to facilitate the implementation of best practice asthma guidelines in primary care in order to improve asthma control.  This will reduce acute exacerbations and thus their associated overall costs with fewer hospital bed days and less time off school \/ work.  It will also ensure that patients with asthma maximize their quality of life.<\/p><p><br \/>  The National Asthma Programme expects that savings would be made in, GP out-of-hours visits, Emergency Department attendances and bed days used by implementing the programme.  In addition, a 10% reduction in asthma deaths each year is targeted by the programme.  Consideration is being given to carrying out an economic analysis of the implementation of the acute asthma guidelines with the support of HIQA.  I am satisfied that good progress can be made in the ongoing development of the National Asthma Programme in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400082#WRBB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asthma Incidence","counter":5556,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400082#WRBB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":5557,"qnumday":637,"qnumall":"[22466\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400082#WRBB00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his Department's estimate of the number of persons here who suffer from asthma; the number of these who are covered by a medical card; the way these figures have been determined; and if it is possible to derive an accurate estimate from PCRS data.","asker":"1178","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":5558,"content":"<p>The HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service has advised that it does not currently collect information regarding an applicant's illness.

The number of assessment reports received in 2012 was 3,505 which is over 400 applications more than in 2010.  It is worth noting that in the period 2010-2012 over 8,200 reports were completed.  While the HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process given the number and complexity of cases, it is endeavouring to address the issue from available resources.<\/p><p>  While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.  The HSE has issued guidance to its staff that where there is a delay in the assessment process, this should not affect the delivery of necessary and appropriate interventions identified for a particular child.<\/p><p>  In addition targeted action plans have been put in place since early 2011.  Measures have included: prioritising assessments, holding additional clinics, contracting the private sector to conduct assessments and reconfiguring resources to target areas of greatest need.  These plans are monitored on a monthly basis by the HSE centrally.<\/p><p>  Following the publication of a report commissioned from the National Disability Authority by the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive, a major emphasis is being placed on reconfiguring disability services for children into geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams as part of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme which is underway.  The NDA report indicated that where integrated teams were operating, the assessment of need process ran more smoothly.  It found that there was no one single solution to remove all of the challenges to operating a statutory assessment of need.  A meeting involving the Department, the HSE and the NDA has been arranged for early June to discuss the Report further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400084#WRDD00800","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Services Provision","counter":5661,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400084#WRDD00850"},{"type":"question","counter":5662,"qnumday":684,"qnumall":"[22823\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400084#WRDD00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the major collective effect of the cuts to personal assistants and the mobility allowance for children and adults with a disability; and if he will reverse these cuts.","asker":"1017","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":5663,"content":"<p>The Government currently provides funding of over &euro;1.5 billion to the Disability Services Programme, through the Health Service Executive's (HSE) National Service Plan for 2013 and is committed to protecting frontline services for people with disabilities to the greatest possible extent.

These reforms will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for medicines resulting in savings for taxpayers and patients.  The Bill passed Report Stage on the 9th of May and will return to the Seanad on the 22nd of May.  It is hoped that the Bill will complete its passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas shortly thereafter.  It is not possible, at this juncture, to provide accurate figures regarding potential savings resulting from the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing, as these depend on various factors including prevailing prices, number of competitors, availability of substitute products, and market dynamics.<\/p><p>  Following intensive negotiations involving the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), the HSE and the Department of Health, a major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded in October last.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs; a lowering of the drugs bill to the State; timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions, and reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400m over 3 years.  &euro;210 million from the gross savings will make available new drugs to patients over 3 years.  Thus, the deal will result in a net reduction in the HSE expenditure on drugs of about &euro;190m.<\/p><p>  The Department of Health and the HSE have also successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represents the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs.  It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.<\/p><p>In addition, the recently established HSE Medicines Management Programme has identified &lsquo;preferred drugs&rsquo; for prescribers when prescribing Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) or statin medication for patients.  This is the first time that the State has introduced a preferred drug initiative.  PPIs are prescribed for patients with peptic ulcer disease and\/or reflux and statin medication is for high cholesterol.  The preferred PPI is Lansoprazole and the preferred statin is Simvastatin.  The HSE is asking doctors to prescribe these preferred drugs in order to save money, both for patients who pay for their medication and to deliver savings of an estimated &euro;15million for the taxpayer.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, the European Commission has completed its eighth review of the EU-IMF financial assistance programme for Ireland and has published the technical report by the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs (ECFIN) which assesses programme implementation by the Irish authorities.  The report published on 28th January 2013 identifies areas where the joint EC-ECB-IMF mission considers that further efficiencies could be achieved in the health system.  This includes compulsory prescription by active ingredient rather than by brand name with exceptions only for 'non-substitutability' cases.  The implications of this recommendation are being examined by my Department at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400084#WRDD03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services, Cost of Medicines","counter":5694,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400084#WRDD03150"},{"type":"question","counter":5695,"qnumday":697,"qnumall":"[23013\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400084#WRDD03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which drug costs have fluctuated in each of the past five years to date; the way this has affected the budgetary situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":5696,"qnumday":698,"qnumall":"[23014\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400084#WRDD03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which a rise in costs of any particular or specific drugs has been identified over the past five years to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":5697,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 697 and 698 together.<\/p><p>The costs of drugs and medicines for the last 5 years are set out in the table below (corresponding figures for 2012 are not yet available).<\/p><p><table><tr><th> -<\/th><th><div><b>2011<\/b><b>(000s)<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>2010<\/b><b>(000s)<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>2009<\/b><b>(000s)<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>2008<\/b><b>(000s)<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>2007<\/b><b>(000s)<\/b><\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Cost of Drugs and Medicines<\/td><td><br \/><br \/>&euro;1,467,575<\/td><td><br \/><br \/>&euro;1,533,619<\/td><td><br \/><br \/>&euro;1,659,931<\/td><td><br \/><br \/>&euro;1,595,089<\/td><td><br \/><br \/>&euro;1,480,201<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>There has been a general price freeze in operation in Ireland for medicines since the mid 1990's.

The Irish Medicines Board has indicated that as of 12 May 2013 there are 49 cases with a clinical diagnosis of narcolepsy, with symptom development post pandemic vaccination.  There are a number of cases still under investigation. The majority of cases are in the five to twenty two years age group. The Health Service Executive has responsibility for health service delivery and at my request, the HSE developed a range of appropriate services and supports to address the needs of this group.  Together, the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills provide a very comprehensive range of services and supports to those affected.<\/p><p>  These supports and services include access to rapid diagnosis, clear treatment pathways, temporary medical cards and reimbursement of expenses incurred. This includes expenses for counselling services for individuals and also for families of children affected by narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination,  in cases where such services are not already available through the HSE.  Multi-disciplinary assessments which allow for appropriate individualised health and educational supports to be put in place are ongoing.  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is also engaging with the HSE and with the individual schools and parents of children concerned to identify and provide educational supports for the children and adolescents affected.<\/p><p>  The HSE's advocacy unit is in regular contact with the support group SOUND and last met representatives of the group on 28 February 2013.

There are now over 3,500 individual gatherings confirmed on the Gathering website. These include clan gatherings, festivals, special sporting events and concerts taking place all across the country throughout the year.

However contact between our two sponsoring\u00a0Departments is ongoing, I am kept appraised of progress and any significant developments are discussed at plenary meetings of the North South Ministerial Council.<\/p><p>  At the North-South Ministerial Council plenary on 18 November 2011, it was noted that the Irish Government\u00a0would provide &pound;25 million per annum in 2015 and 2016 towards the A5 road project.  This is further\u00a0to\u00a0&pound;22 million that the Irish Government has already contributed to the\u00a0project as part of the planning process.\u00a0 It brings the Exchequer commitment to &pound;72 million.<\/p><p>  The Northern Ireland Road Service had planned to start\u00a0construction on two of the approved sections of the A5 in autumn last year. However, following publication of the necessary statutory Orders in advance of construction, the Minister for Regional Development&rsquo;s decision to proceed with the\u00a0A5 was challenged by a group known as the Alternative A5 Alliance.<\/p><p>  While the Northern High Court rejected the majority of the applicants&rsquo; grounds of challenge,\u00a0one was upheld.\u00a0 The judge found that an appropriate assessment under the Habitats Directive should have been carried out on the scheme.\u00a0 On that basis at a further hearing on 8 April 2013 the judge confirmed he would quash the Orders relating to the A5 scheme.<\/p><p>  The project was discussed at the North South Ministerial Council Transport Sectoral on 17 April and the Minister for Regional Development now plans to undertake the environmental assessment required under the Habitats Directive.  This is a necessary first step to progress the project and it must be allowed run its course. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400087#WRGG01200","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":5848,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400087#WRGG01250"},{"type":"question","counter":5849,"qnumday":756,"qnumall":"[22883\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013051400087#WRGG01300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the individual amount of overtime paid in the case of each political\/Ministerial appointee for the period 2007 to date in 2013 relative to his office and the office of the Minister of State; if such payments were made to the Secretary General and advisors, and if so, the amounts for the same period.","asker":"965","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":5850,"content":"<p>The figures relating to overtime payments made to Ministerial appointees are contained in\u00a0Tables 1 and 2\u00a0below.
