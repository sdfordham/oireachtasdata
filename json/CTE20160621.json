They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p> On behalf of the committee, I welcome all of the delegates and thank them for meeting us.  There was a difficulty about having the meeting tomorrow and I thank them for facilitating us today.  As they will be aware, the committee is drawing a blueprint for the more effective scrutiny of budgetary proposals.  There is an opportunity for the Oireachtas to play a greater role in the budgetary cycle.  In that regard, having all proposals subjected to scrutiny from equality, poverty and other perspectives will be extremely important.  This issue has been raised by members of the committee.  That is reason it is important we hear directly from the members of the commission.  I thank them for their submission.  I now invite Ms Logan to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016062100002#B00200","speaker":"1265","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1466521200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for accommodating us.  We have a board meeting tomorrow.  That is the reason we wanted to meet today.<br\/><br\/>Let me make some introductory remarks to put the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission in context in relation to the committee's mandate.  The commission was established in November 2014 as a single legal entity.  It is an amalgam of the Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights Commission.  The most significant change is the commission's new level of institutional independence.  This is demonstrated by having our own Vote and the fact that the 15 members of the commission were appointed by the President, Mr. Michael D. Higgins.  As independent officers of the State, we account directly to the Oireachtas.  <br\/><br\/>The 2014 Act gives us a range of powers, from promotion and education, raising awareness of equality and human rights to significant legal powers whereby we appear before the superior courts in cases as <i>amicus curiae<\/i>.  Across that gamut, our role involves promoting human rights and equality standards.<br\/><br\/>In terms of where we sit globally, we are part of a regional equality and human rights mechanism.  We link with our European counterparts and also strongly with the United Nations.  We are obliged legally to report independently to the UN treaty monitoring mechanisms, the relevant one being the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which sat in June 2015.  Essentially, the purpose of the commission in interacting with that committee is to engage in human rights and equality-based critiques of law, policy and practice.  The commission's interaction with the committee was very unusual in the sense that UN committees do not normally get into the details of domestic financial matters.  <br\/><br\/>I want to mention two comments that were significant.  The committee criticised the State's response to the financial crisis, suggesting it had been focused disproportionately on instituting cuts in public expenditure in the areas of housing, social security measures, health and education without altering the tax regime.  It was suggested many austerity measures had been adopted during and after the crisis but without a proper assessment across Departments of their impact on economic, social and cultural rights.  <br\/><br\/>I will conclude on that point, but I wanted to put the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission in context to ensure members would understand it was not simply an advocacy organisation but one that carried a variety of legal powers.  They relate to economic, social and cultural rights and cover the gamut of equality and human rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016062100002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Emily Logan"},{"type":"speech","time":1466521200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>It is clear from the submission that the commission is at a stage where it is building.

Does it employ an economist?<\/p> <p>  The submission refers to the links the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has developed with international proofing experts such as the Central American Institute of Fiscal Studies and its in-house experience in gender equality and poverty proofing budgets.  It also refers to the prohibition of regressive measures in budgeting.  What precisely is meant by this phrase?  For example, the submission refers to the recent recession.

It would probably be useful to make clear from the start that, by necessity, a vast amount of this work can only be done within Departments.  As Ms Logan stated, a large part of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission's legal mandate is to encourage, but it is also to assist and support.  We do not put ourselves forward as the proofing mechanism because, by necessity, the policies that are known and need to be proofed are within Departments, particularly at the most sensitive stage of the budget cycle when one would like to see an engagement with them before they become policy.  That is ideally where one would like to eventually place the heart of one's proofing mechanisms, but we do not believe that is necessarily our role.  While there may be instances when we may be called in to assist in that role or around the edges of it, there is already the skills capacity to some degree in Departments and it is being used in various ways to engage in proofing.  The issue is bringing together these mechanisms to make more sense of them in order that they have an input into the budgetary process to good effect.  We are not putting ourselves forward as the proofing mechanism.<\/p> <p>  The capacities we have been trying to draw up internationally are primarily through the European Network of National Human Rights Institutions, ENNHRI, and Equinet, the European network of equality institutions.  These networks have subgroups which engage with information sharing and expertise networks on proofing mechanisms.  We have also networked into the New York-based Centre for Economic and Social Rights which is probably the most effective organisation globally for advancing a range of mechanisms centred on bringing human rights principles into proofing mechanisms.  Deputy Hildegarde Naughten also referred to the Latin American specialist centre which engages, in particular, in revenue proofing and tax or fiscal proofing and has at its disposal a range of mechanisms it has developed.  What we bring, in the first instance, is knowledge of what mechanisms are being used globally and who is using them to good effect.  We also know, for example, that when training and experts are required or specific enabling or mentoring is required, we can tap in and quickly make these resources available through our networks.  We view this as very much part of the process.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked a question about the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission's in-house capacity.  Section 18 of the legislation allows us to set up a statutory research advisory group, which would include international legal and policy experts with some experience of proofing.  The group has already met.  Let me give an example of what it is doing.  Having scoured the British Isles to some degree, we will on Friday next, 24 June, bring together a range of actors from academic, legal and policy practitioner circles with experience of the various aspects of proofing.<\/p><p>We are bringing together a range of the actors from academic, legal and policy practitioner circles who we believe have had experience of the various aspects of proofing.  We are doing a technical workshop with them in the first instance to find as quick and as effective a way as is possible of drawing out that learning and then shaping it to make it available to these processes as they emerge.  We are not saying we have a staff member who can do a proofing exercise in a Department.  Neither do we think we should because we do not believe that would be the most effective way of ensuring proofing impacts on the policy process.<\/p><p> In terms of human rights principles, there are several policy guidance mechanisms which help guide policy.  Some of them are about the progressive realisation of particular human rights, some are about protecting core basic standards which should not be undermined, and others are about looking at tax policy to ensure the maximum available resources are being progressively realised.  The Deputy referred specifically to the principle of non-retrogression.  In that context, the UN International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights drew up a series of advices for governments when they are operating in the context of austerity or some type of economic crisis.  It advised a policy process akin to proofing and asked governments to engage in this to justify the degree to which any retrogression of an existing human right could be justified.  Some of the processes include asking the government in question if it has exhausted all possible other remedies or has it put in place mechanisms to ensure ways to redress the policy once resources become available again.<\/p><p> These processes are quite practical at one level in saying that a government should only regress a right that has already been progressively realised in the event of having gone through particular safeguards in terms of policy process.  On the other level, they must ensure the cut has been made in a way that it can effectively be restored.  There are a range of principles about how a government does not retrogress the right to the degree that it cannot be brought back once resources become available again.  These are all practical, in some respects, in giving guidance as to how policy might better protect rights in a period where they would be perceived to be under threat, perhaps through no fault of a government.  It gives almost a governance process through which it can be managed, be more accountable or transparent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016062100002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466521200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>If this expertise is not in-house, could this consultative process report back within the correct timeframe?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016062100002#E00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1466521200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>The commitment in the programme for Government is to put in place policies and procedures for proofing budget-making on an ongoing basis.  It will mean a change in the system of how we develop and put out budget policy.  However, there is a bit of tension with the fact that we are quite far into this year&rsquo;s budget cycle, an issue which has already been discussed by the committee.  It is important to keep in mind that we need to deal in a short-term way but not lose sight of the fact that the commitments to proofing are about how we change the way we do business in a positive way for the future.  Essentially, that is not just a one-off in this context.<\/p> <p>  The key point Dr. Mary Murphy made is that we are talking about changing the system in how we develop budgets through making certain types of information more clearly available, certain choices more clearly articulated, greater transparency and a greater oversight and engagement role for the Oireachtas in that.  It is not simply somebody from the outside dipping into that process.<\/p><p>Rather, we want to examine the way we develop budgets at each stage of the budgetary cycle and see how we can build in the capacity to ensure that the areas we are discussing - equality, gender and poverty proofing - are taken into account as policies are being formed and there is some assessment of them which is brought to the Oireachtas to inform the debate here.  We can try to assist people in terms of thinking around this.  We are talking about a change in the budgetary system and it must be filtered through at all levels of that system.<\/p><p> In the much shorter term, everybody is on the back foot in terms of how we can address the issue of proofing immediately in the budget.  It must be approached with a pragmatic mind.  To some extent, there may be a need to identify some key areas where it is almost worth learning by doing, that there is an engagement that tries to establish a practice and insight as to how it might be done in the future.  It is important to keep the short-term and long-term perspectives in place.  Who can do this?  While we can assist with it to a certain degree, we cannot do it all for the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016062100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Laurence Bond","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466521200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  Mr. Bond made the point that there is a commitment in the programme for Government to improve input into policy procedures regarding the formation of budgets.  This comes from an OECD report which critiqued the State's previous approaches to budget making.  We all agree that in the past, much scrutiny was carried out by Opposition spokespersons almost immediately after the relevant Minister or Ministers presented the budget.  The first sight those spokespersons would have of the budget was when it was presented and they had no indication of any of the measures it contained beforehand.  Often, the analysis of whether a measure is progressive or regressive comes from the ESRI or think tanks after the budget has been introduced.  If we can move away from this to a position where we would have more input before the budget is brought forward, that would be a welcome development.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Murphy stated that the Departments should carry out the proofing.  While I have no difficulty with this, we must ensure we get the proofing tools right first and foremost.  This is crucial.  I am interested in international best practice in the area and in what works well.  At its first meeting, the committee discussed equality, gender, poverty and rural proofing.  Some of the media commentary was negative and asked what all this proofing means.  Could the witnesses spell out the importance of it in the context of equality budgeting?  We must give it that importance first.  What tools would be best for the Departments to use?  Which body should oversee it to ensure that the tools are working effectively and that we are analysing and scrutinising proposals from both the Opposition and the Government?

The first is what we describe as the family of proofing tools.  The Deputy referred to three of the four that are traditionally used internationally.  Human rights and equality are often conceptually separate, then there is gender proofing and poverty reduction.  In one of our closest neighbours, Scotland, the department of finance has led the process up to recently, when it was moved to the department of the Prime Minister.  It is similar to our having the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which has a role for the public reform programme.  If something is embedded institutionally in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, other Departments will generally follow.  The other strand of the question relates to political leadership and whether the Taoiseach's office has a role to play.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016062100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Emily Logan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1466521200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>It draws on our experience.  Ireland showed considerable leadership in the mid-1990s.<\/p><p>We were probably one of the first countries to roll out poverty proofing and to try to put in place the institutional mechanisms.  Some useful learning is still available to us to draw on.  Part of this relates to the role of political leadership.  The placement of oversight mechanisms is important in giving enough authority to one Department to persist with other Departments and their engagement in poverty proofing.  One of the key international lessons is where the oversight mechanism is placed without the Department and the enabler of the proofing.  That is important and we examined the idea of the Departments of the Taoiseach and Public Expenditure and Reform leading.  That mirrors the Scottish experience, for example.  The oversight mechanisms were located as near as possible to the finance department, which acted as the driver to other departments to know they had to engage with it if they wanted their money.  That is an important lesson<\/p><p> Other lessons that emerged from the early experiences of proofing was the degree to which these mechanisms were institutionally embedded as well.  The more they are seen to be statutory and not the product of a particular Government but a product of long-term change in political institutions, the better.  It is important for them to be embedded.  There are related experiences that show they need to be adequately resourced.  The type of proofing tools and the type of data available matter.  Mistakes are often made when people think they can take one tool and kill all birds with it.  That is not the case across the range of equality grounds.  Some grounds simply do not lend themselves to such proofing, perhaps using SWITCH, because the data are not available.  Other types of proofing are, therefore, required such as case study approaches or deeper consultation-led proofing approaches.  There is a rich range of lessons to learn.  Our starting point in thinking about that would be, as Mr. Bond said, for the committee to get the balance right between tactically trying to keep the issue on the agenda in the short term and demonstrating outcomes from proofing exercises in the short term, which is a necessary aspect of trying to make sure it happens, and then strategically giving the time and space to get it right in the longer term in order that it becomes embedded.  It is about trying to get the balance right between doing something but not doing so much so quickly that people's support for it is lost.  We have had to think a little about this because our impulse is to jump in and say, \"Let us do this.  There is so much that could be done it would be wonderful\".<\/p><p> Deputy Naughton asked what short-term tactical measures could be taken in the budget that would lay the ground for opening up the wider range of deeper, strategic changes that could be embedded over a range of budgets.  We have been thinking about that and we have very much asked questions of our assembled experts to give us guidance on Friday such as what is practical now and what would one best spend one's time and money on in this budget in such a way as to ensure that the right doors are being opened up and the right ground work is being laid for subsequent budgets.<\/p><p> With regard to how the commission could engage in this budget, there will be a need to seek the engagement of some Departments which are doing a good deal of this work, for example, for the tax strategy groups and their own policy work but then the issue is how that work is utilised and drawn into the wider budgetary process, including the parliamentary process and the wider public process that goes with that.  We have set aside resources in acknowledgment that the commission may have a specific role here and there in the short term in trying to advance a particular model of how something could be done or comparing and contrasting two different models to see if they generate better options.  Of the human rights family of proofing options that Ms Logan referred to, we are conscious that we have the least experience in Ireland of that range of options but they have been used to good effect in other jurisdictions, which have creative and concrete tools that could be experimented with or piloted in the short term but there is no Irish context to draw on there.<\/p><p> There is good experience in Ireland of the equality and gender mainstreaming options.  In particular, the Department of Justice and Equality led with the equality mainstreaming unit.  Much of that has been well evaluated.  The learning is still there and the skills are still available and the Equality Authority had that direct experience in-house and could more quickly activate that part of it.<\/p><p>The actors involved in rolling out the poverty impact assessment are still in the system and those kinds of lessons are available to us.<\/p><p> We are also conscious that the committee wanted to engage in regional and rural proofing.  To some degree the previous poverty-proofing mechanisms engaged in rural questions.  We are also aware that, for example, international human rights instruments, such as the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, CEDAW, also bring that regional and rural dimension very specifically into their mechanisms for policy proofing.<\/p><p> We believe the range is rich enough and it is not necessary to invent something.  What complex blend of them would work best in our institutional settings at this time is a matter of short-term and longer-term experimentation.  How we lay out a path to do that is of tactical and strategic importance.  We would be very willing to tease that out more and that is what we are equipping ourselves to do on Friday.  We are very aware that this is a significant opportunity but the bigger aim is to try to achieve it in a way that it becomes institutionally embedded and would last across governments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016062100002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1466521200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>As Dr. Murphy mentioned, we carry out some proofing at the moment.  The Deputy mentioned that through the simulating welfare and income tax changes, SWITCH, model, for example, we assess some of the impacts of tax and social welfare measures in particular.  However, that occurs mostly after the budget in a public domain.  Some of that is carried out within Departments in the lead-up to the budget.  Some of that is done for the tax strategy group.  There is a commitment to bring the tax strategy group papers into the budget debate earlier this year, although still quite late.<br\/><br\/>There is an argument for trying to find what has already been done and bring it into the deliberative process of the Oireachtas now rather than after the budget as part of the very short-term things.  The kind of micro-simulation modelling that has been used with SWITCH can be adapted for other purposes.  For example, the Equality Authority commissioned a pilot study of how SWITCH could be used to analyse gender impacts.  In principle it can be used to analyse impacts on some of the other grounds to a limited extent because obviously it is very much dependent on the data in the model.<br\/><br\/>That type of thinking about impact assessment only works for certain types of policies, essentially tax and welfare type policies.  Of course a huge amount of expenditure on policy is not on those types of things.  It is important to think about the types of mechanisms required to assess other types of spending commitments in terms of their impact on poverty, gender and equality.  That is harder to build on because to some extent we are not talking about an off-the-shelf model that can be used or applied.<br\/><br\/>However, there is important experience of how that is done in other jurisdictions.  Obviously, Oireachtas Members have frequently visited Scotland to learn from its experience.  In its budget formation it focuses on equality proofing.  As Departments are preparing their budget framework, their budget bids, they are required to prepare an equality impact assessment that is matched to their budget framework.  All that is published together.  They publish a draft budget considerably ahead of their final budget so it allows them to do that.  To do that, they have systems and tools in place partly at departmental level and partly co-ordinated at a central level.<br\/><br\/>There are some things in the system already that allow for some kind of assessment of certain policies, but at the moment that is not coming forward early enough in the policy formation process.  Most people other than those in the Departments are hearing about it <i>ex post<\/i>.  To bring that up to <i>ex <\/i>ante in the process would be a first step.  There are also specific experiences, for example, in Scotland, whereby in the development of budget policy around other types of expenditure there are mechanisms for equality impact assessment and poverty impact assessment, some of which mirror stuff we may have tried but left behind in earlier years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016062100002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Laurence Bond"},{"type":"speech","time":1466521200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Bond.

Dr. Mary Murphy made the point that the commission will not be the proofer; that is the capacity within Departments.  Mr. Laurence Bond touched on it in terms of the Scottish model.  Will a Department official be sufficiently empowered to call out their line manager, principal officer or Secretary General if they consider that not enough quality proofing is taking place in the budget presentation?  Mr. Laurence Bond mentioned that the Scottish model has systems and tools in place partly at departmental level and partly co-ordinated at a central level.  Is there some type of clearing house where, if somebody within a Department holds the view that an issue has not been addressed within the Department, he or she can send it to him?  If an agency that feeds into the Department considers that the budget submission is failing that test is there a clearing house mechanism?

The Deputy is absolutely right, institutional independence is critical.

That has been my experience in the past 13 years.  I may have had a telephone call but certainly I have never had any attempt to interfere so it does protect the institution if we are independent officers of the State.  Interaction and accountability to the Oireachtas is a fundamental tenet of the credibility of an institution like that.  In terms of our interaction with Departments, we would have quite considerable interaction around draft legislation when it is at general scheme stage.  We have a provision to interact with Department officials who are writing legislation and, yes, we are giving some of the hard messages.  We are accustomed to navigating that space where we try to hold a Department to account or encourage it to do the best job it can while respecting that it has a job to do.  If that is done in a respectable way, it is possible to navigate that independent path but certainly it would be welcomed.<\/p> <p>  The second part I want to pick up on is in relation to the \"caller outer\".  One of the other provisions I would encourage parliamentarians to use is what is called our section 42 in the 2014 Act.  That section deals with public duty.  One will hear the commission speak about this from the autumn and we will get greater publicity around it.  Essentially, it is a new legal obligation on all public bodies from 1 November 2014 to try to eliminate discrimination and have regard for human rights and provide opportunity of treatment and inservice provision of equality.  That is a calling out piece.  There is a compliance piece for us.  At the moment that is not very well understood or certainly not well communicated across the public bodies in terms of the obligation they now have.  As an independent institution we have done some work already with local authorities.  I met representatives of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council in respect of Traveller accommodation.  That is about trying to encourage public bodies to understand that the lens through which they make decisions must be human rights and equality compliant.  I appreciate it talks about principles rather than quantitative economics but it is about a different approach to decision making for people who will be in very powerful positions and making decisions that can profoundly affect people's lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016062100002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Emily Logan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1466521200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I will start by saying that we will not be the proofer.  I will end up being quoted on that in all the wrong ways.  In any event, what I meant was that it is not really an issue of our capacity - to some degree that is not relevant question - rather, it is simply not appropriate for the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to be the proofer.  The proofer should be the Department that is considering the development of the policy and that is responsible for building the proofing mechanisms as early as possible into that policy process - right from the very start in fact.  That is why we should not be the proofer.  There may be instances - for example, learning-by-doing or enabling instances - whereby we would be perfectly willing to engage in partnership exercises with specific Departments at certain stages in the development of the skillsets they may need.  Some of these are in-house in any event and it is a matter of using them in a different way or perhaps sometimes in a different spirit.  That is why we should not be the proofer.  The aim is to embed the process of proofing as early as possible in the Department's process and to make that information available to all the actors in the policy process, preferably as early as possible.  That is the reason.  It is not about our capacity.  The IHREC orients its capacity and tries to play a role in giving support to the process rather than the execution of it.  That is what I mean about building up networks, providing quality training, information, briefing sheets and so on.  In other words, our role is an enabling role as well as serving as the body that calls out when it is appropriate.<\/p> <p>  I thought it might be useful to comment the other question by reference to the Scottish process.  Those involved took the view that it was important institutionally to drive forward the process and keep it on the road when it was sometimes a little shaky using what they called EBAG.  I would not particularly recommend that acronym but it stands for Equality and Budget Advisory Group of the Scottish Parliament.  That is the term they use but this committee might think of a more creative name for it.  They try to get together relevant people such as, for example, the Chairman of this committee, senior civil servants of the lead Department and perhaps organisations like the IHREC, as well as one or two others.  It brings together the central actors and tries to keep the show on the road in the most tactical and strategic way.  That group minds and nurtures the process over time.  It engages in problem-solving, troubleshoots and tries to anticipate where things may need to be called out.  As far as I know, it is a sensitive group and the people on it are charged with minding that area and behaving maturely.  The various actors have to co-operate because they will have a different range of interests.  It seems to work well and it may be a model worth looking at, especially now at this formative stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016062100002#K00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1466521200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the members of the deputation for coming in.  I will run through some questions.  Then perhaps the members of the deputation can address them as they see fit.<\/p> <p>  My first question relates to who is responsible for equality budgeting.  I take the point made by the representatives of the IHREC to the effect that the Departments need to do this in the first instance because it needs to be part of the policy development process from the start.  In fact, it needs to seep into the mindset as well.  I recall carrying out some policy work in the United Kingdom.  At the end of it, someone asked me if I had gender proofed it.  I had never heard of gender proofing.  I thought about the work I had been doing and I realised that I had not.  Not only is proofing good for the analysis but it actually changes the way people think fundamentally.  I fully understand that.<\/p> <p>  There is a quality control role similar to the relationship the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has with the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Even with the best will in the world, civil servants may come under political pressure.  There may be a culture that does not necessarily seek the absolute truth.  Certainly, that is the case in some Departments.  The basic distributional analysis we get on budget day is politicised and basically sets out best-case scenarios.  I can come up with scenarios of how a given measure affects Linda and her two sons versus the scenarios that come out on budget day from the Department which hide all the bad news and highlight all the good news.  The only vaguely equality-proofed document we get is a political one and there is nothing independent about it.  Therefore, someone needs to be in a quality control role.  I am of the view that it would be useful for the relevant people to report to the budgetary committee with their view on the analysis in the same way the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, does for the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance, particularly as questions arose in respect of attempts at political interference.<\/p><p>It is something to consider.  The only two groups I am aware of that could do that are the commission and, potentially, the ESRI.  It does not have the capacity now but it could hire it in.  From an analytical perspective, it could do it.  I would like the witnesses' thoughts on that.<br\/><br\/>In terms of scope, the witnesses said they are bringing together a group of experts on Friday, which is great to hear; I would be grateful if they could send us a copy of their findings.  Do they have a position for this committee and the subsequent budget committee?  If we take the standard equality budgeting framework, there are nine dimensions.  Some of them are more important than others.  Do the witnesses have a view on those?  There is also poverty proofing, which is slightly different from equality budgeting and requires a different analytical approach, and the rights-based approach requires an entirely different quantitative and qualitative approach.  It is a big piece of analytical work, both qualitative and quantitative.  In terms of this budgetary cycle, if the Oireachtas was to pick three or five areas, and there is the standard distributional one, should it be gender, geography, age, race or disability?  What are the areas the Oireachtas needs to get its head around quickly?<br\/><br\/>In terms of timing, I notice the witnesses' report states that it is an ongoing process with the budget but this committee is looking at the arrangements for the full committee that will come into force.  When do they believe the permanent committee should be getting substantive equality and human rights proofing analysis from the Departments, with input from them?  By what month does the committee need to get its head around those issues?  This is somewhat of a chicken and egg situation in that budgetary measures are not announced until budget day but if one wants to do an <i>ex ante<\/i>analysis one needs to know the measures ahead of time.  It is a difficult one.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the standing committee, presumably someone will have to come up with a detailed specification on equality proofing, poverty proofing or whatever the catch-all phrase is for this process.  A detailed specification will have to be put together with exactly the kind of analysis the sectoral committees and the budget oversight committee will need.  Perhaps that will be the commission but do the witnesses have a view as to who should do that and how quickly the standing committee can get that?<br\/><br\/>In terms of the Civil Service, I was surprised to hear Dr. Murphy say that she thought the expertise already existed.  Section 42 of the 2014 Act is a big piece of legislation; it is potentially a game changer.  I would be happy, but surprised, if the Departments have that capacity because it is a new task they are being asked to do.  It is a very specialised skill set.  I was surprised to hear Dr. Murphy say that is not a criticism of the Departments.  It is a new piece of work they have not had to do previously.  Why does Dr. Murphy believe, especially in the middle of a hiring embargo, that they have this very specialised skill set already in-house?<br\/><br\/>I have one question.  How many analysts will the commission have to do the analysis?  I know it will not do the proofing but I refer to the people who will attend the standing committee to give an expert opinion on the equality proofing of the measures that will come from the Departments.  What will be the size of its analytical team?  Will it comprise Mr. Bond, Mr. Bond plus two others or Mr. Bond plus 20 others?  Can the witnesses give us a sense of the number the commission has been sanctioned to hire?  How much fire power will it have?  Can it hire serious people?  Is it hiring 22 year olds with a master's degree or serious analysts with a PhD in econometrics?  This is a technical area and it is not one the Oireachtas knows its away around terribly well.  <br\/><br\/>I have a thought in terms of our report.<\/p><p>There is an initial piece of training to be done.  There is probably an annual piece to be done.  Continuous professional development is one thing about which the Oireachtas does nothing.  This is really technical stuff and really important stuff, so even one-off training or, ideally, refresher courses every year or at the start of a D&aacute;il term for everyone on the committee might be something to consider.  It seems that this group might be the right people to run that kind of training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016062100002#K00200","speaker":"1230","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466521200,"counter":31,"content":"<p>That is a good suggestion.

If I sound reluctant to answer that question, it is largely because Dr. Murphy and I represent one of 15.  In terms of our institutional independence, we are open-minded.  Would that be fair to say, Dr. Murphy?

When we went before the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, we referred to gender equality, disability, minority groups and Roma and Traveller groups, so we referred to specific groups that have the potential to be disproportionately affected by any budget.  They may be at the margins, but any policy decision may disproportionately affect them or push them further into the margins.  They were some of the groups that I thought of.

Nonetheless, it seems more that the power of the proofing mechanism is what it does to the overall capacity of society to hold the democratic system to account regarding the distribution of resources.  That is about using the more transparent and accountability-related mechanisms and bringing more alive the capacity of society to hold Governments to account about the distribution of resources, and there are very many ways IHREC can engage in doing that.  One of them is coming into an expert committee and stating whether something is of good enough quality or not.

Some of them are brutal: they have neither the expertise nor the inclination to do such equality budgeting work.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is a statutory body which matters, as opposed to being an NGO.  This gives it weight that an NGO just will not have.<\/p><p>In the absence of an IFAC equivalent, the standing and sectoral committees will be beholden to each individual Department to give them an expert independent analysis that may end up making the line Minister look really bad.

While there are trade-offs in this regard, my sense is that it is not a case of one or the other.  If the IHREC is to have some quality control role, it will be working with others as part of something like the EBAG process I have mentioned.  Some process like the IFAC process would be needed to facilitate the coming together of assessments.  While this process would not involve the IHREC alone, I certainly envisage that we would be an actor in it.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked many questions.  He spoke about training, which is worth mentioning.  I would see the provision of expert training, including media training, to which I referred, as part of the role of the IHREC.  For example, we already have an institutional relationship with the Institute of Public Administration.  We run certificate programmes in human rights and equality.

However, as the Deputy suggested, the skills more relevant to section 42 such as knowing the best way to use policy to advance equality are not part of our culture to the same extent.

I take the Deputy's point in that regard.  When I spoke about the capacity available in Departments, I was saying some of them had a track record of engaging in distributional analysis.

Anybody who has been fortunate enough to serve at Cabinet level, as I have, will know that the development of a budget varies depending on numerous factors, including the mix of parties in government and what their politics are.  Budget day is spoken about as the big day but it is not really the big day, it is just a tiny part of the whole process.<\/p><p> Maybe we should look at the process up drawing up a budget and a finance Bill in the context of the entire period from the date on which bodies like the IHREC start to make an input until the date on which the finance Bill is passed.  On budget day the Minister outlines general principles and so on.  At the end of the evening, we vote on a couple of motions, the effect of which is to increase the rate of tax imposed on cigarettes and drink, etc.  From then on, it is a question of considering the finance Bill.  Should we not suggest that rather than having a budget scrutiny committee, we should have a budget and finance scrutiny committee that focuses on the period between the announcement of the budget and the publication of the finance Bill?  That is the important period because it is when all the changes can be discussed and debated.

I am not getting into an academic discussion but am focusing on the practicalities as I see them.  Maybe I am wrong.

In other words, I want to hear its perspective on the general principles applying to every budget and finance Bill that are important to the role of the IHREC as a statutory body.  The IHREC is conscious of the need for the principles in question to be adhered to regardless of the composition of the body of politicians who are framing the budget.

I think that it true.  The process may be long or short, or may be constrained in slightly different places.  The key argument for proofing is not that it should substitute for this process, but rather that it is to be encouraged as a means of ensuring processes are built into the system of developing budgets so that when the specific point in reached at which decisions come to be made, those making such decisions have before them details of the implications of their decisions for equality or poverty, to be taken into account in the discussion.  The key point we have been making is that this cannot be done on the hoof when something is presented on the floor of the House.  We believe it has to be built into the process at all stages.  That is what is meant by proofing.<\/p> <p>  Clearly, proofing does not substitute for politics.  Proofing is part of the process of working through the issues in a transparent manner and understanding what various decisions imply.  It is clear that decisions are ultimately made within a political framework.<\/p><p>In this context and in addition to the role of the oversight committee, Members have a role in setting the terms of the independent budget office.<\/p><p> Deputy Donnelly referred to the important issue of quality control.  In some sense oversight is about controlling the quality.  It is partly about setting standards for what constitutes good proofing, to which one then holds the Departments to account.  For example, I do not want to comment specifically on whether the distribution analysis that is published with the budget is political or otherwise, but it is certainly only a particular way of doing it.  The information could include other factors and it could be presented in different ways.  To some extent we need to have agreed standards as to what constitutes the kind of information that has to be made available.  That is not just a political process, it makes the information transparent and makes the impacts clear.  The oversight committee has a role in setting those standards and in seeing they are applied.

In that sense, that there are significant types of expenditure that one cannot model only through SWITCH, but it is important to know what is their impact in terms of poverty, inequality or equality.  The system the Scots have put in place precisely addresses that to some extent because they have not had tax and welfare capacity and have therefore been able to focus on it..<\/p> <p>  Deputy Barrett asked if there were other examples, I do not have an example that springs immediately to mind, but we have just introduced section 42, where there is a duty on public bodies to take account of equality and human rights.  That seems very positive to us and is a great step forward but it is the case already in certain countries, for example Finland springs to mind, where those types of requirements are built in on a constitutional level and to some extent they would have a system whereby they have an office that has some oversight in regard to decision making of government and whether it is taking human rights into account.<\/p><p>As I do not have the exact mechanism clear in my head, I would not like to propose it specifically.  The reference to Scotland is precisely to do with non-tax welfare spending and the need to look at mechanisms and systems to proof that expenditure also, not just to restrict what we are talking about to tax welfare spending.  In that context, I know that there is a reference in the Government's submission to the committee to the fact that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is looking at trying to develop a wider social impact assessment.  It is quite important to look at what is proposed and how it can be built on to actually address the concerns being considered here.  Similarly, there is a commitment in the programme for Government to develop the broader policy impact system that operates through regular impact assessments to take account of some of these issues, partly through the Cabinet office.  It is very important to look at what is proposed at the Cabinet to ensure it takes on board the equality and poverty proofing mechanism.  To some extent, there are things that can be built on, but they need to be developed further.  It is not that we are doing nothing on these issues, it is just that we clearly need to develop and build on what we have in place to take account of equality and human rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016062100002#P01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Laurence Bond","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466521200,"counter":72,"content":"<p>We always felt that in each budget there was a box ticking exercise in terms of poverty and equality proofing generally and that serious efforts were not being made in that regard.

There is an issue about how one puts in place systems and processes that will be meaningful and sustained, not just something that have to happen.  It is important to look at what happened.  For example, there is a commitment that when measures are being brought before the Cabinet, they must be proofed, yet much of it seems to have become a little routine and not that meaningful.  It would be useful to look at why that has been the case and what must be behind the system to make it meaningful.  Part of the difficulty is that it is a chicken and egg scenario; one must build on what one has and try to make it work as well as possible and make it as efficient as possible in order that people do not feel they as if are going through a meaningless exercise but one that requires them to buy into the idea that this is a way of improving policy making and decisions taken that are for the benefit of people as against a bureaucratic exercise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAB2016062100002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Laurence Bond"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1466521200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>It is probably fair to say the previous Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission probably did not engage in socio-economic rights agendas, but since its inception the current commission has been quite proactive in using whatever international mechanism are available to us to hold the Government to account on impact assessments and proofing.

I am glad to have Deputies Niall Collins, Stephen S. Donnelly, Tom Neville, Br&iacute;d Smith, Noel Rock and Maurice Quinlivan as members of the committee.<\/p> <p>  I am grateful for the opportunity to say a few introductory words on the Department's 2016 Estimate.  Initially, I will refer briefly to the high-level details of the financial allocations across the Department for this year.  I will then provide a brief commentary on recent progress across the jobs, innovation and regulation agendas, the three big programme expenditure programmes within the Estimate.  Time permitting, I will also briefly allude to our plans to continue on the road to full employment and our target to create a further 200,000 jobs by 2020.<\/p> <p>  On the 2016 financial details, the total gross allocation for the Department is &euro;810,000,047, as per the published 2016 Revised Estimates Volume.  This includes funding for the Department, its offices and agencies.  It compares to a 2015 Estimate provision of &euro;810.1 million.  Therefore, for 2016 it is essentially a no-change scenario in terms of the quantum of the Exchequer funding provision.  Nonetheless, there are some modest changes between the capital and the current expenditure distributions.  This year the Department and its agencies have a total of &euro;513 million available in Exchequer capital funding.<\/p><p>This represents an increase of &euro;4 million on the 2015 capital allocation of &euro;509 million.  However, it is important that committee members recognise that the Department was provided with an additional &euro;50 million in capital moneys through a Supplementary Estimate in December 2015.  The purpose of the Supplementary Estimate was to provide &euro;21 million for IDA Ireland, mainly to commence its first and new five-year regional property programme.<\/p><p> The December 2015 Supplementary Estimate provided &euro;29 million for innovation supports which helped to meet some commitments earlier than anticipated.  It created additional headroom for extra activity by the agencies in 2016.<\/p><p> The most significant change in capital allocations this year is the increase in IDA Ireland's capital provision.  IDA Ireland sees a &euro;27 million increase on its 2015 total capital allocation of &euro;95 million, resulting in a total of &euro;122 million this year.  Essentially, this increase will enable IDA Ireland to continue progress on its regional property programme during 2016.  This is part of the &euro;150 million five-year new IDA Ireland regional property programme announced in February 2015.<\/p><p> As highlighted in the material provided for committee members, the Department's capital expenditure to the end of May was &euro;7 million, or 4% behind profile.  It is a timing issue across the capital programmes and not indicative of any delayed activity or problem.<\/p><p> At this point of the year, we still anticipate capital expenditure in 2016 across the Department&rsquo;s Vote such is the demand for enterprise and innovation supports.  With regard to current pay and non-pay moneys, the allocation covering my Department, offices and agencies this year amounts to a total of &euro;297.4 million gross.  This is split across pay, at &euro;155 million; pensions, at &euro;49 million; and other non-pay elements, at &euro;93 million.  The figure of &euro;155 million for pay covers the pay of approximately 850 staff in the Department and its offices.  It covers approximately 1,600 staff in the enterprise agencies.<\/p><p> Our current expenditure is &euro;5.7 million, which was 5% behind at the end of May.  It is too early in the financial year to make definitive year-end projections of current expenditure.  Committee members should be aware that any movement of moneys across subheads within the year requires the formal approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is not something a Department can do unilaterally.  This process is typically conducted shortly before the financial year-end, in November or December.<\/p><p> I will comment briefly on what we are doing with the total allocations this year, most of which are set out in specific actions articulated in the 2016 Action Plan for Jobs.  As set out in the briefing material provided for committee members late last week, enterprise supports are multi-annual in nature.  Therefore, the primary focus of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and local enterprise offices this year is on continuing the excellent job results they delivered in 2015.  Last year Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and local enterprise office clients, collectively, delivered over 44,000 gross new jobs, which resulted in 25,000 net new jobs.  These results make 2015 a record year for the enterprise agencies.  It means that over 410,000 jobs in the economy are now in companies directly supported by Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the local enterprise offices.  This is the highest figure ever.<\/p><p> Allowing for the multiplier effect, a similar number of jobs, 400,000, is generated in terms of services and sub-supply to enterprise agency-supported clients.  This year, through their capital programmes, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the local enterprise offices will target a further 32,000 gross new jobs.  There is good progress on the jobs front in the year to date but, as Minister of State, I want to ensure that we do even better.  However, given the scale of agency operations, which span many thousands of clients, it is not possible to quantify the precise employment figures at this stage of the year.  IDA Ireland will present its mid-year figures in early July.  Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices conduct an annual business survey of their clients at the end of the year.  What we can say, however, is that good progress continues on the jobs front, as evidenced in the most recent CSO figures showing unemployment has dipped under 8% for the first time in over seven years.<\/p><p> Yesterday, I was delighted to announce the achievement of record export figures by Enterprise Ireland-supported clients.  In 2015, exports by Enterprise Ireland companies surpassed &euro;20 billion for the first time.  This represents a 10% increase over 2014 export levels.  There were increased exports in all sectors, with the biggest increases in the software, construction and manufacturing sectors.  The primary policy supports underpinning these excellent results and our future targets are set out in Enterprise 2025.  Enterprise 2025 is our new ten-year enterprise and jobs strategy, and it was published in late 2015.  A core element of the strategy is the eight regional action plans that the Department co-ordinated and developed from early 2015 onwards.  These are also complemented by Innovation 2020, our new national science strategy, on which I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, will comment as we move into the examination of programme expenditure area B, which covers innovation.  I am sure he will want to briefly outline some of the positive developments being supported through subhead B.4 of our Vote, concerning science and technology development.  Under this subhead, significant capital investments are being made through Science Foundation Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  A key target of Enterprise 2025, which is also highlighted in the regional action plans, is our target of delivering a further 200,000 jobs in the period to 2020.  Some 135,000 of these are targeted to be in the regions.  Across the eight regional action plans, we are aiming for jobs growth of 10% to 15%.  Admittedly, these are ambitious targets but I would point to the fact that since the action plan for jobs commenced in 2012, we now have over 155,000 more people working.  We are approaching the point where 2 million people in the country will be at work.<\/p><p> While we have made excellent progress of the jobs front, bringing the unemployment rate below 8%, we recognise that there is further work to be done.  A key deliverable for me this year is embedding the eight regional action plans.  We recognise that there is a need to ensure more balanced regional economic growth.  That is why we have developed the eight targeted regional plans, which will concentrate on specific regional strengths.  We shall have the first update reports on implementation of these plans in the next couple of months.<\/p><p> Some important contributory aspects of our overall enterprise strategy fall within the areas of responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Breen.<\/p><p>I am sure that when we come to programme C, expenditure regulation, the Minister of State will elaborate further on some of the key factors underpinning our enterprise policy, such as a harmonious and effective industrial relations system and ensuring that work pays.  I leave my comments there for the moment so that we can proceed to examine the respective programme expenditure areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016062100002#C00200","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1466524800,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I will now take questions from members, who will be invited to speak in the order in which they indicate by show of hand.

Were the sites identified in the existing portfolio of State-owned property or were they new greenfield sites?<\/p> <p>  The Minister referred in her opening statement to the regional property programme.<\/p><p>I presume the advance factory sites are part of that programme.  What exactly does the programme entail in the case of the many vacant sites in State ownership around the country?  They are IDA Ireland sites.  How is this married with the site visits which take place nationally?  The Minister said there were a number of counties in which no advance factory sites were planned.  In parallel, it was indicated in a reply to a parliamentary question of mine recently that there were a number of counties which did not receive site visits.  Therefore, there are gaps on the map on which we must focus our attention.  Will the Minister provide us with an overview of how the regional property programme will push vacant sites and identify potential businesses for them?<\/p><p> Separately, am I right in saying the finances of Science Foundation Ireland, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, InterTradeIreland and the various agencies listed in programme A are all audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General?

The question was transferred to the Department of the Taoiseach.  Will the Minister outline to the committee the level of activity of her Department and the agencies on this scenario or in contingency planning in advance of the result of the referendum?  There seems to be a view that it is a little like hoping against hope it might not happen.  There seems to be a drift and business is concerned.

I will start with Brexit.  Obviously, we are watching very closely what is happening.  The Government and most Irish people hope the United Kingdom will vote to remain in the European Union.  The value of trade over and back across the Irish Sea every week is &euro;1.2 billion.  It is a massive trade and we want to protect it.  We will do everything to protect it, but it must be remembered that there would be a two year lead-in period.  It will not all happen on Friday morning if the people of the United Kingdom decide to exit.  We have contingency plans in place and, depending on the result, will be meeting very early on Friday morning to decide what exactly we should do.<\/p> <p>  We will continue to work with our clients.  I have mentioned Enterprise Ireland and that our exports are massive this year, at a figure of over &euro;20 billion.  England accounts for &euro;7.2 billion of this figure.  In fact, the trend is downwards; the figure has fallen from something like 45% ten years ago to approximately 37%.<\/p><p>To counteract this trend, Enterprise Ireland is making sure that we gain markets.  We are diversifying and making sure that we are out there getting more markets.  The agencies will continue to work really hard.  We know there will be issues around currency fluctuation, regulation, tariffs and all of that.  If such issues arise, our agencies will help their existing companies to work their way through any issues.  It will be all hands on deck on Friday morning.<\/p><p> I was asked about the property background.  IDA Ireland regularly assesses property requirements in the regions and it has identified locations where quality building and site solutions would enhance the property or the opportunity for winning FDI.  I have a list of all the visits made by IDA Ireland to counties, but job creation is not all about IDA Ireland because Enterprise Ireland also delivers jobs.  I know it is really popular to ask about visits by IDA Ireland.<\/p><p> In terms of clients of IDA Ireland coming to the country, if companies have decided to locate their businesses in a particular region, then it is really difficult for IDA Ireland to bully them to go somewhere else.  Of course, if one has advance factories, suitable vacant factories or vacant company sites, then one can bring companies to these areas.<\/p><p> IDA Ireland has spoken to me about another issue.  We can tell a Chinese or Singaporean company, for example, that it only takes one hour to travel from Dublin to Athlone but, in contrast, to us Athlone seems thousands of miles away.  We are working our way through the matter.  I am from the country.  I know that I have said the following many times but I am determined that IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland will do their very best to bring their clients to the regions.  Improvements have been made because last year, 51% of visits were made to rural and regional Ireland, but this year that figure has increased to 56%, which proves we are working away.  I am sorry but Dublin and Cork are popular locations to visit, and Galway has had ten visits.  I have visited Athlone, Galway, Sligo, Leitrim, Longford and Limerick.  All the people in these locations, especially the teams that we have built around the regional plans, for example, the local authorities, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, local enterprise offices, LEOs, and industrial ambassadors, are doing their very best to ensure we get companies on board.<\/p><p> In terms of audits, I can confirm that audits are conducted by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There are no issues of concern across the agencies, in terms of the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual examination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016062100002#G00200","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466524800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I have a question for the Chairman.

I would like to see the Minister return to the D&aacute;il to seek more funding.  IDA Ireland has targeted third level institutions.  In this regard, the Minister listed the institutes in Carlow, Athlone and Waterford.  IDA Ireland is building where an institute of technology, university or college is located.  That is fine, but many other places do not have such an institution.  North Wicklow is an example and obviously I am lobbying on its behalf.  There are plenty of areas where the lack of grade A office space means that nobody is coming to them and developers will not build the first building.  It is a case of the chicken and the egg.  We have lost several high-tech investment opportunities in north Wicklow because there are no suitable buildings available.  I spoke to IDA Ireland about the matter and it explained that it was co-locating buildings with educational facilities.  I ask the Minister to look at the matter.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask follow-up questions to the one posed by Deputy Niall Collins.  Is there a consultation programme?  Could Dublin City Council, Wicklow County Council or Longford County Council approach IDA Ireland about securing an IDA Ireland building for its region?<\/p> <p>  I wish to talk about a third issue.  It is one for Enterprise Ireland and that I have mentioned to the Minister in the D&aacute;il.  One of Enterprise Ireland's tasks is to link indigenous companies with the multinational supply chain.  I have heard anecdotal evidence that it does not have the resources required to carry out this task properly.  The issue has been paid lip service, but that is not a criticism.  Linking companies is not happening on any scale, but there is a huge opportunity to create jobs.  The Minister may not know the answer to my next question, but I ask her to come back to the committee with her answer.  How much money has been allocated for the task of linking companies?  Will such expenditure be increased?<\/p> <p>  My next questions concern gross and net job figures.  Having a 45,000 jobs figure is great.  Obviously, a net jobs figure of 25,000 means that 20,000 jobs have been lost, which seems like a lot.  Are there structural or strategic reasons we are losing almost half of the jobs created?  It feels like a big loss.  Is the Minister concerned about the matter and is she looking at it?<\/p> <p>  Infrastructure has been mentioned.  The latest World Competitiveness Yearbook ranks Ireland at No. 7, which is very good, but we are ranked at No. 23 when it comes to infrastructure.  I know that the matter does not come within the remit of the Minister's Department, but it does advise on transport and broadband.  Does the Minister think we should accelerate our investment in infrastructure, specifically with a view to increasing the level of job creation and retention?<\/p><p>As Dublin is served reasonably well, I would like to ask in particular about investment in infrastructure in the regions.  I refer, for example, to the development of a high-quality road between Cork, Limerick and Galway, the acceleration of the roll-out of broadband and the development of innovation centres in smaller towns around the country.  Does the Minister believe sufficient capital investment is happening to facilitate job creation?  Would she like to see an increase in such investment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016062100002#J00300","speaker":"1230","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1466524800,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Quite a few questions have been put to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016062100002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1466524800,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Of course I would like to see more.

Deputy Donnelly knows that we just did not have money for investment from 2011 until 2014, at least.  We were putting money into hospitals, schools and social welfare schemes.

As far as I am aware, that is it for the moment.  That is where the budget we have been given is going.  That is what we have planned.  The Deputy asked me whether there has been a change in the plan or in the budget since my appointment as Minister.  I remind him that I have been here a month.  A change cannot be made because of the 2017 capital review.  As yet, there is no change in the 2016 spend.  The agreement of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is needed to redirect 2016 spending.  We will make sure there is an emphasis on the regions.  I suppose it is good to come in here and listen to the members of the Select Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation pushing for this.  Deputy Donnelly and his colleagues on the committee are making my job easier by doing so.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked whether Enterprise Ireland is working with IDA Ireland to develop break-out companies from the foreign direct investment companies and to get more industry through from the foreign direct investment companies.  I assure him that such work is ongoing as part of the global sourcing initiative.  As I have mentioned, I was on a trade mission that went to Limerick, Athlone and Sligo.  Approximately 50 foreign direct investment companies and at least 50 more Enterprise Ireland client companies were brought in and matched together.  This was set up in a very organised manner.  It was not done willy-nilly.<\/p><p>Efforts were made to ensure IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland had interviewed their clients and, therefore, knew what kind of matches to put together.  When we met a particular gentleman who had attended a similar event two years previously, he told us he set up a business subsequent to that event and now has 45 people working for him.  That is an example of what is happening under the global sourcing initiative, in which both agencies are involved.<\/p><p> The Deputy also asked about how budgets are used.  In fact, both organisations use their budgets.  There is no specific budget for these purposes.  Both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland use part of their respective budgets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016062100002#K00700","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466524800,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I would like to ask the Minister a specific question.

He can rest assured that he would be very impressed by these well-organised events.  The feedback we have received, especially from the foreign direct investment companies, shows that they are delighted to do business in this way.  I would like to mention another thing that came through to me when I saw smaller Enterprise Ireland companies providing industry, intellectual property or data to foreign direct investment companies.  It seems to me that regardless of whether those in charge of the Irish divisions of the foreign direct investment companies are Irish or from outside the country, they put on the green jersey and make sure the overseas parts of their companies hear about the good supply chain performance they are getting from indigenous Enterprise Ireland-supported companies here.  As a result of that, many smaller Irish companies are getting to trade abroad.  We are trying to ensure that we facilitate as much of tis activity as possible in the interests of helping our indigenous companies to develop.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Donnelly also asked about the fall-off in jobs, or the \"jobs churn\" as it is called.  This is a normal part of every economy.  There is no overarching structural issue in our economy driving job losses at this point.  In the past, we had issues with the construction sector and some other sectors, but now all sectors are growing.  Of course, some are growing faster than others.  Last year, the two agencies actually had their lowest level of jobs churn in recent years.  However, the agencies are moving away from some of the older sectors to high-tech sectors.  For example, they are moving away from pharmaceuticals to biopharmaceuticals.  The pharmaceutical sector is presenting a kind of problem here.  They are also moving jobs from ICT.  The biopharmaceutical sector is huge in this country.  The data sector is also massively important.<\/p> <p>  I would like to go off track for a moment.  The Deputy spoke about infrastructure shortages.  There is actually a skills shortage as well.  If any mothers are listening to me, can I ask them to encourage their children towards subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics?  There is a massive shortage in ICT and in engineering.

In the programme for Government, &euro;200 million is earmarked for IDA Ireland and &euro;300 million for Enterprise Ireland.  IDA Ireland has also looked to the private sector to provide factory sites.  We have had a few successes, although not many, with the private sector providing factory spaces.  Last week, we had one in Galway provided by the private sector.  Over the years, IDA Ireland has negotiated exits from several private finance leases, trying to get them at better prices.<\/p> <p>  Limerick was the subject of nine site visits in the first quarter of the year.  We will be pushing to ensure more visits get to Limerick.  As we stated in the regional plans, it is from the ground up and not all about IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland.

Do these agencies have a co-funding remit under their enabling legislation?  In other words, can they raise other forms of finance to advance their capital programmes?  For example, do they go to the strategic investment fund, which is the successor fund to the National Pensions Reserve Fund?  Do they go to the private market or do they have a public private partnership approach?  Can the Minister provide an overview on that matter?<\/p> <p>  My second supplementary question is tangential to the Action Plan for Jobs and relates to the shadow labour market.  Unfortunately, we all know it is out there.  For example, depending on who we talk to, the groups that support migrants who come to the country maintain there are in the region of up to 30,000 undocumented people here.  Many have put down roots and have families and children.  These people are working in the labour market but are undocumented.  They may have come to the country with a certain visa status or perhaps student status and may be described as visa over-stayers by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  In any event, a significant number of people are in the marketplace but are not showing up on the radar.  They may show up on some Revenue returns but are not otherwise officially recorded.  Many are being forced to work in the shadow economy by virtue of their undocumented status.  That is something which we should consider as part of the Action Plan for Jobs.  Potentially, they could be forcing down rates of pay by virtue of the fact that they have to remain undocumented.  They might have to work for cheaper rates of pay and many of them do so.  I am keen to flag this to the Minister.  This is a significant issue in our community and in the marketplace for labour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016062100002#O02100","speaker":"1221"},{"type":"speech","time":1466524800,"counter":153,"content":"<p>If Deputy Niall Collins does not object, I will push that question to the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, who is in charge of the area.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about income from Enterprise Ireland and income earned by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016062100002#O02200","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1466524800,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I was not asking about income.

I congratulate you as well.  As someone from my constituency I am delighted that you are chairing this committee.  I welcome everyone from the various parties.<\/p> <p>  As Minister of State with responsibility for skills and apprenticeship my remit takes in enterprise, innovation, school buses, SOLAS and anything else one can think of, including the European Space Agency.  If any members of the committee want me to come to their constituencies at any time or speak to any group in a constituency on any issue, I would be pleased to do so provided I get some days notice.  I would be glad to drive down from Dublin or up from Waterford.<\/p> <p>  As the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, has said, I have responsibility for research and development and innovation issues.  I am pleased to outline to members some of the activities being delivered under what is termed programme B expenditure.  Programme B expenditure accounts for approximately 60% of the total Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation capital budget.  Capital supports made by Science Foundation Ireland, the research community and Enterprise Ireland to client companies make up the bulk of this budget.  The primary rationale for Government investment in science, technology and innovation, STI, is to develop a competitive knowledge-based economy and society to drive innovation and enterprise, build human capital and maximise the return on research and development investment for economic and social progress.  The evidence shows that investment in research and development increases economic productivity and competitiveness and is crucial for creating and maintaining high-value jobs.<\/p> <p>  Innovation 2020 sets out the policies for Ireland to become a global innovation leader and provides a whole-of-government roadmap for the next five years to realise this goal.  During the past decade and a half Ireland has built a strong science base which has yielded results in terms of economic and social impact.  Ireland has steadily improved its ranking in the innovation union scoreboard, having moved from tenth place in 2013 to eighth place in 2015 and is currently in the group of strong innovators.  Since 2009 Ireland has been listed among the top 20 countries in global rankings for the quality of its science research.  However, there is no doubt we need to build on this - I will return to this point.<\/p> <p>  I will briefly outline some highlights from 2015 investments as well as targets we have set for 2016.  There is no doubt that 2015 was a productive year for Science Foundation Ireland.  I have met representatives of the foundation in recent days.  Through the Science Foundation Ireland investigative programme a total of &euro;30 million was awarded in research funding for 23 major projects, representing an important investment in future technology and development.  A &euro;28 million investment was made in research equipment and facilities in sectors including pharmaceutical, manufacturing, Internet of things, big data and additive manufacturing.  Through the SFI programme an investment of &euro;23 million further supported SFI's 12 research centres in cutting-edge research with industrial relevance.<\/p> <p>  There are 200 industry partners working intensively with SFI research centres and over 1,200 companies in total collaborating with SFI funded researchers.  In 2016 and in line with the innovation 2020 programme Science Foundation Ireland will focus on supporting individual investigators at different career stages, attracting top research talent to Ireland and launching a new research centre.<\/p><p>Furthermore, Science Foundation Ireland will continue to support Irish researchers to compete and win non-Exchequer funding, particularly through the European Research Council.  Through our investment in Enterprise Ireland, we have supported 896 collaborative research products between industry and academia, a record number.  These projects ultimately provide companies with new commercial opportunities, cost savings or increasing capability.  Enterprise Ireland will support another 900 collaborative projects in 2016.  Some 14 industry-led technology centres are funded.  These centres are collaborative entities established and led by the industry.<\/p><p> A joint initiative between Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland allows Irish companies and multinationals, currently 400, to work together.  In 2015, we had the launch of the technology centre for dairy processing, research and innovation, and 2016 will see the establishment of a similar centre of excellence for the meat sector.  Some 105 new high potential start-ups, known as HPSUs, supported in 2015 will create 1,500 jobs in the next three years.  In 2016, the target is to create an additional 100 high potential start-ups, with 33 already created this year to date.  In 2016, Enterprise Ireland will extend its technology gateway network to provide more regional technological cover to support local industries.<\/p><p> Through Ireland's membership of the European Space Agency, Irish companies secured more than &euro;13 million in contracts in 2015 to develop and deliver technologies and products.  I met the director of the European Space Agency this morning.  Something that may go over the heads of many is that 50 businesses in Ireland contribute to the European Space Agency, providing 2,000 jobs.  Last year we exported &euro;75 million worth of products.  One of the huge successes of the European Space Agency last year was the comet landing.  Some of the technology used for landing on that comet was produced and made in Ireland.<\/p><p> Since 2000, Ireland has been listed among the top countries in global ranking: first, in nanoscience, second, in computer science, third, in animal and dairy science and fifth in material science.  That is a phenomenal record for the 50 companies in Ireland that contribute to the European space programme.  It is envisaged, based on what agency representatives told us this morning, that there will be more work as the agency has great confidence in the Irish companies.  I say this because the director general of the European Space Agency, Johann-Dietrich - Jan - W&ouml;rner, was here this morning.  The number of companies that invest and work in the European space programme was news to me on becoming Minister of State.<\/p><p> I am also happy to report on good progress on Horizon 2020, the EU framework programme for research and innovation.  This is an important source of funding for research and innovation in Ireland.  We have set an ambitious target to win &euro;1.25 billion in competitive funding from Horizon 2020 between 2014 and 2020.  Between 2014 and November 2015, Ireland won &euro;251 million in competitive funding from Horizon 2020, &euro;52 million of which went to SMEs.  This performance has us on track to achieve the 2020 target.  All this investment is helping to deliver impact.  In 2015, we saw a record number of licences and commercially valuable technologies being transferred from higher education research to industry.  We also saw the creation of 31 new spin-off companies from their roots in higher education research.  In 2016, we will continue to drive the commercialisation of Irish research and will deliver more than 30 new spin-out companies as well as approximately 200 new commercial technologies.<\/p><p> As Minister of State with responsibility for skills and training, I fully understand the need for proper investment in the country's talent.  Last year the secretary general of the OECD said that skills have become a global currency in the 21st century.<\/p><p>I welcome the ambitious targets set out in Innovation 2020, particularly around human capital aimed at ensuring a pipeline of talent.  Our success will always depend on our people.  The Government has protected investment in science technology and innovation because it understands the contribution it makes to economic productivity and competitiveness.  We are in a strong position to build on previous investment and secure even greater impact from it.  Innovation 2020 sets out the roadmap to deliver this with its focus on excellent talent and improving research and development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016062100002#P00400","speaker":"1351","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466524800,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I am not sure how much basic scientific research comes into the Minister of State's brief and my figures may be out of date but I think it has been cut by about 60%.  Scientists who were engaged in basic scientific research have essentially been outsourced to the pharmaceutical companies.  Rather than developing new molecules, they are testing drugs for the pharmaceutical companies based in Ireland.  I have met some of our leading scientists in the past two or three years.  What they say is that this move away from basic scientific research and innovation towards a much more commercial role is essentially killing the innovation pipeline, the really high-tech stuff.  Maybe not now, but in two, three or four years' time, our labs will dry up with our own research.  Those scientists have met me privately.  Several of them are worried about speaking out publicly, which is something to be aware of, but they are very concerned about that.  I do not know if this falls within the Minister of State's remit and it may be for the Department of Education and Skills,  but certainly anybody who is looking at innovation would want to know that.  I want the Minister of State to know that and perhaps he would come back to the committee on it.  He may already have a view on it.<\/p> <p>  The Vote before the committee is significant, comprising several hundred million euro.  Does the Minister of State foresee any changes to it?  In December, the Minister of State and I and all Members of the D&aacute;il looked at the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of &euro;50 million, which revised the original Estimate.  I accept that the Minister and Minister of State are new to the role but does the Minister of State foresee making any changes during the rest of the year to the &euro;333 million being brought forward?  Is there anything within that spend that is not providing value for money that the committee and, therefore, the D&aacute;il should know about?  Is there anything that the group of Ministers, whatever way they work, might start doing that had not been envisaged and that might cost some extra money?<\/p> <p>  One of the subheads included in the Vote is our membership of international organisations.  I would be keen for Ireland to join CERN in Switzerland, which is part of the physics group.  This is something we have not done before.  Does the Minister of State know how much it would cost?  There are two types of membership - full membership and associate membership.  Currently, three countries are associate members.  Are there any plans for Ireland to join CERN and, if so, how much would it cost?<\/p> <p>  There is another issue on which I would like to know if any money is allocated.  The Minister, quite rightly, encouraged everyone to start looking at science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, subjects.  However, there is a development gap between our scientists and our engineers.  Scientists say that they are very good at creating very impressive science but they are not trained and usually not very interested in its commercialisation.  Engineers are very good at product development but engineering professors say there is an ongoing lack of State investment in the linkages between the science and the engineers and specifically in terms of product development.  It is something Ireland has never done well.  The heads of schools say it is an area that needs investment.<\/p><p>It may come through the education Vote but it is certainly relevant to the Minister's Department.<\/p><p> I wish to pick up on a comment made by the Minister or Minister of State on the need to attract in the best academics - I could not agree more - and people from the private sector into academia.  One of the biggest impediments to Ireland attracting really high calibre foreign academics and high calibre private sector people to go into academia is the academic hiring framework, which does not allow consideration of either private sector experience or foreign academic experience.  Let me give an example of how this is hurting Ireland right now.  I spoke with a professor recently who secured a lot of European money on Big Data and he needs to hire a group of people.  He needs to hire two types of people - people from the private sector who are Big Data analysts from Twitter, Google and Facebook, etc., some of whom work in Ireland.  He also needs to hire some world class academics - Cambridge is one of the leading areas, MIT, Caltech etc.  He explained that he can employ them on &euro;32,000 which is the starting salary for a junior academic.  However, he is not allowed to take into account any of their academic work.  He can turn to an MIT professor and say he is not allowed to pay that individual according to his 20 years' academic work in MIT because he did not do it in Ireland.  Obviously, no leading academic will come to Ireland for that amount.  Similarly, if he approaches people in Facebook, Google, Twitter and so on he is not allowed take into account, in the increment calculation, any of their work.

I think we have to remember the Irish diaspora and the skills set of the modern Irish emigrant who had to leave in 2008 and 2009, when we had moved from a service to a knowledge-based economy in 2005 onwards.  Those who left - be it the graduates or those with three or four years experience would now have a wealth of experience and if they did not chose to return home, they would have a network of colleagues which we could search for the skilled personnel we need, particularly in innovation.  I know that those who work for large organisations have a knowledge that they will bring back to the country.  I think we should prioritise the diaspora when we consider recruitment.  We want to look after those living here but if there is a skills shortage, we should look at the networks of the Irish diaspora for those skilled in innovation, who can generate more growth when they return.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016062100002#U01000","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speech","time":1466524800,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I will take up some of the points made by Deputy Neville.  There is no question that we lost many skilled people during the recession.  At one stage in 2007, there were 50,000 people serving their apprenticeship, and that number reduced to approximately 5,000.<\/p> <p>  Let us look at the apprenticeships that were on offer during the boom, such as electrics, carpentry, brickwork, plastering and so on, but following the downturn many builders decided not to take on apprentices and employ others, some from outside Ireland who were not qualified.  I have no problem with people from outside of Ireland working here.<\/p><p>We lost the capacity to offer apprenticeships as the numbers offered dribbled out in some fundamental areas.  It is my objective to try to entice companies to take on more people to serve an apprenticeship.  It may require an added incentive for employers to do that.  One of the suggestions that I had been making is that since JobBridge was being axed, paying a company to take on the apprentice for a period of time would work.  The problem apprentices found, once they went through their three or four years training, was there was no job so they left.  <\/p><p> Innovation 2020 is a programme where Enterprise Ireland, IDA, Science Foundation Ireland try to attract people with high quality jobs.  Last week in University College Dublin I addressed the issue of job creation from high-tech jobs in the science area.  It was agreed that in order to attract those who were highly skilled and qualified to return to this country, we would as Deputy Neville said not get them back unless we have the jobs.  Under the Innovation 2020 programme, there is the human capital and creativity fund that would attempt to bring people back.  I was in London last week to speak on Brexit, but I met many young people who had left and were working in high-tech industry in London and other parts of England, who would value an opportunity of good jobs to which to return.  That is an issue this Government will address through the 2020 Horizon project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016062100002#U01100","speaker":"1351","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466524800,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I agree with the Minister of State that we need the jobs to bring back many who have gone, but we do not need jobs that are 100% of what they are doing, many will return for 70% of the job and because they are in technical innovation, they will grow that role into a different area of research and development.  We have to be mindful that it takes less effort to get somebody back than to attract somebody new to the country.  That is psychology.<\/p> <p>  My comments are to try to aid or help us see a way forward.

It can be done at a competitive price compared to having it done outside the country.  This is applicable to industries that have been here a long time but still decide to conduct their research and development outside the country.  I am not saying that is unacceptable, they may not accept me saying that but I think we need to persuade some of the major industries that the people are here and that the Innovation 2020 strategy will ensure there are graduates.

I wish the committee well.<\/p><p> Chairperson, I will deal specifically with my remit and will make some brief introductory comments on my role.<\/p><p> Subhead 3, C3 provided just over &euro;19 million for the workplace relations programme.  With the commencement of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 on 1 October 2015 two statutory independent bodies replaced the five previously in existence.  From that date there is now a single body called the Workplace Relations Commission and an expanded Labour Court.  This was the most radical reform of the State's workplace relations in more than 70 years.  I think this is a very important development, particularly for future industrial relations.  These new structures aim to deliver an independent, world class workplace relations service, which is easy to use, effective, provides for workable means of redress and enforcement within a reasonable period.  It reduces the cost to business, which I think is important as well.<\/p><p> The allocation to the Workplace Relations Commission provides for extensive information services to workers and employers, for industrial relations advisory support as well as for conciliation and mediation of disputes.  In addition it provides for inspection and enforcement of employment rights through the labour inspection services, formerly NERA.  So far more than 5,000 inspections were carried out and 13,000 complaints were addressed in 2015.  <\/p><p> Subhead C5 provides &euro;17.5 million for expenditure on the Health and Safety Authority.  That is a very important part of my remit that we should examine.  We are now experiencing very strong economic growth, businesses are rapidly expanding and new jobs are being created on a daily basis, as outlined by the Minister and Minister of State.  It is vital that we continue to prioritise the safety and health of all workers in a way that promotes business growth, aids competitiveness and protects workers.  A particular focus remains on high risk areas such as agriculture and construction.<\/p><p> More than 10,800 inspections and investigations were carried out in 2015 and new ways of engaging such as using knowledge sharing groups of farmers and farm walks have been developed.  Small and medium-sized businesses are the backbone of our economy and need simple tools and guidance to help them to manage workplace safety and health.  The authority has been to the forefront in meeting this challenge with the continuing roll out of the BeSMART online risk assessment tool, reaching more than 30,000 businesses.<\/p><p> Subhead C13 provides close to &euro;500,000 for the Low Pay Commission.  Last year the newly established Low Pay Commission recommended an increase in the national minimum wage of 50 cent per hour.  A rise of 5.8% to &euro;9.15 cent per hour, which was accepted by the Government and took effect from 1 January this year.  As Minister of State, I look forward to receiving the report of the Low Pay Commission with its recommendations on the rate for the national minimum wage for 2017 on 19 July next.  <\/p><p> Subhead C15 provides for Ireland's annual subscription to the International Labour Organisation, ILO, of &euro;1.5 million.  The Department is currently deepening its engagement with the tripartite UN agency responsible for international labour standards, the International Labour Organisation and next year - I was at a meeting in Geneva about this last week - for the first time ever, Ireland will assume the titular seat on the ILO executive body of the governing body.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016062100002#V00500","speaker":"1272","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466524800,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The two groups that have come together stated they never had the resources to do the job, that perhaps they could do one or two investigations at the same time but they could never really address serious allegations of what is essentially white collar crime.  The funding to the new organisation has fallen for the year 2015-16, again by a small amount.  Is the 2015 figure basically the combined budget for the two organisations that have come together?

They are totally different from the local enterprise boards of the past.  They give advice and signpost financial assistance, a matter about which we spoke, and other supports for those who wish to start their own business.  It is important to note that there are 31 LEOs located around the country and that they work closely with Enterprise Ireland.<\/p><p>Working with microbusinesses is important for LEOs.  They created 3,500 jobs last year.  They were put in place in 2014.  The LEOs are good value for money.  There is access to a LEO in every county, and there are two in the larger counties.  They are a one-stop-shop and they have a very important role to play for start-ups, particularly in access to finance.  One of the problems many start-up companies have is not being able to access finance.  The Minister said that microfinance is in place, and while grants range from &euro;2,000 to &euro;25,000, the average loan is about &euro;15,000.  There is a major take-up of these loans in every constituency.  The efforts of the local enterprise office in County Wicklow, Deputy Donnelly's county, for example, resulted in some 74 jobs being created.  The credit guarantee scheme approved more than &euro;54 million and supported 4,400 jobs last year.  A great deal of financial help is available for start-up companies.  That is very important as we move forward.<\/p><p> As the Minister rightly said, small business is the way forward.  We will not get foreign direct investment into every part of Ireland.  It will probably be focused on the hubs.  Careful consideration has to be given to the LEOs, and as Minister of State with responsibility for small business, I intend to visit as many LEOs as possible to ensure they are working.  That is very important as taxpayer's money is involved.  We must ensure they are delivering to the counties and that there is transparency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016062100002#Y00500","speaker":"1272","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1466524800,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Chairman, may I respond to the Minister of State?  I agree.  The opportunity and the challenge is the word \"start-up\".  The LEOs are ramping up and are learning what they are doing.  Some of them are good and some of them are not so good, but their focus is start-ups.  We have the IDA bringing in business.  Enterprise Ireland is working with a certain number of businesses, for example, through the high potential start-up programme.  What I do not see in the Vote is funding allocated to companies that are steady state.<\/p> <p>  For example, there is an internationally traded services firm in Newtownmountkennedy, County Wicklow, which is working with a furniture manufacturer in another part of the county and exporting furniture.  That firm has a turnover of several million, is in rapid ramp-up mode and is a major success story.  The people there have nowhere to go to ask someone what is available.  The Minister of State listed a number of schemes such as the credit guarantee scheme.  Enterprise Ireland can do certain things and there may be more, but what seems to be missing from the Vote is funding to help existing companies.  We are helping major foreign companies, EI is helping a relatively small number of Irish companies and the LEOs are helping the start-ups, but there is no one for the tradesperson to go to, for example, a plumber who wants to know what he or she can do to grow the business and hire two more people.  That plumber may want to know if there are internship or training programmes, if there is a tax rebate for hiring two new people, or what is the gamut of State aid and support available.  The company representatives I spoke to yesterday have approached EI and they have been waiting a while, but they are hoping to get an answer from EI.  While the one-stop-shop is for the rest of the companies that are not high potential start-ups, companies such as the one I am referring to are not start-ups or Google-type companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2016062100002#Z00200","speaker":"1230"},{"type":"speech","time":1466524800,"counter":205,"content":"<p>The LEOs work.

We have seen the workings of the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  One can see the difference they have made by comparing the number of days lost through industrial disputes in 2015 with the number of days lost in the first quarter of 2016.  One can see that a total 5,115 days were lost due to industrial disputes in the first quarter of 2016, which involved a total of 4,828 workers and four firms.  A total of 32,964 days were lost due to industrial disputes in 2015, which involved nine firms and 37,760 workers.  Comparing those figures and looking at what has happened this year, it is obvious that the industrial relations machinery works, which is extremely important to note.<\/p> <p>  The statistics the Deputy mentioned refer to one-day strikes by teachers that involved 27,000 workers and that account for 23,500 of the days lost in 2014.<\/p><p>The second teachers' strike accounts for 98% of the 24,056 days lost.  A total of 27,588 workers went on strike between January and March of this year.  As many as 27,500 of these were second level teachers striking over the junior cycle reform dispute.  <\/p><p> The industrial relations machinery is independent and is part of the success of the Workplace Relations Commission's programme and that of the Labour Court.  They have done well to ensure that strikes do not occur.  In terms of inspection enforcement, as many as 5,185 inspections were carried out in 2015.<\/p><p> The WRC aims to conduct hearings within three months.  It also has an adviser on corporate services, which is important when it comes to ensuring that strikes do not take place.  The WRC's advisory service provides advice and assistance to employees, employers and trade unions in situations where there is no trade dispute, which is extremely important.<\/p><p> The WRC also has a conciliation service and a mediation service.  The conciliation service helps employers and their employees to resolve disputes when they have failed to reach agreement during their own previous negotiations.  The majority of the cases referred to conciliation are settled.  If no agreement is reached then the dispute may be referred to the Labour Court.  That is the whole idea of the Industrial Relations Act.
