The 2009 Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our overall energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. In order to meet this overall target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heating and 10% of transport power from renewable sources. At the end of 2012, 19.6% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity requirements came from renewable sources with 5.2% of our heat requirements and 2.4% of energy in transport coming from renewables. This equated to 7.1% of overall energy from renewables. <\/p><p>  In order to support development of renewable electricity generation, policy interventions are designed to incentivise the market to deliver the necessary renewable generation capacity. The choice of technology is ultimately a commercial decision for individual project developers. Currently the REFIT schemes are the primary means through which electricity from renewable sources is supported in Ireland. These schemes support electricity generated from a range of renewable sources including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind and are paid for by electricity customers through the Public Service Obligation.<\/p><p>  To date wind energy has proved to be the most commercial technology in the Irish market and provisional figures for 2013 indicate that 16.4% of energy demand in the electricity sector was met from wind. Nevertheless, diversification of the renewable generation portfolio in the longer term will be important for creating a sustainable, carbon free, electricity system. In this regard, biomass will have a role to play and, depending on electricity demand, the full implementation of current policies could mean that up to 5% of electricity may be generated from biomass in 2020.<\/p><p>Biomass, however, is likely to have a more significant role in the heat and transport sectors where fewer alternative technologies exist. Furthermore, estimates by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland show that current policies on their own will not deliver 12% renewable energy in the heat sector. The analysis underpinning the draft Bioenergy Plan, recently approved by Government, is that an additional bioenergy-focused measure in the heat sector would be a cost effective means of meeting Ireland's renewable energy targets. The Plan, therefore, recommends, subject to State Aid clearance and further Government approval, that a scheme be introduced that would incentivise larger heat users to convert to biomass heating solutions. My Department is progressing these outstanding issues and I will revert to Government with a fuller proposal in due course.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700041#WRA01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Services Provision","counter":18,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700041#WRA01250"},{"type":"question","counter":19,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[31299\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700041#WRA01300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when he expects the national broadband plan to provide an adequate broadband service to the Coomhola-Borlinn Valley in West Cork (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"995","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":20,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s Statement of Priorities for the period 2014 to 2016 reaffirms our commitment to delivering a State-led broadband intervention in rural areas.

As a consequence, exploration for oil and gas in the Irish offshore is both a costly and high risk investment.    The recent Wood Mackenzie Report on Ireland&rsquo;s oil and gas fiscal terms considered, as alternatives to the current concession system, the establishment of a state hydrocarbon exploration company and of introducing production sharing contracts.

The draft Plan sets out the broader context for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s bioenergy sector and the current status with regard to the range of policy areas that must be coordinated in order to create the conditions to underpin the development of the sector. The Plan recognises that improved coordination will allow the sector to contribute to a number of policy objectives ranging from the achievement of renewable energy targets, complementing waste management policies, supporting sustainable agriculture and forestry and stimulating economic activity. The Plan also identifies the necessary next steps to be taken by various government departments, agencies and State bodies to support the sustainable development of the sector. <\/p><p>  In terms of bioenergy's role in meeting Ireland's renewable energy targets, the Plan recommends the continuation of the two most significant bioenergy policies currently in place which are the REFIT schemes and the Biofuels Obligation Scheme.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, the analysis underpinning the Plan is that an additional bioenergy-focused measure in the heat sector represents the most cost effective means of meeting a number of different policy goals.

Consequently, the Plan also contains measures to stimulate and support the supply of Irish biomass.

The Government&rsquo;s affordable energy strategy &ldquo;Warmer Homes&rdquo; identified three key interlinking factors which determine whether a person falls into energy poverty, namely energy costs, incomes and thermal efficiency. <\/p><p>  Our high dependence upon imported fossil fuels limits our ability to control energy costs. However, we can promote and facilitate competition in the energy market through appropriate regulation and consumer awareness. Energy customers can choose between multiple energy suppliers and can shop around to seek a deal that best suits their needs and circumstances.<\/p><p>  The Government will continue to ensure that those on low incomes are supported and treated with dignity through the household benefits package and specifically through the fuel allowance.<\/p><p>  The the most meaningful measure that can be taken is to continue to improve the thermal efficiency of people&rsquo;s homes and protect them from the effects of rising energy costs. The Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to low income households that meet defined eligibility criteria and are vulnerable to energy poverty. The scheme is managed by the SEAI (Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland) and delivered through a range of Community Based Organisations, augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage. Recipients of the scheme do not receive grants but have energy efficiency measures installed free of charge. Since the commencement of the scheme in 2000, over 105,000 homes around the country have received energy efficiency measures under the Warmer Homes scheme, with a total spend of over &euro;116 million. The Warmer Homes scheme is expected to upgrade another 12,000 households in energy poverty this year.<\/p><p>  In addition, late last year a taskforce was established to examine the specific issue of consumer disconnections in the electricity and gas market. The taskforce has developed a number of new measures that will have a significant impact in this area. The CER (Commission for Energy Regulation) has published a consultation paper on debt management and has provided guidance that allows suppliers to make more Pay-As-You-Go meters available to customers. The network companies (ESB Networks and Bord Gais Networks) are running a number of pilot programmes which should ensure more customers get the opportunity to avoid a disconnection and energy suppliers for their part, have launched a new code of practice, &quot;The Energy Engage Code&quot;, which guarantees that no customer engaging with them will be cut off. The CER will be monitoring and reporting on disconnection statistics on a monthly basis.<\/p><p>  On the launch of the Energy Green Paper in May, the holding of a number of workshops on the paper was signalled. One of these workshops will be on empowering energy citizens, with energy affordability an integral part of this workshop. <\/p><p>Finally, the Government intends to review the affordable energy strategy and I anticipate releasing a consultation paper this autumn to commence the process.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700041#WRA02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Bodies Funding","counter":36,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700041#WRA02450"},{"type":"question","counter":37,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[31643\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700041#WRA02500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"from where funding for payment of those who sit on the board of RT&Eacute; comes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1083","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":38,"content":"<p>Section 84 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for the terms of Board members of the Public Service Broadcasting Corporations, RT&Eacute; and TG4.

In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources. The primary support mechanisms for renewable electricity, including electricity generated from wind, are the Renewable Energy Feed-In-Tariff (REFIT) scheme and the Alternative Energy Requirement (AER) scheme, both of which are funded from the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy.<\/p><p>  The estimates for the cost of the PSO levy for each year since 2003 are published in the annual PSO decision by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). While the bulk of subsidies for renewable electricity generation paid under these schemes have been for wind, the CER has initiated a project to generate a report on the annual and cumulative costs to date in relation to AER and REFIT support schemes for each technology supported.<\/p><p>  The CER determines the PSO levy which is a charge on all electricity customers without exception. The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in Regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999 (S.I. No. 217 of 2002). The cost of the PSO varies from year to year depending on a number of factors including the wholesale market price of electricity.<\/p><p>  The proposed PSO levy amount for the levy period 2014\/2015 has been calculated by the CER to be &euro;327,712,890 and the draft decision is on its website. In terms of the cost to the PSO of renewable energy, AER is expected to cost &euro;2,269,000 and the cost of REFIT is estimated to be &euro;84,346,555 which together would amount to an average charge of approximately &euro;16.65 per domestic customer for the year. Although a breakdown of the PSO cost by technology is not available, wind makes up almost 95% of the renewable electricity supported in the two schemes. <\/p><p>A final decision on the PSO levy for the 2014\/15 period will issue by 1 August 2014 and will be available on the CER website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700042#WRB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":77,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700042#WRB01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland Issues","counter":76,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700042#WRB01150"},{"type":"question","counter":77,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[32166\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700042#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the proposals he has to meet the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the party leaders in Northern Ireland on the need to progress the Haass talks to a successful conclusion; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":78,"content":"<p>On the evening of my appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I spoke by telephone with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers.

In doing so, it must act proportionately and ensure the protection of civilians at all times. It deeply deplores the loss of innocent lives and the high number of wounded civilians in the Gaza Strip as a result of Israeli military operations and is deeply concerned about the rapid and dramatic deterioration of the humanitarian situation. The European Council calls on both sides to de-escalate the situation, to end the violence, to end the suffering of the civilian populations notably by allowing access to humanitarian assistance, and return to calm. The European Council welcomes on-going efforts by regional partners, and in particular the initiative launched by Egypt, to establish a cease-fire and calls on Hamas to agree on such cease-fire. The European Union stands ready to provide the necessary support to this end. The European Union continues to call for the full implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1860 (2009).<\/p><p>  The tragic events of the past days highlight the urgent need for all parties to work towards a resumption of the diplomatic process and to pursue a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  The European Union reiterates its offer to both parties of a package of European political and economic support and of a Special Privileged Partnership with the European Union in the event of a final peace agreement.<\/p><p>  Israelis and Palestinians need to make the strategic choice of peace in order to allow their future generations to live lives freed from past conflicts and to enjoy the stability, security and prosperity which they are currently being denied.&quot;<\/p><p>  Finally, this issue will be further discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council next week, on 22 July, which I will attend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700042#WRB03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Undocumented Irish in the USA","counter":105,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700042#WRB03350"},{"type":"question","counter":106,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[32362\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700042#WRB03400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the efforts to help the undocumented Irish in the USA; if he will outline any recent positive developments in this area; his future plans on this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":107,"content":"<p>The former T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade visited Washington D.C. over the period 17-19 June for various meetings in relation to U.S. immigration reform, which remains a key Government priority.

We are lobbying actively to ensure that the needs of Irish citizens will be reflected to the greatest extent possible in the scope of the executive action being considered by the President. Our continuing objective is to ensure that the undocumented Irish will have the freedom to work and travel and that there will be pathways for future legal migration from Ireland to the US for those wishing to avail of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700042#WRB03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Programme for Government Implementation","counter":108,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700042#WRB03550"},{"type":"question","counter":109,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[32396\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700042#WRB03600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the commitments under the programme for Government for which his Department is responsible; the progress made to date with regard to each commitment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":110,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to the Annual Report on the Programme for Government and the related statements in the D&aacute;il in March which set out the progress on an extensive number of the Department&rsquo;s commitments. These include increasing exports, promoting Ireland abroad, overseas development aid, humanitarian crises response, civilian corps, implementing the Good Friday Agreement and St. Andrew&rsquo;s Agreement, economic co-operation to support jobs, review of the North- South bodies and Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU.  In terms of the crucial priority of economic recovery, we have achieved very significant progress in restoring Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation through our continued emphasis on economic diplomacy. My Department and our Embassy network, working closely with the State agencies, use every opportunity to highlight Ireland&rsquo;s economic strengths and potential to international audiences. The impact of this work is clear. Ireland&rsquo;s successful implementation of, and exit from, the EU IMF bailout without a precautionary credit line was successfully communicated in international media, to policy-makers, and contacts worldwide via the Embassy network. In June, the yields on Irish 10 year bonds reached historic lows and the ratings agency Standard and Poors upgraded Ireland to an A rating in June. A number of international business rankings also reflect the positively changed analysis of the Irish economy: e.g. Ireland has moved from 47<sup>th<\/sup>place globally in 2011 to 3<sup>rd<\/sup>in 2014 in the influential IMD World Competitiveness Rankings and Forbes magazine has named Ireland the Best Country in the World to do Business.   International media coverage and commentary, while reflecting ongoing domestic and international economic challenges, is notably more positive on Ireland&rsquo;s achievements and prospects than at the time of the formation of the Government. Export levels are now higher than they were before the economic crisis. Net job creation from inward investment and by our small and medium sized exporting companies was higher in 2013 than it has been for ten years.<\/p><p>We are also following up on the implementation of the recommendations in the Government Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy to actively develop cultural and diplomatic links with emerging markets. In February 2014 my Department published a short, focused review of the Strategy, adding an additional seven &lsquo;Exploratory and High Potential Markets&rsquo; and in January 2014 we announced that five new Embassies and three new Consulates General will be opened in key locations across South East Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas. These Embassies and Consulates will provide a platform for further promotion of Irish exports, investment, tourism and education. The implementation of th<font color=\"#004080\">e <\/font>Strategy will continue to be overseen by the Export Trade Council whose role is to strengthen cooperation and coordination across all Government Departments and State agencies involved in the international promotion and development of trade, tourism and investment.<\/p><p>In relation to Northern Ireland, the Government&rsquo;s approach is guided by the principles and values of the Good Friday Agreement and its related Agreements, which are essential to peace and reconciliation in Ireland and across these islands. Their key elements include partnership government in Northern Ireland; agreement on sovereignty; human rights; parity of esteem; and support for the rule of law. The continued shared responsibility of the two governments is to guarantee these principles and to support the implementation of the Agreements.  The Irish Government is determined to realise their full potential.<\/p><p>Against that background, we continue to work intensively with the parties in the Executive and with the British Government in support of an agreement on a comprehensive and balanced framework for dealing with parades, flags and contending with the past.  British-Irish relations, already strong, have benefitted further from the recent State Visit by President Higgins to the United Kingdom.  We will work to ensure that all opportunities for North South and East West cooperation are harnessed in support of job creation and economic growth on the island.<\/p><p>At its Plenary meeting in November 2013, the North South Ministerial Council agreed to focus on new priorities for practical economic cooperation that can help economic recovery, job creation, the optimal use of public money and the most effective delivery of public services.  Ministers have been examining opportunities in this area for the past six months with their Northern Ireland counterparts and there will be a further discussion on this at the next Plenary of the North South Ministerial Council.<\/p><p>Despite the very severe economic and budgetary situation we have faced, the Government has clearly demonstrated its determination since coming into office to maintain and stabilise the budget for Official Development Assistance (ODA) to the maximum possible extent.  In the three years 2011 through 2013, a total of over &euro;1.9 billion has been provided for ODA.  This is an enormous achievement in the circumstances.  For 2014, the Government has again managed to allocate almost &euro;600 million to ODA, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to helping the poor of the world.  Our new policy clearly states that the Government remains committed to the UN target of providing 0.7% of GNP in ODA, and to making further progress towards achieving it as soon as economic circumstances permit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700042#WRB03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Application Refusals","counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700042#WRB03750"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[32615\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700042#WRB03800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of a revocation of a passport and legal challenge for a person (details supplied) in County Cavan; the reason the passport is being revoked; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":113,"content":"<p>All applications for passports are subject to the provisions of the Passports Act, 2008.

The further development of the all-island economy and political stability in Northern Ireland are high priorities for this Government. The Government is working with the British Government, with the Northern Ireland Executive and with civil society actors, North and South, to advance implementation of the Good Friday and Saint Andrews Agreements, to take forward North South cooperation, and to foster an inclusive approach towards commemorating the centenary of historical events making up the Decade of Commemorations. Through my Department&rsquo;s Reconciliation Fund we will offer support to community initiatives that aim to repair those issues which lead to division, conflict and barriers to a deeply reconciled and peaceful society; and to build a strong civil society that encompasses all communities, and promotes respect for all. In the North South Ministerial Council, the Government will continue to work with the Northern Ireland Executive to advance areas of practical North South cooperation which are of mutual benefit.  The vital work of restoring our international reputation and promoting our economic recovery are at the heart of the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, with our mission network playing a particular crucial role. An ongoing priority is the implementation of the February review of the Government Trade Tourism and Investment which focuses on how we co-ordinate our work abroad to provide the best possible platform for the Embassy network, the State agencies and the private sector to win business overseas, to attract greater levels of foreign direct investment, and create jobs at home. I look forward to taking this work forward, together with a number of my Cabinet colleagues, in my capacity as chair of the Export Trade Council.<\/p><p>I am acutely conscious of the need for Ireland to adapt to the global shifts in economic and political power towards the east and south. Ireland has a strategic interest in broadening and deepening our relationships with the countries in Asia to ensure that we can benefit from the opportunities that will arise as the continent continues to develop, as well as having influence in a region that will help shape global developments in the decades to come.  We will also continue to develop our relationship with the Latin American and Caribbean region which, like Asia, includes a number of exploratory and high potential markets for Ireland, as identified in the review of the Government Trade Tourism and Investment Strategy.<\/p><p>Engagement with our EU partners and the broader region will remain a priority for promoting and protecting our interests. Ireland will continue to be a strong supporter of the EU Enlargement policy, which is one of the Union&rsquo;s most powerful tools in pursuing our strategic objective of promoting peace, stability, democracy and prosperity throughout Europe. My Department will continue to coordinate with other Government Departments in identifying and promoting issues of national interest in the EU&rsquo;s negotiations with enlargement countries.<\/p><p>Improving the effectiveness of the Eastern Partnership will be a key challenge for the EU in the period ahead and Ireland will support initiatives aimed at achieving this objective. In this context, we will prioritise the ratification by Ireland of the EU Association Agreements with Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine which were signed at the June European Council.<\/p><p>In my new role, I am deeply conscious of Ireland&rsquo;s proud tradition in international affairs as a country which seeks to promote and share its values. I am determined to continue to advance long-standing priorities in areas of key importance to Ireland and to ensure that we seek at every opportunity, to make a direct and significant contribution to the promotion of global peace and stability, notably through our membership of the United Nations, the European Union, the Council of Europe and the OSCE, as well as through bilateral action.<\/p><p>The crisis in Ukraine, coupled with the profound implications for the EU&rsquo;s relations with Russia, will remain an important priority on the international agenda for some time. We will continue to engage closely with our EU partners in supporting international efforts aimed at de-escalating the crisis and finding a peaceful, inclusive and negotiated settlement.<\/p><p>Ireland will also remain actively engaged in promoting a more active EU role in relation to the Middle East Peace Process and in sustaining the viability of a negotiated, two-State solution. Ireland will also seek to maintain the strong profile it has in addressing the appalling humanitarian situation arising from the conflict in Syria and will support all efforts to promote a political resolution both in Syria and Iraq which is now also experiencing serious internal conflict.<\/p><p>In the area of human rights we will use the remainder of our Human Rights Council term to prioritise national initiatives on promoting and protecting the operating environment for civil society and preventable mortality and morbidity of children under five. 2015 will be a crucial year in the sphere of disarmament and non-proliferation with Ireland actively involved in preparations for the Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and supporting progress towards the entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty.<\/p><p>Our development aid programme with its overall aim of reducing poverty and hunger, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, gives expression to the best of Ireland&rsquo;s values and will continue to be a major priority. Over the next 18 months, the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s 2013 policy <i>One World, One Future<\/i>will inform much of our work in this area. The Policy sets out three guiding principles for our international aid programme: reduced hunger and stronger resilience; sustainable development and inclusive economic growth; and better governance, human rights and accountability.  Ireland will also continue to be centrally engaged in the Post 2015 development framework that will succeed the Millennium Development Goals. Throughout this work we will maintain our commitment to the highest standards of openness, transparency and accountability to the Irish people and to our development partners and maintain our strong focus on achieving real and sustainable development results in order to maximise the impact and effectiveness of our programme.<\/p><p>The provision of an excellent and efficient service to our citizens will of course remain a central focus in my Department.  Ongoing work on the reform of the passport service is a particular priority as it is providing opportunities for new and improved services for passport customers; more secure and efficient processes for the Passport Service; increasing staffing efficiencies and providing financial savings for the Department.<\/p><p>My Department will also develop and publish a Government strategy on Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with our Diaspora and emigrant communities.  Consultations with these communities are already under way, and this work will be carried forward by the Minister of State with Special Responsibility for the Irish Abroad.   In terms of our relations with the United States, we will maintain our ongoing efforts to secure an outcome on Immigration Reform that will serve the needs of undocumented Irish citizens in the US and also provide legal pathway for Irish citizens wishing to live and work in the US in the future.<\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy is an essential element of Government. It is the means by which we promote our values and pursue our interests abroad. Through it, we pursue Ireland&rsquo;s economic prosperity, ensure the well-being of the Irish people, and promote peace and security, both at home and in the wider world. Our foreign policy is also a statement of who we are as a people.<\/p><p>I intend shortly to bring forward a comprehensive review of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy. The purpose of the review, which was initiated in 8 October 2013 and has involved a broad-based process of consultation including Government Departments, State Agencies, the Oireachtas, civil society and members of the public, is to provide an updated statement of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and external relations, and to identify a series of recommendations for its conduct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700042#WRB04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Responsibilities","counter":122,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700042#WRB04550"},{"type":"question","counter":123,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[32792\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700042#WRB04600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide a copy of the briefing he received from the Department on his entering office; if he will publish the briefing; and if so, when the briefing will be published.","asker":"1101","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":124,"content":"<p>My Department will arrange for a copy of the briefing prepared for me on my appointment as Minster for Foreign Affairs and Trade, edited as necessary to reflect exclusions identified in Freedom of Information Act, to be placed on the Department&rsquo;s website in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700042#WRB04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":125,"content":"<p>Question No. 53 answered with Question No. 51.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":126,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700042#WRB04850"},{"type":"question","counter":127,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[32865\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700042#WRB04900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide in tabular form any capital investments made in Irish embassies and consulates in the past two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":128,"content":"<p>Capital expenditure by my Department in respect of Irish Embassies and Consulates in 2012 and 2013 is provided below in tabular form, as requested by the Deputy.

This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and within the country.<\/p><p>Interception of illicit tobacco products, alcohol and fuel is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages, as appropriate. Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.<\/p><p>Action against the illicit trade in mineral oils includes measures to detect and shut down plants illegally laundering marked mineral oil, to detect illicit products in transit and seize both the products and the vehicles transporting them, and to prevent the sale of illicit products.<\/p><p>There is extensive cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating these illicit trades, and the relevant agencies in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through cross-border groups on tobacco and oils enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for large proportions of these illicit markets. In addition, cooperation takes place with other revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in the ongoing programmes at international level to tackle these forms of crime.<\/p><p>Considerable success is being achieved in Revenue's action against the illicit trades. Seizures of cigarettes in 2013 and in the current year to the end of June amounted to 40.8 million and 41.1 million respectively. Seizures this year include one of some 32.2 million cigarettes, as well as 4.5 tonnes of water pipe tobacco, from a vessel at Drogheda Port. This was the largest seizure to date in Europe this year, and was the result of an intelligence-led operation targeting the activities of an international organised crime group headed up by Irish and UK nationals and based in Europe. Action against the illicit oil trade in the period since 2011 has led to the detection and shutting down of 30 oil laundries and to seizure of some 3 million litres of illicit fuel. In addition, more than 120 filling stations were closed, for trading without a licence or for breach of licence conditions.<\/p><p>Action is taken on an ongoing basis to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners have the most effective means of acting against these forms of criminal activity. The total seizures of illicit cigarettes, alcohol products and mineral oils, in each of the years from 2004 to 2013, are as set out in the following table.<table><tr><th><b>Year<\/b><\/th><th><b>Cigarettes<\/b><\/th><th><\/th><th><b>Alcohol<\/b><\/th><th><\/th><th><b>Oil<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b><\/b><br \/><br \/><\/td><td>Quantity<br \/><br \/><br \/>(Million)<\/td><td>Value<br \/><br \/><br \/>(&euro;m)<\/td><td>Quantity<br \/><br \/><br \/>(Litres)<\/td><td>Value<br \/><br \/><br \/>(&euro;m)<\/td><td>Quantity<br \/><br \/><br \/>(Litres)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2013<\/b><\/td><td>40.8<\/td><td>18.9<\/td><td>55,755<\/td><td>1.5<\/td><td>874,882<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2012<\/b><\/td><td>95.6<\/td><td>43.3<\/td><td>33,059<\/td><td>0.7<\/td><td>1,113,142<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2011<\/b><\/td><td>109.1<\/td><td>46<\/td><td>34,040<\/td><td>0.5<\/td><td>1,044,830<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2010<\/b><\/td><td>178.4<\/td><td>75.2<\/td><td>44,276<\/td><td>0.6<\/td><td>289,484<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2009<\/b><\/td><td>218.5<\/td><td>92<\/td><td>96,759<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>283,817<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2008<\/b><\/td><td>135.2<\/td><td>54.4<\/td><td>83,037<\/td><td>0.7<\/td><td>100,470<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2007<\/b><\/td><td>74.5<\/td><td>25.6<\/td><td>22,820<\/td><td>0.3<\/td><td>118,417<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2006<\/b><\/td><td>52.3<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>57,754<\/td><td>0.6<\/td><td>164,157<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2005<\/b><\/td><td>51.3<\/td><td>15.6<\/td><td>328,649<\/td><td>2.2<\/td><td>466,180<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>2004<\/b><\/td><td>60.9<\/td><td>18.6<\/td><td>79,593<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>409,916<\/td><\/tr><\/table>The table shows also the estimated value of the seizures of cigarettes and alcohol products. That information is not available in respect of mineral oil products.<\/p><p>A breakdown of this information by Garda districts is not available.<\/p><p>The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for the detection and detention of counterfeit and pirated goods, including CDs and DVDs, at points of entry to the State, and responsibility for acting against goods of that kind that are in circulation in the State rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Data in respect of CDs and DVDs seized or detained by the Revenue Commissioners in the years 2004 to 2013\u00a0is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that estimating the scale of any illegal activity is difficult. The extent of the illicit trade in cigarettes\u00a0is, however, estimated through annual surveys of smokers, carried out for the Revenue Commissioners and the National Tobacco Control Office of the Health Services Executive by Ipsos MRBI. The 2013 survey indicates that some 11% of cigarettes consumed were illicit. This represents a loss to the Exchequer of some &euro;212 million in excise duty and VAT, assuming that the illicit cigarettes consumed displaced the equivalent full tax paid quantity of cigarettes. Comparable data are not available in respect of alcohol or oil products.<\/p><p>Legislative action has been taken over recent years to ensure that Revenue has the requisite powers to respond effectively to the problem of the illegal tobacco trade. The Finance Act 2012 clarified the legal basis for Revenue officers to open and examine the contents of postal and courier packets that are reasonably believed to contain untaxed excise products. The Finance Act 2013 introduced new offence and forfeiture measures relating to the illicit production of tobacco, including offences of involvement with illicit tobacco production, knowingly dealing in or delivering any illicit tobacco product and keeping materials and equipment for the purposes of illicit production. Provision was made also for the forfeiture of any equipment or materials, including unmanufactured tobacco, used for illicit production. That Act also strengthened the offence provisions relating to the sale or delivery of unstamped tobacco products. The Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 provided that a person suspected of an offence of dealing in, or with, unstamped tobacco products must provide information to a Revenue Officer or a Garda and may be required to present any tobacco product concerned for examination, and makes provision for search by a Revenue Officer or Garda of any bag or other receptacle that he or she reasonably believes to contain tobacco products that are concerned in the offence.<\/p><p>As well as those changes to primary law Ireland, in accordance with EU Directive 2008\/118\/EU, introduced a quantitative restriction, with effect from 1 January 2014, on the number of cigarettes that may be brought into the State for personal use by individuals travelling from Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. The Excise Duty on Cigarettes (Quantitative Restrictions) Order 2013 (S.I. No. 553 of 2013) provides that the number of tax-paid cigarettes that may be brought into Ireland for personal use by individuals travelling from those Member States, without payment of further excise duty in Ireland, is restricted to 300. Anyone with cigarettes in excess of that quantity must declare them to a Revenue Officer and pay the appropriate excise duty. This restriction will remain in place until 31 December 2017 or until such time as the particular Member State has achieved the required EU minimum tax levels, whichever is the earlier.<\/p><p>In response to illicit fuel trading, Revenue has implemented a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem through enhanced supply chain controls, the acquisition of a more effective fuel marker and continued robust enforcement action.<\/p><p>Supply chain controls have been enhanced progressively since 2011 with the objective of reducing the capacity of criminals to source marked diesel for laundering or to get laundered fuel onto the market. The supply chain controls introduced include new licensing conditions for all fuel traders and the introduction from January 2013 of a requirement that all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, make detailed monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions.

It is not clear from the question whether the tax-free lump sum the Deputy envisages is all or part of an individual s retirement lump sum or whether it is simply a proportion of the individual s overall pension fund at the point of drawdown. Neither is it evident what if any limits would apply to the lump sum that could be drawn down early or the conditions that would attach to such a facility. <\/p><p>  In any event, the tax-free retirement lump sum is a significant part of an individual s core retirement benefits which is generally only available in pension schemes approved by the Revenue Commissioners at normal retirement age although Revenue approval may also provide for voluntary early retirement from age 50 where scheme rules allow and with the employer s consent. In such situations, however, retirement benefits would be restricted. <\/p><p>  For many individuals with limited pension savings the tax-free lump sum may well be the major pension benefit at retirement. In my view, it is preferable not to encourage early withdrawals of core pension benefits of whatever kind, as the inevitable result is to divert the savings initially intended to finance retirement to meet short term financial crises. This clearly poses retirement income adequacy issues and, in that regard, the impact of the early withdrawal of pension savings on the ultimate value of the pension pot at retirement should not be underestimated. Allowing access to all, or even to a proportion, of an individual s retirement lump sum before retirement would undermine core benefits in the long term to the detriment of the individual in his retirement years. <\/p><p>  As to the economic benefit of an early access scheme, in other jurisdictions where pre-retirement access to pension savings have been allowed (e.g. Denmark and Iceland), there are doubts about the extent to which the gains in consumption have been attributable to the schemes in those countries. <\/p><p>  I gave consideration to all of these issues in my decision to introduce Section 782A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which provides members of occupational pension schemes with a once-off opportunity to access their Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs), pre-retirement. The option is available for a three year period from 27 March 2013, the date that the Finance Act 2013 was passed into law.<\/p><p>  The pre-retirement access to a portion of AVCs which I introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2013 is allowed on a tax-neutral basis   the contributions were tax-relieved at the individual s marginal rate on the way in and are taxed at the individual s marginal rate on withdrawal. The take-up of the measure to date has not been particularly significant. The measure is, however, designed to enable rather than incentivise individuals to access part of their pension savings beyond their regular or compulsory pension contributions. It is important that individuals continue to provide for their retirement and, it would appear, most individuals with AVCs have to date decided to preserve their AVC pension savings. For these various reasons, I have no plans to extend pre-retirement access to pension savings beyond what is provided for in relation to AVCs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700043#WRC04100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Compensation Fund","counter":186,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700043#WRC04200"},{"type":"question","counter":187,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[32209\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700043#WRC04300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide details of the current estimate by the joint administrators of a company (details supplied) of the losses at the former company; if he will further provide details of the role of the Insurance Compensation Fund in dealing with this issue; the amount that has been collected to date from the 2% insurance levy introduced since 1 January 2012; the timeframe the levy is likely to have to remain in place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":188,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[32675\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700043#WRC04400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated cost of winding down Quinn Insurance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":189,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 169 together.<\/p><p>  The Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) levy being applied to home, motor and commercial insurance, and which\u00a0came into effect from 1 January 2012,\u00a0 operates under the Insurance Act 1964. \u00a0Its purpose is to protect policy holders in the event of their insurer becoming insolvent.

These have been most pronounced in urban areas, particularly Dublin. This is most likely driven by a supply-demand mismatch in these urban areas. The current level of new builds is very low by reference to historical norms as well as estimates of medium-term housing demand.\u00a0<\/p><p>In order to address the current inadequacies in the market, the recently published\u00a0Construction 2020 strategy sets out\u00a0a range of actions to be taken in the immediate future\u00a0which aim to address,\u00a0among other issues: housing supply, with a particular focus on planning issues and appropriate and sustainable development financing; transparent and sustainable mortgage lending; as well as\u00a0the application of the tax code to the construction and property sectors.<\/p><p>Action 1 of the Strategy provides a National Framework for Housing Supply is to be established on a statutory footing with an annual National Statement of Projected Housing Supply and Demand to be\u00a0published every June. The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government (DECLG) has advised me that the\u00a0Housing Agency has\u00a0been asked to take the lead in implementing this Action. <\/p><p>The proper management of all State land is critical; accordingly, both lands that have been transferred to the Housing Agency and lands held by local authorities which are suitable for development will be the first sites considered in any future targeted social housing building programme. DECLG's annual Housing Land Availability Survey (HLAS) gathers information from local authorities to inform the publication of the amount of zoned residential land in their areas that is currently serviced. It is currently estimated that there are in excess of 25,000 hectares of undeveloped residentially-zoned land nationally, which equates to a capacity for over 500,000 new homes (based on a national average of 20 units per hectare). This capacity is considered to be sufficient to meet\u00a0total housing requirements nationally for more than the next ten years.\u00a0In line with the commitments under the Construction 2020 strategy, a Housing Supply Co-ordination Task Force for Dublin has been established with an immediate focus on addressing supply-related issues in the capital. <\/p><p>Under Action 8 of Construction 2020, a Social Housing Strategy is to be published by the end of the third quarter of\u00a02014. To assist in the development of the Social Housing Strategy, the Housing Agency has invited submissions by 31 July 2014. This invitation for submissions is available at the following weblink:\u00a0. <\/p><p>Regarding the recent rise in rents, the Private Residential Tenancies Board has been asked to carry out a focused piece of research that will explore options to address the difficulties being experienced in segments of the private rented sector and to report back to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government with policy recommendations in the coming weeks. With regard to broader social housing policy, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 will provide for the introduction of the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme.\u00a0 HAP will provide a new framework for the provision of rental assistance and will, in as much as it can, facilitate the removal of existing barriers to employment by allowing HAP recipients remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment. \u00a0It is expected that the Bill will be enacted by the summer, following which the commencement date and the detailed terms of the scheme will be prescribed.\u00a0<\/p><p>DECLG expects the final output across all social housing programmes for 2014 to be in the region of 6,000 new housing units. The number and method of delivery of social housing units in future years is determined in the course of the annual Estimates process and will be informed by the Social Housing Strategy which is\u00a0currently in preparation and which will set out clear objectives in respect of delivery over the next five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Remuneration","counter":247,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD00350"},{"type":"question","counter":248,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[32429\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has an estimate of the impact that reductions in the public sector budget and the growth in temporary and part-time contracts and lower wages in the public sector have had on the wage share to GDP ratio.","asker":"1195","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":249,"content":"<p> The public service Exchequer wage bill (net of pension related deductions) has been reduced by 17 per cent since 2008, with public service employment volumes falling by 10 per cent. <\/p><p>  The most definitive source of wage data comes from the annual National Income and Expenditure Accounts, recently published by the Central Statistics Office.

There is no interest cost associated with these payments as they did not require borrowing.<\/p><p>(2) The promissory notes to IBRC and EBS added &euro;30.85 billion to the general government debt, but not the national debt, in 2010. There was an interest holiday on the IBRC promissory note repayments in 2011 and 2012 and thus zero interest was payable for these years. In 2013 promissory note interest\u00a0of &euro;214 million was payable up\u00a0to the date of IBRC's liquidation. General government interest is also payable on the EBS promissory note for all years with an average of &euro;12 million payable between 2012 and 2014. Under the terms of the promissory note an annual payment &euro;3.085 billion was to be made to the beneficiary banks. This payment was made in cash in 2011, and the IBRC element\u00a0(&euro;3.06 billion) was\u00a0paid by way of a government bond in 2012. Both these payments impacted the national debt and incurred general government interest costs of approximately &euro;0.3 billion in each of the years 2012 to 2014.\u00a0\u00a0The IBRC promissory notes were cancelled and replaced with a portfolio of eight floating rate Government bonds for a total amount of &euro;25 billion. The bonds pay interest every six months (June and December) based on the six month Euribor interest rate plus an interest margin. The margin averages 2.63% across the eight issues. This gave rise to payments of &euro;0.65 billion in 2013 and an estimated &euro;0.8 billion in 2014. The Deputy should note that these payments contribute significantly to the surplus income of the Central Bank, up to 80% of which is paid to the Central Fund in the following year.<\/p><p>(3) By the end of 2013, &euro;10 billion (net of the sale of Bank of Ireland equity in 2011, the sale of Irish Life and the sale of contingent capital notes in 2013) is estimated to have been paid through direct payments from the Exchequer account to the banking sector.Although no specific borrowing was made in the cases of interventions paid through the Exchequer, the impact can be estimated using the average rate of interest on government debt.<\/p><p>This figure excludes fees paid to the Minister under the Credit Institutions Financial Support and Eligible Liabilities Guarantee schemes amounting to &euro;4.4 billion from 2008 to 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":259,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD01150"},{"type":"question","counter":260,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[32439\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will set out in tabular form the number of applications received and granted for a banking licence in the State in each year since 2010.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":261,"content":"<p> As Minister for Finance I have no role in the granting of a banking licence.

As a result of the change, farmers in this position would have lost their farm payment entitlements and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine advised those farmers to transfer those entitlements to active farmers by 15 May last (the deadline by which the change takes effect and after which the payment entitlements in the hands of the affected lessor farmers would be worthless).<\/p><p>  On 1 May last, I announced my intention, based on the case made to me, to provide for an exemption from CGT on any chargeable gains arising from the disposal by the owners of payment entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme where all of those entitlements were leased out in 2013 and where the owners, because of the change in CAP regulations, were advised by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to transfer their entitlements to an  active  farmer by 15 May 2014. \u00a0I propose to include appropriate provisions to give effect to the CGT exemption in Finance Bill 2014 which will be published shortly after Budget 2015 in the Autumn.<\/p><p>  I support the principle of ex-ante and ex-post economic impact assessments, including cost benefit analysis in formulating and evaluating tax policy and, since coming into office, I have instructed my Department to carry out a range of significant economic assessments of various tax expenditure measures. I do not, however, automatically follow this course in every tax change I have made or put forward, as circumstances and common sense also have a bearing on the decisions to be made in this regard. I did not have a cost benefit analysis carried out in this instance.<\/p><p>  Among the reasons for this is that the CGT exemption will apply on a  once-off  basis only and to a specified number of affected farmers who would not have disposed of their leased farm payment entitlements if it were not for a change to EU regulations which was outside of their control. Moreover, I was persuaded that, since the Department of Agriculture had advised affected farmers involved in leasing to dispose of their leased payment entitlements in circumstances where they would not otherwise have done so, significant damage would be done to the critical policy of encouraging longer term leasing in the absence of the CGT tax concession. Encouraging land mobility through long-term leasing has been one of the main drivers in agri-taxation  policy. Long-term leasing provides the certainty required to encourage lessees to invest and improve land and encourages progressive and competitive farmers to enlarge their farm holdings. Finally, since a decision had to be made in this matter within a relatively short period before 15 May last, there was insufficient time to conduct any meaningful impact analysis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Universal Social Charge Application","counter":265,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD01550"},{"type":"question","counter":266,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[32443\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the revenue that would be foregone by amending the universal social charge to raise the threshold for the 2% rate to &euro;12,000, &euro;15,000 and &euro;17,500, respectively.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":267,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year cost, estimated by reference to 2014 incomes, of increasing the 2% USC rate threshold to &euro;12,000, &euro;15,000 and &euro;17,500 is tentatively estimated to be of the order of &euro;189 million, &euro;465 million and &euro;685 million respectively.<\/p><p>  These figures are estimates for 2014 incomes from the Revenue tax forecasting model using latest actual data for the year 2011, adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim.

This can be characterised as the weighted average cost of its bond and bill issuance.\u00a0 As at 31 March 2014 the blended effective interest rate on Ireland's EFSF loans was 2.31%. <\/p><p>  The effective interest rate on Ireland's EFSM loans is based on the EFSM's cost of funds when it issues bonds.\u00a0As at 31 March 2014 the blended interest rate on Ireland's EFSM loans was 3.06%.<\/p><p>  The interest rate on the United Kingdom's bilateral loan to Ireland is fixed and is based on the weighted gross redemption yield on all UK Debt Management Office (DMO) gilt issuances to the market in the six month period up to the date of the disbursement of each portion of the loan, plus a service fee of 18 basis points. As at 31 March 2014 the estimated blended euro equivalent interest rate on Ireland's UK loans including hedging costs was 1.78%.<\/p><p>  The interest rate on both bilateral loans from the Kingdom of Sweden and Kingdom of Denmark is floating and is based on 3-month euribor plus a margin of 100 basis points. As at 31 March 2014 the interest rates on these loans were 1.34% and 1.33% respectively.<\/p><p>  The interest rate on the IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) is tied to the IMF's market-related interest rate, known as the basic rate of charge. As the IMF loan is provided in Special Drawing Rights, which is composed of a basket of four currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY), the interest rate is constructed from 3-month Eurepo, US and UK Treasury Bills and Japanese Government Discount Notes' rates plus a margin of 100 basis points. Borrowings of up to three times a country's IMF quota are subject to the basic rate of charge. Borrowings above three times quota attract a surcharge of 200 basis points which is in addition to the 100 basis points margin which forms part of the basic rate of charge. This surcharge increased to 300 basis points in mid-January 2014 per the IMF rules as the loan size exceeded three times the quota for more than three years after the date of the first disbursement. As at 31 March 2014 the overall estimated blended euro equivalent interest rate on Ireland's IMF loan, including hedging costs, was 4.99%.<\/p><p>  The Deputy should note that the mixture of floating and fixed interest rates across facilities and, in the case of the EFSF within a facility, makes it difficult to compare one facility directly against another as they contain different interest rate risk profiles, currencies and maturities.\u00a0 In addition, the floating interest rates quoted are at a point in time and are, therefore, subject to change depending on movements in market rates. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD02700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Exemptions","counter":283,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD02750"},{"type":"question","counter":284,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[32452\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the proportion of income earners exempt from income tax in 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":285,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[32479\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD02900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the percentage of self-employed people who are outside the income tax net; the way this compares to the percentage of PAYE workers who have no income tax liability; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":286,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[32664\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of those in employment earning less than &euro;32,800 per annum; the number earning greater than that amount; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":287,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[32665\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of one income married couples with the annual income being less than &euro;41,800 per annum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":288,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[32666\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number and percentage of taxpayers who would be affected by any reduction in the marginal rate of tax.","asker":"1178","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":289,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107, 129, 159, 160 and 161 together.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, estimated by reference to 2014 incomes, around 856,000 (39%) income earners are exempt from income tax:<\/p><p>- 75,700 self-employed income earners are exempt from Income Tax, this represents 35% of self-employed income earners and 3% of all income earners.<\/p><p>- 780,300 PAYE income earners are exempt from Income Tax, this represents 40% of PAYE income earners and 36% of all income earners. <\/p><p>It should be noted that this analysis focuses on Income Tax, some taxpayers exempt from Income Tax may be paying Universal Social Charge (USC).

However, removal of the marker from rebated fuel represents a significant threat to the exchequer and therefore Revenue has made action against this illegal activity one of its priorities and is implementing a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem through enhanced supply chain controls, the acquisition of a more effective fuel marker and continued robust enforcement action. <\/p><p>  Supply chain controls have been enhanced progressively since 2011 with the objective of reducing the capacity of criminals to source marked diesel for laundering or to get laundered fuel onto the market. The supply chain controls introduced include new licensing conditions for all fuel traders and the introduction from January 2013 of a requirement that all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, make detailed monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions. Revenue is using this data to identify suspicious transactions and patterns of distribution for investigation. Revenue has also intensified its targeting, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, of enforcement action against suspected fuel laundering operations. <\/p><p>  To support further the integrity of the distribution system and minimise the risk of fraud, I introduced a provision in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 that will make a supplier who is reckless in supplying rebated fuel for a use connected with excise fraud liable for the duty at the standard rate of tax. This new provision will strengthen Revenue's hand in dealing with those traders supplying rebated fuel recklessly to dubious customers and will provide a further disincentive to such activity. Revenue has published guidelines for mineral oil traders which will assist them in identifying and avoiding such transactions.<\/p><p>  Revenue works very closely with fuel sector representative bodies in tackling the problem and they have been very supportive of the measures introduced to combat fuel laundering. \u00a0The evidence available to Revenue, in terms of feedback from the legitimate trade and increased consumption of road diesel, indicates that this strategy has been very effective. <\/p><p>  In addition to the measures implemented to date, Revenue and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the UK completed an Invitation to Make Submissions process to identify a new fuel marker and it is expected that a new marker will be introduced in both jurisdictions early in 2015, following consultation with the oil industry and other stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD04100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Cost","counter":302,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD04150"},{"type":"question","counter":303,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[32458\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the annual cost to the Exchequer in each year from 2010 to 2014 of subsidised agricultural diesel; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":304,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[32466\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD04300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the approximate number of litres of agricultural diesel which qualified for tax relief, sold in the State in each of the past three years; the approximate number of litres of fully duty paid auto diesel and petrol sold in the state in the same period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":305,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 117 together.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there are no separate statistics available in respect of Marked Gas Oil (MGO) used for agricultural purposes.

There is no debt implications as they did not require borrowing. <\/p><p>(2) The promissory notes to IBRC and EBS added &euro;30.85 billion to the general government debt, but not the national debt, in 2010. There was an interest holiday on the IBRC promissory note repayments in 2011 and 2012 and thus zero interest was payable for these years. In 2013 promissory note interest\u00a0of &euro;214 million was payable up\u00a0to the date of IBRC's liquidation. General government interest is also payable on the EBS promissory note for all years with an average of &euro;12 million payable between 2012 and 2014. Under the terms of the promissory note an annual payment &euro;3.085 billion was to be made to the beneficiary banks. This payment was made in cash in 2011, and the IBRC element\u00a0(&euro;3.06 billion) was\u00a0paid by way of a government bond in 2012. Both these payments impacted the national debt and incurred general government interest costs of approximately &euro;0.3 billion in each of the years 2012 to 2014.\u00a0\u00a0The IBRC promissory notes were cancelled and replaced with a portfolio of eight floating rate Government bonds for a total amount of &euro;25 billion. The bonds pay interest every six months (June and December) based on the six month Euribor interest rate plus an interest margin. The margin averages 2.63% across the eight issues. This gave rise to payments of &euro;0.65 billion in 2013 and an estimated &euro;0.8 billion in 2014. The Deputy should note that these payments contribute significantly to the surplus income of the Central Bank, up to 80% of which is paid to the Central Fund in the following year.\u00a0<\/p><p>(3) By the end of 2013, &euro;10 billion (net of the sale of Bank of Ireland equity in 2011, the sale of Irish Life and the sale of contingent capital notes in 2013) is estimated to have been paid through direct payments from the Exchequer account to the banking sector. Although no specific borrowing was made in the cases of interventions paid through the Exchequer, the impact can be estimated using the average rate of interest on government debt.<\/p><p>The average rate of interest on general government debt for 2013 is given as 4% in my Department's Stability Programme Update, 2014 published last month. Using this interest rate to estimate the impact of injections into the banking sector from the Exchequer account gives estimated interest costs of &euro;0.45 billion\u00a0in 2012, &euro;0.5 billion in 2013 and &euro;0.4 billion in 2014.<\/p><p>This figure excludes fees paid to the Minister under the Credit Institutions Financial Support and Eligible Liabilities Guarantee schemes amounting to &euro;4.4 billion from 2008 to 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD05200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":318,"content":"<p>Question No. 117 answered with Question No. 112.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Government Deficit","counter":319,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD05350"},{"type":"question","counter":320,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[32467\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD05400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his estimate of the current structural deficit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":321,"content":"<p>My Department's latest estimates of the structural deficit were outlined in the April 2014 Stability Programme Update. <\/p><p>  The structural deficit is the underlying deficit that would occur in the absence of temporary factors and the impact of the economic cycle\u00a0on the\u00a0budget balance. The\u00a0estimated structural budget deficit\u00a0in 2013 was\u00a06.2 per cent of GDP, which\u00a0was projected to fall to 4.7 per cent in 2014. The 2014\u00a0estimate comprised\u00a0the headline general government deficit of -4.8 per cent\u00a0of GDP, less temporary measures amounting to 0.2 per cent\u00a0of GDP. To arrive at the structural balance from this, the\u00a0component of the deficit which related to the position on the economic cycle - the cyclical component -\u00a0was removed. This component amounts to 0.3 per cent\u00a0of GDP. This\u00a0cyclical budgetary\u00a0component is derived as a function of the output gap.

Retail credit firms are a regulated category of entities which are authorised to provide credit (in the form of cash loans) directly to individuals. Some firms authorised in this category are mortgage lenders. Retail credit firms have been subject to regulation by the Central Bank since 1 February 2008. A register of all Retail Credit Firms is available on the Central Bank website at the following link: <\/p><p>I am informed by the Central Bank that, at end-March 2014, six of these firms had a total of 17,789 primary dwelling (PDH) mortgage accounts of which 4,554 were classified as restructured; \u00a0four had a total of 739 buy to let (BTL) mortgage accounts of which 88 were classified as restructured.\u00a0 Regarding the level of outstanding debt on these accounts, there was a total of &euro;3.316bn in outstanding PDH debt and a further &euro;0.158bn in outstanding in BTL mortgage debt.\u00a0 Of that outstanding debt, mortgage accounts amounting to &euro;1.880bn (PDH) and &euro;0.083bn (BTL) respectively were in arrears of over 90 days.\u00a0 The Central Bank has advised that it does not publish the interest rates applied by regulated entities.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank's Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART)\u00a0announced in March 2013\u00a0set time bound and measurable targets for the 6 main banks requiring them to systematically address their arrears book.\u00a0\u00a0The Central Bank has informed me that retail credit firms are not subject to the prudential standards set out in the Central Bank's MART. However, the same consumer protection framework applies to retail credit lenders as to other regulated lenders including the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA). As such the Central Bank engages with these firms in relation to their treatment of borrowers under the mortgage arrears resolution process as provided for in the CCMA. In particular, the CCMA sets out requirements for all mortgage lenders, including retail credit firms, dealing with borrowers facing or in arrears on a mortgage secured on a primary home and provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their co-operating borrowers in mortgage difficulty.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The Central Bank has informed me that retail credit firms were also included in the scope of the Central Bank's recent review of the 'Implementation of the Revised CCMA' by mortgage lenders, the purpose of which was to ensure that mortgage lenders achieved full implementation of the requirements of the revised CCMA by end December 2013.<\/p><p>The Central Bank has advised that during 2012, non-bank lenders reported that 59 properties were repossessed following a court order, accounting for 24% of total properties repossessed following court orders. During 2013, non-bank lenders reported that 53 properties were repossessed following a court order, accounting for 15% of the total.\u00a0 In Quarter 1 of 2014, non-bank lenders reported that 9 properties were repossessed following a court order, accounting for 12% of total properties repossessed following court orders<\/p><p>The Central Bank continues to engage with all mortgage lenders, including retail credit firms, in relation to lenders' mortgage arrears resolution strategies and approaches to dealing with borrowers in or facing arrears.\u00a0 Early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders is key to resolving cases of mortgage difficulty.\u00a0 Where there is effective and meaningful engagement regarding a mortgage difficulty, the data shows that an increasing number of durable long term mortgage restructures is being put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD06200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services Regulation","counter":331,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD06250"},{"type":"question","counter":332,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[32470\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700044#WRD06300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of all investigations into the collapse of Custom House Capital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":333,"content":"<p>The Central Bank's investigation into Custom House Capital Ltd (in Liquidation) and persons concerned in its management has been on-going since the publication of the Final Report to the High Court by Court Appointed Inspectors dated 19 October 2011. <\/p><p>  Upon presentation of the Final Inspectors' Report on Custom House Capital Ltd (CHC) to the High Court in October 2011, Justice Hogan ordered that CHC be wound up immediately.\u00a0 It should be noted that copies of the Final Report have been provided to other relevant state authorities for their consideration i.e. the Minister for Justice and Equality, to the Director of Public Prosecutions, to the Director of Corporate Enforcement, to the Revenue Commissioners and to the Garda Commissioner.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  The Central Bank provides\u00a0regular updates on Custom House Capital on its website.\u00a0 Following consultation with An Garda Sioch&aacute;na, the Central Bank's investigation has been deferred pending completion of investigations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>  In order to enhance the\u00a0investor protection legislative framework, the Central Bank has been provided with extensive new powers since the onset of the financial crises\u00a0to prevent the loss of client assets as occurred in the case of Custom House Capital.

 To implement targeted personal injury and property damage risk work programmes to mitigate litigation risk, in State Authorities and Health Care Enterprises, in order to reduce the costs of future litigation against the State. <\/p><p>  Since its inception in 2001, the SCA has been to the forefront of the State's response to a number of threatened incipient mass actions such as asbestos &quot;worried well&quot;, sexual abuse, organ retention and orthopaedic implants categories of cases.\u00a0 As a result of securing early, precedent, decisions in the High and Supreme Courts, the SCA has prevented the proliferation of mass action claims against the State.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  In addition, in its day-to-day activities defending clinical negligence and non-clinical negligence cases, the SCA continues to make significant savings for the State.\u00a0 In\u00a02012, an independent actuarial assessment projected that &euro;127. 5 million would be required in that year to cover both the cost of resolving clinical claims and managing ongoing active claims.\u00a0 The net cost, taking account of successful recoveries from third parties, was &euro;84\u00a0million   a saving of 34%.\u00a0 Similarly, in 2013, an independent actuarial assessment projected that &euro;154 million would be required to cover the cost of resolving clinical claims and managing ongoing active claims.\u00a0 The eventual outturn was &euro;119.7 million   a saving of &euro;34.3 million or 22%.<\/p><p>  In 2012, the Government decided to establish a Legal Costs Unit (LCU) within the State Claims Agency to deal with third-party costs arising from certain Tribunals of Inquiry. <\/p><p>  Approximately 220 cost orders have been made in the Mahon Tribunal.\u00a0 The LCU received 104 costs claims to end of May 2014 seeking a total\u00a0of &euro;8.53 million.\u00a0 Seventy-three of these claims,\u00a0seeking &euro;3.53 million, have been negotiated and settled at &euro;1.96 million without the necessity for taxation, representing a saving of approximately 44%. <\/p><p>  A further 125 cost orders have been made in respect of the Moriarty Tribunal.\u00a0 The LCU received 27 costs claims to the end of May 2014\u00a0seeking a total\u00a0of &euro;8.55 million.\u00a0 Twenty-four of these claims,\u00a0seeking &euro;2.86 million, have been negotiated and settled at &euro;1.41 million without the necessity for taxation, representing a saving of approximately 50%.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  In relation to legal costs, concerning the State Claims Agency and its portfolios of claims, the Agency in an initiative designed to reduce barristers' fees invited barristers to tender competitively for their services in 2012.\u00a0 This tender competition followed the success of a similar initiative by the SCA in 2011 which reduced the costs of fees paid to solicitors by some 25%.\u00a0 The new barristers' panels were put in place in January 2013 and are expected to yield legal costs savings in excess of 25% on an annual basis. <\/p><p>  Finally, the SCA vigorously pursues all available money recoveries in accordance with best claim practices and as permitted by law.\u00a0 One such example is the recovery of monies by means of third party\/co-defendant contributions.\u00a0 Whether by adjudication of the court or agreement with the third party\/co-defendant, a specified percentage contribution in relation to a particular claim may be paid by the third party\/co-defendant to the SCA.\u00a0 Additionally, in certain cases, an indemnity in full may be received from a third party\/co-defendant.\u00a0 The SCA succeeded in recovering &euro;15.2 million in the calendar year 2011, &euro;3.9 million in 2012 and &euro;1.7 million in 2013. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700045#WRE02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":381,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700045#WRE02550"},{"type":"question","counter":382,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[32489\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700045#WRE02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total amount raised from stamp duty on residential property and separately from commercial property in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":383,"content":"<p> I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the yield in 2013 from Stamp Duty on residential property sales was &euro;65.5 million and on non-residential property sales was &euro;86.9 million.

In the first instance a harmonised set of EU rules on capital requirements for credit institutions and investment firms\u00a0was agreed early last year. These rules apply to all 28 EU Member States and\u00a0were transposed into Irish law earlier this year.\u00a0The rules set stronger prudential requirements for banks, requiring them to keep sufficient capital reserves and liquidity. They aim to\u00a0strengthen the effectiveness of the regulation of credit institutions and investment firms in the EU and enhance financial stability. A further objective is to contain the pro-cyclicality of the financial system which in turn will ensure a high level of protection for investors and depositors and will benefit of the operators in these markets. <\/p><p>  These rules are an important part of the Single Rulebook which is the foundation of the banking union. The Single Rulebook consists of a set of legislative texts which all financial institutions in the EU must comply with. The Single Rulebook also contains improved rules on depositor protection and rules for managing failing banks.<\/p><p>  In addition to this Single Rulebook the Deputy will recall that further integration of the banking system was considered necessary for Member States within the currency union and on this basis Eurozone Member States\u00a0agreed to the creation of a banking union.\u00a0In a supervision context the banking union\u00a0will include a Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) which creates a new system of financial supervision comprising of the ECB and national supervisory authorities of the participating Member States. Under this new system of supervision the ECB will directly supervise significant credit institutions and will work closely with national supervisors to supervise other credit institutions under the general oversight of the ECB. <\/p><p>  With regard to implementation of this common system of supervision, the ECB will take over its supervisory responsibilities on 4 November of this year. I understand that ECB's preparations for this are well under way at this stage. Ms Danielle Nouy was appointed Chair of the Supervisory Board of the SSM in December 2013. Ms Sabine Lautenschlager was appointed Vice-Chair in February of this year and a further three appointments\u00a0to the Board were made in\u00a0March. The ECB recently confirmed that it has largely completed the establishment of the SSM governance structures. The Supervisory Board adopted its Rules of Procedure on 31 March 2014 and they entered into force on 1 April 2014. <\/p><p>  In relation to staffing of the SSM I understand this is proceeding and is taking place in a top-down fashion. The SSM has also confirmed\u00a0that preparatory work is well advanced in areas such as IT infrastructure, HR and legal services. <\/p><p>  In April of this year the ECB published its framework regulation which lays down the main procedures governing cooperation between the ECB and national supervisors. <\/p><p>  Furthermore, the Deputy will be aware that the ECB is performing a comprehensive assessment of the banks balance sheets, including an asset quality review and a stress test, prior to it assuming full responsibility under the SSM in November. I understand this process is on track and final results should be published by the\u00a0end of October. <\/p><p>  In summary the\u00a0process of putting in place a European system of banking supervision is well underway. It\u00a0is expected that the momentum behind\u00a0this project\u00a0will continue at a steady pace over the next few months with a view to the SSM being fully operational by November of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700046#WRF01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":456,"content":"<p>Question No. 169 answered with Question No. 74.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":457,"content":"<p>Question No. 170 answered with Question No. 128.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Remuneration","counter":458,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700046#WRF01750"},{"type":"question","counter":459,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[32679\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700046#WRF01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the implementation of the Mercer report in relation to remuneration at the State supported banks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":460,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware the Review of Remuneration Practices &amp;amp; Frameworks at the Covered Institutions (the \"Mercer Report\") was published by my Department on 12th\u00a0March 2013.

Instead, the regime addresses the problem of pension overfunding and excessive pension accrual by imposing a much higher effective tax charge on the value of retirement benefits above set limits when they are drawn down, thus discouraging the building up through contributions of large pension funds in the first place or the unwinding of the tax advantage of such overfunding excessive pension accrual by way of the higher effective tax charge.<\/p><p>  The yield from the changes made to the SFT regime is estimated at &euro;120 million in 2014 and in a full year and is expected to arise in two main ways: firstly, from the cessation of tax-relieved contributions to pension saving from those employees and individuals in the private sector affected in the short to medium term by the changes and, secondly, by the conversion, to some degree, of employer pension contributions and pension promises in respect of those employed individuals into compensatory current taxable remuneration. In addition, some of the yield will also arise from affected individuals who remain in pension arrangements and continue to contribute to them or accrue benefits under them, and will take the form of chargeable excess tax payable at retirement where their SFT or Personal Fund Threshold (PFT), as appropriate, is exceeded. This increased tax will effectively claw back any tax subsidy which helped fund the excess over the SFT or PFT.<\/p><p>  These savings and additional tax revenues would mainly impact on the yield from income tax but it would not be possible (except through the imposition of significant additional administrative burden and cost on employers and pension administrators) to separately identify the total yield from the changes to the SFT regime from the general income tax yield. The Deputy will be aware that the yield from income tax in the first half of 2014 is marginally ahead of target for the period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700046#WRF02700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Yield","counter":473,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700046#WRF02750"},{"type":"question","counter":474,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[32684\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700046#WRF02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will set out for each local authority area the loss of revenue based on 2014 data that would arise in respect of the local property tax if the maximum allowable variation is applied in each area in 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":475,"content":"<p>In accordance with section 20 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) elected members of a local authority are required to pass a formal resolution in order to vary the basic rate of Local Property Tax (LPT) in respect of residential properties situated within their functional area. \u00a0Both the 0.18% and 0.25% LPT rates, which must be changed at the same time and by the same factor, can be increased or decreased by up to 15%.

Building on the commitments of the Programme for Government and the Medium Term Economic Strategy, the following\u00a0key priorities\u00a0were set out:<\/p><p>- Strengthening the Domestic Economy and Prioritising New Jobs for the Unemploye<\/p><p>- Delivering Better Living and Working Standards<\/p><p>- Improving Housing Availability and Affordability<\/p><p>- Responsible and Sustainable Management of the Public Finances<\/p><p>- Rebuilding Trust in Politics and Public Institutions<\/p><p>- Protecting and Enhancing Peace in Northern Ireland<\/p><p><b>1.   Strengthening the Domestic Economy and Prioritising New Jobs for the Unemployed<\/b><\/p><p>In relation to the first priority, some of the specific actions relevant to my Department include:<\/p><p>- Enacting legislation to establish the Strategic Banking Corporation. By 2018 this will make up to &euro;4 billion in low-cost funding available to small and medium-sized businesses.<\/p><p>- Enacting legislation to establish the &euro;6 billion Irish Strategic Investment Fund to make commercial investments in Irish enterprise and infrastructure.<\/p><p>- Using the same legislation to establish NewERA on a statutory footing to support higher investment levels and better returns from our commercial semi-states.<\/p><p>- Continuing to support the development of Dublin as an international city region that will have positive economic benefits for the entire country.<\/p><p>As well as these specific actions, my Department will continue to examine the use of its policy levers to assist sectoral economic growth as reflected in policies already introduced to support tourism, agriculture, SMEs etc. My Department will also play a leadership role in developing the Construction 2020 Strategy and actively engaging with the Retail Consultation Forum.<\/p><p><b>2. Delivering Better Living and Working Standards<\/b><\/p><p>Consistent with the measures to be taken to create more jobs and reduce unemployment, Government has committed to delivering a new deal on living standards to ensure that the economic recovery is felt by low- and middle-income working families. Through the budgetary process, I will work with my Ministerial colleague, Brendan Howlin TD to:<\/p><p>- Introduce measures to assist low-income families by improving the system of child income supports such that those moving from welfare to work will retain payments for children to ensure that people are better off in work.<\/p><p>- Increase access to subsidised childcare and afterschool places by extending eligibility and rebalancing parental contributions for families making their way into employment.<\/p><p>- Announce a tax reform plan to be delivered over a number of budgets to reduce the 52% tax rate on low- and middle-income earners in a manner that maintains the highly progressive nature of the Irish tax system.<\/p><p>- Increase the Household Benefits Package by &euro;100, in part to compensate older people and other vulnerable groups for the introduction of water charges.\u00a0<\/p><p>My Department will also assist in completing, by end-2014, a review of the implementation of the Central Bank's mortgage arrears targets set for the banks and the operation of the Insolvency Service to ensure that both bodies have the powers needed to support families willing to work their way through their debt problems.<\/p><p><b>3. Improving Housing Availability &amp;amp; Affordability <\/b><\/p><p>My Government colleagues and I recognise that adequate supply of housing for all sectors is fundamental to a healthy society and a vibrant economy. The Department of Finance is playing a leading role in implementing the Construction 2020 strategy. A key policy objective is to ensure that home ownership remains an attainable ambition for young families. My Department will be centrally involved in:<\/p><p>- Assessing the merits of a new 'Help to Build' funding schemes for the development of affordable housing in the private sector, and the merits of a new &quot;New Buy&quot; scheme to ensure availability of adequate, affordable mortgage finance for first-time buyers when new housing output comes on-stream in advance of Budget 2015.<\/p><p>- Working with national and European competition authorities to encourage and support new mortgage lenders into the market in order to put downward pressure on interest rates for variable rate mortgage customers, both new and existing.<\/p><p>- Liaising with NAMA to ensure the timely and coherent delivery of a successful Strategic Development Zone to maximise the delivery of residential housing units, as well as to deliver commercial space in Dublin's Central Business District.<\/p><p>- Sourcing significant new sources of finance from, e.g. the EIB, ISIF, pension funds and the private market\u00a0to assist the Social Housing Strategy.<\/p><p><b>4. Responsible and Sustainable Management of the Public Finances<\/b><\/p><p>A central pillar of Government strategy since it took office is to return the public finances to a sustainable position and introduce safeguards that will ensure past mistakes are not repeated. In this respect:<\/p><p>- Our Medium Term Economic Strategy commits us in the first instance to cutting the deficit to 3% of GDP by 2015.<\/p><p>- The state's investment in Bank of Ireland shows that the careful management and disposal of our bank holdings can result in good returns for the taxpayer. The Government will continue to work through diplomatic channels to build international support for measures that will reduce Ireland's debt. The disposal of the remaining bank assets will reduce this sector's contribution to the State's excessive debt levels.<\/p><p>- NAMA was an agency born out of the banking crisis and the Government is determined to ensure it concludes its work as quickly as possible. The ongoing review of NAMA strategy will be published in the coming weeks and it will support an accelerated disposal strategy that will mean at least 80% of the assets will be disposed of by end 2016.<\/p><p>- As Europe emerges from the financial crisis, the Union must focus on issues that will make a real difference to the daily lives of its citizens. The Government remains committed to ensuring that the European Union prioritises the key themes which were central to Ireland's presidency   Jobs, Stability and Growth. Both government parties will work through their membership of the largest European political families   the EPP and PES   to ensure that growth and job creation are at the heart of EU's agenda. I will further this agenda through Eurogroup and ECOFIN and its\u00a0relevant agencies. My Department plays a very significant role in representing Ireland at European and International institutions and we intend to use all of our interactions to ensure these institutions are focused on increasing global economic growth.\u00a0 <\/p><p><b>5. Rebuilding Trust in Politics &amp;amp; Public Institutions <\/b><\/p><p>In relation to rebuilding trust in politics and public institutions, greater transparency in budgetary policy through the publication of the Medium Term Budgetary Framework along with the independent oversight of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council reinforces the integrity of the budgetary process. Enhanced engagement with the Oireachtas at Ministerial and official level also illustrates my Department's commitment to rebuilding trust in public institutions. For example, I now engage with the Oireachtas Committee on a quarterly basis ahead of ECOFIN to assess Ireland's views on European policy.Over the remaining term of this Government, my Department will continue to further this agenda through:<\/p><p>- Legislating to give NewERA, which manages the State's shareholder function in relation to commercial semi-state companies, the responsibility to provide advice to the relevant Minister on appointments to the semi-state boards.<\/p><p>- Assisting in systemically publishing details of all appointments to State Boards by providing details of appointments to boards under the aegis of the Department of Finance.<\/p><p>- Facilitating the retention by local authorities of 80% of the proceeds of  the local property tax from 2015, with the option to vary the rate by up to 15%. This will be done in a manner that ensures that no local authority will be worse off as a result of the funding reforms, and that some local authority areas where property values and property tax bills are higher than average will be better off. It will be up to the new councils to decide whether to use any surplus funds to cut the rate of property tax or to fund additional services.\u00a0<\/p><p>To conclude, we have achieved a great deal over the past 3 years but we must not become complacent. We will continue to place job creation and economic growth at the heart of all our economic policies. As we return to more normal times the Statement of Priorities, that builds on the programme for Government and the Medium term Economic Strategy (as a blueprint to sustain a competitive economy that can pay its own way, serve society, and that can survive and thrive in a reformed Eurozone and an increasingly globalised international economy) offers a roadmap on how we intend to help working families and low and middle income workers. My Department remains fully committed to delivering on these priorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700047#WRG00800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners Investigations","counter":520,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700047#WRG00850"},{"type":"question","counter":521,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[32806\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700047#WRG00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will arrange for a response to be issued by the Revenue Commissioners to a person (details supplied) in County Cork","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":522,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Revenue has been in on- going correspondence with the taxpayer both directly and through parliamentary questions and representations by various deputies.\u00a0 The current situation is that the taxpayer has refused offers made in June 2014 to meet with Revenue officials to discuss his issues.\u00a0 He has however accepted the offer of a local review of one issue, to be carried out by a senior Revenue official.<\/p><p>The taxpayer's latest letters addressed to the Assistant Secretary South West Region, both dated 11<sup>th<\/sup>June 2014, have been replied to on 15<sup>th<\/sup>July 2014.

This may include an interest only or other temporary solution for a period if it is likely that full repayment of the original or revised principal will be achieved over time, or where there is a payment plan to return the account to sustainability through the clearance of arrears.<\/p><p>A personal insolvency arrangement effected under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012; or<\/p><p>If an arrangement could not be reached or is not appropriate, that the PDH and BTL property securing the loan has been voluntarily sold or, failing that, any situation where a Specified Credit Institution takes possession of the property including by way of voluntary agreement with the borrower or by Court Order or otherwise&quot;.<\/p><p>The Central Bank has informed me that a range of sustainable solutions have been utilised by each of the lenders to date. These include but are not limited to the following:<\/p><p>- Term Extensions<\/p><p>- Split Mortgages<\/p><p>- Permanent Interest Rate Reductions<\/p><p>- Voluntary Solutions<\/p><p>The Central Bank has advised that each sustainable solution impacts the outstanding loan balance and arrears in different ways. For example, an arrears capitalisation involves adding the outstanding arrears to the loan balance which is then repaid over the duration of the loan term whereas a split mortgage involves splitting the loan balance (including the arrears) into affordable and warehoused portions.\u00a0Additionally, the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) sets out requirements for mortgage lenders dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears. The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.\u00a0 The CCMA sets out how mortgage lenders must treat borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears, with due regard to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The CCMA sets out a list of options for alternative repayment arrangements that may be offered by lenders. Provision 39 of the CCMA requires lenders to explore all of the options for alternative repayment arrangements offered by that lender.\u00a0\u00a0Under the CCMA, where an alternative repayment arrangement is offered by a lender, the lender must provide the borrower with a clear explanation, on paper or another durable medium, of how the alternative repayment arrangement works, including:<\/p><p>a) the reasons why the alternative repayment arrangement(s) offered is considered to be appropriate and sustainable for the borrower as documented by the lender in compliance with Provision 40 of the CCMA, including demonstrating, by reference to the borrower's individual circumstances, the advantages of the offer for the borrower and explaining any disadvantages; <\/p><p>b)\u00a0the new mortgage repayment amount; <\/p><p>c) the term of the alternative repayment arrangement; <\/p><p>d) the implications arising from the alternative repayment arrangement for the existing mortgage including the impact on: <\/p><p>the mortgage term, <\/p><p>the balance outstanding on the mortgage loan account, and <\/p><p>the existing arrears on the account, if any; <\/p><p>e) a statement that the alternative repayment arrangement may impact on the borrower's mortgage protection cover; <\/p><p>f) the frequency with which the alternative repayment arrangement will be reviewed in line with Provision 43, the reason(s) for the reviews and the potential outcome of the reviews, where: <\/p><p>circumstances improve, <\/p><p>circumstances disimprove, and <\/p><p>circumstances remain the same; <\/p><p>g) details of any residual mortgage debt remaining at the end of an alternative repayment arrangement and owed by the borrower; <\/p><p>h) how interest will be applied to the mortgage loan account as a result of the alternative repayment arrangement; <\/p><p>i) how the alternative repayment arrangement will be reported by the lender to the Irish Credit Bureau or any other credit reference agency or credit register and the anticipated impact of this on the borrower's credit rating;

They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape.  As part of the Budget 2012 decisions, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools is being gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014.  In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement.  The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible.  If amalgamations do take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by the Department.<\/p><p>How best to sustain provision for widely dispersed and small Protestant communities does present as a particular challenge especially in any locality where enrolment in their schools is declining to single figures and amalgamation is not an option because there is no other school nearby.  The Government is intent in fostering pluralism in school provision.  Supporting minority churches in maintaining their schools is part of that policy.<\/p><p>Our current configuration of small primary schools has been examined by the Department in a value for money (VFM) review.

Both teaching and non-teaching staff allocations are approved on an ETB basis and it is a matter for each ETB to distribute the staffing allocations concerned within its scheme. <\/p><p>The non-pay grant (standard expenditure) to each ETB is determined having regard to pupil enrolment variations, certain other costs, an estimate of the ETB's receipts (mainly receipts from night classes) and the amount available for distribution.  The grant is to meet costs associated with the ETB's administrative offices, certain other administrative costs and costs associated directly with schools. ETBs are given a high level of autonomy in the management and appropriation of the grant in respect of standard expenditure, and each ETB is allowed to distribute the grant in line with its priorities and perceptions of need. The non-pay grant also includes provision for, inter alia, the schools services support fund (SSSF), DEIS schools, the book grant, programme grants (e.g. transition year programme) and special class grants (known collectively as associated expenditure). Associated expenditure grants are determined on a per capita basis.<\/p><p>The total pay grant in 2014 amounts to some &euro;710m. Of this, the Department's allocation for teacher pay is &euro;572m approximately, for SNA pay is &euro;25m, for administrative pay is &euro;47m approximately and some &euro;24m for maintenance pay. Pay costs across all headings are also funded by receipts retained by the ETBs of &euro;41m, comprised principally of retained superannuation contributions.<\/p><p>The total non-pay grant in 2014 amounts to some &euro;69m.

The clear measure on which the delivery of the Haddington Road Agreement must be judged, therefore, is the impact that the various measures have on the overall Public Service Exchequer Pay and Pensions Bill, while facilitating the maintenance and provision of necessary public services in a period of intense resource constraint.<\/p><p>It is clear that the Agreement has facilitated, and will continue to facilitate, significant reductions in the Public Service Exchequer Pay and Pensions Bill. This is evident from the fact that the net Public Service Exchequer Pay Bill reduced by &euro;210 million in 2013. This reduction was enabled, in large part, by the implementation of various measures in the first 6 months of the Haddington Road Agreement. The underlying savings have also allowed some recruitment to frontline services, particularly in the Health and Education Sector. More generally, it should be noted that the Public Service Exchequer Pay Bill will have been reduced by 22% from &euro;17.5 billion gross in 2009 to an estimated &euro;14.6 billion gross, or &euro;13.6 billion net, by the end of 2014.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The savings arising from the implementation of various measures in the Agreement are incorporated in advance in the context of the Estimates process each year. It is then the responsibility of Public Service Management and each Department's Accounting Officer to deliver the required level of savings through complete implementation of the various reforms and workplace changes which the Agreement enables to ensure that their respective Pay Bill targets are met.\u00a0<\/p><p>In 2013, the total amount of allocated savings arising from the implementation of measures under the Agreement was almost &euro;300 million. Of this total, approximately &euro;251 million was allocated to Exchequer pay savings with further savings of &euro;46 million arising from pensions and a number of other non-Exchequer sources (e.g. Local Authorities, Central Bank).\u00a0<\/p><p>In 2014, a further &euro;465 million in savings arising from the implementation of measures under the Agreement was incorporated into the budgetary arithmetic. This reflects the full year impact of various measures implemented in 2013, as well as measures which are to be implemented in 2014, such as the deferral of incremental progression.\u00a0 This brings the total amount of savings allocated to date under the Agreement to &euro;762 million.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Specifically, the pay reduction to those earning over &euro;65,000, will deliver approximately &euro;210 million of the targeted &euro;1 billion in savings over the lifetime of the Agreement. Other central measures, including pension reductions and increment pauses, will deliver in the order of &euro;130 million, bringing the total amount of savings from central measures to over &euro;340 million by 2016.<\/p><p><b>Summary of savings from Central measures <\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th><\/th><th>Full year<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Reduction in higher pay<\/td><td>&euro;210 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Increment deferrals<\/td><td>&euro;60 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Other measures - including pensions<\/td><td>&euro;72 million<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>&euro;342 milllion<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><br \/>With approximately two years remaining in the lifetime of the Agreement, over 75% (&euro;762 million) of the &euro;1 billion reduction targeted has been incorporated into the relevant Votes.

The plan will be based on a comprehensive study of Ireland's public investment priorities over that period. <\/td><td>Completed <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>In the initial years, when resources will be most heavily constrained, we will prioritise investment in school building, non-national roads, healthcare, and in job-creation. <\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will insist that major capital projects are subjected to proper cost-benefit analysis and evaluation, improving future productivity and growth prospects, and that the value-for-money obtained is significantly enhanced compared to the most recent period. <\/td><td>Completed <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The new NDP will be based on traditional exchequer capital spending, plus other resources to be invested from the National Pension Reserve Fund, on the basis of obtaining a return on investment and that does not impact the Government Balance Sheet. <\/td><td>In Progress <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>In developing the new NDP, we will re-examine the investment programmes of the semi-state companies to ensure that they are in line with new economic circumstances. <\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>In order to ensure that public enterprise plays a full role in Ireland's economic recovery, we will create a holding company to manage the state's holdings of the semi-states, and to co-ordinate investment in key priority areas identified by the Government, including energy, water and forestry. <\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Over time, we also propose to finance the investment programme from the sale of certain state assets. We will target up to &euro;2 billion in sales of non-strategic state assets drawing from the recommendations of the McCarthy Review Group on State Assets when available. Assets will only be sold when market conditions are right and when adequate regulatory structures have been established to protect consumer interests. <\/td><td>In Progress<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Re-prioritise capital funding for smaller projects that deal with specific immediate problems. Smaller projects are more labour intensive and more likely to be carried out by local contractors increasing short-run domestic economic impact. Investment priorities will include education, health and science and technology.<\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Conduct a Comprehensive Spending Review to examine all areas of public spending and to assess effectiveness of spending programmes and value for company.<\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Accelerate capital works that are 'shovel ready' and labour intensive including schools and secondary roads.<\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will reform public procurement to become a tool to support innovative Irish firms and to allow greater access to Irish small and medium sized businesses. <\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will introduce new legislation to protect all small building subcontractors that have been denied payments from bigger companies. <\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A referendum to amend the Constitution to reverse the effects of the Abbeylara judgement to enable Oireachtas committees to carry out full investigations.<\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A referendum to protect the right of citizens to communicate in confidence with public representatives.<\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>All appointments at Principal Officer level and above will be open to external competition and at least one-third of such appointments will be reserved for candidates from outside traditional civil service structures for a 5-year period. <\/td><td>In Progress<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Pin down accountability for results at every level of the public service   from Ministers down   with clear consequences for success and failure. Ministers will be responsible for policy and procurement and public service managers for delivery.<\/td><td>In Progress<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Where appropriate, agency boards will be scrapped and agency managers will report directly to Ministers and their Departments on performance against targets. <\/td><td>Action Required<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Put in place a Whistleblowers Act to protect public servants that expose maladministration by Ministers or others.<br \/><br \/>Restore Freedom of Information. <\/td><td>Completed<br \/><br \/>In Progress<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>There will be no more &quot;golden handshakes&quot; for public servants that have failed to deliver. <\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Overhaul TLAC (Top level Appointments Commission), with the chairperson and the majority of members drawn from outside the public sector. <\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Introduce a reformed incentive system for all grades within core Government departments to reward cross-departmental teams that deliver audited improvements in service delivery and cost effectiveness. <\/td><td>Action required<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Go beyond the recommendations of An Bord Snip to rationalise core processes that are duplicated across the public service, by establishing shared back-office operations for information technology, human resource management, payments and entitlement applications, business inspections and procurement. <\/td><td>In Progress<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Review the Local Government Efficiency Review as part of our Comprehensive Spending Review.<\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Make substantial cuts to the number of State bodies and companies.<\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Instigate a Government-wide review to identify and eliminate non-priority programmes and outsource, where appropriate, non-critical functions. <\/td><td>In Progress<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Rather than giving fixed budgets to traditional public service providers like the HSE, VECs and F&Aacute;S, we will put resources into the hands of citizens to acquire services that are tailored to better suit their needs and less expensive for the taxpayer.<\/td><td>In Progress<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Establish a new model of financing social interventions   called Social Impact Bonds   that share audited exchequer savings with charitable and voluntary organisations.<\/td><td>In Progress<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Where appropriate we will open up the delivery of public services to a range of providers. <\/td><td>In Progress\/ Ongoing Implementation<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will give schools, hospitals and other public service bodies new freedoms   within strict budgets and new accountability systems   to set their own staffing needs, automate routine processes and adapt work practices to local staff and customer needs. <\/td><td>In Progress<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will legislate for a reformulated code of laws, replacing both the Ministers and Secretaries Acts and the Public Service Management Act, which will spell out the legal relationship between Ministers and their civil servants and their legal accountability for decisions and for management of Departments.<\/td><td>In Progress <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The system of implied general delegation of a Minister's statutory powers to civil servants will be abolished and replaced by a fixed and determined system of delegation of specified powers to specified officers. <\/td><td>In Progress <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Where a responsibility is delegated through several civil service grades, each grade will be held accountable for their element of it and departmental officials giving evidence to Oireachtas committees will be obliged to speak on their own behalf for their delegated responsibilities and, where appropriate, defend themselves and their actions. <\/td><td>In Progress <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Delegation orders will spell out the functions of the Minister in supervising the exercise of delegated powers: the Minister will be responsible for ensuring that adequate standards are maintained; outputs are delivered as determined or agreed; and procedures are in place to provide the Minister with the necessary and correct information to enable him or her to respond to problems of administration and to give an account of those problems, and of any necessary corrective action, to the D&aacute;il and to the public.<\/td><td>In Progress <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will bring to an end the unacceptable executive practice where no record is kept of ministerial involvement with an issue and resulting decisions.<\/td><td>In Progress<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will review the grading structure of the civil service and public service and reduce number of management grades.Public service managers will be given greater autonomy in deciding how they use staffing budgets and resources to achieve agreed outcomes. <\/td><td>In Progress<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will remove barriers to mobility across the public service. As part of this we will create a new tier of senior public service management structures, where senior officials are rotated across the public sector to nurture the collaborative culture needed to tackle the biggest cross-cutting social and economic challenges. <\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>High level strategic goals will be reflected in individual goals, in a new performance management and development system for staff. Staff recognition schemes will be developed and devolved, with particular emphasis on team awards. Staff will be encouraged to put forward suggestions for improving service delivery and organisation efficiency and effectiveness. <\/td><td>In Progress<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Government services websites, public offices, telephone services, and helplines will be reconfigured to facilitate access to a broad range of government services through a single point of contact. <\/td><td>In Progress<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ministers' salaries will be reduced, political expenses vouched for and severance payments for ministers axed.<\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>No political pensions will be paid to sitting TDs and in future no retired politician will get a political pension until the national retirement age. Politics must be about service to the public, not financial gain for politicians.<\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Amend the Constitution to Give D&aacute;il committees Full Powers of Investigation: The Abbeylara Supreme Court decision currently limits the ability of D&aacute;il committees to hold investigations into crucial issues of public concern, such as the banking crisis.<\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A statutory duty on anybody established by or under statute, or with a majority ownership or funding by the State, to submit to the same parliamentary questions regime as applies to Government departments. This will involve a liability to provide answers to written questions within a specified number of D&aacute;il sitting days. (We will however recognise the special position of bodies with a commercial mandate operating at arm's length from Government). <\/td><td>In Progress<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will amend the rules to ensure that no senior public servant (including political appointees) or Minister can work in the private sector in any area involving a potential conflict of interest with their former area of public employment, until at least two years have elapsed after they have left the public service.<\/td><td>In Progress <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Restrictions on the nature and extent of evidence by civil servants to Oireachtas committees will be scrapped and replaced with new guidelines for civil servants that reflect the reality of the authority delegated to them and their personal accountability for the way in which it is exercised.<\/td><td>In Progress <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The Committee would be the formal channel of consultation and collaboration between the Oireachtas and the Ombudsman, responsible for receiving and debating her annual and special reports and for ensuring that her criticisms and recommendations are acted upon. For that purpose, she would attend as a regular witness before the committee.<\/td><td>In Progress <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will legislate to restore the Freedom of Information Act to what it was before it was undermined by the outgoing Government, and we will extend its remit to other public bodies including the administrative side of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, subject to security exceptions<\/td><td>In Progress<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We intend to end the heavy dependence on a very limited pool of extremely expensive private solicitors firms providing legal services to the State and agencies, look at ways to require agencies to seek legal advice from the CSSO and not from the private sector in order to save costs, and ensure that legal work at the bar for the State is spread more equitably rather than confined to a very limited pool as at present. <\/td><td>In Progress<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will progress the Statute Law Revision Project in order to enhance public accessibility to the statute book.<\/td><td>In Progress\/Ongoing Implementation<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will extend Freedom of Information, and the Ombudsman Act, to ensure that all statutory bodies, and all bodies significantly funded from the public purse, are covered.<\/td><td>In Progress<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will introduce Whistleblowers legislation.<\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will introduce a statutory register of lobbyists, and rules concerning the practice of lobbying.<\/td><td>In Progress<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will abolish the additional pay for Ministers who leave office. We will restrict the payment of pensions to politicians so that in future a member can only qualify for a pension at the national retirement age (currently 65) and upon leaving public life. We will cap taxpayers' subsidies for all future pension schemes for politicians (and indeed for everybody) that deliver income in retirement of more than &euro;60,000.<\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will legislate and change D&aacute;il standing orders to ensure the absolute confidentiality of information entrusted to members of the D&aacute;il by their constituents or informants, and ensure that such information cannot be compulsorily disclosed through the legal process except with the consent of the informant.<\/td><td>Completed <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Every public body will set out clear and unambiguous long, medium and short term strategic priorities, which will be clearly communicated to public service and citizens. Strategic priorities will be translated into high level goals for all Departments, on a 'whole of government' basis, and in consultation with Ministers. <\/td><td>Completed <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Performance indicators will be identified to monitor progress on high level priorities. Annual reports of departments and agencies will include output statements and audited financial accounts prepared on generally accepted accounting principles. The performance information provided in output and outcome-focused measurement will feed into the decision making process for future plans at political and senior management level. <\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The reform process will provide for increased delegation of budgets, subject to detailed plans, relevant performance reporting and audited accounts compiled in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. <\/td><td>In Progress\/Ongoing Implementation<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Detailed business cases will be required for major projects, with review and reporting requirements built in to the plan. Sanctions will be imposed at an early stage for significant overruns. <\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will change the current emphasis on performance reporting to performance management. All medium to long-term projects that involve significant public spending will be subject to cost benefit analysis, and to on-going evaluation. The results of programme evaluations will be published and programmes not meeting their objectives will be wound down. <\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Performance and progress will be published in a new, audited annual Public Service Delivery Reports. Oireachtas Committees will expose any failure to hit milestones and targets. Each sectoral Committee will take on new powers, similar to those wielded by Public Accounts Committee, to hold Ministers and public servants to account for value for money. This will feed into Oireachtas consideration of the next Budget. <\/td><td>In Progress\/Ongoing Implementation <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Where appropriate, agency boards will be scrapped and agency managers will be accountable directly to Ministers.<\/td><td>Action Required <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will bring forward the annual Estimates cycle, so that it becomes more timely and relevant. It will in future start at the beginning of the preceding year and conclude by the summer. <\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The annual Estimates will in future distinguish between monies being allocated to maintaining the existing level of service for existing programmes and money to support new programmes or policy decisions.<\/td><td>Completed\/Ongoing Implementation<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The Book of Estimates will be accompanied by a detailed performance report on what the previous year's spending had achieved. It will also give details of the level of performance achieved by agencies under service delivery agreements with Government. <\/td><td>In Progress<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Oireachtas members will be given, from within existing resources, dedicated resources for the proper scrutiny of the Estimates. <\/td><td>In Progress<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will give the Comptroller and Auditor General the extra powers needed to carry out value-for-money audits of State programmes.<\/td><td>In Progress<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will publish cost-benefit analyses for major infrastructure proposals and &quot;tax expenditures&quot; in advance of Government approval. <\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Public sector bodies will be required to publish balance sheets and to move to accruals from cash-flow accounting. <\/td><td>In Progress<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Every Purchase Order by a Government Department or agency for more than &euro;20,000 will be published online. We will give the Comptroller and Auditor General and Oireachtas Committees the extra powers needed to carry out value-for-money audits of State programmes. <\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Public bodies will be required to openly compete for budget resources by publishing pre-budget spending requests, and what they would deliver in return for such allocations to help deliver Programme for Government. <\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will conduct a Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) to examine all areas of public spending, based on the Canadian model, and to develop multi-annual budget plans with a three-year time horizon. This plan will be presented to the D&aacute;il for debate. It will assess effectiveness in achieving desired outcomes, and value for money.<\/td><td>Completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The CSR will examine the number, range and activities of bodies funded significantly from public purse, including at local government level, and reduce numbers where appropriate. In future, when proposing a new agency, it will be necessary to prove that the proposed new functions cannot be carried out within the existing framework. <\/td><td>Completed <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will, subject to there being no compulsory redundancies and to the protection of front line services: Reduce the total number of public sector employees by between 18,000 and 21,000 by 2014, compared to the total number at the end of 2010.

To this end, the enterprise agencies and other relevant players have been tasked with working to enhance the competitiveness of manufacturing in Ireland by working with companies and implementing the recommendations in the strategy. That sector lost 50,000 jobs in the years up to 2010 but at the end of 2013, there were a total of 215,900 people directly employed in the sector, which was an increase of 10,000 on the numbers identified at the time the Strategy was published.  This sector also supports a similar number of jobs indirectly. <\/p><p>In order to progress the recommendations contained in the Forf&aacute;s Strategy, I established a Manufacturing Development Forum, comprising industry practitioners.  One of the key results from the work of the Forum is a <i>National Step Change<\/i>initiative aimed at strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s manufacturing base across all firms and sub sectors, redressing perceptions of the sector as a career choice and removing barriers to the competitiveness of the sector in Ireland.  <\/p><p>The Strategy does not identify specific locations around the country for the expansion of the sector.  However, a particularly attractive feature of manufacturing in Ireland is the fact that many of the present jobs are not in the main urban areas, but dispersed into regional locations, thereby providing a valuable employment focus in areas where alternative jobs are scarce. The further development of the sector will, of course, build on this key feature. <\/p><p>The<i>Action Plan for Jobs <\/i>contains a series of actions to develop the manufacturing sector including a commitment to develop a framework for a <i>Regional Enterprise Strategy<\/i>to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprises.  I intend that the framework will be developed on a pilot basis initially, focusing on the Midlands region, and involving the agencies under the remit of this Department &ndash; Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs). The objective is to enhance synergies between the agencies and their client companies and build on the competitive strengths of the region to maximise the potential for job creation.  <\/p><p>The work of the enterprise agencies already focuses on developing the manufacturing sector.  Enterprise Ireland runs many initiatives to help sustain existing jobs and to create new jobs in the Midlands and provides funding to the Institute of Technology in Athlone to build the research capabilities in the Region. Enterprise Ireland offers a suite of grants to companies to uplift their technological capacities, innovation and skills capabilities and export potential. The recently established LEOs are required to give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector which, over time, can develop into strong export entities and graduate to the Enterprise Ireland portfolio. <\/p><p>In addition, IDA Ireland positions the Midlands as having a strong cluster in Medical Technologies and Life Sciences with big names such as Abbott, Covidien and recently Jazz Pharmaceuticals in Monksland, outside Athlone and American Medical Systems in Athlone announcing significant investments in their manufacturing facilities.<\/p><p>I believe that the Forf&aacute;s Strategy actions and the agency activities outlined above will serve to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and help create good quality, sustainable jobs in manufacturing. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700050#WRK05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services Provision","counter":786,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700050#WRK05500"},{"type":"question","counter":787,"qnumday":305,"qnumall":"[32100\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700050#WRK05600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of jobs supported in Counties Longford-Westmeath by the competitive start up fund operated by Enterprise Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Reform Programme will also provide a more efficient and effective framework for dealing with complaints and disputes and for enforcement and compliance generally. Significant progress has also been achieved to date in so far as the legislative, technological, structural, administrative and staffing changes required are concerned to underpin the workplace relations reform programme. The Government, at its meeting on 8th July, 2014, approved the publication of the enabling legislation while a single contact portal, e-complaint facility, staffing and structures plan, workplace relations website, early resolution service, adjudicator training and recruitment plans and enhanced technologies and processes are already in place.<br \/><br \/><br \/>One of the Disruptive Reforms in the Action Plan for Jobs relates to the development of an Integrated Licensing Application System to help reduce the regulatory burden on the enterprise sector through the provision of a single portal for applying for, and renewing, a multiplicity of licences.  The new licensing system will be developed for the retail sector in the first instance and rolled out to other sectors of the economy thereafter.  A Request for Tender was issued through eTenders and in the EU Official Journal.  The tender evaluation process is ongoing.  Subject to the successful awarding of the services contract to an appointed provider, the System should be delivered in the Autumn 2014.<br \/><br \/><br \/>Another initiative to help reduce the regulatory burden on business is , a portal where business can find relevant information on regulatory requirements quickly.  This makes it easier for them to comply.  Further, my Department has instituted a series of free business communication events called Taking Care of Business (TCOB), where business people can hear short presentations on regulation and available supports and interact with personnel from up to 30 agencies.

The launch of the first call for expressions of interest under the Seed and Venture Capital Scheme 2013-2018 was a key Action Plan for Jobs target for 2013 and was announced on May 31st 2014. The original timing of this call was designed to align with the end of the majority of investment periods of Funds supported under Seed &amp;amp; Venture Capital Scheme 2007 &ndash; 2012.  <br \/><br \/>The Government through Enterprise Ireland has made commitments of &euro;99.5m to a number of fund managers under the Seed and Venture Capital Scheme 2013-2018.

The amount of leveraged capital far exceeded the initial targets (&euro;375m was secured against an initial target of &euro;150m).  Each of these funds is actively engaging with the market to source investment opportunities. <br \/><br \/><br \/>The Government through Enterprise Ireland and the National Pension Reserve Fund (NPRF) also established Innovation Fund Ireland (IFI). The objective of IFI is to attract international VCs to establish a presence in Ireland.

The main FDI clusters which have emerged in the North East Region are in international business services, mainly Financial Services, and consumer goods and manufacturing.  While IDA Ireland always seeks to influence the client decisions on where to visit or where to locate, the final decision in all cases is made by the investor.  <\/p><p>At the end of 2013 there were 7 IDA Ireland supported companies in Cavan<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>employing 1,135 people with 6 IDA Ireland supported companies in Monaghan employing 365 people.  IDA Ireland has formed strong relationships with these companies and, having regard to the fact that 70% approximately of all FDI investments won by IDA Ireland is from the existing client base, the agency continues to work closely with them in order to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites.  IDA Ireland works closely with third level educational institutions in the region so that the skill-sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the Region are being developed.<\/p><p>During 2012, as part of its marketing activities, IDA Ireland began an online marketing initiative, &ldquo;Connect &amp;amp; Invest&rdquo;, to showcase the unique attributes of individual regions to international clients and this initiative continues to be implemented in 2014. <\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland works with and supports local entrepreneurs with commercial business plans and also provides preferential funding for entrepreneurs and companies, with detailed export plans, who are expanding or establishing a business in the County as part of the BMW Region.<\/p><p>Payments of over &euro;1.8 million were made to companies in Cavan in 2013 and to date in 2014 over &euro;9.9 million has been approved to Cavan companies.

The APJ is working towards the creation of 100,000 jobs by 2016 (as compared to 2012), which will make a significant contribution to Government&rsquo;s aim of returning Ireland to full employment (2.1 million people) by 2020. This will be achieved by focussing on Government&rsquo;s priority of strengthening the domestic economy, and prioritising new jobs for the unemployed.<\/p><p>  In recognition of the vital importance of jobs to every aspect of the economic recovery, my Department will prioritise its role in delivering policies that support jobs in every county, town and village, with a particular focus on sectors, for example retail, that support balanced regional development. Central to this will be realising the full potential of the new network of 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), which are based in every local authority area, and which will support entrepreneurship and small business activity throughout the country.<\/p><p>  Indeed, reinforcing the importance of entrepreneurship in this context, my Department will publish a new Entrepreneurship Policy aimed at achieving a 25% increase in start-ups over the next five years, and to deliver a doubling of the jobs impact of start-ups over five years.<\/p><p>  To enable new and existing businesses to operate more efficiently, my Department will continue to lead on cutting down on the amount of red-tape, for example through the introduction of the new Integrated Licensing Application system.<\/p><p>  In conjunction with creating more jobs and reducing unemployment, I will also prioritise the delivery of better working standards. My Department will lead the work of the Low Pay Commission, to make appropriate recommendations regarding the appropriate level of the minimum wage and related matters, and will prioritise the enactment of the Collective Bargaining legislation that has already been approved by Government.<\/p><p>  I will also ensure completion of the programme of reform and modernisation of the Workplace Relations Bodies, including the enactment of the Workplace Relations Bill, to deliver, for employees and employers, streamlined advisory, conciliation, adjudication, inspection and enforcement mechanisms through the new two-tier structure of the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.<\/p><p>  I will continue to prioritise the successful work by the enterprise agencies under my Department in the context of the continued delivery of investment, export, and jobs targets. Further, I will maintain our focus on important science, research and innovation issues, for example by working to maximise Ireland&rsquo;s drawdown of EU Research funding (including &euro;1.25bn targeted under Horizon 2020) and building on the industry-relevant science base to ensure economic and jobs dividends from that investment through FDI, industry collaboration and direct commercial outputs.<\/p><p>  In addition, I will ensure that Ireland continues to derive the maximum benefits from the negotiation of, and our participation in, international trade agreements, and from trade missions led by my Department and the enterprise agencies. I will also work to ensure that the development of EU policies on employment and growth most appropriately reflect Ireland&rsquo;s interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700051#WRL01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":838,"qnumday":323,"qnumall":"[32794\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700051#WRL01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will provide a copy of the briefing he has received upon entering office from his Department; if he will publish the briefing; and if so, when the briefing will be published.","asker":"1101","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":839,"content":"<p>The briefing material that was prepared is currently the subject of a Freedom of Information (FOI) request that has been submitted to my Department.

These site visits were from new companies visiting the location for the first time and from senior executives of existing companies.  Data on site visits is maintained on a county basis only. <\/p><p>  There are many complex factors influencing investor location decision-making such as the increasing preference of investors globally for cities of scale with 1 million plus population, significant challenges from lower cost locations in the UK and Eastern Europe and attractive regional aid. <\/p><p>  In the region as a whole, there are currently 43 IDA Ireland client companies employing 4,812 people.  IDA Ireland has formed strong relationships with these companies and, having regard to the fact that 70% approximately of all FDI investments won by IDA Ireland is from the existing client base, the agency continues to work closely with them in order to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites.  IDA Ireland works closely with third level educational institutions in the region so that the skill-sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the Region are being developed.<\/p><p>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2014, we are bringing a particular focus to regional job creation and are delivering a range of measures to support this goal.  One such measure is that IDA Ireland will commence building new advanced manufacturing facilities in Waterford and Athlone and office space in Letterkenny.  The Athlone building will provide an enhanced platform to attract FDI to the Midlands Region.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  This is particularly important given the challenges in relation to the future sustainability of the State pension, with increased numbers of older people living longer.   <\/p><p>  When assessing whether an individual is entitled to a State pension (contributory), and to ensure that they can maximise such entitlement, all contributions (paid or credited) from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account.<\/p><p>  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is taken as the date used for averaging purposes in order to qualify for a State pension (contributory). <\/p><p>  To qualify for a state pension a person must &ndash; <\/p><p>  - have at least 520 paid contributions and <\/p><p>  - satisfy a yearly average condition (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid or credited is required for a full rate pension, and reduced rates of payment may be payable for pensioners with lower averages).<\/p><p>  The yearly average test has been in existence since 1961 when contributory pensions were first introduced. The scheme was designed with a view to ensuring that people could qualify for contributory pensions immediately and to suit a system where social insurance coverage was limited. <\/p><p>  For those with insufficient contributions to qualify for a full or partial State pension (contributory), the social protection system already provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated people to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. <\/p><p>  In addition, persons who have insufficient contributions to qualify for a full State pension (contributory), may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory).  Furthermore, some affected persons may be entitled to a qualified adult increase on their spouse&rsquo;s\/partner&rsquo;s pension payment.  This increase is paid directly to the qualified adult. <\/p><p>  The success of all of these measures across the entire State pension system, in ensuring equality of outcomes for men and women, is evidenced by the poverty statistics, which show that women over the age of 65 are less likely to be in poverty than men of the same age. <\/p><p>  The most recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund confirms that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.   It found that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories will continue to obtain the best value from their contributions. <\/p><p>  A total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) in 2020, although that date is subject to change.  Under this approach, the level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life. Issues such as equality of outcomes for women and men, including those who spend some years outside the labour market on caring duties, will be considered carefully in the context of that reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700051#WRL04400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Services Card","counter":884,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700051#WRL04500"},{"type":"question","counter":885,"qnumday":342,"qnumall":"[32203\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700051#WRL04550","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of persons refused a social welfare payment following their refusal to take part in the new photographic identification card system; her position regarding the welfare of these persons not receiving any payments; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1195","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":886,"content":"<p>The Public Services Card (PSC) has been introduced to enable individuals gain access to public services more efficiently and with a minimum of duplication of effort, while at the same time preserving their privacy to the maximum extent possible.

The purpose of the report was to gather information on pension charges levied to assess whether charges are reasonable and transparent, and make recommendations.  The report highlighted a wide range of issues in relation to pension charges and identified a number of problems.  While the provision of pension schemes cannot be cost free, it is clear that there are major challenges to be addressed in the two main areas of reasonableness and transparency of charges.<\/p><p>  Following the Report&rsquo;s publication and a consultation with stakeholders, it was agreed by Government in April 2013 that the recommendations contained in the report would be implemented.  A group comprising the Department of Social Protection, the Pensions Authority and the Central Bank is in place to initiate actions that follow up on these recommendations.  Each has a core role to play in delivering on the recommendations contained in the report and work is progressing in this regard.<\/p><p>  In line with the report&rsquo;s recommendation to monitor the implementation of the Consumer Protection Code, the Central Bank recently published findings of a review of annual pension statements.  This review found the vast majority of firms were in compliance with the code.  Where the Bank identified a small number of firms where the format of annual statements were not as required, the firms concerned were required to submit implementation timelines for full compliance.  Work is also ongoing in relation to other recommendations of the report such as consideration of a single standard measure that would assess all charges as well as investigation of the drivers behind take up of PRSAs.<\/p><p>  In parallel, my Department is involved in complementary EU negotiations in relation to a review of the IORPs (Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision) Directive which lays down basic requirements for occupational pensions and their supervision.  It is anticipated that agreement would result in improvements for consumers in the areas of member information regarding charges, trustee competencies, scheme governance and risk management.  In addition, progress on the issue of charges will be supported by recent actions to restructure the Pensions Authority and strengthen governance and regulation and give consumer representatives a greater input into pensions policy.  I have previously highlighted that the first task of the new Pensions Council will be to monitor the implementation of the recommendations in the Report on Pension Charges and advise if further actions are needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700052#WRM05100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unemployment Data","counter":983,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700052#WRM05150"},{"type":"question","counter":984,"qnumday":376,"qnumall":"[32677\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700052#WRM05200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of persons formerly employed in construction trade categories, particularly electrical or mechanical, who are in receipt of jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

It is a matter for OPW to determine, on a case by case basis, having due regard to the need to avoid any diminution in the facilities or services offered to the general public, whether special arrangements can be made to cater for individuals or groups who may wish to organise or participate in other activities of any particular kind.    <\/p><p>  I regret that my Department does not have any grant or other funding scheme that might be availed of to support the specific proposal referred to.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700053#WRN03400","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Bodies","counter":1050,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700053#WRN03425"},{"type":"question","counter":1051,"qnumday":404,"qnumall":"[32234\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700053#WRN03500","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the number of agencies or State bodies under the aegis of her Department that have been abolished since 2011; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"973"},{"type":"question","counter":1052,"qnumday":405,"qnumall":"[32249\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700053#WRN03600","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the number of new agencies or State bodies that have been established under the aegis of her Department since 2011; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":1053,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 404 and 405 together.<\/p><p>I refer the Deputy to the reply to Question 419 of 13 May 2014.<\/p><p>As set out in that reply, the functions of Culture Ireland were merged fully into my Department during 2013 and the Board was replaced with an Expert Committee whose members provide their time on a <i>pro bono<\/i>basis.

The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses.  This is being achieved through measures designed to accelerate commercial investment and the development of a State-led intervention for non-commercial areas.<\/p><p>  Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector have accelerated with commercial operators investing, or committing to invest, approximately &euro;2.5 billion in networks and services.  I understand that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out 28 fibre-based broadband networks in County Wicklow by July 2016.  In addition the recent announcement of a joint venture between ESB and Vodafone includes a proposal to provide high speed broadband in 4 locations in County Wicklow.<\/p><p>  The Government has committed to an ambitious plan which involves ensuring the delivery of broadband services to those parts of rural Ireland that will not be served by the commercial sector.  Services will be delivered over a network, with fibre at its foundation, which is sustainable and guarantees a quality broadband service to rural consumers into the future.  This will be the key element of an intervention strategy that will ensure that all citizens and businesses can access high speed broadband services regardless of where they live.<\/p><p>  Under EU State Aid Guidelines Member States cannot intervene where commercial investors have plans to roll out services.  A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department, to identify those areas that require a State intervention.  An initial list has already been identified and includes 15 areas in County Wicklow.  Further areas may also be identified as part of the ongoing mapping process which is ongoing.<\/p><p>  A stakeholder consultation on the implementation of the State-led intervention has recently been launched and will feed into the mapping exercise, which I expect to conclude in the autumn.

In order to meet this overall target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources.  Provisional figures indicate that, in 2013, 20.5% of Ireland's electricity requirements were met by renewable technologies such as wind energy, hydropower and biomass with 16.4% of electricity demand being met by wind generation.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland on <i>Quantifying Ireland&rsquo;s Fuel and CO2 Emissions Savings from Renewable Electricity in 2012 <\/i>estimated that renewable electricity generation resulted in CO2 emissions being reduced by 1.94 million tonnes in 2012.<\/p><p>Achieving these renewable energy targets requires investment in generating capacity and at the end of 2013, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid was 2,300 MW with over 3,000 MW of renewable generation having taken up connection offers under the Gate 3 grid connection programme.  It is estimated that a total of around 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target.<\/p><p>Although achieving our renewable energy targets will be challenging, it has been established that Ireland has sufficient onshore renewable energy resources to do so.  Intensive discussions took place over the last year with the UK to establish if it would be possible to export renewable energy in order to allow the UK meet its 2020 target.  While this work established that, with the appropriate policy and regulatory framework, renewable energy trading could deliver benefits to both Ireland and the UK, the complexities involved and the decisions yet to be taken by the UK, make post 2020 delivery more realistic given project lead times.  Nevertheless, given the move towards an Internal Market for Energy, I am of the view that trade in renewable electricity is likely to happen after 2020.  Any such trading would require infrastructure that would be separate from Ireland's transmission grid and would be funded by private developers without any impact on the Irish consumer.<\/p><p>It is also clear that there is potential to increase the diversity of our renewable generation portfolio in the period beyond 2020.  To that end, the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP), published earlier this year, identifies the sustainable economic opportunity for Ireland in the period to 2030 of realising the potential of our indigenous offshore wind, wave and tidal energy resources.  The Strategic Environmental Assessment carried out for the OREDP found that 4,500 MW of offshore wind and 1,500 MW of wave and tidal generation could be sustainably developed in Irish waters.<\/p><p>In terms of European targets for the period beyond 2020, the EU Commission published its 2030 Climate and Energy Package in January this year.  Work is underway on a cross-Departmental basis to establish the appropriate national position for Ireland in relation to greenhouse gas reduction and renewable energy targets in the context of an overall level of ambition set by the Commission for a 40% greenhouse gas reduction and 27% renewable energy target at EU level for 2030.  The contribution of the various sectors to meeting the national targets will be considered as part of developing a national position over the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700054#WRO05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Services Speeds","counter":1144,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700054#WRO05200"},{"type":"question","counter":1145,"qnumday":438,"qnumall":"[32570\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700054#WRO05300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the extent to which comparisons continue to be made between the quality, scale, standard and availability of broadband and mobile telephony in this jurisdiction and that available in other EU and non-EU competing jurisdictions; if the upgrading required is adequately provided for; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1024"},{"type":"question","counter":1146,"qnumday":443,"qnumall":"[32575\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700054#WRO05400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the degree to which high speed broadband services are on target to bring the standard here up to the highest quality in terms of international best practice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":1147,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 438 and 443 together.<\/p><p>A comparison report, the &ldquo;State of Broadband&rdquo; published by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in September 2013 ranks Ireland 35<sup>th<\/sup>of 183 countries for fixed line broadband penetration per 100 inhabitants; 19<sup>th<\/sup>of 170 countries for mobile broadband penetration per 100 inhabitants and 31<sup>st<\/sup>of 192 countries with 79% of the population accessing the internet using broadband.<\/p><p>The most recent OECD comparison report on retail fixed broadband speeds marketed, ranks Ireland 11<sup>th<\/sup>highest, equal with countries such as Australia, France, Germany, Switzerland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom for the highest marketed download speed available of 100 Mbps in 2012.  In the case of mobile broadband access, the OECD ranks Ireland 14<sup>th<\/sup>highest of the 34 countries surveyed.<\/p><p>These comparisons provide useful evidence of global trends in customer access to high speed broadband and mobile services.  They do not however measure the proportion of the populations which can access the high speed services within the states compared.  The broadband market in Ireland has changed considerably since the last OECD survey.  The highest market retail broadband speed offered by one service provider has increased from 100Mbps to 200Mbps in that period.  Another service provider is rolling out a fibre based network passing 1.4m premises and offering speeds of up to 100mbps.  This trend towards higher broadband speeds is expected to continue as service providers roll out new high speed services.  The recent announcement of a joint venture between Vodafone and ESB to provide fibre-to-the-premises services passing 500,000 premises initially should further improve Ireland&rsquo;s international ranking over time.  I am confident therefore that Ireland will continue to improve its relative placing with those countries surveyed in the current OECD table.  According to ComReg statistics, at the end March 2014, the proportion of all fixed broadband subscriptions equal to or greater than 10Mbps in Ireland increased from 32% to 57% in the last year.  38% of all such subscriptions were equal to or greater than 30Mbps up from 21% in the same period.  In addition to fixed line services, mobile services providers are rolling out next generation 4G networks following ComReg&rsquo;s multi-band spectrum auction in 2012.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s Statement of Priorities for the period 2014 to 2016 reaffirms our commitment to delivering a State-led broadband intervention in those areas the commercial market will not serve.  The National Broadband Plan aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses.  This will be achieved using a State-led intervention in non-commercial areas to ensure the delivery of high speed broadband services to those parts of rural Ireland that will not be served by the commercial sector.

The National Broadband Plan aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This is being achieved through measures designed to accelerate commercial investment and the development of a State-led intervention for non-commercial areas.<\/p><p>  Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector have accelerated with commercial operators investing, or committing to invest, approximately &euro;2.5 billion in networks and services. <\/p><p>  The Government has committed to an ambitious plan which involves ensuring the delivery of broadband services to those parts of rural Ireland that will not be served by the commercial sector. Services will be delivered over a network, with fibre at its foundation, which is sustainable and guarantees a quality broadband service to rural consumers into the future. This will be the key element of an intervention strategy that will ensure that all citizens and businesses can access high speed broadband services regardless of where they live. <\/p><p>  Under EU State Aid Guidelines Member States cannot intervene where commercial investors have plans to roll out services. A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department, to identify those areas that require a State intervention. An initial list has already been identified and includes over 1,100 towns and villages across Ireland. <\/p><p>  A stakeholder consultation on the implementation of the State-led intervention has recently been launched and will feed into the mapping exercise, which I expect to conclude in the autumn. It is my intention to conduct a full public consultation on the outcome of the mapping process and the proposed intervention strategy.  EU State aid clearance will also be required.  This will be followed by a detailed procurement process with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>  It is my intention to progress this complex and ambitious project as a key priority. I believe that it will address current connectivity challenges in a sustainable and meaningful way and will ensure that rural Ireland can enjoy comparable levels of quality and service as those experienced in urban areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700055#WRP00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electricity Transmission Network","counter":1170,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700055#WRP00450"},{"type":"question","counter":1171,"qnumday":447,"qnumall":"[32723\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700055#WRP00500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will provide an update on the work of the expert panel that was appointed to review the routes for the GridLink project; the timelines he expects on its work with specific reference to considering underground routes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"949","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":1172,"content":"<p>I refer to the reply to Priority Question No. 3 on today's Order Paper.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700055#WRP00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Adviser Appointments","counter":1173,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700055#WRP00650"},{"type":"question","counter":1174,"qnumday":448,"qnumall":"[32742\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700055#WRP00700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will provide in tabular form a detailed breakdown of the name and number of ministerial special advisers in his Department; their annual remuneration; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":1175,"content":"<p>No Special Adviser has been formally appointed since my appointment.<\/p><p>Special Adviser appointments will be undertaken in accordance with the Instructions on Ministerial Appointments for the 31st D&aacute;il and the Guidelines on Staffing of Ministerial Offices (July 2014) issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p>In accordance with Section 11(1)(a) of the Public Service Management Act 1997, I may appoint a maximum of two Special Advisers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700055#WRP00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards","counter":1176,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700055#WRP00850"},{"type":"question","counter":1177,"qnumday":449,"qnumall":"[32757\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700055#WRP00900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the gender quota targets for the boards of State bodies and agencies under his remit; the level reached to date; and his future plans to meet and maintain the targets.","asker":"1101","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":1178,"content":"<p>My Department is committed to seeking to attain the 40% target for both genders on State Boards and it is a key concern of mine to ensure high quality representation on Boards irrespective of gender.<\/p><p>  This Government adopted a significant innovation in 2011 to widen access by all persons to be considered for appointment to State Boards by providing that expressions of interest be sought publicly from all those that might be interested in serving on such Boards.<\/p><p>  In accordance with the Government Decision of 12 April 2011, on my Department's website, Expressions of Interest have been invited from persons wishing to be considered for appointment to vacancies on State Boards under the aegis of my Department and this information has been used to inform decisions for such appointments.

Application Guidelines were also issued, which outlined the scoring process which included capacity of the organisation, strategic fit, demonstration of need, achievability of the proposal and value for money.

Similarly, where an estate has not been completed to the standard outlined in the planning permission and the planning authority has not taken enforcement action within seven years of the expiry of the permission authorising the development, section 180 also provides that the planning authority must initiate taking in charge procedures if requested to do so by the owners of the units concerned.

of a full-time executive nature and are governed by statutory processes.   <\/p><p>** The board of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority was reappointed for an additional month from 1 May 2012 and replaced by a new board from 1 June 2012 which will continue in place until 31 December 2014.   <\/p><p>*** Appointments of the Local Authority Chief Executive members of the Boards of the Local Government Computer Services Board, the Local Government Management Services Board and the Local Government Management Agency (which was established on 1<sup><\/sup>August 2012, replacing the LGCSB and the LGMSB), are made by the County and City Chief Executives collectively.   <\/p><p>The Public Appointments Service operates a new portal which offers a single dedicated point of contact to all government Departments, as a support to the existing State board appointment procedures. This service provides a mechanism for Departments to advertise board vacancies and it gives prospective candidates an opportunity to register their general interest in a position on a state Board and to be alerted to upcoming vacancies.   <\/p><p>Since July 2011, my Department has sought expressions of interest through its website, from suitably qualified and experienced persons, for consideration as members or chairpersons of the boards of State bodies under my Department&rsquo;s aegis. Expressions of interest can be made at any time and will be kept on file in my Department for consideration as vacancies occur. In considering applications, due regard is had to the requirements of the position, the qualifications, experience and expertise of applicants and Government policy regarding gender balance on State boards. <\/p><p>All appointments are made in accordance with the appropriate legislation governing appointments to each body. In some cases statutory selection procedures must be followed or nominations must be sought from independent nominating panels before appointments are made by the Minister or the Government, as appropriate. In a number of situations, only some appointments to the body concerned are made by the Minister, or appointments are made with the consent of another Minister. <\/p><p>The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann (BGE) under the Companies Acts. The Memorandum and Articles of Association, provide that the appointment of directors is the responsibility of the Board of BGE, with the approval of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. 12 directors were appointed initially for the period to July 2014, one of whom has since resigned. The remaining 11 directors have been re-appointed for a further 6 month period to 30 November 2014. <\/p><p>The following have been appointed to the Board of Irish Water:   <table><tr><th>Irish Water <\/th><th>Ms. Rose Hynes (Chair) <\/th><th>July 2013 <\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Mr. Michael McNicholas <\/td><td>July 2013 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Mr. John Tierney <\/td><td>July 2013 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Ms. Margaret Rae <\/td><td>July\/2013 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Mr. Philip Lee <\/td><td>November 2013 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Ms. Hilary Quinlan <\/td><td>November 2013 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Ms. Regina Finn <\/td><td>November 2013 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Mr. Colman Sheehy <\/td><td>November 2013 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Mr. Billy Moore <\/td><td>November 2013 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Mr. Brian McKeown <\/td><td>November 2013 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Mr. Sean Kelly <\/td><td>November 2013* <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Ms. Jacqueline Hall <\/td><td>November 2013 <\/td><\/tr><\/table>*resigned in June 2014   <\/p><p>In addition, although not a State Board in the traditional sense, appointments to the Board of Pobal, a not-for-profit company, fall to be made by the Government having considered nominees from a range of stakeholders.

Leave to seek a judicial review must usually be sought within eight weeks of the decision, although the High Court may extend this period where it considers that there is good and sufficient reason for doing so. The High Court may only grant leave where it is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for contending that the decision is invalid or should be quashed. The person seeking leave must also have a substantial interest in the decision and have participated in the decision making process or had good and sufficient reasons for not doing so. <\/p><p>  Section 146 of the 2000 Act provides that a report and recommendation on any case which is before the Board for decision can be prepared to assist the Board in making its decision on that matter. The Board is obliged to consider any such report and recommendation before determining the matter but it is not bound to adopt the report in making its decision. However, subsection 34(10) of the 2000 Act in relation to planning appeals provides that in circumstances where the Board&rsquo;s decision is different, in relation to the granting or refusal of permission, from the recommendation of the reporting inspector, then the Board&rsquo;s decision must include a statement indicating the main reasons for not accepting the recommendation in the inspector&rsquo;s report. The Board follows this practice in all cases which come before it for decision.<\/p><p>  In June 2007, my Department issued Development Management Guidelines for Planning Authorities under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which planning authorities and the Board must have regard to in the performance of their functions. The Guidelines contain a section in relation to planning reports, and advise that the planning report should gather together all information relevant for the proper consideration of the application and that it should structure these considerations in a way that is clear to the applicant and the wider public and that enables informed judgements to be made as to the merits of an appeal to the Board. The Guidelines also note the requirements of section 34(10)(b) of the 2000 Act and reiterate that where a final decision of a planning authority or the Board on a planning application is different, in relation to either the granting or refusal of permission, from the recommendation of the final planning report, the decision must indicate clearly the main reasons for not accepting the recommendation. The Guidelines further advise that it is best practice that the decision would address all the relevant issues raised in the final planning report and that where the decision, while not differing from the recommendation in relation to the grant or refusal, significantly varies the conditions, the reasons for this variation should also be given.

These specific control requirements in relation to certain breeds were introduced as a balanced and workable arrangement which recognises the rights of dog owners, while also taking account of the needs of society to be protected from dogs with a significant capability to inflict very serious injury.

Legislation to dissolve the Board was passed by the Oireachtas in December 2012. Its functions have now transferred back to the Department of Defence. <\/p><p>  There were no appointments to the Board of Coiste an Asgard from 2009.

The then Minister for Defence appointed Commandant Adam Lagun to the Board on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff. As the Army Pensions Act, 1927 specifies that one of the ordinary members must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps, this position was not publicly advertised. Details of Commandant Lagun&rsquo;s appointment to the Army Pensions Board were published in the Iris Oifigi&uacute;il on 13 January 2012.<\/p><p>  The civilian doctor vacancy was advertised on the Department of Defence website and the Public Appointments Service website.

Artic les 34 to 36 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union prohibit Member States from maintaining or imposing barriers on intra-EU trade in goods. These provisions give rise to the principle of mutual recognition whereby each Member State is obliged to accept onto its market products which are legally manufactured or marketed in another Member State. Member States can only refuse to apply this principle in cases where there is an overriding public interest (e.g. public safety, public or animal health or the protection of the environment). Even then, all trade restrictive measures taken must be necessary for, and proportionate to, the protection of the public interest concerned.  My Department attaches considerable importance to the live export trade and, over the years, has been very active in facilitating both the cross border live trade and shipments abroad.<b><\/b>Live exports serve a dual purpose as a means of satisfying market demands for live animals and providing alternative market outlets for farmers. Total live exports to the end of June this year stand at almost 160,000 head of which almost 28,000 went to the UK, an increase of some 3,300 head or 14% up on the comparable period in 2013. Of this 28,000, some 20,200 went to Northern Ireland which is an increase of 5% on the same period in 2013.   <\/p><p>However, the potential to grow the live trade to the UK even further is constrained by the buying specifications operated by the British retail chains in relation to cattle born in this country and exported live for finishing and processing in that market. The retailers&rsquo; longstanding policy is to market British and Irish beef separately. This means that beef must be sourced from animals originating in one country; i.e. born, reared and slaughtered in the same country. In addition, logistical difficulties arise when a small number of Irish-born animals are slaughtered in a UK meat plant. Under mandatory EU labelling rules, these carcases have to be deboned in a separate batch, packaged and labelled accordingly, thereby incurring additional costs for the processor. These issues are a matter of commercial preference, both of slaughter plants in the UK and Northern Ireland, and of UK retailers. <\/p><p>While Bord Bia has repeatedly raised this issue with British retailers over the years, they are unlikely to reverse their marketing policy in the short term. The fact that the price of British beef has fallen significantly in recent times, and that the three UK retail outlets which stock Irish beef are currently under pressure to stock more British beef, is also a relevant consideration   in this regard. Nevertheless Bord Bia, in its ongoing interactions with British customers, will continue to pursue all opportunities to maximise the full potential of the beef and livestock trade with our largest trading partner. In addition Bord Bia actively supports the development of the live export trade through the provision of market information, developing market access and promotional activity.   <\/p><p>In addition I am engaging with Northern counterpart, Ms Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, in this regard. In so far as common market rules are concerned, however, as I have already explained, the issues relating to purchase of Irish born animals by NI slaughterhouses and the purchase of the meat from such animals by UK retail outlets are a matter of commercial procurement strategy by these operators. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700058#WRS04100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Appeals","counter":1475,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700058#WRS04200"},{"type":"question","counter":1476,"qnumday":556,"qnumall":"[32639\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700058#WRS04300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a decision on a dual claim appeal will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1477,"content":"<p>The Agriculture Appeals Office received an appeal from the above-mentioned in relation to a dual claim.

While this report will be studied further in my Department as part of the ongoing review of the bovine TB eradication scheme, I should point out that this paper has modelled data specific to the British bovine TB eradication programme. It should also be noted that the scale of the TB problem and within-farm dynamics in the cattle industry in the UK are considerably different to the situation here. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the comprehensive TB Eradication Programme as implemented by my Department has incorporated a badger removal policy since 2004 because TB is present both in cattle and in badgers and it is necessary to eradicate this disease in both species. Research conducted over the years by the Department and others has demonstrated that the eradication of bovine TB disease is not a practicable proposition until the issue of the reservoir of infection in badgers, which is seeding infection into the cattle population, is addressed. I should emphasise that badgers are only removed in areas where an epidemiological investigation carried out by my Department&rsquo;s Veterinary Inspectorate has found that badgers are the likely source of infection. <\/p><p>  My Department believes that the culling of badgers is cost effective and that it has contributed significantly to the very significant improvement in the disease situation in recent years and, in particular, since 2008, during which period the number of reactors has declined by almost 50% from around 30,000 to 15,600 last year. This is a new record low since the commencement of the eradication programme in the 1950s and, for the first time since then, eradication is now a practicable proposition. It is noteworthy that the animal prevalence of TB in Ireland in 2013 was, at 0.26%, roughly half of that in Northern Ireland where badger culling is not practised. The improvement in the TB situation has also resulted in a significant reduction in expenditure on the TB eradication scheme, which has fallen from &euro;55m in 2008 to &euro;30m in 2013. It is also noteworthy that the incidence of TB in badgers has fallen by about 50% since 2002, and this is also contributing to the reduction in the incidence of the disease in cattle.   <\/p><p>  In regard to badger vaccination, the ultimate objective of my Department is to incorporate badger vaccination into the Irish TB eradication programme when data is available to ensure that it can be incorporated in an optimally effective and sustainable manner. A number of field trials are ongoing in Ireland with this objective in mind, but it is anticipated that it will be a number of years before a viable oral delivery method can be put in place and, therefore, targeted badger removals will continue in the medium term. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700058#WRS04800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Adviser Appointments","counter":1482,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700058#WRS04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1483,"qnumday":558,"qnumall":"[32739\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700058#WRS05000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will provide in tabular form a detailed breakdown of the name and number of Ministerial special advisers in his Department; their annual remuneration; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1484,"content":"<p>In answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, two Special Advisers are employed in my Department, details of which are provided below:-  <table><tr><th>Name <\/th><th>Current Salary <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Ross MacMath&uacute;na (from 16\/1\/2012 to date) <\/td><td>&euro;103,200 (single point scale) <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&Aacute;ine Kilroy (from 18\/4\/2011 to date) <\/td><td>&euro;81,676 (3 rd point Principal Officer Standard Scale) <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The salary increase for one of my advisors, which is marginally higher than the pay guidelines for such a position, was approved by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.

In particular, the coming year will see the transition to the new Common Agricultural Policy and the rollout of the new Rural Development Programme which will deliver a vital injection of strategic investment into rural communities and provide essential supports for family farms.\u00a0 The new CAP will provide the basis for delivering on the overall objectives of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.\u00a0   Building on the significant progress already achieved under FH2020, I am firmly committed to delivering on the FH2020 plan and ensuring that all sectors within the agri-food sector benefit from the growth envisaged in output under the strategy. Central to this is the fundamental importance of providing a valuable market for the output of farming sector across the range of activities.   <\/p><p>  In this context, the ending of dairy quotas in 2015 provides a very significant opportunity for growth and expansion and managing the transition to this change in market conditions is a firm focus for me.\u00a0 I am very cognisant of the challenges currently facing the beef sector and through the establishment of the beef forum and other strategic measures being considered by my Department, I am focused on ensuring that the sector will overcome the current difficulties being experienced. <\/p><p>  In tandem with the rollout of the CAP, the implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy is a strategic focus for me. This presents many opportunities for the seafood sector and together with the potential to add value in the processing sector, the targets set out in FH2020 for the seafood sector are eminently achievable. The continued implementation of the Harnessing our Ocean Wealth Strategy will also prove essential to the wider economic development of the marine. <\/p><p>  Overall, I am firmly committed to ensuring that the agri-food sector continues to contribute significantly to broader economic recovery and to build on the progress already achieved in terms of export growth.\u00a0<\/p><p>  There are a wide range of other areas where work is ongoing and I will continue to prioritise these projects to support all stakeholders in the agri-food sector and the broad remit of my Department. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700058#WRS05700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Communications","counter":1491,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700058#WRS05800"},{"type":"question","counter":1492,"qnumday":561,"qnumall":"[32784\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700058#WRS05900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will provide a copy of the the briefing he has received upon entering office from his Department; if he will publish the briefing; and if so, when the briefing will be published.","asker":"1101","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1493,"content":"<p>As I have retained my portfolio as Minister of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, there was no requirement to provide me with further briefing.

They include the developer, the OMC, an owner of a residential unit in the development (i.e. a member of the OMC) or such other person as the court sees fit.

Demand in 2013 was at the same level as it was in 2012 and while there was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011, nevertheless the demand for general legal services (excluding asylum) in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006. In recognition of this, the Board has not been subject to the level of cuts  that other public service bodies have had to experience and my predecessor was able to maintain the Board&rsquo;s allowance at the same level for 2014 as it was in the previous three years.  Nevertheless it is a challenging environment that has resulted in recent years in growing waiting times for those seeking legal services for most matters.  The Board prioritises certain categories of case, most notably cases involving children at risk of going into State (Child and Family Agency) care and cases involving international child abduction.  In 2013 approximately 17% of the Board&rsquo;s first appointments with clients involved cases that had been prioritised.  It is difficult for the Board to add additional categories of cases for prioritisation without such an approach impacting on the meaningful ability to prioritise the case types that I have just mentioned.<\/p><p>In September 2013 my predecessor signed into law by way of Regulations, a package of proposals from the Board for the revision of the financial eligibility and contributions provisions governing the granting of civil legal aid including a reduction in the capital eligibility threshold for legal services and increases in the contributions payable by most persons seeking legal services. These provisions should have some impact, on the resources available to the Board.  I can inform the Deputy that, in response to the changed environment the Board has taken steps to try and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of its legal services. Those steps include the following:<\/p><p>- A  &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach to service delivery is being piloted, the aim of which is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice. If the applicant requires further services they remain on the &lsquo;waiting list&rsquo;;<\/p><p>- In August 2012 the Board introduced a new case management system in its law centres which will deliver efficiencies in terms of administration as well as to the delivery of legal services. It will take time for the full benefits of this system to materialise;<\/p><p>- In November 2011  responsibility for the management and administration of the State funded Family Mediation Service was transferred to the Board. A key reason for this transfer was to improve the synergies between the family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law);<\/p><p>- The Board has maintained a high level of usage of private solicitors for family law cases in the District Court;<\/p><p>- The Board continues to engage with other key players in the justice \/ legal area such as the Courts Service and the Child and Family Agency, with a view to trying to ensure that State funded resources that impact on its area of business are used to best effect.<\/p><p>Details concerning waiting times and case types, provided by the Legal Aid Board, are set out in the attached appendices.  Waiting times for legal services as of the 1 July 2014 are set out on a law centre by law centre basis in Appendix I.  Most of the Legal Aid Board&rsquo;s law centres operate a &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach which involves giving an applicant a short consultation (45 minutes) for legal advice.  Those persons remain on the Board&rsquo;s waiting list if they require further legal services.  It is not practical to give &lsquo;averages&rsquo; as the waiting times fluctuate at each law centre depending on a variety of issues including current court commitments, staff numbers and staff availability.  In terms of the case types that are awaiting a service, attached at Appendix II is a breakdown of the case types in respect of persons who have yet to see a solicitor while the breakdown at Appendix III relates to case types in respect of persons who have had a &lsquo;triage&rsquo; appointment with a solicitor but are awaiting further services.<\/p><p><b>Appendix I<\/b><\/p><p><b>Waiting times &ndash; 1 July 2014<\/b><\/p><p><b>Waiting times are given in weeks<\/b><table><tr><th><b>Law Centre<\/b><\/th><th><b>Part-Time Centre<\/b><\/th><th><b>Waiting time for a first consultation<\/b><\/th><th><div><b>Further waiting time for a second consultation<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>(centres operating triage)<\/b><\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Athlone<\/td><td><div>21<\/div><\/td><td><div>22<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Athlone<\/td><td>Mullingar<\/td><td><div>24<\/div><\/td><td><div>20<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>33<\/div><\/td><td><div>n\/a<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Castlebar<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>30<\/div><\/td><td><div>34<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>16<\/div><\/td><td><div>13<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clondalkin<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><td><div>19<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork North<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>47<\/div><\/td><td><div>15<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork South<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>56<\/div><\/td><td><div>37<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dundalk<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>6<\/div><\/td><td><div>n\/a<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ennis<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>19<\/div><\/td><td><div>33<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Finglas<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>8<\/div><\/td><td><div>21<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway Francis St<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>23<\/div><\/td><td><div>70<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway Seville House<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>16<\/div><\/td><td><div>19<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Gardiner Street<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>6<\/div><\/td><td><div>44<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td>- Carlow<\/td><td><div>3<\/div><\/td><td><div>46<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>- Kilkenny<\/td><td><div>6<\/div><\/td><td><div>45<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Letterkenny<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><td><div>49<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>43<\/div><\/td><td><div>n\/a<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>24<\/div><\/td><td><div>27<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td>Drogheda<\/td><td><div>14<\/div><\/td><td><div>n\/a<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Monaghan<\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><td><div>n\/a<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Montague Court<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>29<\/div><\/td><td><div>n\/a<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Navan<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>16<\/div><\/td><td><div>22<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Nenagh<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>6<\/div><\/td><td><div>33<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Newbridge<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>24<\/div><\/td><td><div>46<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Personal Injuries Unit<\/td><td><\/td><td><div>n\/a<\/div><\/td><td><div>n\/a<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Portlaoise<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>15<\/div><\/td><td><div>40<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Boyle<\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><td><div>24<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td>Sligo<\/td><td><div>5<\/div><\/td><td><div>25<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Smithfield<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>37<\/div><\/td><td><div>14<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tallaght<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>35<\/div><\/td><td><div>40<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tralee<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>34<\/div><\/td><td><div>n\/a<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tullamore<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>22<\/div><\/td><td><div>n\/a<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>33<\/div><\/td><td><div>n\/a<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>40<\/div><\/td><td><div>23<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>- <\/td><td><div>24<\/div><\/td><td><div>n\/a<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700059#WRT05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1574,"content":"<p>Appendix IISubject MatterTotalAccess 141Access and Guardianship 53Access Guardianship and Maintenance 47Anti-social Behaviour Order Repossessions 3Case Stated 21Child Abduction 2Child care -

While the volume of cases processed by ISI up until now falls short of expectations, the caseload continues to increase month on month, as debtors become familiar with the solutions available to them.  To date, almost 1000 applications have been made to the ISI and almost 200 cases have already reached a successful conclusion.  There have been 164 bankruptcies so far this year.  Up to 61% of residual debt has been written off in some cases involving secured debt and over 80% of debt was written off in cases of unsecured debt. So far this year, the ISI is dealing with over &euro;0.5 billion of debt, and  it expects the increase in cases to continue over the coming months.  The ISI has now published a Debt Settlement Arrangement Protocol which it developed in conjunction with the key stakeholders and which is expected to result in the faster development of proposals, faster acceptance by creditors and higher acceptance rates by creditors, as happened in England and Wales when a similar Protocol was introduced there some years ago.  The ISI is currently working on developing a similar Protocol for the Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA), which it hopes will be agreed later this year and again, this should facilitate a more efficient and streamlined process.  In addition, I understand that the ISI will be launching an information campaign later this year in an effort to reach out to those struggling with debt and make it clear to them that there is a solution for everyone.  I will continue together with the ISI to keep its effectiveness under careful ongoing review and to address any issues that are required to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700059#WRT07400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Criminal Prosecutions Data","counter":1599,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700059#WRT07500"},{"type":"question","counter":1600,"qnumday":599,"qnumall":"[32631\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700059#WRT07600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of prosecutions taken and convictions secured in respect of illegal moneylending activity in recent years; the penalties that applied on those convictions; the penalties available in law on conviction; and when the most recent conviction took place for such activity in an Irish court.","asker":"993","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1601,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that the regulation of money lending is provided for by way of a number of pieces of legislation.  Legislative provisions relating to the regulation of money lending are provided for in the Consumer Credit Act 1995, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Under the 1995 Act, unlicensed money lending is an offence.  Persons who engage in money lending and who do not hold the necessary licence granted by the Central Bank are committing an offence under section 98 of the Act.  A person who is guilty of an offence under the Act is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, or on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.  There are also a number of provisions in the criminal law which may be of relevance in particular circumstances, for example, sections 10 and 11 of the Non-fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 and section 17 the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 provide for offences relating to harassment, extortion and demanding money with menaces.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the investigative agency responsible for the investigation of allegations of unlicensed money lending.  These investigations are conducted at a local level. The Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation can and does assist in such investigations, as requested.<\/p><p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that prior to May 2013 there was no specific Pulse incident category available to capture investigations into unlicensed money lending but I am informed that the Pulse system has now been subsequently enhanced to reflect a new incident type to record such offences.  I am further informed that details on any conviction related to illegal moneylending activity prior to this date would require a manual analysis of the Garda Pulse system which would require a disproportionate expenditure of Garda resources.  I am also advised that since May 2013 there have been no prosecutions for illegal moneylending activities but An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has indicated that there are three investigations into illegal moneylending activities currently underway.  Two investigations are still ongoing and in relation to the third investigation, a file has been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions seeking directions to charge.  I would, of course,  also encourage those who may have information concerning the operation of unlicensed money lenders in particular circumstances to make that information available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who will take all measures open to them to enforce the law in this area.<\/p><p>  Under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service and the Minister has no role in the matter.  Section 4(3) of the 1998 Act provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which includes the provision of statistics.  The Courts Service has indicated that it is not in a position to provide statistics relating to convictions on illegal moneylending activity. I have asked the Courts Service to review the position in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700059#WRT07700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drugs Crime","counter":1602,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700059#WRT07800"},{"type":"question","counter":1603,"qnumday":600,"qnumall":"[32635\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700059#WRT07900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views regarding the recent upsurge in the level of heroin seizures in Cork city and county; the response to this growing problem.","asker":"993","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1604,"content":"<p>I have requested a report from the Garda authorities in relation to this matter and I will further advise the Deputy in this regard when the report is to hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700059#WRT08000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigrant Investor Programme Applications","counter":1605,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700059#WRT08100"},{"type":"question","counter":1606,"qnumday":601,"qnumall":"[32678\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700059#WRT08200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of applications received and approved to date under the immigrant investor programme and the start up entrepreneur scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1607,"content":"<p>To date, thirty applications for the Immigrant Investor Programme have been received by the Department of Justice and Equality.

Where sections 6A and 6B of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, are applicable, a child born in the island of Ireland on or after 1 January 2005 has an entitlement to Irish citizenship if, at the time of the birth of the child, one of his or her parents had, during the period of 4 years immediately preceding the person's birth, been resident in the island of Ireland for a period of not less than 3 years or periods the aggregate of which is not less than 3 years. Periods of unlawful residence, periods of residence which were for the sole purpose of having an application for refugee status determined or periods of residence where permission was granted for the purposes of study are excluded from the determination of periods of reckonable residence. Entitlement of a child to Irish citizenship is determined by the Passport Office following receipt of an application for a passport on the child's behalf.Where a child born in the State did not at birth have an entitlement to Irish citizenship, the parent or guardian or person who is in loco parentis to the child may lodge an application for naturalisation on behalf of the child if and when the conditions for naturalisation are satisfied.<\/p><p>With regard to the residency situation of the children, the general position is that permission to remain in the State in respect of children under the age of 16 is granted in line with that granted to their parents.

The HSE has no access to data held by Biogen Idec in relation to this programme.<\/p><p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. <\/p><p>Fampridine was never available to multiple sclerosis patients under the Long Term Illness (LTI) Scheme, however, the HSE received an application for the inclusion of Fampridine in the GMS and community drugs schemes.  The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association for the assessment of new medicines. <\/p><p>  In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product.  The report is available on the NCPE's website ().  The NCPE report is an important input to assist the HSE in its decision making process and informs further discussions between the HSE and the manufacturer of the drug.<\/p><p>  The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable.  In these circumstances, the HSE has not approved the reimbursement of Fampridine under the GMS or other community drug schemes. <\/p><p>However, I am aware that studies are ongoing to assess the wider impact of Fampridine on both walking and quality of life for persons diagnosed with MS.  The results of these studies will contribute to the evidence base demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of the product which can be used to support future applications for its inclusion on the lists of reimbursable items supplied under the GMS and other community drugs scheme.<\/p><p>The HSE met with Biogen Idec recently to discuss a potential revised application.  The HSE expects that Biogen Idec will submit a revised application.  The HSE will then re-consider the application in as timely a fashion as possible in line with the agreed procedures and timescales for the assessment of new medicines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700061#WRV01500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Administration","counter":1737,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700061#WRV01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1738,"qnumday":644,"qnumall":"[32111\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700061#WRV01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if persons who were on the long-term illness scheme and transferred to medical cards will be reimbursed from the period of 1 July 2011 to 31 May 2014; and if so, the procedure for applying for the reimbursement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1739,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) is responsible for the administration of the primary care schemes, therefore, the matter has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700061#WRV01700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1740,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 645 and 646 answered with Question No. 643.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":1741,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700061#WRV01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1742,"qnumday":647,"qnumall":"[32114\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700061#WRV02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding a medical card application in respect of persons (details supplied) in County Carlow.","asker":"968","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1743,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

The system, which includes two databases, allows the Department to record and actively track the title and whereabouts of all files of the Department.   These include records transferred to it from the Department of Local Government and Public Health on the establishment of the Department of Health in 1947.

Its purpose was to examine the Department&rsquo;s child care files, find any references to the names of children who were in care and to create an index containing those names.  The purpose of the index was to facilitate efficient and thorough searches and retrieval of records on behalf of individuals seeking their own personal information in the context of Freedom of Information legislation, Court Orders of Discovery and applications to the Residential Institutions Redress Board. <\/p><p>  The Project involved the indexing of all papers held by the Department relating to child care services, some of which contain information referring to individual children who were in care.  The personal information references have been indexed onto a specialised &lsquo;names index&rsquo; along with other relevant information.  <\/p><p>  The Inter-Departmental Committee to establish the facts of State Involvement with the Magdalen Laundries considered the routes of entry to the Magdalen Laundries, including from Mother and Baby Homes, and my Department and the HSE conducted searches of retained records for any relevant information.

Yesterday, my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, published the report of the Inter-Departmental Group on Mother and Baby Homes, which was established in early June, to assist the Government in scoping the necessary examination of this important issue.  Submissions on the terms of reference for the Commission from over 120 groups and individuals have also been received by that Department and a number of meetings have been held with groups.  Collectively, these inputs and consultations will assist the Government in finalising proposals for the Commission&rsquo;s establishment.

As the Deputy may be aware, the tobacco industry has argued that standardised or plain packs would be easier to forge and would lead to growth in illicit trade of tobacco products.  However, the Revenue Commissioners have advised me that they are satisfied that the standardised packaging legislation will not have a significant impact on their work in relation to illicit trade in tobacco products. The Revenue Commissioners have advised that the tax stamp is a key means for them to distinguish between legal and illegal products, irrespective of the way in which the cigarettes are packaged. Tax stamps will remain a fixture on tobacco products following the introduction of standardised packaging, and contain all features possible to minimise the risk of counterfeiting. <\/p><p>  Combating the illegal tobacco trade is, and will continue to be, a high priority for the Revenue Commissioners. They have extensive cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating the illicit trade, and in addition, cooperation takes place with other revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud office, OLAF, in the ongoing programmes at international level to tackle the illicit trade.<\/p><p>  Research carried out by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, in conjunction with the HSE National Tobacco Control Office, indicates that contraband represents the majority of illicit cigarettes. Figures from 2013 indicate that the proportion of smokers classified as having an illegal pack was 12%, representing a decrease of 4% since 2009. These findings indicate that the level of consumption of illicit product is being contained, although Revenue remains determined to confront the illegal trade in tobacco products, to optimise levels of seizures of illicit tobacco product and to pursue those found to be involved in this illegal activity.  The research estimates that the consumption of illegal cigarettes represented a loss to Revenue of approximately &euro;212 million in excise duties and VAT in 2013; a decrease from the estimated figure of &euro;249 million in 2010. <\/p><p>  The 2014 EU Tobacco Products Directive sets out further measures to be adopted by Member States in order to tackle illicit trade; in particular, it includes provisions relating to traceability and security features of tobacco products. Tobacco products will be marked with a unique identifier and security features.  This will allow for their movements to be recorded and for such products to be tracked and traced throughout the EU.  This will also facilitate the verification of whether or not tobacco products are authentic.<\/p><p>Following Government approval, Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations signed the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products, adopted by the Parties to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), in New York on 20 December 2013. The new international treaty is aimed at combating illegal trade in tobacco products through control of the supply chain and international cooperation.  As a key measure, Parties commit to establishing a global tracking and tracing system to reduce and eventually eradicate illicit trade.<\/p><p>  In view of the above, it is anticipated that illicit trade of tobacco will not increase as a result of the introduction of standardised packaging.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700062#WRWW05900","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":1901,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700063#WRX00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1902,"qnumday":702,"qnumall":"[32630\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700063#WRX00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress to date in determination of an application for a medical card in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1903,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

Under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2009, an 8% reduction in a range of fees and allowances payable to GPs was introduced in 2009, which effected full year savings in the region of &euro;34 million.  Further reductions to a range of GP fees and allowances were introduced in 2010, which effected full year savings in the region of &euro;44 million.  This equated to an approximate additional reduction of 9%.<\/p><p>  In 2013 the Minister for Health decided to apply further reductions to the fees and allowances payable to GPs.  This equated to an overall reduction of 7.5%, amounting to a saving of some &euro;38 million in a full year.

A review took place in June and it was decided that the reduced fees provided for in the FEMPI regulations should be maintained in place. The regulations will be reviewed again in 2015 and a decision will be taken at that time regarding maintaining, restoring or further reducing fees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700063#WRX05900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Delays","counter":1987,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700063#WRX05950"},{"type":"question","counter":1988,"qnumday":730,"qnumall":"[32825\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700063#WRX06000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason for the delay on a decision in granting a discretionary medical card in respect of a family (details supplied) in County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The conditions covered by the LTI Scheme are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Mental handicap; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.

Consultants working in full-time private practice and those with B* contracts which permit off-site practice must obtain indemnity cover from medical defence organisations.   One of the medical defence organisations, the Medical Protection Society (MPS), which indemnifies the majority of consultants concerned,  increased its membership subscription rates in Ireland  from the beginning of July, 2014, by an average of 42%.  The consultants must purchase their professional medical indemnity up to agreed financial limits or 'caps'. Professional medical indemnity is provided by the medical defence organisations. In the event that a claim for an adverse medical event against a consultant exceeds these caps, the excess is covered by the State's Clinical Indemnity Scheme.<\/p><p>  Following a detailed assessment, Government agreed to extend the caps arrangements in 2013 for a period of five years. The Government also decided in July 2013 to adjust the cap annually in line with the Consumer Price Index. It is important to note that without the caps, indemnity subscription rates for consultants in private practice would have increased to a far greater extent than they have.  The caps rates since 1 July, 2014 are:<\/p><p>  - consultant obstetricians, neurosurgeons, and orthopaedic surgeons undertaking spinal surgery -  &euro;590,425 per claim as well as an annual aggregate limit of &euro;1,771,275 per consultant;<\/p><p>  - for all other specialties the limit is &euro;1,180,850 per claim with no aggregate limit;<\/p><p>  Officials in my Department have met representatives of the Medical Protection Society and also the Irish Hospital Consultants Association about this issue.  The State Claims Agency commissioned an actuarial assessment of any proposed decrease in the caps rates, which, while of benefit to private consultants, would incur more costs for the State and this issue is being examined by my Department in conjunction with the State Claims Agency.  At a time of huge financial pressure on the public health system any change to the caps arrangement must be carefully considered and a Government decision would be needed to effect such a change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700063#WRX06700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Medical Services Scheme Administration","counter":2000,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700064#WRY00200"},{"type":"question","counter":2001,"qnumday":734,"qnumall":"[32831\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700064#WRY00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will introduce measures to recoup moneys paid to general practitioners for medical card patients who have passed away or emigrated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2002,"content":"<p>The HSE, through the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS), makes payments to General Practitioners (GPs) for services they provide to eligible persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card, therefore, I have referred this matter to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700064#WRY00400","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2003,"content":"<p>Question No. 735 answered with Question No. 729.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":2004,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700064#WRY00600"},{"type":"question","counter":2005,"qnumday":736,"qnumall":"[32835\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700064#WRY00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a full medical card will issue in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2006,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

In November 2012 the Government announced its decision that the new children&rsquo;s hospital will be co-located with St James&rsquo;s on its campus, ensuring it benefits from the broadest possible range of adult sub-specialty expertise and research capability. The intention is ultimately to tri-locate adult, paediatric and maternity services on the campus. Satellite centres, which will share governance and staffing with the new children's hospital, will be built on the campuses of Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals.   <\/p><p>  The Government's decision was based on the over-riding priority of best clinical outcomes for our children. Tri-location of adult, paediatric and maternity services brings benefits for children, adolescents, newborns and mothers. In all cases, the benefits of tri-location are maximised where the adult hospital provides the broadest possible range of clinical sub-specialties and expertise, readily accessible for paediatric and maternity patients on the shared campus. In addition, tri-location that delivers the most significant depth and breadth of clinical and academic research on site will enhance the potential of research to drive best clinical outcomes. St James's Hospital is considered the best adult co-location partner for the new children's hospital, having broadest range of national specialties of all acute adult hospitals, as well as strong and well established research and education infrastructure.<\/p><p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is the body responsible for planning, designing, building and equipping the hospital and has been actively progressing the project on the new site. The Project Brief for the hospital on the St James's campus has been agreed, a decant strategy for the site is in place and is actively being progressed, and a preferred design team has been selected and is expected to be appointed shortly. Design development will then begin with the aim of making a planning submission in February 2015. Transition of services is scheduled to commence at the end of 2018. <\/p><p>  In order to establish the required number of car-parking spaces for the new children's hospital, a multi-factored approach was adopted, including a benchmarking exercise against existing children&rsquo;s hospitals. This multi-factored approach resulted in a proposal for 1,000 carparking spaces. The figure will be validated following appointment of the Design Team. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700064#WRY04600","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":2045,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700064#WRY04700"},{"type":"question","counter":2046,"qnumday":751,"qnumall":"[32880\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700064#WRY04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a shortage of BCG vaccines; the action the Health Service Executive is taking to deal with same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2047,"content":"<p>I am aware that there are currently issues concerning the supply of BCG vaccine in Europe.

We will abolish the &euro;3 travel tax subject to a deal being agreed with Ryanair and Aer Lingus to re-open closed routes and bring more tourists into Ireland. If no deal can be done, there will be no reduction in the tax. In Budget 2014 the Government announced the introduction of a zero rate travel tax\u00a0initiative\u00a0as part of a process aimed at generating new airline routes into Ireland\u00a0and this came into effect from 1 April 2014. \u00a0\r\n\r\nThere has been a positive\u00a0response to the initiative from airlines the introduction of new routes and increased capacity on existing services from Dublin, Shannon, Cork and Knock. A total of 23 new services have been announced commencing in 2014 along with additional capacity on 21 existing routes from the four main airports.We will work with the Aviation Regulator to cut airport charges in order to deliver increased routes, airlines and passenger numbers.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nThere were over 24.8m passengers through Irish airports in 2013 up 4%. Dublin Airport had its third successive year of growth of passenger numbers led by a record-breaking performance on transatlantic traffic.\u00a0 As a result of this strong growth, a &euro;5.6 million rebate in airport charges is being paid to a total of 40 airlines at Dublin Airport under the growth incentive scheme. \r\n\r\nNew and additional routes have been announced out of Dublin, Shannon and Cork to North America, Europe and the UK. On 29 May 2014 the Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR) published a draft determination proposing to lower charges at Dublin Airport by 22% over the next five years.\u00a0 Stakeholders have until 31 July to make submissions on the CAR draft determination.\u00a0 A final determination is due in September 2014.\u00a0\u00a0 A modern high speed transport system is essential to ensure our economic competitiveness. We will support the expansion in range and frequency of high capacity commuter services, which will be subject to cost benefit analysis. The Public Transport Investment Programme is being rolled out in line with the &ldquo;Infrastructure &amp;amp; Capital Investment Medium Term Exchequer Framework 2012 -2016&rdquo;.\u00a0 Projects\/Programmes included in the Framework are:\r\n\r\nThe Luas Cross City Project, which will link the two existing Luas Lines in Dublin City Centre, was the key public transport project prioritised under the 5-year capital framework. The project is progressing well to agreed timelines and is on target for completion by end-2017.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther priorities included for implementation are also progressing on time and to budget as follows:\r\n\r\n- Railway Safety and Capital Maintenance Programme;\r\n\r\n- Replacement Public Service Obligation (PSO) buses;\r\n\r\n- Upgrade of existing QBCs in the GDA with emphasis on the Ballymun\/Airport\/Swords corridor;\r\n\r\n- Removal of certain pinch points\/bottlenecks including some urban rail level crossings; and\u00a0\r\n\r\n- The Regional Cities Programme which funds the development of sustainable transport projects in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.Funding will be provided on a once off basis to repair damage done to non-national roads due to recent severe weather conditions.\u00a0 As part of the 2011 Jobs Initiative an extra &euro;60 million was reallocated to regional and local roads to carry out surface restoration and road reconstruction works. Subsequently, an additional &euro;50m. was allocated to regional and local roads under\u00a0 Government stimulus measures in 2013 and funding in 2014 includes an extra &euro;50m allocated in the Budget for work on regional and local roads. In addition, as a result of the severe weather in the December\/January period the Government confirmed additional funding of &euro;16.8 million for repairs to roads damaged during the period 13 December 2013 to 6 January 2014. In addition, a further &euro;20m was allocated to local authorities in May 2014 as part of the Infrastructure Stimulus Package (Phase 4).We recognise the need to rebalance transport policy to favour public transport. We will therefore establish a Cabinet sub-committee on Infrastructure to explore the benefits to the public transport passenger of more diverse bus service provision. In December 2013, the National Transport Authority (NTA) announced\u00a0that about 10% of publicly subvented (PSO) bus services currently operated by Dublin Bus and by Bus &Eacute;ireann will be tendered out with the new services commencing in late 2016.\u00a0 These routes include some orbital routes and local routes in Dublin, and some Dublin commuter routes into Leinster as well as Waterford routes.The rural transport network is vital for rural communities as a reliable and sustainable transport service. We will maintain and extend the Rural Transport Programme with other local transport services as much as is practicable. A\u00a0major restructuring of the Rural Transport Programme (RTP) was announced in July 2013, including\u00a0the establishment of 18 Transport Co-ordination Units (TCUs) replacing the existing 35 RTP Groups, to\u00a0 manage rural transport services within their area. The new structures will maintain the focus on social inclusion, with stronger links into local policy making by local authorities and will position rural transport within a national integrated public transport network. They will ensure that the provision of rural transport services is mainstreamed as a subsidised public transport service. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe process to establish the 18 TCUs on a phased basis is well advanced with the first TCU, Local Link Kerry, launched on 20 June 2014We will review and update the regulation of taxis to ensure that taxi services are recognized as a key component of the public transport system and we will provide for a forum for discussion between the regulatory authorities and taxi providers. The Taxi Regulation Act, 2013 was enacted in October 2013. Statutory Instrument No. 163 of 2014 completed the\u00a0commencement of that Act in April this year with the exception of section 49.\u00a0The\u00a0National Transport Authority\u00a0also introduced new small public service vehicle (SPSV) regulations on 7 April\u00a02014 which introduce new measures provided for under the Act as well as consolidating and replacing the existing SPSV regulations.\u00a0We will legislate to regulate the vehicle clamping industry.\u00a0 The Vehicle Clamping Bill 2014 was published on June 9th last. The Bill is scheduled to be introduced in the Seanad on July 16th 2014. Under this Bill it will be the function of the National Transport Authority to regulate clamping activities and matters relating to appeals.We will introduce roadside drug testing programmes to combat the problem of driving under the influence of drugs.\u00a0 Section 11 of the Road Traffic Act 2014 provides for intoxicant impairment testing which will replace section 11 of the Road Traffic Act 2010.\u00a0 These non-technological tests will assist the Garda&iacute; in forming the opinion that a driver is under the influence of an intoxicant and will form part of the evidence, should a court case ensue.\u00a0 It is expected that section 11 will be commenced shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA working group chaired by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety (MBRS) and with representation from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department\u00a0was established last year to consider the scientific, operational, legislative, resource and cost issues with regard to the introduction of roadside chemical testing for drugs. The MBRS is currently finalising detailed specifications for the oral fluid roadside testing devices and expects to issue the invitation to tender for the devices later this year.It is also setting up a laboratory to test the devices. Legislation to provide for the use of such devices is currently being drafted in consultation with relevant agencies and bodies and will form part of the Road Traffic Bill to be introduced later this year.We will continue to invest in the National Cycle Policy and we will look to extend the Dublin Bikes Scheme across the wider Dublin area and to other cities and integrate the scheme much more effectively with public transport links.\u00a0 Strategic investment in sustainable travel under key programmes has been continued with on-going support for smarter travel investment committed under a 5 year multi-annual budget of &euro;65 million. . \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorks on cycling infrastructure in\u00a013 towns were completed under the 2012\/2013 Active Travel Towns programme.\u00a0 9\u00a0towns were selected under a second round of funding awarded in April 2014 in respect of the period 2014-2016. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA total of\u00a015 projects were also funded and completed under the National Cycle Network Funding Programme 2012\/2013. A further 3 projects shared in funding of &euro;6.3 million under the second tranche of NCN funding for the years 2014-2016.\r\n\r\n11 cycling projects were selected to share in the &euro;10 million set aside for the development of greenways from the recently announced &euro;200 million Government Stimulus Package for Infrastructure Development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe public bike\u00a0 schemes\u00a0 will be launched to the public\u00a0 in Cork, Limerick and Galway in Autumn 2014 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConstruction of the expansion of the dublinbikes scheme is currently on-going with several of the additional bike stations completed and operational.\u00a0 It is expected that all of the additional stations will be completed by summer of this year, which will result in the overall provision of 102 dublinbikes stations, 1,500 bikes and a total of circa 3,000 cycle stands under the full dublinbikes scheme.\u00a0 Coca cola was announced as the new sponsor for the Dublin Bikes in June 2014.Safety at sea and decent working conditions must underpin the development of the fisheries sector. We will explore the provision of an emergency towing vessel for the Coast Guard. A review study on the necessity for an Emergency Towing Vessel, and the associated risks and possible strategies that may be available to the State was undertaken and its summary findings were presented to Government on 10 July 2013.\u00a0 In the current economic climate and also having regard to the long time frame for developing consensus on a suitable multi-purpose offshore patrol vessel (M-OPV) for the future, it was decided that the focus for the next few years will be on improving pollution and accident prevention, through the range of measures outlined in the Action Plan.\r\n\r\nThe Work in Fishing Convention 2007 sets standards to protect workers in the fishing sector.\u00a0 The Department is working on developing the legislative basis to enable Ireland to ratify the Convention and implement it nationally. The Department has also engaged with the Federation of Irish\u00a0Fishermen on the development of a new logbook, which is assisting the industry in complying with the requirements of the Convention, when it enters into force.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Maritime Administration of the Department\u00a0is preparing a new Maritime Safety Strategy which will focus on reducing the number of deaths and injuries in the recreational craft, fishing, passenger and cargo vessel sectors. The development of the Strategy is being informed by a consultation process in the period June to August 2014 designed to engage a range of stakeholders and the general public.\u00a0 Publication of the new Strategy is planned for Q4 2014.All State funding will be subject to the beneficiaries signing up to a dispute resolution service, a code of governance and a new mandatory code of conduct regarding child protection in sport. Irish Sports Council (ISC) is working with Federation of Irish Sports to develop Just Sport Ireland as preferred approach for dispute resolution.\u00a0 There are currently over 40 sports signed up to Just Sport Ireland and six adopting their own dispute resolution services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISC&rsquo;s recognition and funding application procedures require all sports bodies to meet a certain standard of governance. In addition, the ISC are encouraging all funded bodies to sign up to the Governance Code for Community and Voluntary Organisations. The code encourages organisations to agree to operate to key principles in order to run their organisation more effectively in areas such as leadership, transparency and accountability and behaving with integrity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ISC has committed to working with Dept. Children and Youth Affairs and other appropriate authorities in implementing any new codes around child protection.A number of positions on the Sports Council&rsquo;s governing Board will be made directly electable. This was considered as part of the proposed Sport Ireland legislation which is currently being prepared.\u00a0 It was decided that the Bill will not provide for 'Directly electable positions'.In future sports funding should prioritise projects which further greater participation in sport on a local and national level. New rounds of Sports Capital Programme advertised in March 2012 and January 2014 with a focus on projects that will increase participation in sport. 2036 applications were received in response to the latter round and successful applications were announced on 3 July 2014. In total, &euro;40.5m will be allocated for 880 sports projects across the country.The National Sports Facilities Strategy will become the blueprint for the future development of all sports facilities in the country and will inform any future investment on sports infrastructure.\u00a0 One of the Department's priorities for 2014 is the development of a Policy Statement for Irish Sport.\u00a0 The aim of the statement is to articulate the various policies that exist in sport into one single document and set out the objectives in this area. \u00a0\u00a0The statement will take account of existing documents such as the draft\u00a0National Sports Facilities Strategy which was published as a discussion document in 2012.\u00a0We will prioritise the Tourism Marketing Fund as an essential pillar of our tourism strategy and will ensure the best return on Exchequer spending. A total of &euro;35.476m has been allocated to the Tourism Marketing Fund for 2014.\u00a0This will ensure that the Business and Marketing Plan for Tourism Ireland for 2014 is fully resourced to meet its objectives. This plan was approved by the North South Ministerial Council on 22 January 2014.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasures to ensure that marketing programmes provide the greatest possible value and impact are being further developed by Tourism Ireland, under the oversight of the Departments, and regular reviews of marketing programmes are undertaken by Tourism Ireland in association with the tourism industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOverseas visit numbers to Ireland reached 6.986m in 2013 (CSO):\u00a0 +7.2% on 2012.\u00a0 The latest CSO figures show that visit numbers for the period February-April 2014 are up 7.5% when compared to the corresponding period of 2013.\u00a0\u00a0 14,000 more people (+11.4%) were employed in &lsquo;Accommodation and Food Services&rsquo; in the first quarter of 2014, on a seasonally adjusted basis, compared to the same period in 2013.Marketing campaigns will be developed in emerging long haul markets such as China, Russia, India, Japan and the Middle East, using the Tourism Marketing Fund. Recovery of market share in Britain will also be a key priority in a revamped tourism strategy. Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s 2014 marketing plan included a range of measures to encourage growth in visitor numbers from emerging long haul markets, including working with key trade partners to ensure their marketing activities facilitate maximising our reach across target segments.\u00a0 Tourism Ireland will continue to work with the relevant visa authorities to exploit further opportunities to promote the short-stay visa waiver programme through publicity, media trips and collaboration with UK Visa Offices to maintain and increase awareness in developing markets. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVisits from long-haul markets grew by +15.1% in 2013.\u00a0 For the period from February-April 2014, visits from long-haul markets (excluding North America) increased by 7.0% when compared to the same period in 2013.Event tourism will be prioritised to continue to bring major fairs and events to Ireland such as the Volvo Ocean Race or Solheim Cup. The F&aacute;ilte Ireland Events Ireland team continues to work in addressing enquiries and prospective queries from event organisers, with a view to welcoming major events which have the potential to deliver increased tourism numbers and significant economic benefit.\u00a0 Some of the key events which took place in 2013 included the finals of the Heineken Cup and Amlin Challenge Cup, and the Irish Open Golf Championship. Major events (other than sporting) supported in 2013 included New Year&rsquo;s Eve Festival, Dublin, St Patrick&rsquo;s Festival, Galway Arts Festival, Kilkenny Arts Festival, Wexford Opera Festival, Cork Jazz Festival and Cork International Choral Festival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor events in 2014 will include the St Patrick&rsquo;s Festival, Giro D&rsquo;Italia, Irish Open Golf, Dublin Horse Show and the Adventure Travel World Summit. In May the island of Ireland hosted the first three stages of the world famous cycling race Giro d&rsquo;Italia. Following the spectacular opening stages in Northern Ireland, Dublin provided a host of special events and a world famous welcome for almost 200 of the world&rsquo;s top professional cyclists and their spectators. The Croke Park Classic American Football game will take place between the University of Central Florida and Penn State University at the end of August.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough the 2013 Financial Support Fund, F&aacute;ilte Ireland supported 213 conference applications for bids and marketing support for committed conferences (as of mid-December 2013). These conferences represent 131,000 international delegates and have a potential estimated business value of &euro;179 million.We will target available resources at developing and co-ordinating niche tourism products and activity packages that are attractive to international visitors focusing on food, sports, culture, ecotourism, activity breaks, water-based recreation and festivals. There is significant progress on the delivery of the National Food Tourism Implementation Framework. In 2013 F&aacute;ilte Ireland selected eight further food ambassadors to join the Food Tourism Network Development programme, bringing the total number of food &lsquo;champions&rsquo; to twenty two. These emerging food &lsquo;champions&rsquo; will actively influence and shape the future of Irish cuisine and food tourism in their region. In 2013 the focus was on individuals located along the route of the Wild Atlantic Way and the benchmarking programme took place along the established driving routes of Norway in September. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFood is one of the Key workstreams identified in F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s Business Plan for 2014.\u00a0 F&aacute;ilte Ireland has also invested in a range of walking and cycling routes around the country ranging in size and variety from looped walks to full greenways such as The Great Western Greenway. There are now over 200 accredited looped walks around the country.\u00a0 Under the &lsquo;walkers welcome&rsquo; initiative it is supporting accommodation providers who provide additional services to walkers in key walking areas.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 F&aacute;ilte Ireland has also recently undertaken significant cycle and activity tourism market research in four of our key overseas markets and the domestic market to identify both the potential market size for cycling in particular but also walking, equestrian, sailing, angling and water-based activities in Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n29 key events which align with potential for driving international visitors will be supported through the national festival fund in 2014 and 175 festivals will be supported through the regional fund.\u00a0 Improving the e-capability of our tourism product will be a priority.In excess of 3,600 tourism businesses availed of web supports in 2013. F&aacute;ilte Ireland is continuing to provide these programmes into 2014 with a particular emphasis on online selling both directly through industry websites and via 3rd party platforms.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nSupports provided to businesses in 2014 to date include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- 275 businesses provided with digital specialist input, predominantly &lsquo;National Web Tests&rsquo;, designed to review their online status and identify specific strengths and weaknesses to target areas of improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- 1345 businesses attended online &lsquo;Webinars, Web-Tutorials and\/or face-to-face &lsquo;Digital Workshops&rsquo; addressing digital topics including digital strategy; channel management; content development; social media; mobile capability etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIreland.com is live in 22 markets and is available in ten language versions.\u00a0It attracted 13.5 million unique visits in 2013, including a 21% increase in page views over 2012.\u00a0The website is designed to capitalise on the growing importance of the internet in travel and holiday planning and to harness the phenomenal growth in social media.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTourism Ireland has over 2.1 million fans worldwide on Facebook, making it the 4th most successful tourist board on the social networking site. Tourism Ireland has over 120,000 followers on Twitter making it the 3rdmost successful tourist board on this popular site.\u00a0 Tourism Ireland also has over 11 million views on its YouTube channel and is ranked number one in the world by video views.\u00a0<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects Status","counter":2108,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700065#WRZ01450"},{"type":"question","counter":2109,"qnumday":773,"qnumall":"[32408\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700065#WRZ01500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his proposals to progress the Narrow Water Bridge project in view of the commitment in the statement of Government priorities that a particular emphasis would be placed on infrastructural development in the Border region; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":2110,"content":"<p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.

The report, published in July 2013, found that there have been significant improvements in the service response to homelessness of children (that is, not in the care of their parents) in the last 10 years.  The range and standard of prevention services and services for children has improved over the past decade and this has contributed to a decrease in the number of children presenting to services as being homeless.<\/p><p>  It should of course be noted that policy responsibility for homeless young people, insofar as it extends to my Department, relates to children under 18 and any child welfare and protection concerns that may arise in the context of the Child Care Act 1991.  Young people who are homeless, either singly or as part of a family unit and not falling within this category are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authorities.  Young people who were formerly in the care of the State and presently in receipt of aftercare services will, as part of this support, have their accommodation needs identified.<\/p><p>  Children who present as being homeless to emergency services are taken into care. Such children are typically more challenging to care for as they may be out of school; have experienced neglect and serious family discord; problematic drug use; have mental health or learning difficulties.  These children often wish to be only involved with peers and they may be less inclined to engage with social work services. Services need to provide early and flexible options to engage with these children and to support them beyond their 18th birthday.<\/p><p>  Aftercare is the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person who is leaving statutory care at 18 years of age, to assist him\/her in making the transition to independent living.  The children most vulnerable to homelessness as care leavers are those leaving residential care or short term foster care placements.  Children, who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that helps them achieve positive outcomes. It is essential that these young people have an opportunity to develop a relationship with a dedicated aftercare worker who will work with them to identify their needs and ensure that services are in place to help provide them with the stability and support they need.<\/p><p>  The Child and Family Agency has advised that they are in the process of establishing interagency aftercare committees at local level bringing together Local Authorities, HSE and other statutory and voluntary agencies.  These committees will develop interagency wrap around aftercare plans for young people, particularly for those with complex needs, including housing requirements.<\/p><p>  A protocol, developed by the Child and Family Agency and the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association, in relation to dealing with accommodation issues of young people leaving care, is nearing completion.  When agreed and implemented, the protocol will see the relevant local authority housing representative attend aftercare planning meetings with social workers of the Agency in relation to those young people for whom social housing has been identified as the most appropriate form of accommodation support.  This, it is hoped, will facilitate a more efficient service for those leaving care in obtaining social housing suitable to their needs.  <\/p><p>  Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, it has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare. This is in response to concerns that there was insufficient focus in this area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis.<\/p><p>  The approach adopted is to impose a statutory duty on the Agency to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person.  The aim is to create an explicit, as opposed to implicit, statement of the Agency&rsquo;s duty to satisfy itself as to the child&rsquo;s or young person&rsquo;s need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports.  The draft provisions also clarify the range of agencies providing relevant services with which the Agency will cooperate in the development of the plan.<\/p><p>  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, at its sitting on 1st April, considered the draft aftercare provisions.

However, I can assure the Deputy that I will be giving full consideration, in conjunction with senior officials in my Department, to identifying my priorities for the remainder of my term of office.  There is much work to be done and it is not without its challenges. Obviously, to deliver in full on our commitments in the Programme for Governments is of key importance and, in that context, the following will form part of my key priorities.<\/p><p>  I intend to enact the Children First Bill which is currently awaiting Committee Stage. I also hope to pass legislation to amend the Child Care Act 1991 in respect of aftercare.<\/p><p>  I will continue to support the work of the recently-established Child and Family Agency, known as Tusla.  This is a huge undertaking which will require continued commitment and dedication and detailed engagement with the Tusla board and management team.<\/p><p>  I also hope to see the development of the National Children Detention Facilities completed.  Funding for the new facilities was secured and work is well advanced.  We will meet our Programme for Government commitment to end the practice of detaining children in prison facilities. Later in the year I intend to present a Bill to the Oireachtas to amend certain provisions of the Children Act 2001.  This will provide for the merging of the three existing Children Detention Schools into a single legal entity, and will also address a number of legal and policy issues associated with managing all children under the age of 18 on that site. <\/p><p>  I intend to launch Ireland&rsquo;s first ever Early Years Strategy and policy on &lsquo;Family Support and Parenting&rsquo;, creating an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland&rsquo;s early years sector.  I intend to continue quality improvements in early years and childcare services and to review existing targeted childcare supports. It is crucial that we deliver high standards and transparency in this area, and that all parents have confidence in our early years sector.  Maintaining the free pre-school year is an on-going challenge but one I intend to meet. <\/p><p>  In relation to adoption services, work is continuing on the Heads of Bill for the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill and I hope to be in a position to seek Government approval to publish the Heads of Bill as soon as possible.  Once approved by Government, the Heads of Bill will be sent to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for its detailed consideration.<\/p><p>  The establishment of a Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and related matters is a recent Government priority, and one I expect that will require a significant level of participation by my Department.<\/p><p>  The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People was launched in April 2014. This is an innovative whole-of-Government approach to policies for children and young people. My Department has a diverse range of lead and co-ordination functions and I will do whatever I can at a political level to assist in the roll-out of the Framework.<\/p><p>  The new Area Based Childhood programme was a key commitment of this Government aimed at tackling child poverty, building on and continuing the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme. Over the coming months I expect to see a number of the approved projects become operational.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700066#WRAA05100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Briefing","counter":2255,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700066#WRAA05150"},{"type":"question","counter":2256,"qnumday":825,"qnumall":"[32786\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700066#WRAA05200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will provide a copy of the the briefing he has received upon entering office from his Department; if he will publish the briefing; and if so, when the briefing will be published.","asker":"1101","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2257,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that I have no difficulty in providing a copy of the briefing that I received on entering office in this Department or in publishing the same briefing, subject to any necessary redactions that might be appropriate and consistent with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Acts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700066#WRAA05300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Recruitment","counter":2258,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700066#WRAA05350"},{"type":"question","counter":2259,"qnumday":826,"qnumall":"[32808\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700066#WRAA05400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his plans to recruit staff when his Department was first announced; the number of new staff recruited; the number of vacancies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2260,"content":"<p>My Department was newly established in June 2011.

This level of funding represents an increase of over &euro;558 million on the 2013 Estimate of &euro;439 million and the significant investment demonstrates that, while operating within difficult budgetary constraints, this Government is strongly committed to delivering important reforms and service developments to support children and families. <\/p><p>I consider that the estimate provision for my Department will facilitate the delivery of a significant level of public services, including those where Service Level Agreements exist as well as a number of new policy measures that include:<\/p><p>- The establishment of the new Child and Family Agency which took effect on 1<sup>st<\/sup>January 2014. This was a historic development and a significant milestone in the programme of this Government to fundamentally reform the delivery of services to vulnerable children and families. The financial allocation to the Agency in 2014 amounts to &euro;609 million, including &euro;7 million in capital funding. This resource allocation is for the continuing provision of services previously administered by the Health Service Executive, the National Educational Welfare Board and the Family Support Agency. It is acknowledged that delivering the range of service required of the Agency, within this budget, is challenging. Notwithstanding the significant level of resource provided, certain areas of expenditure, such as legal costs, have in the past proven difficult to manage within the allocated budget. The Agency is implementing significant reform to seek to achieve greater value for money in such areas and the progress in this regard is subject to ongoing monitoring and review with my Department. We will work closely with the Board and senior management of the Agency to ensure the provision within the significant resource provided, of high quality and responsive services to vulnerable children and families. <\/p><p>- An additional &euro;4 million to support implementation of the Pre-School Quality Agenda which seeks to support high standards through supporting the efforts of providers and their staff in delivering improved and more reliable quality; and to respond to concerns raised by parents;<\/p><p>- An increase of &euro;1.5 million in funding to address child poverty through the new Area Based Childhood (ABC) programme. This will bring to &euro;4 million the State funding to be invested in this initiative in 2014.   The total budget allocation for the programme over the period 2013 &ndash; 2016 is almost &euro;30 million.  <\/p><p>- &euro;31m in capital funding to facilitate the continuation of construction work on the new Children Detention School facilities in Oberstown, Lusk, Co. Dublin. The timeline for the project will see the first three residential units available in the third quarter of 2014 and will be prioritised for the transfer of 17 year old boys from adult prison facilities, currently in St Patrick`s Institution. <\/p><p>Other important areas being supported in 2014 are the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which has a funding provision of &euro;175 million. Some 4,300 pre-school services are participating in the programme and approximately 68,000 children are currently benefiting from it. In addition, in excess of &euro;50 million is also being made available to support the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services by the voluntary youth sector for all young people including those in disadvantaged communities.<\/p><p>More recently, a further &euro;5 million in capital funding has been made available to my Department in the current year for childcare under the Phase 4 Infrastructure Stimulus which is being introduced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.   I am currently considering the best options for the use of this additional funding and will be making further announcements in this regard in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700066#WRAA05700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Interdepartmental Meetings","counter":2264,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700066#WRAA05750"},{"type":"question","counter":2265,"qnumday":828,"qnumall":"[32810\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700066#WRAA05800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of interdepartmental meetings his officials have held with other Departments about services for children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It represents a whole of Government approach comprising 163 commitments, runs from 2014 - 2020 and will accommodate a number of constituent strategies.  The Framework sets out and centralises common outcomes, it captures policy commitments, prioritises key transformational goals necessitating action and aims to ensure an innovative and effective way of working.  The document also identifies Departmental leaders and stakeholders with regard to those commitments and I expect that, as such, it will require and generate a considerable number of meetings and discussions.  As such it provides a roadmap for future interdepartmental engagement with regard to services for children and young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071700066#WRAA05900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2267,"content":"<p>Question No. 829 answered with Question No. 822.<\/p>"}]
