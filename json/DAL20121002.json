I signed a commencement order on 30 August 2012.  Since the Bill passed, considerable work has been undertaken to prepare the scheme to go live.<\/p><p>This included training workshops conducted with the banks to prepare for the scheme, bilateral legal agreements negotiated with the banks to participate in the scheme, an accreditation process undertaken for banks to participate and the drafting of the necessary scheme under section 5 of the Act.

Nevertheless, we have delivered on our quarterly commitments under the action plan for jobs in terms of the credit guarantee scheme. <\/p><p> With the consent of my colleagues the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I have now made the necessary scheme under section 5 of the Act.  The scheme, which is SI 343 of 2012, was laid before the Oireachtas on 13 September.  Officials in my Department are working on the final arrangements in conjunction with the participating banks and the operator of the scheme, Capita Assets Services.  Launch of the scheme is imminent.<\/p><p> With regard to the interest rate, this will be a matter for the individual participating banks.

I look forward to working with him.<\/p><p>  I want to raise a couple of issues arising out of the Minister's response.  The Minister has missed his target in terms of the assurance given on passage of the Credit Guarantee Bill 2012 at the end of the previous D\u00e1il term that the scheme would be up and running in quarter three.  We are now into quarter four.  I cannot understand the reason all of the technical issues to which the Minister referred were not addressed while the scheme was being negotiated and all the heavy lifting was under way.  Issues such as training, briefing of the banks and so on should have been addressed in parallel with the legislative process.  The Minister knew, given the Government majority and broad support of the House for the legislation, that it would be passed.<\/p><p>  I would like to put this matter in context.  While this training, briefing of the banks and so on is under way, the reality in terms of lending on the ground is stark, as set out by the Central Bank in its report of September last.  I know there is an understanding in the Minister's Department of the seriousness of the lending situation.  However, I fear this is not properly understood in the Department of Finance.  They are either blind or ignorant of it.  Gross &quot;new&quot; lending was down one third in the first quarter of 2012 versus the last quarter of 2011.  Only Greece has refused more small business loans than Ireland during that quarter, with one in four businesses seeking credit in Ireland being refused in the past six months versus one in 28 in Greece.  It is constantly stated that Ireland is not Greece.  However, small businesses seeking loans would get an easier hearing in Greece while there is a continual faffing around here in terms of the introduction of the loan guarantee scheme.<\/p><p>  I am incredibly concerned that it is being left to the banks to set the interest rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200004#B00200","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speech","time":1349183100,"counter":12,"content":"<p>It is a scandal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200004#B00300","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1349183100,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Has nothing been learned that the banks are once again being put in the driving seat of a scheme put in place to guarantee the future of small businesses?

The Minister need not bother reading out the statistics supplied to him by the Department of Finance in regard to the Credit Review Office.  Businesses on the ground are not getting finance.  If they are, they are getting it at penury rates and conditions and only in respect of the re-financing of existing working capital.  As such, this lending cannot be defined as new.  While people are being trained and we are negotiating interest rates, businesses are laying off people and are unable to create jobs or access whatever demand exists.<\/p><p>  When will this money be in the pipeline and when will a business be able to apply for money from the scheme?

We are seeking to introduce schemes to assist where the system is not working.  It is important we give a break, through the provision of microfinance, to those wishing to start up a business.  We are also seeking to introduce a scheme for loan guarantees.<\/p><p>To answer Deputy Calleary's point, the banks are still those who give the loan.  Where a loan has been turned down the credit guarantee scheme is applied, and in return for this guarantee we charge a 2% premium on top of the rate which would otherwise have been provided to the lending.  Our scheme is to intervene where people are turned down wrongly because of a system whereby the bank rejected the risk on the grounds of collateral or because of the sector.  This intervention is very targeted.<\/p><p> As the Deputy stated, I accept wider issues exist with regard to banking.

To reverse this trend and deliver our target of 100,000 extra jobs by 2016 will require a major transformation in the economy.  The new economy which we must build will be based on enterprise, innovation and exporting.  For the Government to promote this transformation will require progress on a number of fronts, including improving competitiveness, improving access to finance, embedding a jobs agenda within the necessary fiscal consolidation, taking strategic action to facilitate growth in sectors with significant potential and improving the capacity to convert good ideas into good jobs.<\/p><p>  The action plan for jobs seeks to integrate work across the whole of Government to deliver the focus on employment.

Nobody disagrees with that but when I asked for a breakdown of the payout from the redundancy fund over a number of years, I was told by the Minister's Department that the figures were not available.  Therefore, the Minister did not know how many large or small companies were involved.  She made the decision completely ill prepared.  I fear she will do the same again.

Ensuring more such businesses can start up, expand and export is a key pillar of our plans for jobs and growth.  For this reason, the Government has decided to implement an ambitious reform of the delivery of services to small and micro businesses.  This will include the development of a new small and microbusiness division within Enterprise Ireland as a centre of excellence in the provision of supports to that sector; the dissolution of the county and city enterprise boards, CEBs, and the transfer of their functions, assets and liabilities to Enterprise Ireland; the establishment of local enterprise offices, LEOs, to provide a high quality, innovative, one-stop shop support service for small businesses within local authorities and early access to services provided by national bodies; the integration of key local authority business services into the LEOs; and the promotion of a local environment in which enterprise can thrive.<\/p><p>  Not only is it important that this restructuring be conducted as a priority, we must also ensure the new model is fit for purpose.  A high level implementation working group chaired by my Department is progressing the range of issues involved, including a focus on functions, structures and staffing, all of which will form the basis of a detailed and ambitious service level agreement between Enterprise Ireland and the local authorities.  A project plan is in preparation that will set out clear milestones and timelines for implementation.  I intend to complete the process as rapidly as possible.<\/p><p>  In tandem with the work of the implementation working group, my Department is engaged with the Office of the Attorney General regarding the detailed primary legislation that will be necessary to implement the new arrangements.

To this end, I plan to deliver a series of significant interim milestones during the transitional arrangement.

That is certainly true of this Government.  The majority of the State's employment is found in small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  Some 2,200 new businesses open every month.  However, 1,400 businesses also close every month.  Whenever we discuss this issue with the Government, it tells us that steps forward are being taken.  While there have been some steps forward, for example, in terms of foreign direct investment, there have also been major steps back.  On balance, the latter worsen the State's unemployment situation.<\/p><p>  Last week, the Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation received evidence from the Irish Exporters Association, IEA.  Like us, it has seen a vacuum develop within the supports for SMEs.  The city and county enterprise boards, CEBs have been in a state of chaotic limbo since Mr. Batt O'Keeffe was the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  The evidence to the committee suggests this situation is costing jobs.<\/p><p>  I do not mean this personally, but there is a vacuum in this area because there is a vacuum in the Department.  Ineptitude in the Minister of State's small enterprise section is allowing a critical sector that is heavily dependent on job creation to flounder.  We are dealing not only with significant economic challenges, but also with a lack of leadership on the part of the Minister of State.  The Government has been in power for nearly 18 months, yet he was unable to provide a date for when the new regime would be in place.

The Minister, Deputy Burton, informed the joint committee that the European Commission is expected to publish a set of proposals in early December in the form of a youth transitions package.  The main element of the forthcoming package is expected to be a proposal for a youth guarantee aiming to ensure targeted young people are either working or in appropriate training or work experience within a specified time after becoming unemployed.

However, it is clearly Commissioner Andor's intention that there will be a shift in emphasis towards youth unemployment and youth guarantees.  That is the implication of what he is seeking to do.<\/p><p>  With regard to the domestic economy, I take Deputy Wallace's point.  For a start, F\u00c1S became solely focused on apprenticeships within the construction sector whereas the reality, if one examines the German and other successful continental European markets, is their apprenticeships models have a much broader industrial base.  The EU is seeking to promulgate the building of a wider base of apprenticeships for member states.  The role of SOLAS and the reorganised VECs will be in this area and the Deputy ought to table a question in this regard to the Minister for Education and Skills.<\/p><p> On the wider issue of the strategy for tackling unemployment raised by Deputy Clare Daly, we all know about financial constraints on the Government.  However, within that, there are a number of strands in the strategy.  One element is to make financial consolidation, which is essential, more job friendly.  For example, selling old assets in order to invest in new assets is a way of becoming more dynamic.  Examining the establishment of funds to exploit through NewERA and infrastructure can drive potential.  Equally, the action plan for jobs considers how to get the whole of Government to move to a more pro-employment area.  Pathways to Work, from the Minister for Social Protection, is about identifying those who are disadvantaged in the labour market and seeking to support them to give them an opportunity to take up employment.

In the three years prior to taking office, over 300,000 jobs were lost.  The collapse of the property bubble brought our banking system to a point of collapse and employment in the construction sector fell by 60%.  The surge in unemployment is the direct consequence of these failed policies.  A huge task of economic transformation is necessary to reverse these trends and get employment growing.  <\/p><p>  There are two major elements to the Government&#8217;s response to unemployment &#8211; Pathways to Work and the action plan for jobs.  The aim of the action plan for jobs is to create a supportive environment for enterprise to create and sustain new jobs.  We have set an ambitious but realistic target of creating 100,000 jobs by 2016.<\/p><p>  The aim of Pathways to Work is ensure that as many opportunities as possible go to people who are currently on the live register, particularly those who are long-term unemployed.  It has an objective of ensuring that at least 75,000 of those currently long-term unemployed will move into employment by 2015.  It also aims to reduce the average time spent on the live register from 21 months to less than 12 months by the end of 2015.<\/p><p>  The establishment of the new integrated national employment and entitlements service will transform the nature and level of engagement between our employment services and those who are unemployed.  It will also provide better targeted services to both job seekers and employers.  The labour market activation measures outlined in Pathways to Work include over 85,000 job placement and work experience places to be delivered this year by the Department of Social Protection, and over 450,000 training and education places to be delivered by the Department of Education and Skills.  In addition, the financial supports available to employers who recruit a person who is long-term unemployed have been improved.  These include Revenue&#8217;s job assist scheme and the employer&#8217;s PRSI exemption scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection.  The Government has been actively promoting these schemes to employers in recent months, with the support of business representative bodies.  We must continue to do all we can to facilitate the return to work of those who have lost their jobs.  I am currently preparing the 2013 action plan for jobs on behalf of the Government and will be exploring further measures which can be taken to transform our economy and support job creation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200012#K00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","time":1349186700,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Long-term unemployment is at a critical level.

The Government is tinkering around the edges.  This Government and the last Government have taken \u20ac24 billion out of the economy and at the same time the private sector has taken \u20ac30 billion out of the economy.  Sucking that level of money out of the economy leads to the economy collapsing.  The Government has been involved in a pro-cyclical policy, making the trough deeper.  By these policies, the Government has taken a kango hammer to the Irish economy and it is in disorder as a result.<\/p><p>  There are obvious solutions, and not just those proposed by Sinn F\u00e9in.

Unemployment in Donegal is very high.  The Border region has an unemployment rate of 16.3% compared with the national average of 14.7%.  To get foreign direct investment into Donegal, or even indigenous start-up companies, the local enterprise officers will be rolled out, which will start with small companies, which will be the driver of the engine of growth in the economy.  They will also work with the third level institutes to facilitate the private sector.  Innovation vouchers are available to help those with an idea to commercialise it.  While getting a big company to locate there is very welcome, start-up companies are also very important and there are a number of such companies that believe opportunity still exists.<\/p><p>  I agree this is a challenge but it is difficult, despite the success of the IDA, to give a clear, specific plan.  There will be a focus on the north-west offices with the IDA, which brings investors into Donegal all the time.  It is to be hoped there will be direct engagement that will benefit Donegal.  That is my commitment as Minister of State, to ensure we get employment into the north west.<\/p><p>  Donegal should also take up the coastal development opportunities outlined by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the development of fisheries.  All those offer potential employment.  This is a challenging job but the focus of Government is to attract foreign direct investment into Ireland.

I have established a<i><\/i>manufacturing development forum to set out a strategic vision for 2020 aimed at increasing employment in the sector.  Its membership comprises key industry players and I have instructed the forum to identify impediments to job creation in manufacturing areas and opportunities for immediate job creation.  High value production is the future of indigenous manufacturing, and growth sectors are pharmaceutical, biotechnology, agriculture and food, medical technology and ICT.  A number of steps have been taken to enable indigenous manufacturing firms to specialise, develop skills and value and scale up, including the launch of the new potential exporters division, Enterprise Ireland&#8217;s lean business offer, the new development capital scheme and improvements to the research and development tax credit scheme.<\/p><p>  Forf\u00e1s data show that manufacturing employment grew by 1.1% in 2011, an increase of 2,198 jobs.  This reverses a trend of four continuous years of job losses, when almost 45,000 jobs were lost in manufacturing.  The bulk of the growth was in foreign-owned industry but indigenous manufacturing also increased slightly, with 92,507 employed by Irish-owned companies.  Employment growth in Irish manufacturing companies has been especially strong in the medical device, food and ICT sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200015#N00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Leaders' Questions","time":1349188500,"count":121,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200015#N00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1349188500,"counter":122,"content":"<\/a> <p>Since we last spoke in the House, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Shortall, has resigned.

What is most revealing is that while they cover medicinal products and the poisons Bill, among other things they excluded completely any reference to primary care.  Despite appointing the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, saying she would have special responsibility for primary care, there is not a mention of primary care.  Was it not then the Taoiseach, the T\u00e1naiste and their Cabinet colleagues ditched and isolated the Minister?  She was not given statutory delegation for primary care and despite knowing from freedom of information requests that she had sought it on a number of occasions, it fell on deaf ears.  Who excluded primary care from her delegated statutory authority as Minister of State?<\/p><p>  The Minister of State met the T\u00e1naiste and the Taoiseach during the summer to resolve this issue, and the suggestion was that a summer holiday might sort it out.

However, primary care, no more than public transport or any other issue, covers a range of activities.<\/p><p>  I can confirm to Deputy Martin that the position is that issues which were raised in recent days about the pharmaceutical industry and the cost of drugs, insurance claims and the issue concerning consultants being re-rostered and the substantial savings that will accrue over the coming years have all been the focus of pretty intense negotiations with conclusion in areas of these in the past period and with more to come.  In respect of the primary care centres, when I addressed this matter last week, I told Deputy Martin they were in different sectors, in that leases were involved in some, direct Exchequer funding was involved in others and, in some cases, the primary care centres would be provided under a public private partnership, PPP, system.  This is all part of the stimulus package of more than \u20ac2.5 billion brought forward by the Government which covers the areas of transport, health, justice and education, as well as the major development at Grangegorman.

We have already heard about the slashing of child benefit and I dare say this is only the tip of the iceberg over the next eight weeks of rumours and so-called leaks.  I would like to remind the Taoiseach of one thing before the Government begins its next round of imposing penalisation on the people.  Last year's budget has proved to be one of the most regressive in the history of the State, disproportionately affecting those already struggling.  As the Nobel Laureate, Joseph Stiglitz, has said, austerity never works to resolve economic downturns.  He said that austerity instead turns downturns into recessions and plunges recessions into depressions.  A succession of budgets dragging down domestic demand and delaying recovery is not the answer.  There are other options if only the Government would consider them.<\/p><p>  Increasing the effective tax rate for high earners by just 1.5 percentage points would generate an extra \u20ac650 million in additional revenue.  A wealth tax could also generate more than \u20ac200 million.  The Government would effectively get \u20ac850 million just by a moderate targeting of high earners.  Those are just two proposals the Nevin Economic Research Institute has published in its strategy for an alternative adjustment which would lead to the same deficit outcome of 7.5% of GDP but also provide for the protection of front line services and social protection.<\/p><p>  The Government's plans will result in the loss of 29,000 jobs next year, whereas this costed proposal would save 21,000 of those.  While there is no way to fast-track economic recovery, the path the Government is taking is the wrong one.  There is an alternative to penalising people while still generating the revenue required.  Does the Government intend to continue to burden those who cannot take any more or will it ensure that those can pay do?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200017#P02400","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1349189700,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to give my regards to his fellow county-people following their victory in the all-Ireland Football Championship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200017#P02500","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1349189700,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Get that over with first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200017#P02600","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1349189700,"counter":211,"content":"<p>Let me be clear about a few things.

He said that austerity rarely works.  I happened to be there to welcome 5,500 members of the International Bar Association to our country.

We have already made it clear that in our preparations for this Presidency that is where the focus will be - on the development of the Single Market and the continual opening of opportunities for jobs and business.  I invite the Deputy and others to come to the House the week after next in order to participate in the economic debate that has been requested a number of times, taking into account the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council report, the IMF report and others.<\/p><p>The Deputy can feel free to criticise Government, as I am sure he will, or to put forward constructive suggestions for consideration by the Minister for Finance as he prepares to bring his recommendations to Government.

The Government's agenda is one of cuts to the income of people who cannot afford them, many of whom are going to the wall.  One of the proposals which I put forward today would generate extra revenue through the targeting of people who can afford to pay extra.  As per that proposal, people earning \u20ac100,000 would pay an extra \u20ac1,500 in tax.  Surely these people can afford to carry that burden.  We should not be targeting cuts to child benefit at people on low incomes and those in receipt of social welfare benefits who cannot afford that hit, or be forcing them into having to go cap in hand to secure an increase.  We should be targeting the people who can afford to pay.

Prior to the ceremony, I had the honour to meet Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace where, along with other world leaders and key figures in the sporting realm I attended a reception.  We then travelled on to the Olympic Stadium for the opening ceremony, which was truly a spectacular event.<\/p><p>  Earlier in the day I met the Irish Olympic athletes who were based at the Irish camp in St. Mary's College in Twickenham.  We were greeted by the Irish team's chef de mission, Olympic silver medalist, Sonia O'Sullivan.  I congratulated all the athletes and their back-up teams for their efforts in qualifying and representing Ireland at the Olympics and said that they carried the dreams of the Irish nation with them.  I wished them all the best in their respective fields.<\/p><p>  During the course of the day, I met the Governor and Republican Party US presidential candidate, Mr. Mitt Romney, at the Embassy of Ireland.  The meeting, which was at Governor Romney's request, was an opportunity to discuss the close state of Irish-US relations, Ireland's economic recovery and the development of EU-US trade.  I informed him of our preparations for Ireland's upcoming Presidency of the EU.<\/p><p>  I returned to London on 12 August to attend the closing ceremony of the Olympic games.  I commend the Olympic organising committee on an outstanding job as the games were a huge success.  I would like to put on the record of the House my admiration for the efforts of all of those who competed for Ireland and, in particular, my congratulations to those who won medals.  I would also like to take this opportunity to repeat once again my heartfelt appreciation and gratitude to all those who represented Ireland in the Paralympics.  The Government has since hosted receptions in Farmleigh for the Olympic and Paralympic athletes, their coaches, families and friends.<\/p><p>  The UK Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, invited me to attend an event on &quot;hunger&quot; which he was hosting prior to the closing ceremony.  A small group of countries with a high profile in the area of nutrition were invited to participate in this global event, along with representatives of international organisations, the private sector and civil society.  The event aimed to raise the level of political commitment to combat the problem and to stimulate the development of new products and services to improve nutritional levels in developing countries.  I was invited to contribute on the overall challenge of under-nutrition and had an opportunity to emphasise the priority Ireland will attach to building further political commitment to address hunger and nutrition during our forthcoming Presidency of the EU in 2013.  I stated that the eradication of hunger is a cornerstone of Ireland's foreign policy and that we are determined to play our part in putting solutions into practice.  I informed the group that Ireland spends 20% of its Irish Aid budget on programmes that directly address hunger and nutrition and that we will continue to meet this target.<\/p><p>  Following the global nutrition event, I had a meeting with Mr. Ertharin Cousin of the World Food Programme.  I congratulated her on her recent appointment as executive director of the WFP.  I reiterated Ireland's priority in eradicating hunger and achieving global food security and said that I looked forward to working with the WFP to deliver the international conference on hunger, nutrition and climate justice during Ireland's EU Presidency.<\/p><p>  I have no immediate plans for a meeting with the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron.

I will reflect upon the letter sent by Deputy Adams.  It is important to have as comprehensive a background to these meetings as is possible.  As Deputy Adams is aware, I met Mr. Black, the survivor of the Kingsmill massacre, and the families of the victims.  I also intend to meet a group from west Fermanagh who will soon come down with the Minister, Ms Foster.  These events are an important opportunity to speak for survivors and next of kin who have lost loved ones.<\/p><p>  This morning I raised the issue of Marian Price with the Secretary of State when we met shortly after 8 a.m.  It is an issue about which we are concerned and I understand from background information that her health has improved somewhat.  It is of interest in respect of her as a person and I took the opportunity to raise the issue this morning.<\/p><p>  We also discussed the question of dissident groups and the importance of keeping a focus on community development.  The covenant centenary march went off without any great disruption, although there were aspects of sectarianism in some incidents.  It is important to keep in perspective that the decade of centenary commemorations will be overseen sensitively and in an understanding and comprehensive way by both Governments and we have a keen interest in this.<\/p><p>  For the Deputy's information, we also discussed having a strategy for involvement in working with our colleagues in Northern Ireland.  Co-operation can be enhanced in the areas of health, hospital care, education and tourism.  We have appointed some personnel to the permanent representation in Brussels as we prepare for the Presidency of the European Union which will be of interest and assistance to our colleagues in Northern Ireland.  Work is being done by both Governments on licensing diesel suppliers and the capacity of both Governments, through research which is being done, on putting a marker into diesel which cannot be washed out, which would deal with the extraordinary level of cross-Border activity.  I commend the customs service and the Garda for their confiscation in recent days of substantial equipment.  This activity does down the local economies of people who go about their business perfectly legitimately.<\/p><p>  There is a great deal of cross-Border involvement.  The next meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council is to be held in Armagh.  I hope to build on further involvement in visits to Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>  When we signed the strategic partnership agreement with Prime Minister Cameron it was suggested that as is appropriate, I as Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister would visit on an alternate basis to show interest in the work of the Executive and the Assembly and also with regard to communities in Northern Ireland.  I have met a number of people in the course of normal business here who have expressed views and proposals which in some cases are worthy of following up.  I invite Deputy Adams to put forward his views on which we might follow through.  It is not true to say we do not have a strategy, interest or involvement in building on the foundations of the Good Friday Agreement for the betterment of all communities.  I hope over a period of time to demonstrate this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200019#R00400","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1349190900,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his response.  I very much welcome his assertion that the Government will continue to improve co-operation across the island on a range of issues.  Like the Taoiseach, I join in commending the customs service and the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na on the arrests and confiscation of equipment in diesel laundering plants.  It always strikes me, including with regard to what happened last night, that those arrested are almost immediately released.  Not only are both states denied a tax intake but environmental damage is caused by the huge amount of sludge that is dumped, not least in counties Louth and Monaghan.  I have met the PSNI and Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na on this issue.<\/p><p>  There is much in what the Taoiseach said with which I agree.  I was in Belfast at the weekend and I very much welcomed that the big parade went off peacefully, apart from a few unsightly sectarian examples.  No one was injured or killed and this is something to be glad about in such a charged atmosphere.<\/p><p>  I will return to the point I made earlier.  I am not convinced, and more importantly the families of Pat Finucane, the Ballymurphy victims and others are not convinced, that the British Government wants to deal with these issues.  David Cameron is not responsible for them; he was not there and he may not have even been born.  The only way the British Government can be brought to deal with these issues is if the Government gives Mr. Cameron a case which is absolutely and totally undeniable.  The Government has the wherewithal to do so because such a case exists.  The people of Ballymurphy will co-operate.  When Deputy Martin was the Minister for Foreign Affairs he visited the site, walked the ground and met the people.  The same thing happened with regard to other instances.  The Finucane family has a proven track record on the issue affecting it and those involved in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings also deserve support.<\/p><p> With respect, what I suggest is logical.  The Taoiseach should take some of his very fine civil servants and set them to deal with the information aspect.  Then, if the Taoiseach is satisfied the case is made, he should send it to Mr. Cameron so when he next meets him it is on his desk and he cannot dodge it, and it is more than something mentioned at a meeting but is something in which the Government is involved.  If the British do not deal with it then the Taoiseach should arm the consular and diplomatic services, our friends in the United States and in the diaspora and other governments which praise the peace process but want to see it brought to completion.  They are allies in this task.  Once again I commend this approach to the Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200019#R00500","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1349190900,"counter":247,"content":"<p>This morning I raised the case of Pat Finucane with the Secretary of State and repeated to the Right Honourable Ms Villiers our position following the decision of Judge Cory, appointed after the Weston Park talks, namely, that whatever recommendations he makes will be followed through by both Governments; that I regard it as an international agreement; and that the British Government did not honour its element of it and instead chose a review under Mr. da Silva which was not satisfactory for the Finucane family.<\/p><p>It is not acceptable in the sense that there was a clear agreement between both Governments and this Government set up the Smithwick tribunal arising from the Cory recommendations in so far as this jurisdiction is concerned.

What new ideas, if any, did the Taoiseach bring to the conference?  Were the results of a major study by a non-governmental organisation called Tax Justice Network, written by James Henry, formerly of McKinsey & Co and an expert on tax havens, that an incredible $21 trillion are salted away by the super-rich global elite in offshore accounts, trusts, etc., relayed there?  In view of that stunning information, how does the Taoiseach justify joining with the British Prime Minister in opposing even a modest transaction tax on the vast billions circulating through the world and European financial markets on a daily basis?  Even a modest wealth tax on this elite is opposed, which in Europe and elsewhere refuses to invest in the productive economy and is instead facilitated by the ten top private banks, including the likes of Goldman Sachs - the great vampire squid, as it was famously alluded to in an American magazine - sucking up the resources for its services to big business and the super-rich internationally?  Is it not very clear that on the basis of this information, emergency action, taxes and levies on these elements of wealth need to be introduced on a European and world basis?

It does not just apply to the area mentioned by Deputy Higgins.  For example, the Hunger Task Force report of 2008 called on Ireland to prioritise three particular areas.  The first was to improve small-holder agricultural productivity in Africa, particularly among women farmers.  The second was to target the prevention of maternal and infant under-nutrition and the third was to promote governance and leadership to reduce global hunger at both national and international level.  The Deputy is aware of Ireland's long tradition of involving itself in these matters over the years, from the concerts organised by well-known Irish musicians from Bob Geldof to the campaign by U2 for the elimination of debt in the Third World.  These people are all part of that programme.<\/p><p>  The event took place in Downing Street and included a number of leaders, political personnel and organisational personnel from non-governmental organisations, with particular reference to Africa and North Africa.  Contributions were made by these people at the event called by the Prime Minister.  One thing that struck me was the impact of nutrition being made available and dealt with for children from birth to two years of age who suffer from stunted growth, which carries through to other families.  For example, a British entrepreneur has a foundation dealing with the provision of nutritious foods through peanut butter and such additions.  The impact it can make in a few short weeks is extraordinary.  There was a good deal of discussion about that and where it could lead.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, equality and mental health, Deputy Lynch, pointed out, the Step Up Nutrition or SUN concept is of importance as well.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is also aware of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the William J. Clinton Foundation and the impact they have made, particularly in Africa with regard to related matters there.  Small-holder agricultural productivity, particularly among women farmers in Africa, is of particular interest to Ireland.  <\/p><p>Over the years and under a range of Governments, Ireland has become recognised as a country that leads in a sensitive, caring way when dealing with under-nutrition, malnutrition and hunger elimination, both through the practical demonstration of food production standards and the provision of water and facilities.  For a small country, we have a disproportionate impact, as has been evident in our involvement in Lesotho and other regions.<\/p><p> The meeting lasted for an hour or an hour and a half and was based in particular on contributions from African personnel.  One of those present was the Somalian runner Mo Farah, who received this year Olympic gold medals in both the 5,000 m and 10,000 m.  Also present was the former world record holder, Haile Gebrselassie, an ambassador and proponent of the work that is under way.  Mo Farah, the Olympic double champion, spoke with great feeling about his homeland and other countries in the region.  He referred to the impact of credible, commonsense action to deal with malnutrition and under-nutrition and to the agri-sector in particular.<\/p><p> The proposition made by Ireland, based on its involvement over the years, was recognised by the leaders present at the meeting.   We intend to maintain expenditure under our Irish aid programme at 20%.  Ireland is the only country in the world to have made and delivered upon such a commitment.  This has been the case over the years and it is commendable.  The T\u00e1naiste recently announced that it is our intention to maintain expenditure at its current level in dealing with these particular areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200020#S01200","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349192100,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I commend all those involved in the struggle to improve nutrition and end hunger.  They should receive every support.  The point I am making to the Taoiseach, however, is that the resources deployed in this regard are a fraction of what could be brought to bear in a concerted way if we had a very different financial system internationally and a different order of priorities.  Does the Taoiseach not see any contradiction between his wish to end suffering and the fact that European and other world leaders, among whom he mixes so effortlessly and who slap him on the back as the best of friends, deploy significantly more resources to areas such as armaments production than to the resolution of human problems such as hunger, whose solution is crucial?<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach mentioned in his reply two billionaire so-called philanthropists.  The poverty-stricken and hungry are dependent on the kindness of people who make billions, using all kinds of tax havens in the process to maximise the profits of their corporations.  Does this not strike the Taoiseach as obscene in reality?  The wealth these people have created, including the \u20ac15 trillion that has been salted away, is created by human labour, by hundreds of millions of people.  Should it not be taxed in an emergency fashion through transaction and wealth taxes?  With his friend Prime Minister Cameron, why does the Taoiseach not open up a new front in this regard rather than apply the Band-Aid which, unfortunately, will not in any way resolve the crisis of world hunger?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200021#T00200","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speech","time":1349192100,"counter":262,"content":"<p>If we had had a very different financial order and competence ourselves over the years, we would be in an even stronger position to deal with elements of this.  The Deputy asked me our view on the financial transaction tax.  I have answered this in the House on many occasions.  We have not supported a financial transaction tax because it would place our financial services centre and, as a consequence, our economy at a disadvantage.  Were it to be applied on a global scale, or throughout the European Union, we would have a different perspective.  It is not applied globally and, for that reason, Ireland has a very clear view.  It will retain such a view during its Presidency.  It will run its Presidency as competently as it can but it will not become an advocate of a measure that could place our economy and, as a consequence, our people at a serious disadvantage.<\/p><p>  Partly through the programmes adopted by Ireland, the Union and many other countries, the region in question will expand enormously economically in the coming 20 years.  Many countries in north Africa are expanding at a rate of 6%, 7% or 8% per year.  Clearly, there is enormous potential in this regard.  When one speaks to those affected directly by the Irish aid programme and expenditure thereunder, one notes that they value the aid very much.  They commend the NGOs and the Irish Aid assistance programme.  I am sure they feel this way about other countries also.  We continue to keep on that path development.  It is in the interest of Ireland and the African peoples.  I am sure the Deputy supports that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200021#T00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1349192100,"counter":263,"content":"<p>The reply to this batch of questions shows up the Taoiseach's reluctance to engage in any substantive way with EU matters or to embark on a substantive diplomatic initiative.

Instead, we are hearing accounts of small encounters or encounters exaggerated by the Taoiseach's spin doctors; it seems the real work is left to others.<\/p><p>  At the weekend, the Taoiseach made a seemingly strong statement demanding that Germany and other countries keep to his understanding of the June deal.  This had more than a hint of <i>The Skibbereen Eagle<\/i> about it because, in reality, the Taoiseach indicated he had serious bilateral talks with leaders of only one of the three countries implicated in the statements of last week.  The Taoiseach met the Chancellor well over a year ago.  Since June, there has been no sense of there being any engagement with any leaders on the EU issue and the follow-through from the June meeting.<\/p><p>  Did the Taoiseach discuss with Prime Minister Cameron the ongoing eurozone crisis?  Did he endeavour to enlist support for Ireland's position on the separation of bank debt from sovereign debt?  Did he discuss the European position thereon?  He stated last week in the House that he felt his only role is to attend and speak at the summits.  It is time to end that policy and have a series of substantive bilateral talks with the countries that matter in respect of following through on the June meeting, including Finland, Holland and Germany.  He should keep pushing our case because it has been drifting since June.  We know what has happened.<\/p><p>  What was Prime Minister Cameron's perspective on the European Union?  Was there any sign of change in terms of his having opted out of the important negotiations?  Was there any sense of his becoming more involved or coming back within the fold?  While we welcome the bilateral funding from the United Kingdom, made available some time ago, we must acknowledge a very important issue arises in terms of the role of the United Kingdom in the unfolding eurozone crisis and the resolution thereof.  The United Kingdom could have a significant role to play and could offer significant support for Ireland.<\/p><p>  Very little has happened over the past year and a half on any of the issues pertaining to the North that we discuss here week in, week out, be it the Finucane case or the prisoners in Maghaberry.

He is aware that not only did I introduce the opportunity to report to the House before European Council meetings, but also after.  The Deputy's question reads: \"...asked the Taoiseach the matters he raised during recent contacts with Prime Minister Cameron.\"  I have answered the question for Deputy Adams, who has tabled three questions.  Deputies Higgins, Boyd Barrett and Martin each have one question.  The last occasion when I met Prime Minister Cameron face to face was as a result of his inviting me to attend Downing Street at a meeting he had called during the course of the Olympic Games to deal with the issue of hunger and under-nutrition in Africa.  There was nothing else on the agenda but that.  There was no opportunity to raise matters such as Northern Ireland, the EU, the eurozone, financial transaction taxes, the relationship between Ireland and England or sterling versus the euro.  That is the situation.<\/p><p>  I am quite prepared to have discussions here about the EU as often and as long as Deputy Martin wants.  Suffice it to say that every Minister who goes abroad on EU business has a full programme and sees it through fully.  The Deputy is aware of the intense level of negotiation that has gone on between Department of Finance officials and others with their counterparts in France, Spain, Germany and so on, the Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF.  The Deputy is aware of the Minister for Finance following through with his counterparts in Paris, Rome and Berlin before he went to the informal meeting in Cyprus.  I also reported to the House last week on my own direct meetings with Prime Ministers Samaras, Rajoy and Monti.  We fixed a date for a meeting with President Hollande.  Tomorrow, I have a meeting with President Barroso of the Commission, President Van Rompuy of the Council and other leaders who are there.  These discussions will obviously centre around the eurozone crisis and our priorities for the Presidency, which will reflect dealing with that crisis.  As I told Deputy Adams earlier, I discussed a range of issues with Secretary of State Villiers this morning in regard to Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>  It seems as if Deputy Martin thinks that I should spend my time travelling around Europe.  I am much more interested in results.  The last big result was on 29 June when the Council of the Heads of Government decided to break the link between sovereign and bank debt, that Ireland's debt sustainability issue would be looked at and that we would get equal treatment.  Commissioner Rehn, who has been very supportive, has said that he would like to see that completed by the end of October.  I do not think that is feasible, but what I am interested in, and what the Minister for Finance is taking very skilfully down the line, is getting the best deal for the Irish people and the Irish taxpayer in this regard.  I will say that very clearly during the course of face-to-face meetings tomorrow, including with Mr. Barroso, and to the other leaders when I meet them at the next European Council meeting, as I did last week.<\/p><p>  Deputy Martin seems to think that we should be travelling all of the time and having meetings.  We have a very big team in the permanent representation and Ministers engage directly with officials on a constant basis.  I would like to think that we could have a conclusion to this, but it is not that simple, as the Deputy is well aware.  The difficulty is compounded by electoral prospects in other countries, which are always part of this mix, as the Deputy is well aware.<\/p><p>  The interpretations that can be put on the future of the banking union, whether it should be on a stepped approach for the systemic banks in the first instance or all of the banks together, and other issues are for discussion.  They arise from a very clear decision that was made.  The statement last weekend merely reiterates the fact that the Heads of Government made a very clear decision and I want to see that followed through and concluded.  What it means is that the link would be broken, banks could be recapitalised directly by putting a structure in place to do that, this country's capacity to meet our debt repayments would be reviewed and, in the context of deals for others, Ireland would get equal treatment.  That is the decision and that is what I want to see implemented, as I am sure Deputy Martin does.  While I am sure that elements - the promissory note and the sustainability of the bank debt - can be very technical and complex, the decision as a foundation is very clear and we want to see that followed through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200022#U00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1349192700,"counter":266,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach's answer confirmed more or less the points that I made in my question.

Perhaps that should have been an opportunity to ask slightly broader and deeper questions about the priorities in the world and how well governments are dealing with the issues facing humanity.  The Taoiseach would probably agree that big international events like that allow us to think about what is happening in the world and for humanity.<\/p><p>  The import of Deputy Higgins's question is whether the Taoiseach, Prime Minister Cameron and the others attending the summit questioned why we have such an extent of hunger in the world, when the hunger is evident in a world of plenty.  We do not have hunger today as we did 300 years ago because there is not enough food in the world.  The irony is that millions of people are starving and go hungry when there is more food in the world than the world's population could possibly eat.  Therefore, leaders like the Taoiseach, Prime Minister Cameron and other European leaders must consider the issue of the fair and civilised distribution of food, wealth and resources in our society.  Our economic system is failing disastrously in that regard and moving in precisely the opposite direction.  Rather than moving to greater equality and better distribution, it is moving the other way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200023#V05500","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1349193300,"counter":339,"content":"<p>Could we have a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200023#V05600","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1349193300,"counter":340,"content":"<p>The differential between those at the top and those at the bottom is growing wider every year, including in this country, where the top 10% of people have 14 times the income of those at the bottom.

There are reports clearly indicating a loss of up to 15,000 jobs in the European Union if a financial transaction tax were imposed.  That is a matter of opinion.  There are other countries in Europe with a very strong objection to a financial transaction tax.  We object to this on the basis of it being discriminatory, and if it had a severe impact on our economy, it could be disastrous.  If it were applied in a global sense, we could have a very different perspective.  Our membership of the European Union and eurozone allows in some cases for those who want to pursue the area of enhanced co-operation to do so.  We have indicated that clearly while arguing the issue at European Council meetings.<\/p><p>  At the meeting in Downing Street during the course of the Olympic Games, which dealt with hunger, under-nutrition and malnutrition, there were contributions from a number of representatives from African non-governmental organisations, as well as African leaders.  They reported on the activities ongoing in their individual countries and suggestions for dealing with malnutrition in that sense.<\/p><p> As I said, the T\u00e1naiste, who visited Africa some time ago, outlined Ireland's programme as being the only country in the world where 20% of our foreign aid is focused directly on dealing with the question of malnutrition and hunger elimination.  I made the suggestion that because we will hold the Presidency of the European Union until June of next year, and the British Government will hold the presidency of the G8, we should co-operate at both those leadership levels to further pursue proposals to deal with hunger elimination, malnutrition and under-nutrition.  I found the conclusions of the meeting in that regard were very satisfactory and we will build on that during the course of our Presidency with our British colleagues who will have the presidency of the G8.<\/p><p> The contribution made by the double Olympic champion, Mo Farah, spoke for itself.  As a refugee from Somalia, he noted the appreciation and consequence of the food aid programme, the efforts to eliminate hunger and deal with the malnutrition and under-nutrition were very strong.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett is aware, the European Union has the strongest and most comprehensive food aid programme in the world, and Ireland has been an outstanding contributor to many causes over the years.  We are at 20% in terms of the spend of our Irish Aid programme on the elimination of hunger, malnutrition and under-nutrition and the T\u00e1naiste has confirmed that we will maintain that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200023#V05800","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349193900,"counter":343,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach has not answered my main question.

People of all age groups use the service, including students, workers, elderly persons and people needing to travel to Cavan General Hospital or to Dublin hospitals.  Councillor Smith detailed to me the exact difficulties that will be faced by so many people who spoke to him in recent days, who need this public transport and who are not in a position to hire taxis.  Many individuals do not have immediate family members to bring them to hospital appointments or on other necessary journeys.

The new route will increase the distance travelled.  I have been contacted by a number of people who use this service and who do not have transport to the nearest pick-up points in Charlestown or Ballaghaderreen.  They have said that there was no consultation on these changes.

First, it must be stated that I have no personal or ministerial power when it comes to bus routes and route frequencies operated by Bus \u00c9ireann.  The provision of bus services and the routes they take are operational matters for the company management in conjunction with the National Transport Authority, NTA, which is the licensing and regulatory body for public transport.  However, as the Government is the sole shareholder in the CIE companies, the re-design of this and other Bus \u00c9ireann routes is something of which I am aware and in which I am interested, so I have made inquiries with the company on the matter.<\/p><p>  Bus \u00c9ireann operate a mix of services. Some of these services are commercial.  These include school transport and Expressway which competes on the open market with private operators.  The company also operates public service obligation, PSO, services.  This PSO payment is made for the company to carry out important and necessary bus services which would not be viable were they to rely on commercial revenue alone.  Expressway services do not receive a subsidy, either directly or indirectly.  Bus \u00c9ireann's services are not as direct as their competitors and, due to that and the recession, Expressway has lost passengers and revenue as customers have opted for private providers who operate a faster service by bypassing smaller population centres. In order to gain competitiveness and achieve a break-even position, Bus \u00c9ireann had to re-design its Expressway services.<\/p><p>  I appreciate that changes to the bus services will inconvenience some passengers.  Given the financial position that Bus \u00c9ireann and the CIE companies are in, however, there is no alternative for the companies but to ensure that commercial operations operate on a commercial footing, and that means following the routes that most passengers want.<\/p><p>  Rural transport is a critical component of public transport services and it is vital for the development of a fully inclusive society, both from a social and economic perspective.  In January last, the Government approved new arrangements for the development and implementation of integrated local and rural transport services.  It was decided that the NTA would be assigned national responsibility for local and rural transport services integration, including the rural transport programme, RTP, and this has been effective since 1 April 2012.  This new role for the NTA coupled with its existing national remit for securing the provision of public passenger transport services will enable the development of better links between local and rural services and scheduled bus and rail services. This is something which is fundamental to a wholly integrated transport network.<\/p><p>  Local integration working groups have been established in some areas while in others RTP groups have been working informally with potential partners to identify transport integration opportunities.  Work has commenced on the inclusion of the RTP services in the national journey planner and on the inclusion of RTP and school transport services in reviews of public transport services being undertaken by the NTA in the South-Eastern Regional Authority area, in the Border, Midland and West area and in the South and Mid-West area.  Consideration of RTP services in these reviews will serve to highlight transport needs and offer opportunities for integration.<\/p><p>  The integration process is set to achieve the efficiencies required in the face of the challenging fiscal climate in which the country finds itself.  Some of the challenges involved in the integration process are quite complex, involve multiple players and involve matters not always within our control.  Integration can deliver a more complete and cost-effective transport service in local and rural areas that better meets the transport demands of all users.<\/p><p>  As I have indicated, Bus \u00c9ireann must ensure it meets the customer demand for limited stop services with quicker journey times in order that Expressway services are commercially viable.  Failure to react to this market demand would result in a loss of Expressway services altogether.  I appreciate the concerns of Deputies with regard to the impact on certain passengers arising from the re-design of certain Expressway routes and I have asked the chief executive of Bus \u00c9ireann to meet Oireachtas Members and brief them personally on the changes to services in the north-west.<\/p><p>  I will also direct the NTA, in its ongoing reviews of the PSO services, to take account of those places that will no longer be served by commercial services.  It should be noted that future cuts to the level of subvention for PSO public bus services will limit the scope for any new or additional services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200027#Z00400","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1349196300,"counter":547,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, replying on this matter.  I recall the Minister speaking eloquently and properly in Enniskillen about cross-Border co-operation and the real progress that has been made in the province of Ulster, especially since the Good Friday Agreement of 1998.  The route I have spoken about is Enniskillen, Swanlinbar, Bawnboy, Ballyconnell and on to Cavan.  The service is part of south Fermanagh and it has the potential to service an even bigger area in south Leitrim, as Deputy Naughten agreed, as well as west Cavan.  Bus \u00c9ireann said in a reply to local media that it was due to low customer usage, but it refused to detail the records about the numbers travelling.

That is the type of decision Bus \u00c9ireann must make when providing a commercial service.  The chief executive officer of Bus \u00c9ireann met the Wicklow and Wexford Deputies today about a similar issue, and I will use my offices to ensure the Deputies meet the chief executive officer and senior management directly to discuss this.

Therefore, I do not have the power to instruct the company to defer or change its decision.  Solutions can be found, however, albeit partial solutions.  There was a similar issue in the midlands a few weeks ago and it was possible to identify public service obligation, PSO, alternatives for people.  They might not be able to get the bus they wish but they can at least get a PSO bus to somewhere that is served by an Expressway service.  In another case, it was possible to give a licence to a private operator on a no-subsidy basis to provide a feeder service to a bigger town where passengers could then take the Expressway service.  They might not be able to get it in the town in which they live, but they at least have a service.  Those are the types of options that can be explored.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Naughten's question about fraud and travel passes, that budget comes from the Department of Social Protection.  There is a working group of officials from my Department and the Department of Social Protection examining those issues.

In that context, it makes sense to award any State work available, where possible, to people on the live register.  While I accept the guidelines issued by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to returning officers throughout the country advise that consideration be given to unemployed people, it is clear from past experience that these guidelines, weak as they are, are being largely ignored and flouted.<\/p><p>  Many of our returning officers have not even set up websites, although there is a common website format available to them.  Of those who have, only a few have application forms available for election work.  To my knowledge, none of these returning officers has made any attempt to advertise the fact that people can apply for these jobs.  If a person is motivated enough to find these secret jobs, what happens next?  The applicant fills in a form which asks for contact details and a personal public service, PPS, number.  The only other information actively sought is an applicant's current employment status and whether they have worked previously in the role.  There is a blank section to fill in other details but the form does not specifically ask about work experience, qualifications, information technology skills, administration skills and so forth.  Why would our returning officers not seek this information from prospective employees?<\/p><p>  I believe this so-called application process is largely a worthless and cosmetic exercise and that the jobs will be filled the same way they always have been, from the ranks of retired civil servants and the student children of those who are in the know.  I do not believe I am being cynical in saying this.  At least the returning officer in Wicklow, for example, is honest enough not even to pay lip service to this farce.  A message on the Wicklow website about the employment of polling and count staff, dated 20 September 2012, states:<ul style=\"margin-left:20px\">All jobs are offered first to people who have worked successfully with me in the past.  Due to a nationwide revision of the number of voters assigned to each polling station, there will be fewer stations in this constituency for future polls.  There are fewer jobs available and a surplus of experienced staff.  For the moment, therefore, I will not be accepting any new applications.<\/ul>  This is a disgrace and must be rectified.  The generous payment on offer to polling clerks and count centre officials could make a difference to a child's Christmas for an unemployed family, whereas for a retired civil servant on a State pension it means Christmas in Lanzarote.

The primary role of my Department in electoral matters is to provide an appropriate policy and legislative framework for a modern and efficient electoral system.  Within that framework, local returning officers are responsible for all matters in connection with the actual conduct of elections and referenda, including the selection, appointment and training of polling station staff in accordance with the relevant provisions of electoral law.  To assist returning officers, the Department issues guidance to them in advance of each election and referendum.  In that guidance, it is emphasised that the smooth conduct of polls is dependent on maintaining a cadre of sufficiently skilled and experienced people.  Having regard to the overall objective of the smooth conduct of the polls, returning officers are advised to employ competent and efficient persons as polling staff.  They are also asked to give consideration, wherever possible, to employing suitable persons who are unemployed.<\/p><p>  The approach taken in the Department's guidance strikes the right balance.

I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this issue.  My predecessor, the former Deputy P.J. Sheehan, used the oft-quoted line that there would be nothing left in west Cork but bachelors, briars and bullocks.  I am returning to that theme today, particularly to the issue of briars - I am not that concerned about the bachelors or bullocks.  The former Deputy used to refer to the briars shaking hands in the middle of the road and I am here to inform the Minister that in many cases in west Cork, the situation has got worse since it was first brought to the attention of the House by my former colleague.<\/p><p>  The current position of Cork County Council according to a recent reply is that it is not in a position due to resource constraints to patrol all roadside hedges and issue notices on a systematic basis.  Nevertheless, notices are regularly issued, particularly when a specific problem is brought to the attention of staff.  It is an objective of the roads directorate to follow up assiduously on any cases of non-compliance with such notices.<\/p><p>  Essentially, if a person reports to the council that a particular landowner has overgrown hedges, the council will issue the landowner with a notice but those who are out walking or driving do not have the wherewithal to write down each landowner's details.  It goes against the grain for many people to report on their neighbours or to set neighbour against neighbour by writing to the council seeking legal directives for people to cut their hedges.  Under the law the Roads Act 1993 passes responsibility for this duty to the landowner but the council undertook this practice until 2009 and maintained the roadside hedges.  Since 2009, it has abandoned that duty and left it to the law to take its course.  The reality, however, is that the system is not working.  To be fair to rural dwellers, when we canvass such areas, they do not make many demands of their elected councillors, and I have had the privilege of running in two local elections, but one issue of annoyance to them is that of overgrown hedges and I am anxious councils would take on board the responsibility to deal with this.<\/p><p>  I live in the real world and I am not looking for Exchequer funding but I ask the Minister to speak to his officials and come up with a national policy whereby the Department would take the lead in the matter and instruct the councils to be more proactive.  At a time when we are trying to achieve a greater level of compliance with the household charge, and people in rural areas have in general paid the charge with no difficulty while making few demands of the council in return - they do not get waste services or water - one issue that is very important to them is that the hedges are trimmed.  People have shown goodwill by paying the household charge so a greater policy response on behalf of councils would go a long way towards addressing this problem rather than the abandonment that has taken place to date.  As matters stand it is a matter for individual landowners and if they are reported, the council will follow up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200029#BB00400","speaker":"994"},{"type":"speech","time":1349196900,"counter":559,"content":"<p>The compliance rate with the household charge in Cork is not as good as in the local authorities in Deputy Ellis's and Deputy Clare Daly's constituencies.

Under the Roads and Road Vehicles (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order 2007 all remaining matters pertaining to the Roads Act 1993 were transferred to the Minister with responsibility for transport.  Consequently, this matter is one which comes within the policy remit of my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Perhaps the Office of the Ceann Comhairle might take note of that.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has a wide range of functions related to roads, including the legal framework for the provision and maintenance of roads, funding of the roads programme and promotion of road safety.  The Department states that its overall objective is to provide, within the framework of a balanced and integrated transport policy, for the safe, efficient and cost effective movement of persons and goods by road.  Specific objectives include those to ensure, as far as possible, the provision of a safe and efficient network of national, regional and local roads, and to ensure the optimum and safe use of the public road network.<\/p><p>  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each road authority.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the road authority.<\/p><p>  It is also the case that section 70 of the Roads Act provides that the owner or occupier of land must take all reasonable steps to ensure that a tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation on the land is not a hazard or potential hazard to persons using a public road and that it is does not obstruct or interfere with the safe use of a public road or the maintenance of such a road.  Where a tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation is a hazard or potential hazard to persons using a public road, or where it obstructs or interferes with the safe use of a public road, a road authority may serve a notice in writing on the owner or occupier of the land in question requiring the preservation, felling, cutting, lopping, trimming or removal of such tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation within the period stated in the notice.<\/p><p> However, I can inform Deputy Jim Daly that I am examining the prospect of developing a new social employment scheme in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.  This could involve participants, who are unemployed at present, carrying out some of the work that is the subject of the topical issue raised by the Deputy.

Were the figures to be broken down, the Minister would find them to be highly impressive.  Notwithstanding that, I do not appreciate being pushed around from one Department to another, of being obliged to deal with the intricacies of the matter and of trying to find out who is responsible.

Consequently, I would be anxious to see something like this because ultimately, an area like west Cork relies heavily on tourism and on the appearance of the countryside.  In addition, there also is a leisure, health and safety aspect and while people are being encouraged to walk, it is not possible on many roads.

The scale of the problem was identified and at least 10,000 home owners are in ownership of what essentially are valueless properties.  At the time, the Minister assured Members the stakeholders involved, namely, the insurance industry, the construction industry, banking, HomeBond and so on were being given until the end of September to come up with solutions to fund the remediation works and to this problem and that if they did not do so voluntarily, he would impose a solution on them.  It is now 2 October and I note that last week, the Construction Industry Federation's spokesperson, Tom Parlon, was highly voluble in stating that he, as a spokesperson allegedly for the stakeholders, has no solution to this problem.  Consequently, the ball is firmly in the Minister's court with regard to telling Members the status of the fund to implement plan B, as he assured them at the start of the summer.  Moreover, I might add this is required now both because of the failure of the stakeholders and because the State cannot shirk its responsibility for its role in this scenario.  I refer to the fact that evidence existed for decades about the problem of pyrite in other countries such as Britain and Canada, as well as in the geological formations of the land around us.  In addition, the fact the building regulations were changed in December 2007 and the HomeBond structural guarantee was changed in 2008 is indicative that both these schemes were defective and deficient in the first place.  The State stood over a lack of regulation, a lack of testing and an inadequate guarantee system through HomeBond.  Therefore, the State must take responsibility now.

However, I believe the State has a role and a duty to assist home owners to find a resolution to the problem.  This was one of my key objectives in setting up the independent pyrite panel, on which Deputies Clare Daly and Ellis have been briefed on a regular basis by those involved with the panel.  Indeed, the panel follows the same theme in its report, identifying the State as having an important role in ensuring that responsible parties engage constructively in processes to deliver solutions for home owners.  I note there are not 10,000 homes which are ready to fall down but that 850 require urgent remediation.  The panel's report identified 10,000 home owners with a potential liability for pyrites.  The cost for the remediation of pyrite-damaged dwellings must fall on those responsible and I welcome the report of the panel, which has a clear view on this matter.  It was unambiguous in its view that the parties with direct or indirect responsibility for the pyrite problem should face up to their responsibilities and provide solutions for home owners and that the State is not responsible for the pyrite problem and consequently, not liable for the cost of remediation.<\/p><p>  On receiving the pyrite report in June and reflecting on the panel's recommendations for stakeholders to provide solutions to home owners, I immediately began a series of discussions with the stakeholders with a view to securing a voluntary industry-led solution for home owners.  I asked the stakeholders to give urgent consideration to the relevant recommendations in the report and revert to me with their proposals by the end of September.  I have received responses from all the stakeholders in the last couple of days and am now in a position to give urgent and careful consideration to the content of these responses.  I am not in a position at present to give a considered view but seek a few more days in which I will be in a position to read those responses in great detail to ascertain whether any meaningful input into the resolution of this problem has been given to me by the stakeholders.<\/p><p>  I previously made it clear that in the absence of workable solutions from the stakeholders, I will consider an imposed solution along the lines recommended in the pyrite report.  Recommendation No. 14 in the report recommends the establishment of a resolution board, which could be funded by the construction, quarrying and related insurance sectors.  I do not believe it is a sustainable viewpoint that the taxpayer should be made liable for the costs associated with the remediation of pyrite-damaged dwellings and the panel noted its report the potential for those responsible readily to pass responsibility to the State.

We need to have a way of keeping an eye on this.  We have not had accountability, which is something we need to address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200031#DD00400","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1349198100,"counter":576,"content":"<p>I am surprised Deputy Ellis would talk about building standards considering that some of his pals were involved in Priory Hall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200031#DD00500","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1349198100,"counter":577,"content":"<p>No pal of mine was involved in Priory Hall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200031#DD00600","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1349198100,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I will certainly not accept responsibility for him anyway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200031#DD00700","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1349198100,"counter":579,"content":"<p>I will not either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200031#DD00800","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1349198100,"counter":580,"content":"<p>The conduct of some of the professions and builders involved in such projects leaves much to be desired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200031#DD00900","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1349198100,"counter":581,"content":"<p>The Minister is right about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200031#DD01000","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1349198100,"counter":582,"content":"<p>It had nothing to do with the Building Control Act of the day.

This is a relatively short technical Bill, with 20 sections in total.  The Bill proposes to amend the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 to provide for the enhanced and effective functioning of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council and the registration boards established under the Act.  It will also amend the Act to better provide for the assessment and recognition in Ireland of qualifications obtained outside the State and to ensure compliance with the relevant EU instrument.<\/p><p>  The 2005 Act provides for the establishment of a system of statutory regulation for designated health and social care professions.  The regulatory system comprises a registration board for each of 12 designated professions, a Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system, and a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters.  These bodies are collectively known informally as CORU.  CORU is responsible for protecting the public by regulating health and social care professionals in Ireland.  It promotes high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among the registrants.<\/p><p>  The Health and Social Care Professionals Council was established in 2007.  Its functions include the governance and co-ordination of registration boards and the provision of administrative support and secretarial assistance to registration boards and their committees.  Although the annual cost of running the council is currently being funded by the Exchequer in the main, the intention is that the regulatory system will, in time, be fully self-funding through the annual fees payable by registrants as is the case with all other health professional regulators.<\/p><p>  The following 12 health and social care professions are designated under the Act: clinical biochemists; dietitians; medical scientists; occupational therapists; orthoptists; physiotherapists; podiatrists; psychologists; radiographers; social care workers; social workers; and speech and language therapists.  In addition, the decision of the previous Government to rationalise the Opticians Board into the Health and Social Care Professionals Council will see another two professions, optometrists and dispensing opticians, being regulated under the Act in 2013.<\/p><p>  Under the Act, I, as Minister for Health, may designate other health and social care professions if I consider it is in the public interest to do so and if the specified criteria have been met.  I am conscious that some professions, currently not designated, made a case to be regulated under the Act.  However, my immediate priority is to proceed with the establishment of the registration board for the professions designated under the 2005 Act.  Then and only then can consideration be given to the registration of other professions.  That is not to say that work cannot be ongoing in that regard.  To date two registration boards, the Social Workers Registration Board and the Radiographers Registration Board have been established.  The Social Workers Registration Board has established its register, has held elections, and has made the necessary by-laws on education and training qualifications.<\/p><p>  The board has also adopted a code of professional conduct and ethics, which was subject to public consultation.  When the statutory transition period ends two years after the establishment register next May, the professional social worker will be fully regulated under the Act.  The Radiographers Registration Board will soon be in a position to open its register and commence its two-year transition period.  This will also facilitate the commencement of the fitness to practice provisions of the Act.  The Act provides for grandparenting - a transitionary period of two years during which existing practitioners must register on the basis of current specified qualifications.  After this only registrants of a registration board, who will be subject to the Act's regulatory regime will be entitled to use the relevant designated title.<\/p><p>  While progress in establishing all 12 registration boards has been slower than expected, this is due in the main to unforeseen legal technical and resourcing issues.  However, the learning obtained in establishing these two registration boards has been immense and is informing the work under way on the establishment of a further four registration boards before year end.  These are occupational therapists; speech and language therapists; dieticians; and physiotherapists.  The remaining boards in respect of those professions designated will be established by 2012.<\/p><p>  In line with the Government's decision on transparency in board appointments, my Department sought and received expressions of interest from professionals and laypeople for appointment to these boards over the summer months by public advertisement via the public appointments system.  My intention is that these boards will be established in coming weeks with the exception of the physiotherapists registration board which would be closer to year end.<\/p><p>  The Bill has three main purposes.  The first is to amend the Act to allow the Minister for Health to continue to appoint professional members to the council until each of the registration boards has been established in respect of the 12 professions designated under the Act, has held elections and is in a position to nominate one of its elected members.<\/p><p>The second is to incorporate the provisions of Directive 2005\/36\/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications into the principal Act and to provide for the assessment and recognition of other non-Irish qualifications which are outside the scope of the directive.  Third, in order to enhance the effective operation of the council and registration boards, other amendments are proposed.  These relate to items such as fees payable to members of the council, registration criteria and the updating of fines for offences under the Act.  <\/p><p> I will now briefly explain the technical difficulty that has arisen with the appointment of professional members to the council.  The Act provides that the council consists of a chairperson and 24 ordinary members, with each of the 12 registration boards nominating one of their elected members for appointment.  As is usual in such cases, because no registration boards will have been established, the Act empowers the Minister for Health to directly appoint these 12 professional representative members.  The phased establishment of the 12 registration boards and the resulting lapse of time have, however, meant that in the absence of registration boards which can then nominate council members, professional representative members cannot be appointed to the council to fill the vacancies arising from the completion of the terms of office of the original members.  Currently, 12 professional members are attending council meetings in an observer capacity with my consent so that the perspective of the professionals can be maintained.  This is an interim measure.  Those attending do not have voting powers and cannot fulfil the requirements of a quorum.  The Bill, therefore, proposes an amendment to the Act to allow the Minister for Health to continue to appoint professional members to the council until such time as the registration boards have been established, have held elections and are in a position to nominate elected members for appointment to the council.<\/p><p> The Bill also takes account of the provisions of Directive 2005\/36\/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications, which was enacted following enactment of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  This directive is an internal market measure aimed at facilitating the free movement of persons within the European Economic Area, EEA, space.  While health professionals are the largest single professional category availing of its provisions, the directive applies to any regulated profession.  The Department of Education and Skills, in light of its role in qualifications, has overall responsibility for the directive in Ireland.<\/p><p> Deputies may be aware that discussions are currently taking place at EU level to modernise the directive.  These are expected to conclude during the Irish Presidency of the EU.  It is necessary, in the meantime, to give effect to certain aspects of the current directive in this Bill.  The directive makes it easier for qualified professionals, including certain health and social care professionals, to practise their professions in European countries other than their own, while providing appropriate safeguards to ensure public health and safety and consumer protection.  This means that applicants' qualifications and post-qualification work experience are assessed to ensure that they meet the qualification entry requirements to that profession in Ireland.<\/p><p> As qualification recognition is the first step in a statutory registration process, it was always the policy intention that the registration boards would assume responsibility for the qualification recognition function under the directive.  The Bill, therefore, provides that each registration board will be designated as a competent authority under Directive 2005\/36\/EC for its designated profession.  Currently, the Minister for Health is the competent authority for most of the health professions designated under the Act and qualification recognition currently is for the purpose of eligibility for recruitment to the publicly-funded health sector.  The introduction of statutory registration will mean that all persons with non-Irish professional qualifications who seek to exercise their profession in Ireland must have their non-Irish qualification recognised under the directive.  The amendments contained in the Bill will also provide a legal basis for the assessment and recognition of qualifications obtained outside the State, which are outside the scope of the directive, namely, the non-EEA qualifications of EEA nationals and the qualifications of non-EEA nationals.  The Bill provides that the processes for the assessment of these qualifications are the same as provided for under Directive 2005\/36\/EC, including the provision of explicit appeal mechanisms.<\/p><p> The main provisions of the Bill can be summarised as follows.  Section 1 sets out that the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 is the principal Act.  Section 2 inserts a number of definitions into the principal Act.  Section 3 provides that the Minister for Health will continue to appoint representatives of the designated professions to the council until such time as all registration boards are established and are in a position to nominate elected members.  Section 4 provides a legal basis, when the council is self-funding, for payments to members of the council and its disciplinary-fitness to practise committees, subject to the approval of the Minister for Health and with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Section 6 permits each registration board to prescribe certain practise and training requirements for professionals who have not practised for a designated period of time.  <\/p><p> Sections 11 and 13 increase the maximum fines for offences committed under the principal Act.  Sections 15 and 16 provide for some changes in relation to &quot;grand parenting&quot; and in respect of the use of professional titles during the transitional period in which practising professionals may apply for registration.  Sections 17 and 18 give the Minister the power to appoint members of the council and registration boards for a period of up to four years rather than the current fixed term of four years.<\/p><p> Amendments are also proposed to the principal Act in sections 5 to 12, inclusive, and 14 and 15 to provide for the assessment and recognition in Ireland of qualifications obtained outside the State.  Section 5 inserts a new section 27A to provide that, when their registers have been established, registration boards will be designated as competent authorities under Directive 2005\/36\/EC, empowered to act as competent authorities for their designated professions under Directive 2005\/36\/EC and empowered to assess qualifications obtained outside the State, which are outside the scope of this directive.  This section also provides for necessary transition arrangements in relation to applications under the directive.<\/p><p> Section 6 amends section 31 to provide that a registration board may make by-laws relating to procedures for the assessment of professional qualifications, training, experience, aptitude tests or adaptation periods of applicants for registration whose professional qualifications have been obtained outside the State and are outside the scope of the directive.  Section 7 amends section 38 to update and simplify the approved qualifications criteria in section 38(2) so that there are three categories: Irish qualifications; qualifications approved under Directive 2005\/36\/EC and other qualifications; and to insert new definitions and remove others no longer necessary.<\/p><p> Sections 8, 9 and 10 relate to procedures and appeals for non-Irish qualifications.  Section 12 relates to the use of title in the provision of services on a temporary and occasional basis.  Sections 14 and 15 amend the registration process for existing practitioners to comply with the processes of Directive 2005\/36\/EC, which provide for the assessment of formal professional training and post-qualification professional experience.  Section 19 provides a minor clarifying amendment to the list of optional qualifications required by an existing practitioner-radiographer in order to register during the transitional period.<\/p><p> This Bill will enable the health and social care professionals council to continue to fulfil, in a more effective way, its objective, namely, to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among registrants of the designated professions.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200031#DD02300","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349198700,"counter":597,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive outline of the Bill before us.  The Fianna F\u00e1il Party welcomes the introduction of this legislation, the details of which we can go through on Committee Stage.  There is an obligation on us at this time to ensure regulation and oversight of health and social care professionals, as provided for in the 2005 Act and in this amending legislation which seeks to address some of the technical issues outlined by the Minister.<\/p><p>  The Minister, wearing two opposite hats, will be aware of the importance of protecting the integrity of professionals, in particular professionals in the health and social care areas, which are two key areas wherein breaches of trust and the guidelines can have serious consequences for individuals, the professionals and the integrity of that profession.  It is important we maintain the highest standards in these areas.<\/p><p>  As a pro-European and someone who welcomes free movement of goods and services and the transfer of qualifications between the States, I welcome the transposition of Directive 2005\/36\/EC.<\/p><p>However, in ensuring the free movement of goods, services and people and the transfer of qualifications between member states, it is critical to have in place some form of governance at EU level to monitor oversight in all member states, because in challenging times of economic difficulties and political upheaval, it could happen that oversight in a particular member state ceases to be sound and robust.  However, one would be obligated to recognise the qualifications of medical and care professionals of that state even though one's ability to check out the individuals may be somewhat diminished.  In such a situation it is very important to have oversight and monitoring at EU level of directives passed by the Council and European Parliament and transposed by member states.  I am not necessarily concerned about this with regard to the Bill but it may arise in future.<\/p><p> Previously, we spoke about Indian and Pakistani doctors coming here.  It is important we welcome them and that they are treated with dignity and respect.  Unfortunately, this has not always happened.  In certain cases they were put up in boarding houses and given less than what I would consider appropriate accommodation.  It took some time to assess their qualifications and competencies and in the meantime they were left in limbo.  We wanted and welcomed them, but when they arrived we were unable to deal with them in the manner to which they were entitled.<\/p><p> If oversight in any member state or country is questioned or diminished in any way, it brings into question the integrity of everyone who comes from there.  We must ensure, therefore, that any country, inside and outside the EU, which provides excellent professionals who come here to dig us out of a hole, so to speak, engages in monitoring to ensure the continued integrity of those who are welcome here and that people cannot question the suitability of individuals.  This can happen if the robustness of oversight, training, education, qualifications and standards is diminished.  For all these reasons, this is a critical aspect of the directive, the broader internationalisation of medical professionals, and the transfer and freer of movement of people and services throughout the European Union.<\/p><p> Not necessarily related to the Bill is the issue of the PIP implants.  Who is responsible for medical devices?  The Irish Medicines Board is not responsible.  We are told the European Union has an oversight role.  At the same time, women throughout Europe who had received the PIP implants which were made of low-grade industrial silicone-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200032#EE00200","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349199300,"counter":599,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting the Deputy but the Irish Medicines Board is responsible for medical devices in this country.  The incident referred to by the Deputy was a case of fraudulent use of a synthetic industrial implant material.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200033#FF00200","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1349199300,"counter":600,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  The point I am making is that people are entitled to protection against fraudulent use of material which is then put into a person's body.  The difficulty is that while the Irish Medicines Board may have oversight within the State, if something happens outside the State, people may have difficulty seeking redress afterwards.  In fairness, the Minister and the Department responded in a very humane and passionate way when the issue arose to address the concerns of the many women who received the implants.  However, there is no form of redress for the many people who were implanted with industrial grade silicone.  The implants were approved in Germany or somewhere else at some stage - the company was in France but I believe the patent was German - after which they arrived in Ireland.  The Minister, the chief medical officer and others moved swiftly to try to address the concerns of these women, but we cannot pursue anyone and it will be very difficult to seek redress for the fraudulent use of silicone.<\/p><p>  With European integration comes obligations for the European Union.  It is fine to agree a directive and for member states to transpose it into national law, but oversight is very important and it must be supported at European level in terms of resources and cost.  It is unacceptable that a situation such as the PIP implants can arise or that a member state could have diminished ability to oversee the domestic competency of qualifications, training and education.<\/p><p>  The Minister stated four councils will be established by the end of the year and that others will be rolled out.  Considering the medical and care professionals included in the scope of the Bill, it is important we have oversight and that the councils are established to ensure proper training, education, qualification assessment and continual monitoring.  The Bill deals with high level qualifications including clinical biochemist, dietician, medical scientist, occupational therapist, podiatrist, physiotherapist, psychologist, radiologist, social care worker, social worker and speech and language therapist.  The difficulty we have had in recent years is recruitment and attracting highly qualified people in the various professional categories outlined in the Bill to work in Ireland.  Now our highly trained professionals are beginning to drift abroad to seek opportunities in other countries.  This is a disturbing development.  We all say the fees, salaries and remuneration of general practitioners and consultants should be addressed, but we must be conscious of encouraging people to enter these professions and keeping a percentage of them in the country after they are trained for our own health and social care services.<\/p><p>  We welcome the experience that people gain and bring back when they go abroad, and high-end professionals will always move in and out of the country.  However, we have a difficulty if there is only one-way traffic and everyone is moving out.  The Department of Health, the HSE and the various professional bodies which oversee their membership must be very conscious of this and monitor it to ensure the people who go abroad and gain experience bring it back to this country.  During the 1980s the most able people drifted away and it caused difficulties.  They returned in the 1990s and the first decade of this century and had a major impact through bringing new ideas and procedures, especially in medicine.<\/p><p>  I will not delay the House much longer.  The establishment of the various oversight councils is to be rolled out and I would like the Minister to make a commitment that this will happen.<\/p><p>People will always have concerns about the conflict of interest in respect of self-funding, self-regulation and discipline and what flows from that in the event of a fitness to practise meeting or professional misconduct hearing.  People may sometimes have a view that there could be a conflict of interest in self-assessment, self-regulation and self-monitoring.  I believe the legislation is robust enough in terms of ensuring that is not the case and that, in general, there is no major conflict.<\/p><p> The Health and Social Care Professionals (Amendment) Bill before us is a follow-on from the 2002 report entitled Statutory Registration for Health and Social Professionals: Proposals for the Way Forward and the 2005 Act that flowed from it.  In bringing this legislation to the D\u00e1il, which is an obligation, we continually upgrade the oversight of health and social care professionals in every way to ensure it is flexible in dealing with the changing environment that exists.  We should ensure there is flexibility, opportunity, oversight and strong regulatory powers in terms of sanction if there are breaches of professional conduct or what can flow from an internal inquiry which may find a person to be in breach of professional conduct.  That is critical but what is as important is that if there is a view held by the State or individuals that there is no proper oversight or disciplinary procedures by one of the quora, there is a mechanism in place for the State to step in and have a fully independent inquiry if there is a serious breach by a individual professional under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 and the amending legislation.<\/p><p> It is important to do this to give people confidence and belief in the quality of the people providing health and social care.  Deputy \u00d3 Caol\u00e1in has raised this issue numerous times, such as, for example, the Dr. Neary case and many others that have flowed from that.  That, in itself, is an issue of concern.  We had the debate in this House on symphysiotomy and there was all-party agreement.  People will debate the rights and wrongs of symphysiotomy but there are many whose lives have been destroyed because of this barbaric act.  We heard at first hand stories that were very emotionally told and felt by those who listened to the impact it had on their lives.  I am not saying that the people who carried out symphysiotomy were doing something that was illegal at the time.  However, when there is clearly an evolving technology and change of practice, it is important there is continual training and re-evaluation of what is considered the norm in medicine and social care.  Let us be quite clear, many practices carried out in psychiatry for a number of years would now be considered almost barbaric.  There has been a changing and evolving ethos about how we deal with people with mental health and psychiatric issues and in general medicine itself.<\/p><p> It is for those reasons that there is an obligation on the various quora under this legislation to ensure that, as the Minister referred to, there would be training, continuing evaluation, upskillling and professional development.  We see it in many other areas and I believe it should be in the medical and care profession as well.  What can very often happen is that individual professionals are very competent and eminently qualified but may not continue to evolve and train themselves in the most up-to-date techniques, procedures and thinking in whatever profession they are involved in.  That can have disturbing effects for people down the road.  I have cited a number of cases, with symphysiotomy being the very obvious one.  This was practised in this country up to the 1970s, after which it was considered to be a procedure that should not be visited on anyone except in the most exceptional circumstances.  Even at that, there was a strong body of medical evidence in this country, across Europe and especially in the UK that it should never be used and that a caesarean was the way to deliver a child if there were huge difficulties in delivery.  We have had discussions on this issue and I am not sure whether the individuals said this was the right procedure based on the ethos of the hospital or a religious ethos or whether they just did not continually upskill in the most modern techniques and changes in practice in the medical profession.  The same is true of social care and psychiatry, with the move from institutionalisation to dealing with and treating people in their immediate home and community environment.  That is very welcome but there are still people within the professional community who would say that perhaps we might look at that again.  Continually training and upskilling and continuing personal development are very important in the quora overseeing the qualifications of people.<\/p><p> Those are my thoughts with regard to this Bill before us and the 2005 Act.  In other fora over the years, I have raised the issue of how oversight and governance at European level should be resourced at European level and the need for a centralised system to ensure all countries play by the same rules in respect of scrutiny of professionals' training and qualification.  This is something about which I feel very strongly because all we need is for one or two people from other countries to be found not to be eminently qualified or to have done something wrong in their professional conduct and straight away it will be used by bigoted people and racists to undermine people who are here for a good reason, namely, to assist us in the delivery of our health care.  This is why I have always said, as I did at the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, that people who have come from abroad are welcome and must be welcomed with open arms and that we must insist on the highest standards, not just for ourselves but for their integrity in order that people would have absolute confidence in them.  If not, the sinister element in society could jump on a particular incident and use it to further their own narrow-minded, bigoted agenda.<\/p><p> I welcome the Bill and hope the Minister moves expeditiously in establishing the various councils of the professions and that we would continually upgrade and monitor things to ensure there are additions and the ability to add quora to oversee varying professions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200033#FF00300","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349199900,"counter":602,"content":"<p>I wish to record my objection to the fact that the Minister has, for whatever reason, chosen not to stay for opening statements in response to a Bill he has just put before the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200034#GG00300","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1349199900,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I wonder where that is from.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200034#GG00400","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1349199900,"counter":604,"content":"<p>This is a technical Bill amending the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  It is uncontroversial, seeking to ensure the continuing and effective functioning of the structures established under the 2005 Act - the Health and Social Care Professionals Council and the registration bodies for the 12 designated health and social care professions.<\/p><p>The main purpose of the Bill is to allow the Minister for Health to continue to appoint professional members to the council until such time as the 12 registration boards are established under the Act and are in a position to nominate elected members.  We are told in the explanatory memorandum that the Minister has been unable to appoint professional members to the council on the completion of the terms of office of the 12 members appointed when the council was first constituted.  We are told this was due to &quot;unforeseen circumstances&quot;.  In the interest of clarity, I ask that the Minister explain those circumstances.  We should have a detailed explanation of the reason he has not been able to proceed as initially intended.<\/p><p> This Bill is being introduced in very different times from those that saw the principal Act introduced.  In 2004 and 2005, the years in which the Health and Social Care Professionals legislation was processed in the Oireachtas, there were unprecedented opportunities to transform health services and create a truly equitable and efficient system.  Instead of availing of them, there was bureaucratic change, with the establishment of the HSE.  The two tier system remained firmly in place and was reinforced by the privatisation policy of the former Minister, Ms Mary Harney, and the rest of the then Government.  We are now in dire economic straits.  Cruel cuts are being imposed by this Government on public services and the privatisation policy remains in place.  What does this mean in practice?  It means that a system that should be wholly designed to allow patients to receive the best care and to allow health and social care professionals to provide that care is instead built around the HSE bureaucracy and the private profit motive.<\/p><p> The system values professional expertise more for the profit it can generate than for the good health outcomes it can help to bring about.  As a result, our public health services are short in all of the 12 professions listed in the Bill.  Public patients struggle to gain access to the expertise that is readily available.  It would be readily available only if access were assured.  The recruitment embargo denies patients access to timely care and qualified young people the opportunity to work.<\/p><p> The speech and language therapy profession is one of those listed in the Bill.  Let me quote from a letter, dated 29 May 2012, from the Irish Association of Speech &amp; Language Therapists to the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>, a paper I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, reads given her roots in a certain part of the island.<ul style=\"margin-left:20px\">There is huge demand for speech and language therapy for adults and children in services across Ireland.  There are significant numbers of unemployed fully qualified therapists.  The recruitment embargo has meant that services cannot recruit for vacant posts and few new posts are being created.<\/p><p>Some graduates are working in volunteer positions and these can vary in terms of content.  These can provide excellent opportunities for skills maintenance and professional development.  However, they are not equivalent to working as an autonomous speech and language therapist under professional supervision and are not considered under the competencies framework for full membership of the professional body. <\/p><p>[T]here is both a supply of qualified, highly skilled therapists and a demand for their services, but in the current situation there is a gap between the two, such that children and adults wait unacceptable durations for access to the fundamental human right to communicate.<\/ul>That is a very measured, thoughtful and accurate description of the reality faced by health professionals and patients today.  This reality is not peculiar to speech and language therapists.  We can all relate to it because I am sure every Deputy in this House knows of examples of children and adults with special needs who have not received the professional speech and language therapy they need.  It is shameful, especially in the case of children.  Children's most vital language learning years pass so rapidly that the system put in place by successive Governments fails to match patient need with professional service provision.  The same could be said of the other listed professions, including that of social workers.  We are very conscious of this in the context of the referendum Bill we passed in this House last week.<\/p><p> I wish to raise the issue of cross-jurisdictional recognition of qualifications and cross-jurisdictional working of professionals.  That is addressed in sections 11 to 15 of the Bill which implement EU directives and are especially relevant to Ireland given the continuing existence of partition.  The North-South feasibility study on cross-Border co-operation in health care provision, which was carried out jointly by the two Departments, North and South, and on whose publication and content we had to wait for such a long period, addresses this issue.  I wish to cite the report extensively because I believe absolutely that there are powerful gains to be made and real progress to be achieved by turning around two back-to-back health delivery systems on this small island and having them face each other and work together in the common interest and good.  The study states:<ul style=\"margin-left:20px\"> 5.19 Both jurisdictions face significant challenges in terms of sustaining high quality, highly specialist tertiary services normally only provided in centres servicing large populations.  The availability of appropriately qualified and skilled staff for such specialist areas is key and for populations of either jurisdiction, the small number of hospital consultants providing care in these areas inevitably means that services are inherently vulnerable.<\/p><p> 5.20 In a number of service areas, increased sub-specialisation is evident and in newly developing services it is inevitable that the expertise will reside among a small clinical team.  For such highly specialised services the population based in either jurisdiction may not be sufficient to sustain a team of appropriately trained skilled clinicians and the longer term sustainability of a high quality service may only be possible if considered on an all-island basis.  Where patients have to leave both jurisdictions for treatment, the impact on individuals and their families is very significant in terms of patient well-being and accessibility for the family in sometimes very traumatic circumstances.  Combining resources for the provision of such services on a North-South basis makes sense.<\/p><p> 5.21 The development of new highly specialist acute and certain other services and the changing pattern of increased specialisation in existing acute services provides a unique opportunity for both jurisdictions to work together.  In principle, both jurisdictions should consider developing these services in a collaborative manner, particularly where low patient throughput makes it difficult to sustain highly specialised services and for health professionals to maintain their skills.<\/ul><\/p><p>It continues:<ul style=\"margin-left:20px\"> 5.46 It is recognised that both populations would benefit from flexible working arrangements which would enable staff to work in another jurisdiction, for example, practitioners with scarce clinical skills might reasonably offer a service to both populations.  However, there are some obstacles to workforce mobility, which can be effectively dealt with provided there is a clear focus on tackling such issues.  These aspects include indemnity for staff working out of jurisdiction and mutual recognition of qualifications between professional bodies in both jurisdictions as well as registration and pension issues associated with working in both jurisdictions.<\/p><p> 5.47 While great progress has been made, further work needs to be undertaken to extend the facilitation of cross-border working for health and social care staff.  Furthermore access to an effective resource, which sets out procedures and protocols, to facilitate work across jurisdictions, would be advantageous.<\/ul>These recommendations are not from a Sinn F\u00e9in election manifesto, nor are they taken directly from the health policy that I anchored and published with colleagues in 2005 for my party.  I have just cited a jointly commissioned report.  For all the same and practical benefits that it recounts, I again commend to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to impact with her senior Minister, if that is at all possible, and to acknowledge this as an area of neglect.  There is little evidence of focused endeavour, North or South, to bring about the promise of such an agreed report.  However, a willingness clearly exists.  It is a significant step forward and should be seized in the interests of ordinary people the length and breadth of this island.  All that holds us back is a nervousness of a new step forward and a sense of ownership over whatever part of the island on which we live.<\/p><p> At the end of the day, if the Minister and the Department do not take the initiative to give life to the promise of that particular report, including the section I have just cited on the record, it will be lost again and the report will be left to gather dust on a shelf.  I urge the Minister of State not to allow that to happen and to help ensure health professionals on this island can provide the best possible service to patients, which is what they are trained to do and is what the overwhelming number of them want to do.  It is the reward of their lives' choice that they get the opportunity to deliver their skills on a continuous basis and have the prospect of development within their chosen career paths.  I commend the report strongly to the Minister of State and I am happy to record that I will support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200034#GG00500","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349201100,"counter":607,"content":"<p>I understand that Deputy Catherine Murphy wishes to share time with Deputy Mattie McGrath.

Ten of the disciplines have not been properly established on the council, yet the Minister has no power to extend the terms of the council's appointees.  Given the fact that the Health and Social Care Professionals Act was enacted in 2005, why have these disciplines not been properly constituted yet?  Not all of the period in question was a time of financial stress or cutbacks.  Since 2005, everyone has learned what can occur when there are regulatory failures.  The idea behind the council is to put proper regulation in place.  It is not just in terms of finance that we need regulation.  We need systems that can anticipate developments and work in co-operation with and deliver services to the public.<\/p><p>  The explanation of &quot;efforts have been made&quot; offered by the Minister and the Bill's digest is anodyne.  What efforts have been made?  Has an onerous obligation that cannot be met been placed on the individuals coming forward?  Is there a campaign of not co-operating?  Why have the other disciplines not been established?  Do they view the council as unnecessary?  What dialogue has been held to determine why the council has not been properly constituted, something that has made it necessary for the Minister to intervene and introduce this legislation?<\/p><p>  The disciplines in question, including occupational therapy, physiotherapy, psychology, social work and speech and language therapy, are the primary care areas with which we have been engaged for the past two weeks.  In many cases, the quality of the service they deliver, especially in the public system, depends on one's address.  Some parts of the country might have no waiting lists while other parts could have two year waiting lists.  Deputy \u00d3 Caol\u00e1in referred to speech and language therapy.  There is a world of difference between diagnosing a three year old, delivering the therapy then and sending him or her to school at five years of age and making him or her wait two years for that therapy.<\/p><p>  The option of a multidisciplinary approach is being missed because the council has not been properly constituted.  The commitment of the specialties must be questioned.<\/p><p>  Although Deputy \u00d3 Caol\u00e1in was referring to Northern Ireland and the Republic when he spoke of cross-jurisdictional matters, county boundaries being crossed is also an issue.  Children attending a special school in west County Dublin will receive speech and language therapy if they are from the area, but not if their addresses are in, for example, north County Kildare.  This is despite the fact that the same organisation is involved.  The systems failures have progressed past being regulatory.  They have to do with people's locations, the numbers involved and the architecture of the HSE itself.<\/p><p>  The Bill is a modest measure to plug a gap, but it will not deliver a vastly improved service to those who need it, which is what is urgently required.  We cannot say that often enough.  The stupidity of the situation is that the five year old who starts school without having received therapy must be picked up by the education bill if he or she fails in school later.<\/p><p>We also pick them up by way of underperformance in ability to work and so on.  There is a certain element of economic stupidity about how this is handled and seen within a so-called silo philosophy.<\/p><p> I also wish to speak to the elements that are not included.  Perhaps they are not appropriate to this Bill but I should highlight them anyway.  For example, medical devices and the practitioners using them are not covered.  There was a significant failure in regulation with the PIP implant case, and in the US in 2000, a failure in the licensing system in France was identified with regard to the company in question.  The process involved the company being regulated by a German-licensed organisation.  The problem could have been identified much earlier if the published material had been picked up by the professions.  We can see how that played out for people.<\/p><p> The private clinic area, including those dealing with cosmetic surgery, is not taken in with these regulations.  Where there is a failure and no one to pick up the problems, the State ends up picking up the issue through the public health care system.  Regulation of areas not included in this measure is required urgently.  I understand the European regulatory system is being considered, although individual member states have been warned that this may take some time to flow through by means of directive and legislation.  It will be necessary to act on an interim basis in order that we can learn from those mistakes and ensure they are not repeated.  There is a similar case with invasive implants like DePuy's hip replacements, which have also failed.  These failures have caused individuals to have to endure pain and concern arising from another big operation.  This is one of a range of other areas that must be tackled through regulation.<\/p><p> I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts on this when he wraps up the debate.  I share the concerns of Deputy \u00d3 Caol\u00e1in about the Minister not being present.  I respect the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, who will give a report to the senior Minister.  Nevertheless, the Minister should have stayed in the Chamber to deal with this legislation and at least listen to the opening statements.  It is very important for the Minister to revert to us on these issues.  Not all of the problems occurred under his watch and the legislation dates from 2005.  It is important to understand what is going on and why there is disengagement by these professions.  The only person who can tell us is the Minister because he has been having the dialogue for the past 18 months.  It is vital that he tells us about the dialogue and why there has been a failure that prevented a board being set up without this sort of intervention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200036#JJ00300","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349201700,"counter":610,"content":"<p>I am delighted to be able to contribute to the debate on the Health and Social Care Professionals (Amendment) Bill 2012.  Although I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, I am also disappointed that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, left the Chamber so swiftly after making his opening speech on this Bill.  The Act has been in force since 2005 but the Minister has only been in power 18 months.  Nevertheless, we should have a proper debate and there are questions to answer.  The Minister should try to explain some of these issues.<\/p><p>  The Minister indicated that the Act provides for grandparenting, or a transitional period of two years during which existing practitioners must register on the basis of current qualified specifications.  The Taoiseach, if he has the chance to appoint his next Cabinet, might insert a grandparenting clause to keep the likes of the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, under control so as not to allow what we read about every day in the Department to happen.<\/p><p>  I compliment the new Minister of State, Deputy White, at the Department of Health but I also pay tribute to the former Minister of State, Deputy Shortall.  I served with her on the last Oireachtas committee dealing with social welfare and know her to be a tireless worker and advocate of the underprivileged.  She is a champion for fairness and equity.  She was forced into a position where she had to resign from office, which is both scary and disappointing.  The Taoiseach has already lost two Ministers of State in 18 months, which is a concern.  Nevertheless it is not my business but a matter for the Taoiseach to run his Government.  While I would not dare to lecture him on how to do it, a small bit of common sense and mutual respect would go a long way.<\/p><p>  As I noted, this legislation is originally from 2005, when a system of statutory regulation was designated for health and social care professions.  We all know this to be badly needed.  The regulatory system comprises a registration board of 12 designated professions and also allows the Minister to make 12 appointments.  This begs the question as to why there has been a delay in getting these bodies up and running.  There is plenty of expertise and legal advice around so we should have been able to foresee whatever problems may have been down the road with this legislation, which is less than seven years old.  I know the Minister is only in office 18 months but the fact remains that the legislation has not worked, so I must ask why there is a delay.<\/p><p>  Does this arise because it is part of the dysfunctional organisation of the HSE?  There are many thousands of excellent staff in the HSE, both office and front-line workers, including all kinds of health care professionals.  Nevertheless, there is a significant deficit and much baggage and administration, red tape and bureaucracy.  We must tackle that problem.<\/p><p>  The bodies involved in this issue are collectively and informally known as CORU, and they are responsible for protecting and regulating health and social care professionals in Ireland.  CORU promotes high standards of professional conduct, education, training and competence among registrants.  That is something everyone in this House and the wider country wants and demands.<\/p><p>  CORU covers some delicate areas, including biochemists, dieticians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, psychologists, radiographers, social workers and speech and language therapists.  Many of these people have made a career choice arising from career guidance and family or peer advice.  They have dedicated time in third level institutions, doing research and masters degrees, ending up in a highly qualified position after a massive cost to the State and the individuals or families, which may have struggled to help the people achieve the qualifications.  Deputy Murphy, on the other hand, referred to the people in many disadvantaged areas, waiting for treatment.  Every Deputy knows of many cases of people waiting for orthodontic treatment, speech and language treatment and access to many similar such services.<\/p><p>With the embargo on recruitment to the HSE and the health needs that exist, it beggars belief that people are told the special treatments their children need, having waited a year or two years and then going into secondary, are not covered by the State.  That is a huge cost on the family and a huge social pressure on the individuals who badly need the treatment.  Whether it is speech therapy or dental treatment, they need it.  They were recommended by health care professionals to have it and they applied for it.  As was mentioned, some people have worked as volunteers.  There are many people waiting for such treatment and there is a high demand for it, but many of our highly qualified people are emigrating and we are losing that valuable resource to other countries.  Many of those people do not even work their chosen profession in the countries to which they emigrate.  It is a disgrace.<\/p><p> I said during the debate on the children's referendum Bill that it is pointless passing laws and amending this legislation if we do not have the wherewithal, the resources and, most importantly, the vision and the passion to follow through on these measures.  There is no point in amending Acts, putting them on the Statute Book and filling up the law libraries.  We must make sure we are able to provide for what we legislate.  I know we are in a deep dark recession but this legislation has been hanging around since 2005 and during the peak boom years of the Celtic tiger, but it is still not up and running.<\/p><p> I was interested to hear the research Deputy \u00d3 Caol\u00e1in quoted.  On an island the size of Ireland and having regard to the peace process and people coming together, the Administrations in both parts of the island must come together, pool, unite and share expertise for the benefit of all the people.  This is still a small island even when one includes the populations of both jurisdictions relative to the size of our neighbours.  My late brother could not understand how we had 13, or whatever is the correct number, health boards at the time and Manchester where he was working, which had a population of 3 million had one body looking after this area.  When we consider many such cases, we can see where bureaucracy has got a grip.  The health boards were disbanded because we wanted openness, transparency and accountability but we got the gigantic monster that is the HSE and no job was lost at the time.  I am not blaming the current Minister for that but it happened and it got more unwieldy, entangled and bureaucratic and, worse than that, it operates at arm's length from ordinary people.<\/p><p> On the other hand, there are the private practitioners, some of whom are accounted for in the legislation, who have set up their own systems.  I go back to the time of Barry Desmond and I saw him in the D\u00e1il trying to break the grip the consultants had on the public hospitals.  I have often said that if one is a veterinary practitioner, one must provide one's own specialist designated research, operating theatre and whatever.  Why should consultants have access to public facilities and beds if they are not playing ball?  Such access should be removed from them.  They should get their own house in order if they do not play ball, cutting out the waiting lists and work longer hours.  I cannot understand how there have been so many commitments to change this but it has not been changed.  It is the stark naked fact that big powerful lobby groups in this country are the tail wagging the dog and they are refusing to budge.  It is a long time since Barry Desmond - I think he is alive and well and I hope he is - stood in this House and as Minister tried to break that cartel and he failed.  Successive Ministers have also failed to do so but it must be broken.  What we, this Bill and all other legislation are about is service to our people and not to any particular sections or elite group of our people.  These people have excellent qualifications and worked hard to gain them and they must be recognised for having done that and paid appropriately but not for having a logjam and a closed shop.  We saw what happened with the pharmacists - young pharmacists could not become practitioners.  Now there is the issue of the price of generic drugs.  We have to deal with this matter.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, and the Labour Party promised that they would deal with it but they have not.  It is not easy to do so: they cannot simply wave a magic wand and have it dealt with but they have to deal with it because the public are tired of it.  We are all tired of it because it has gone on for too long.  In the recession we must examine the pooling of resources North and South on this island.<\/p><p> We must not allow a situation where racism against foreign national practitioners could be encouraged.  They were encouraged to come here and we needed them.  Unfortunately, most of them were working junior doctors.  It was 18 months ago when the Minister, Deputy Reilly, embarked on a crusade abroad to recruit these people, whom I am sure were suitably qualified, but we found they were staying in bed and breakfast accommodation and all kinds of places and they could not operate.  There were queues for procedures.  I would not want anybody who does not have proper qualifications and certification working in our hospitals but they were recruited abroad to a set of standards, must have been interviewed and must have got the nod to come over here at great expense to the State, I might add, and then they were kept here in abeyance as if they were in some kind of quarantine.  Then we had to do some kind of a cleansing in respect of them before they could work.  It was horrible for those people to have been put in that situation plus the fact that we did not have them working at the front line where we needed them.  That was another case of bureaucracy gone mad.  I do not know who was keeping the door closed, keeping them out or did not want them here but that is what happened and it was not that long ago.  I am sure it will happen again but it should not happen.  Those eminently qualified people, regardless of their colour or creed, are entitled to work here and they have worked here.  We cannot discriminate against them because some people are anxious, as others have said, to jump on the bandwagon and discriminate and denigrate people because of their colour, race or because of where they come from.  That should not be allowed or contemplated anywhere.<\/p><p> Where does health and social care and the HSE fit into all this?  It is all about health and social care but that is not being meted out to ordinary people who are trying to access ordinary, simple, basic treatments.  In many cases when people get into the system they are very well treated but such access is not made available to many people.  It is the preserve of those who are able to go private and access the system.  I read in the newspaper today that VHI health cover will increase again.  The minute any changes affect these people they pass on the cost to the insurers.  We have to question the cost of treatments and bed nights in terms of insurance cover.  They are too high.  The rackets must be stopped.  The cartels must be broken.  Health and social care must be delivered to people.  It is part of their civil right under the Constitution.  That must be recognised and we must set out to deliver that.  The delay from 2005 to 2012 in getting this legislation up and running and the need for it to be amended now to enable its unfolding is patent nonsense because that should have been identified at the time the legislation was introduced.  I am not saying we are infallible but there are legal people who understand if there are legal pitfalls and blockages in the context of legislation.  If there are, there should be a back-up model in order that the blockages can be cleared and dealt with and the legislation, as enacted, can be put into practice.  It is all fine to hear pious platitudes but we must be mindful if there are various reasons legislation cannot be implement or is not workable.  Do we ever in the Oireachtas test if legislation is fit for purpose before we pass it?  That applies to all legislation.  One wonders if some legislation passed was ever tested to establish if what it proposed was sane, realistic or achievable or if it was all in deep chapters, which no one could unravel or implement.  I thank the Minister for introducing this legislation now but why is there a need for it and why did it take so long to introduce it?  Will he answer those questions?  I know the Minister of State might attempt to and that the Minister is not present.  I think he is one of the 11, like the Flight of the Earls, who will be flying off.  It is important to be prepared for taking over the EU Presidency.  I remember when I was on the opposite side of the House a few years ago Ministers being criticised for travelling abroad for St. Patrick's Day celebrations.<\/p><p>If it was Halloween, I would say it was something else but this is similar to the Flight of the Earls with high powered Ministers, officials and their entourages.  I do not know if that is necessary.  If the troika can come over here to tell us what to do, surely the European officials could come here to meet departmental officials and say what they want out of it.  I wish the Taoiseach and his Ministers well with the EU Presidency but is this amount of foreign travel needed?  Nothing has changed since I sat on the Government benches other than the personalities on the seats and the public is growing weary of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200037#KK00200","speaker":"1090","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349202900,"counter":613,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputies Paul Connaughton, Peter Fitzpatrick and Mary Mitchell O'Connor.<\/p><p>  The Bill is an important legislative instrument, as it seeks to advance the establishment of the State regulatory scheme for professionals, which will regulate the registration of the various professions delivering services within our health system.  The delivery of this registration process is central to ensuring those providing services under various professional banners are qualified to do so; the provision of their services is regulated by an appropriate authority, adequately equipped to ensure the patient receives a professional service and delivered by a person appropriately qualified to do so; and the delivery of that service is regulated by a reputable authority, which has the power to enquire into, and adjudicate on, contentious issues arising from the delivery of the service.<\/p><p>  A total of 12 health and social care professions are designated under the original Act but only two have established registration boards and this is causing a delay in the delivery of this system, which seeks to safeguard the delivery of professional services from the targeted areas to the patient.  This scenario cannot be allowed to prevail and, accordingly, we must ensure this legislation, which empowers the Minister to make the necessary appointments required to bring effect to the system, is passed in the interest of delivering a safe and efficient care to the patients involved.<\/p><p>  Registration with whichever of these 12 boards is applicable to the profession they intend to practice is required before the professional persons can use the relevant title and the original Act provided for the establishment of the Health and Social Care Professional Council, which would implement the Act and bear overall responsibility for regulation.  The problem has arisen whereby the Minister for Health has no provision to fill vacancies that have arisen in the remaining ten disciplines for which boards have not been established.  This is causing the system to stall and it is essential that this legislation be put in place and that there is no further delay in the implementation of this process, as the adequate registration of professionals and the establishment of a regulatory authority authorised to examine the qualifications of professionals offering their services and capable of ensuring those practising are qualified to do so is essential to the confidence of the public in the services offered.<\/p><p>  We are becoming a more cosmopolitan society and, with the influx of people from other jurisdictions, it is imperative that we have this process in place in order that professional people who present themselves and offer their services can be appropriately adjudicated regarding their qualifications and their fitness to practise.  The Bill addresses the requirements of the professional's qualifications directive, Directive 205\/36\/EC, establishing rules for the mutual recognition of professional qualifications between EU member states and also provides for the recognition of qualifications obtained outside the EU.  This is such an important area that I fail to understand how the original legislation, which resulted in the appointment of the first council in 2007, still remains in limbo in 2012.  That is a gap of seven years and this reflects either complacency on behalf of those charged with the implementation of the legislation or an unwillingness on their behalf to implement it.  Whichever is the case, any further delay must not be tolerated and I commend the Minister on pushing ahead with this Bill to break the logjam.  I urge him to proceed speedily with the establishment of the registration and regulatory authorities provided for in the Bill and ensure that, on this occasion, those involved are not afforded the opportunity to frustrate the implementation of this system and that the safety of the patients is placed before professional sensitivities.<\/p><p>  I have no doubt whatsoever that is what the Minister will do because bringing change to a health service that had become dysfunctional and incapable of delivering the service the public wants is a task that was bravely accepted and undertaken by him and he is actively engaged in it.  I am becoming weary of listening to those on the Opposition benches complaining every step of the way.  These departmental cuts were coming regardless of who occupied the ministerial chair because those on the Opposition benches, who are complaining, left the till open and let everybody help themselves.  They blew the money like drunken sailors and left their mess for the Minister to clean up.<\/p><p>  Why was this legislation, which was passed in 2005, not brought into effect until the Minister came along?  Why is it necessary to introduce a new Bill in order that he be authorised to appoint new members to the ten professions that failed to adhere to the legislation?  It was not given effect because the Government that introduced the legislation comprised the same people who are attacking the Minister at every opportunity and who had a blueprint for dealing with the introduction of difficult or unpopular procedures.  That blueprint was to ignore them and to let those adversely affected by them ignore them.  That appears to be the only reason ten of the 12 identified professions failed to form registration boards.  They were simply allowed the indulgence of proceeding on their merry way, totally ignoring the 2005 legislation.  The then Minister did absolutely nothing about it.  That way of governing has no place in a modern democracy and the Government and the Minister of Health will take the difficult path - the path which wins few friends - that will deliver the change so badly needed in the way we deliver health care to those relying on us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200039#MM00200","speaker":"972"},{"type":"speech","time":1349202900,"counter":614,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  As health and social care becomes increasingly specialised, it is only proper that professionals working in these areas are correctly registered and this is the rationale behind the Bill.  A few short years ago, only five professions were subject to statutory registration: doctors, dentists, nurses, opticians and pharmacists.  At the time, that was sufficient as that was the extent of specialisation within the profession.  However, as scientific knowledge increases, so too does the need for registration and among the health and social care professionals covered by the Bill are dieticians, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, psychologists, social workers and speech and language therapists.<\/p><p>  The legislation will have the benefit of giving much-needed clarity to consumers wishing to purchase the services of some of these professionals.  For example, a person procuring the services of a speech and language therapist for a child can be assured that if he or she is registered with the necessary board governing that profession, that he or she have the proper qualifications and that those qualifications have been checked and independently verified.  Equally, if people let a social worker into their home or are engaging with a psychologist, they deserve to be assured that the person involved has achieved the necessary competence and that this has been independently verified.  The registration process will protect the public but will also protect the professionals involved in that proper entry requirements will be established and there will be a proper mechanism to oversee entry into the profession and ensure this is restricted to people who have the necessary qualifications.<\/p><p>  At European level, the introduction of the professional qualifications directive set out the rules for recognition of qualifications between member states, an important consideration for the many professionals of Irish origin working abroad, and the Bill also provides for the recognition of qualifications obtained outside the State, which are outside the scope of the directive that was transposed into domestic law in 2009.  The fact that the boards established under this Bill will determine fitness to practise complaints for each of the 12 listed professions is another important consideration.  This was provided for in the 2005 Act, but had not commenced to date and the passing of this Bill will facilitate the speedy introduction of proper complaints procedures.  For students currently in second level education, greater clarity will be provided in terms of career paths as a result of the legislation because one of the functions of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council is the approval of education and training courses.<\/p><p>  I am concerned, however, about the slow nature of progress to date in the establishment of the various boards.  For example, only two of the 12 registration boards proposed have been established.  The first of these, the Social Workers Registration Board, was appointed in August 2010 and the register for social workers opened in May 2011.  All practising social workers must be on the register by the end of May 2013.  A total of 2,700 social workers are expected to be on the register by the end of May next year and much work relating to this process remains to be done.<\/p><p>  Another concern must be the payment of an application fee and, subsequently, of an annual retention fee.  This is a cost of going to work and should be recognised as such, perhaps with these fees being offset by tax credits.  The procedures involved in the appeals system must be fair and it is only right and proper that applicants for registration who are dissatisfied with the outcome have the right to appeal and the list of grounds for appeal are listed in the Bill.  I also welcome the fact that under the current Act, and also under the provisions of this Bill, applicants will have the right to appeal a registration board decision to the High Court to ensure their rights are safeguarded.  As medicine and social care becomes increasingly specialised, it is fitting that a proper system be put in place to recognise emerging specialties and ensure all professionals claiming membership of a particular medical or social care profession have their competence independently verified and have complaints against them arbitrated on by a professional and independent body.<\/p><p>  I welcome the provisions of the legislation in the context of the clarity they bring to the use of the 12 professional terms listed and the safeguards they provide both to the professionals involved and the users of their services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200039#MM00300","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speech","time":1349203500,"counter":615,"content":"<\/a> <p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Health and Social Care Professionals Bill.  The Bill proposes necessary technical amendments to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, which introduced a State regulatory regime for the designated health and social care professions not previously regulated.  The main purpose of the Bill is to amend the Act to allow the Minister for Health to continue to appoint professional members to the council until each of the 12 registration boards established under the Act has held elections and is in a position to nominate one of its elected members.  The 12 registration boards were established following the 2005 Act, which provided for the establishment of a system of statutory registration for 12 health and social care professions.<\/p><p>  The system comprises a registration board for each of the 12 designated professions, a Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system, and a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters.  In time, as each register completes its transitional period, only a registrant of a registration board will be entitled to use the relevant designated title.  The Health and Social Care Professionals Council was established in March 2007.  Its mission is to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence through statutory registration of health and social care professionals.<\/p><p>  I have witnessed at first hand some of the great work carried out by carers throughout my constituency of Louth and east Meath.  Whether it is nursing, midwifery, occupational therapy or radiography, the standard of care provided in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda or Louth County Hospital in Dundalk is outstanding.<\/p><p>  Social care is a profession where people work in partnership with those who experience marginalisation or disadvantage or who have special needs.  Social care practitioners work with children and adolescents in residential care, as I have experienced in the setting of St. John of God's, Drumcar, County Louth.  Other services include those for people with learning or physical disabilities, like the great work done by St. Brigid's Special School in Dundalk.  I have seen support provided to homeless people in Dundalk by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  I have seen people with alcohol or drug dependency being supported by the Simon Community in Dundalk and Drogheda.  Other organisations support families in the community and I have witnessed the support provided for older people by Older and Bolder in Dundalk and Drogheda.<\/p><p>  To date, only two registration boards, the Social Workers Registration Board and the Radiographers Registration Board, have been established.  This is the difficulty the Bill addresses.  The current provisions of the Act do not allow for the Minister to make nominations for vacancies which have arisen subsequently, since the Act specifies that these should be elected members of, and nominated by, registration boards.  The Bill, therefore, provides that the Minister may appoint members to the council in various circumstances, including where a registration board has not been established or has not yet held an election.  This is one of the key benefits of the Bill and why I have no hesitation in commending it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200040#NN00200","speaker":"1068"},{"type":"speech","time":1349203500,"counter":616,"content":"<\/a> <p>New and innovative therapies are being developed and internationally recognised all the time.  I wish to draw attention to dance movement therapy, art therapy, drama therapy, music therapy and play therapy.  All of these therapies have merit.  As a former school principal, I have seen wonderful outcomes for children with emotional needs who have participated in play therapy led by qualified play therapists.  Any therapy delivered by professional therapists that cuts down on medication and improves quality of life must be welcome.<\/p><p>  I have particular regard for music therapy, which I have seen used in the children's unit of our National Rehabilitation Hospital in D\u00fan Laoghaire.  Music therapy is based on the understanding that all human beings are able to respond to music, irrespective of disability or injury.  Music has always been a powerful tool of expression.  It can touch our emotions deeply and allows for a freedom of communication that needs no words and often no movement.  Music therapy is an evidenced-based profession.  A growing body of research demonstrates the benefits and importance of music therapy as part of rehabilitation treatment programmes.  Music therapy is the planned and intentional use of music-based methods to meet an individual's emotional, social, physical, psychological, behavioural and communication needs.  Irish music therapists works closely with other professionals within the interdisciplinary paediatric teams using music-based methods to facilitate the children to achieve their rehabilitation goals.  Music therapy is available as a core therapy in many international rehabilitation units and is an established part of interdisciplinary treatment within health, education and social care settings.<\/p><p>  On 26 July I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health asking for statutory registration and recognition of these four therapies.  Many Irish people have invested years qualifying in these areas.  They have also invested significant amounts of money and they are professionals.  However, there are many other rouge traders, such as people presenting themselves as qualified dance movement therapists, art therapists, qualified drama therapists and music therapists.  It is confusing for people and leaves vulnerable people in a more vulnerable position.  The present position is unsatisfactory for our citizens and for the therapists.<\/p><p>  The object of the principal Act associated with this Bill is to protect the public.  This will be achieved by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among the registrants of the 12 health and social care professions designated under the Act.  In the principal Act, 12 professionals are listed and, in time, only registrants will be entitled to use these titles and the public will have confidence in the professions.  This must be greatly welcomed.  The answer to my parliamentary question of 26 July, which asked for statutory recognition for dance, art, drama and music therapists, indicated that the Minister for Health has power to include them if he considers it appropriate and in the public interest.  When the regulatory frameworks in respect of the 12 designated professions are fully in place, I ask the Minister to incorporate these additional therapies - drama, art, dance, music and play therapy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200040#NN00300","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"speech","time":1349203500,"counter":617,"content":"<\/a> <p>I welcome the Health and Social Care Professionals (Amendment) Bill.  It is very important that the designated professions are regulated.  I was closely involved in the debate on the original Bill in 2004.  My contribution is based on the debate that took place at that time in respect of one profession that was excluded.  The profession of psychotherapy and counselling was excluded specifically because the organisations involved in regulating the professions could not agree how it was to be regulated.  That was the sole reason for the exclusion and the Minister of State at the time, Tim O'Malley, accepted that they should be included.  He hesitated to include them while divisions existed among the various professional organisations on how to regulate.  He asked the professions to agree on an approach.  In 2008, the professions presented to the Minister a document on public protection entitled Submissions on The Statutory Regulation of Counsellors & Psychotherapists in Ireland.  Tomorrow, I will outline and develop the reasons psychotherapy and counselling are not regulated at present.  Anyone can practise and charge for psychotherapy or counselling in this country.<\/p><p>Counselling can do great damage to vulnerable people.

It is the zombie-like drug addict we see on the streets or the alcoholic who is staggering home or falling off the bar stool, drunk.  The private face presents differently.  Not all addicts fit the stereotypes I have mentioned.  Addiction affects many people in our society.  For every person in addiction, at least six or ten other people are affected by it, often very seriously.  We know the economic cost.  It is more than &#8364;3 billion, considering the crime related and health related matters.  I move this Private Members' motion to bring this matter onto the floor of the House and to look at the scale of the problem, what is being done to address the matter and what is lacking in tackling these issues, and to ensure the issue does not end up on the cutting-room floor of the budget.<\/p><p>  It is also important to look at the changing nature of addiction.  We are now in the area of polydrug use of lethal combinations, including alcohol.  Services must be able to keep up with these changes in use.  Many of the statutory services are focused solely on heroin use.  We must also consider the use of the Internet in sourcing substances.  In acknowledging the scale of the problem, the point must be made that it is not confined to Dublin.  It is a national problem.  Alcohol was always there, but now the towns and villages of Ireland are seeing heroin, cocaine, head shop products and so on.  We must also consider other addictions, such as gambling, food, sex and the Internet.<\/p><p>  We know there is gangland crime.  It is one part of the problem.  The horrific recent killings, particularly in front of young children, were especially gruesome.  I hope the other aspects of addiction will get the same attention and resources as the gangs are getting.<\/p><p>  I am hoping for an honest, thoughtful and thought provoking debate.  The motion calls for addiction to be prioritised as a health issue and not primarily a criminal issue.  It is good to see drugs are now the responsibility of the Department of Health.  That is a positive step.<\/p><p>  Heroin first appeared in the late 1970s and 1980s in Dublin's inner city, where cynical operators and dealers targeted poor communities.  The drugs were dispensed like sweets until the teenagers were hooked.  I saw so many lovely young people taken over by heroin.  Their families were devastated and their communities held to ransom.  The lone voice of the late Tony Gregory brought the issue into the D\u00e1il Chamber, where it was not taken seriously because officialdom had no real interest in tackling the issue then.  The flat complexes in the inner city were known as heroin supermarkets at the time.  Tony Gregory continued to make drugs a major issue in the D\u00e1il and in Dublin City Council.  This debate is so that the issue will not be off the agenda.<\/p><p>  Currently, we are seeing a rise in heroin use.  It is interesting that it is coinciding with another economic depression.  Again, there are no geographic bounds.  At a meeting this morning we were told of increases in seizures of heroin for personal use and supply in Dublin city.  The European monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction places Ireland top of the table of EU countries for heroin use.  This is compounded by polydrug use, including alcohol use.<\/p><p>  We are also seeing an alarming emergence of grow houses in suburbia, in rural areas and in rented apartments.  It is not confined to poor communities.  The growers' expertise is considerable.  They are producing higher strength cannabis.  The main psychoactive chemical, THC, is several times higher in grow house skunk than in hash.  Project workers working with young people are concerned about this.  It is being confused with the more benign name of hash which, whether we agree or not, has a different effect on people.  I will not be like various Presidents of the United States or Ministers and admit to smoking the odd joint when I was in college.  I did not.  This is irrelevant, but I thought I would put it out there.<\/p><p>  I have seen the long-term effects of significant use of cannabis.  It is not good to see.  However, we should open the debate on cannabis use and look at the arguments for and against.  Ireland is the only EU country not to regulate the medical use of cannabis.  The Netherlands is looking at classifying this high potency cannabis with cocaine and ecstasy.  More young people are using skunk in Dublin.  At one of the projects young people talk about paranoia and panic attacks.  Other substances are mixed with skunk and young users, in turn, mix it with Benzodiazepine and alcohol.  There is great pressure on some drug projects because they are dealing with a broader array of drugs, rather than cannabis or heroin on their own.  There is also crystal meth, crack cocaine and tablets.<\/p><p>  It may be because the heroin epidemic began there that Dublin's inner city has become associated with drugs.  The response in the inner city has been remarkable.  We have excellent projects and services in the voluntary and community sector.  There is SAOL, Soilse, Chrysalis, HOPE and Crinan, to name a few.  They are taking on these challenges.  The SAOL project produced the Reduce the Use booklet which is being used in Ireland and throughout Europe.  There are other interesting initiatives on harm reduction.  I was at the north inner city drugs task force today.  I used to chair it when I was a teacher and I am now back as a public representative.  I listened to project workers talking about their work, how they are coping with funding cuts and with their terror of the effect of further cuts to front-line services.<\/p><p>  The late Tony Gregory once said, &quot;Follow the money&quot;.  That eventually led to the setting up of the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair\u00ed Quinn, was Minister for Finance at the time.  It took the murder of Veronica Guerin to get people moving.  That is not good enough for all the other people who are involved in the addiction area.  In 2007, Tony Gregory also spoke about the middle rank of dealers, and called for a mini-CAB for those areas where young people see dealers with extravagant lifestyles and no visible means of income.  The motion calls for some of the assets of drug related crime acquired by CAB to go back into communities most negatively affected and used for treatment, rehabilitation, prevention, education and family support services.  The money could also be used to deal with the intimidation and fear that families must deal with because of drug debt.<\/p><p>  We know about death from overdose, lethal mixing and suicide.  We have innovative programmes that are seriously at risk of being cut.  I am talking about ASIST training, particularly for those dealing directly with vulnerable people.  Statutory agencies sometimes send people to do this training and then do not use it, while community projects whose workers would use the training might not have the funding for it.  Mindfulness also has a programme.  It is a proven strategy for those in recovery.  The Oasis Deora counselling centre in North Wall, Dublin, is one of the few that will deal with people in addiction.  So many programmes wait until people are in recovery.<\/p><p>  Between 20,000 and 50,000 are affected by hepatitis C but effective treatment is available.  We know that injecting drug use, especially the sharing of injecting equipment, is the leading risk behaviour for the transmission of hepatitis C.  The national strategy has set out a clear plan.  The Government amendment refers to the expansion of needle exchange services.  Will this include the provision of injecting rooms which are in some other cities but not in Ireland?  This is controversial, but we need that debate.<\/p><p>  We also need the debate on decriminalisation.  We need to have a reasoned debate looking at the research.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200041#OO00300","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1349204700,"counter":622,"content":"<p>The Deputy has used her ten minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200042#PP00100","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1349204700,"counter":623,"content":"<p>I will make a couple of final points.  With regard to the methadone protocol, methadone has certainly had a stabilising effect on drug users.  There is no doubt about that, but the problem is that people are being left on methadone for too long.  There is a need to address this.  It is much cheaper to have somebody on methadone than to have them in a rehabilitation or residential centre.<\/p><p>  My final point is about the alcohol strategy.  A national substance misuse strategy was launched last February but the Government will have to take on a very powerful lobby, that is, both the drinks industry and the sporting organisations that accept sponsorship from the drinks industry.  We have seen all the problems and we know the facts and figures about the effects of alcohol.  I could use an extreme case.  We could ask one of the drug barons in Dublin, Cork or Limerick if they would like to sponsor an event.  We ask it of the drinks industry, which is also responsible for a drug.  It is a much more harmful drug at times because more people are dying from alcohol related illnesses than are dying from all the other drugs combined.<\/p><p>  I will conclude as I do not wish to take time from the other Members in the Technical Group.

I congratulate Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on drafting the motion and apologise to her for encroaching on her time.  She was in full flow and could have continued.  I also welcome the new Minister of State with responsibility for primary care, Deputy Alex White.  I hope he has a successful tenure, at least more successful than his predecessor.<\/p><p>  This Private Members' motion is very important because addiction is a serious problem throughout the country.  I received a call from my local radio station today.  It related to just one phrase in the motion which refers to opening a debate on the decriminalisation of drugs.  I will address that issue later in my contribution.  It is a pity that this single phrase has been picked on by some Members on the Government side as the important message of the motion, because the motion covers all aspects of addiction.<\/p><p>  The biggest addiction problem in this country is addiction to alcohol and alcohol abuse.  It is the number one issue in Ireland today.  In 2010 a HSE report estimated the cost of alcohol related problems at \u20ac3.2 billion annually.  That is a huge figure when one considers the costs of the HSE and the overruns it is dealing with at present.  Addiction, particularly alcohol addiction, is the cause of that financial cost, as well as further problems.  Alcohol related crime is estimated to cost approximately \u20ac1.2 billion every year.  We really have a major problem with alcohol and alcohol addiction in this country and it must be dealt with as comprehensively as possible.<\/p><p>  In the case of alcohol related crime, 97% of public order offences are due to alcohol, according to the Garda PULSE system, while in over 50% of murders committed in this country the perpetrators had consumed alcohol.  For 76% of rape defendants, alcohol was a factor in the rape.  One can see it is a huge problem.  Financially, we must deal with it, quite apart from the cost to society and the cost to families and young people who are damaged and abused as a result of alcohol abuse.  One of the biggest problems with alcohol is its availability.  It is in every corner shop and supermarket.  We just cannot get away from it.  When I was young, parents complained about the fact that the sweets were always on display beside the checkout in the shops.  Now, it is the off-licence that is on display beside the checkout, to encourage people to buy drink when they are paying for their groceries.  We must deal with that.  The previous Minister was putting together proposals and hoping to put measures in place to deal with it, so I hope this Minister will continue that work.<\/p><p>  We talk every day about the reductions in the health budget and the cutbacks that are due to take place in forthcoming years.  Consider that in the context of the cost of alcohol abuse at over \u20ac3.2 billion each year.  If we could deal with that and make real inroads, we could ease a great deal of the pressure on our health budget and have a more reasoned debate about it.<\/p><p>  Drug abuse is a problem not only in the inner cities but throughout the country, including in rural areas.  There is a complete lack of support and services for addicts in rural areas.  There is a heroin problem in a number of areas in County Donegal, with many addicts in the local communities.  Indeed, over the last year or so there were a number of deaths related to drug use in rural areas.  Addicts in rural areas who wish to get on a methadone programme or who wish to deal with their addiction must wait six weeks for an appointment for a methadone programme.  They must then travel to Dublin to get approval to attend the methadone clinics.  That is unacceptable when drugs are available throughout the country.  Young people's lives are being destroyed from drug abuse and the lack of support services for them.<\/p><p>  This motion proposes a number of actions to be carried out by the Government.  It calls for the assets seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, to be made available to fund drugs projects.  That is vital.  They should also be used to offset the cuts that are being imposed.  It calls for no further cuts to community employment, CE, schemes that are dealing with addiction services.  That must be implemented.  In the last number of weeks cuts have been made to child and adolescent mental health services in the HSE west area.  This means that young vulnerable people and the many families suffering as a result of alcohol abuse and addiction problems cannot avail of the services they require to help them to cope with their daily lives.  Those services must be reinstated to ensure young people will be able to cope and talk to somebody who could help them to live through their difficult situation.<\/p><p>  It is vital that we have a debate on the decriminalisation of drugs in this country.  In 2002 Portugal decriminalised the possession of drugs for personal use.  Reports I have read show that this has reduced addiction and crime related to drug use.  We must have that debate and it must be done without hysterical reactions.  We must look at these models to see if there is anything we can transpose to Ireland which could help to reduce addiction.  Anything that would lower the level of addiction and the problems people have with it must be welcomed.<\/p><p>  The motion is comprehensive and I congratulate Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on producing it.  It is vital that we maintain services as well as putting them in place.  If we could move away from a system of year to year budgets and think in the long term, we could make a real impact, reduce our costs and reduce the level of the problem in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200042#PP00300","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1349204700,"counter":625,"content":"<p>This is an incredibly diverse motion which contains some excellent ideas for dealing with addiction in Irish society.  In fact, any specific aspect of the motion could be a single motion in itself.  I will use the short time available to me to deal with drug addiction as it pertains to prisons.<\/p><p>  Any meaningful policy for dealing with drugs must take a particular approach to prisons for a number of reasons.  First, there is the fact that crime is the central reason for so many drug addicts ending up in prison.  Obviously, the individuals themselves are victims.  In addition, on a purely economic basis, there are benefits to society in terms of saving money from ending a revolving door by dealing with the issue of addiction when people are caught by the system, as it were.  When people are taken out of society and incarcerated with plenty of time on their hands it should be an opportunity to rehabilitate them.  Instead, it is a training ground to get more people hooked on and involved with drugs.  Unless we deal with this issue, we are deceiving ourselves.<\/p><p>  There are two issues involved.  The first is the number of prisoners who have addiction problems and end up in prison as a result.  A survey carried out on the psychiatric status of Irish prisoners in 2005 revealed that almost 60% of male prisoners sentenced had a drug dependency problem and 45% had an alcohol dependency problem.  Only 26% of sentenced prisoners did not have an addiction problem of any nature.  Other shocking surveys were carried out in the late 1990s and early in the last decade which showed that 21% of intravenous drug users first injected drugs while they were in prison.  Our prisons are introducing people to a life of drugs rather than dealing with the issues while prisoners are in prison.  This is despite the fact that there has been a huge shift in policy, with airport style searches being introduced since 2008 and a hard-nosed attitude being employed.<\/p><p>That does not work.<\/p><p> We must go back to the drawing board and we need a rational, sensible and non-sensational attitude to this problem because it has been the official strategy of the State since 2002 to have drug-free prisons.  That is an embarrassment when we look at the policy pursued by the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell.  It was based on increasing the resources to deal with searches and surveillance, amending the rules regarding visitors and contraband, mandatory drug testing, increased punishment for prisoners who were drug offenders and a much more hardline approach but the reality is that it has been a complete failure and we must now consider a different way to work.<\/p><p> It is completely wrong that we have a scenario where such resources are spent on security when we only have 24 full-time drugs counselling posts spread over 14 Irish prisons, with 4,000 Irish prisoners reliant on nine detox beds.  It is completely back-to-front.  I had the misfortune to spend a month in prison in the D\u00f3chas centre ten years ago where I got to see at first hand many of the antics that went on and again the approach was the wrong way around.  While I was there a young woman was released, took an overdose and died that weekend.  It was a normal conversation in the prison.  This young woman had been in and out of prison all her life.  The prison wardens would report young people coming in and for a while they are getting steady meals, their skin is improving and they are starting to deal with their issues if they can keep them off the drugs.  Suddenly, however, they are back out into the same conditions on the outside that led them into addiction in the first place, they take a hit and end up dead.<\/p><p> We need joined-up thinking.  I was appalled that while I was in the centre, there was not a single counsellor to deal with all the issues, stresses and strains faced by those young women and mothers as a result of a life inside.  There was a hairdressing unit that could have taught them a skill that could get them a job when they were released but no one tried to deal with the training aspect of rehabilitation.<\/p><p> Every society that places an emphasis on rehabilitation in such places sees it work because it is not just illegal drugs that are the problem, it is the pro-drug culture that exists in the prison.  In 2010 we spent approximately \u20ac3 million on prescription drugs in the prisons.  When I was there I was the only person in the prison who was not on drugs of some sort.  People were either doing the illegal stuff or at night they queued for the tranquilisers and sleeping tablets that keep people sedated.  It was scandalous that this should have been happening instead of proper intervention.  We must look at this.<\/p><p> I fully support the idea being pushed by the Jesuits in particular about developing custodial treatment centres instead of sentencing, that people would agree to be sent to a treatment centre instead of a prison, perhaps with a reduced sentence on the basis that they get treatment.  It would cost a fraction of what it costs now, would stop the revolving door and society would win.  Unless we deal with this how we are deceiving ourselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200042#PP00400","speaker":"1015","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349205300,"counter":627,"content":"<p>Like the other speakers, I pay tribute to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan for bringing this comprehensive motion forward and highlighting the many important issues it raises.<\/p><p>  It is timely that such a motion should come forward because alcoholism and drug addiction, particularly heroin addiction, have blighted our society for many years.  We are now in an economic recession, with mass unemployment, austerity and cuts being visited in a serious and severe way on our society.  We are recreating the conditions which have given rise to these problems at a serious level since the 1980s, and even further back with alcohol.  We are now at a moment when we will create the conditions for all of these problems, which are already very serious, to get much worse if we do not take them seriously and deal with them in a sensible and rational way.  More lives, families and communities will be devastated by these problems if we do not ensure it does not happen.<\/p><p>  We do not need to quote statistics, although there are many, to know of the enormous overlap between alcohol addiction and heroin addiction and issues such as poverty, homelessness, poor quality housing and high levels of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment.  We might add to that list the issues of suicide and mental illness.  All of these are complex, multifaceted issues but there is unquestionably a huge correlation between them all.  They must be dealt with if we are to make any serious effort to deal with heroin addiction, alcoholism or other forms of addiction.<\/p><p>  It is no coincidence that the heroin epidemic first arose in this country in the 1980s during the last period of recession and mass unemployment.   It ravaged lives, families and communities and we are still dealing with the legacy of the problems that developed then.  Many of those problems have been passed down through the generations from parents to children and even to grandchildren.  If we made any headway in trying to deal with those problems, it was because the communities most affected by them, the families and the rehabilitated addicts themselves, fought back, demanded resources, set up community initiatives, worked through community employment schemes to cope with and manage those problems and forced some sort of serious policy response from Governments over the last 20 years to a point where we did not resolve the problems but we were beginning to get a handle on how to address them.<\/p><p>  Now, however, there is a threat that all that work could be undone if cuts are imposed on CE schemes that provide counselling services, drug rehabilitation schemes and outreach services to young people who are vulnerable.  These CE schemes are holding together some of the most disadvantaged communities that are most affected by alcoholism and drug abuse and every cut to those services threatens to exacerbate the problem of heroin addiction.<\/p><p>  It is rarely said, particularly about heroin, but there is an important distinction between heroin and many other drugs.  It is almost a misnomer to talk about heroin getting people high, as if it is a fun drug.  Heroin is a pain-killer; people take it to kill the pain.  It is more akin to tranquilisers and legally prescribed drugs, which are also about sedating people with serious mental health and other problems.  We must understand that it is the underlying problem of poverty, with many of those who have fallen into heroin addiction being the same people who went through industrial schools, sexual abuse and neglect and ended up in prison.  We must deal with the problems at the root cause.<\/p><p>It means addressing issues such as homelessness and I note the strong correlation between homelessness, drug problems, alcoholism and so on.  In addition, as previously noted, there must be a serious debate on decriminalisation, not in some sort of hippie way of thinking one should let it all hang out and let drugs be taken because it is cool but rather because criminalising the problem has not worked.  It does not work and one must deal with it as a serious health and social problem.  Moreover, one must ensure the provision of the resources and services necessary to deal with that problem and the underlying social causes, such as poverty and unemployment that create the conditions under which such problems can flourish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200043#QQ00200","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349205900,"counter":629,"content":"<p>As previous speakers have stated, this is an important debate and I thank Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan for tabling this comprehensive Private Members' motion.  As the budget will be announced within eight weeks of this debate and given the amount of kite flying that has been taking place in other areas regarding cuts, it is of particular importance to have a real debate on this subject over the next two days.  In stating the obvious, there is a massive crisis.  There must be urgent action on the part of the State and a real discussion on the problem because the measures taken thus far, while having some effect, really have made little progress or have had little impact.  As my colleague has noted, the drug problem developed in Dublin's inner city in the 1980s and mainly manifested itself as a problem with heroin addiction.  However, we now are faced with a national problem involving polydrug use, including alcohol, as well as a massive increase in gang activity around the issue, which is a major element to have developed recently.<\/p><p>  I represent the constituency of Dublin South-Central, which is the most disadvantaged urban constituency in the country.  While its people are very proud and well organised in their efforts to organise their community, that is the legacy of the Celtic tiger in my constituency.  I refer to the poverty levels, unemployment and youth unemployment levels and the high numbers of early school leavers in that area.  Moreover, there is serious drug and alcohol abuse within the community, as well as gang activity.  An informed source told me the areas of Dublin 10 and 12 have the highest levels of drug seizures and highest drug use and supply in the entire country.  There is an epidemic of hashish, which is not like it was in the 1970s but which is a potent, powerful and very expensive drug.  It costs approximately \u20ac50 to buy a bag, from which one might get four joints.  In addition, another dangerous drug, crystal meth, is beginning to make its appearance in the community.<\/p><p>  The constituency has experienced a vicious feud between two gangs in the Dublin 12 area that has resulted in 29 murders, the most recent of which was the vicious shooting of a gang member in front of his child.  There is a major problem of intimidation which must be addressed, although I acknowledge it has been addressed by some of the local task forces.  During the past two years, I have been approached by community groups, such as Addiction Response Crumlin, ARC, and individual families with regard to the intimidation in the area.  For example, one family was driven out of their home by gang activity recently.  Only yesterday, I spoke to a woman who is being extorted of \u20ac10,000 by the gangs in the area.  These are people who are in receipt of social welfare and this has been going on daily.  For \u20ac40, they are willing to put in one's windows unless one pays up.  This is the level of activity within the community that people are facing and it is not an exception but is widespread.  The gangs in my area usually are based around criminal families, which groom troubled teenagers and children, some as young as ten, to expand their operations.  These children and teenagers are used to target families on behalf of those gangs and this cannot be ascribed to antisocial behaviour but constitutes organised crime in the community.<\/p><p>  As a member of the local policing forum, my perception is there is a lack of urgency in dealing with such issues.  I am sure the position is the same in other areas and I note Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan made particular reference to the inner city local policing forum.  This must come from the top, that is, there must be a Government-driven strategy to deal with this issue.  I recall that a special drugs policing forum operated in the inner city.  It intervened in the community and did a very good job until its disbandment after a number of years of being in place.  However, one is told the Garda cannot do much because families are not coming forward.  There is a reason families do not come forward, which is they are afraid that their houses might be burned, petrol bombed or pipe bombed.  They fear that their windows could be put in or, in some exceptional circumstances, that they could be shot dead.  Anyone with any local knowledge knows who is involved in this gang war.  There must be a strategy to target such serious criminals.  There must be constant surveillance, raids, searches and constant arrests in respect of these criminal gangs.  There must be CAB investigations to let them know they cannot act with impunity, which is what they are doing at present in many communities.<\/p><p>  I also wish to address the issue of services.  The Addiction Response Crumlin centre is a highly successful community response to the drug crisis.  Working with more than 550 individuals and families, it runs a total of eight projects, which include three community employment schemes and family support for 80 families with an under-18 project.  However, since 2008 the centre has had its funding cut by 22.7%.  Its training allowance has been cut by 50%, its material grant cut by 53% and its administrators must juggle things around skilfully.  A citywide estimate of community drug services in general indicates they have had their funding cut by 29% since 2008.  The dial to stop drug dealing initiative, which built up local knowledge and had been introduced highly successfully by all accounts, was abolished in January of this year without consultation.  The cuts have devastated and undermined the community's response to the drugs crisis and another round of cuts in the forthcoming budget would be disastrous.  Perhaps someone in government should explain this to the troika.  Our communities are being devastated and we cannot take any more from that perspective.  Finally, I fully support the point made about opening up debate in respect of legislation to legalise certain drugs at least, thereby removing organised crime from the scene.  International experience shows the war on drugs is a complete and absolute failure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200044#RR00200","speaker":"1032"},{"type":"speech","time":1349205900,"counter":630,"content":"<p>While I already did so in the Chamber earlier, I wish the new Minister of State every good luck in the years ahead.  I wish him all types of success and hope he will be successful in an extremely difficult, demanding and tough role.  I really mean this and wish him good luck.  I sincerely thank the Technical Group.  This is an unusual situation in that I appreciate the great work done by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and am thankful to the Technical Group for allowing me time even though its members did not know I am not fully in support of the motion before the House this evening.  Their willingness to give time to a person who does not support fully the motion demonstrates just how open and understanding they are.<\/p><p>  I have a number of issues and I wish to use the time allocated to highlight my concerns.  First, if one considers our history regarding the abuse of substances, one must acknowledge our experience nationally with alcohol, for instance, is not good.  If one takes the motion's call to &quot;prioritise addition as a health issue and not primarily as a criminal issue and ensure the necessary allocation of resources&quot; and to &quot;open the debate on decriminalisation of illegal drugs and safer consumption&quot;, I must reiterate that as a nation, our record with regard to consumption is not good.  This is the reason I genuinely cannot fully support this motion.  As for decriminalising some of the drugs that are illegal at present, it could make it easier.  I acknowledge great arguments can be made on both sides and I listened attentively to previous speakers but when it comes to maintaining addictions, it could result in it being easier for people to sell drugs that would then be classified as being legal.  Moreover, selling such drugs over the counter could lead to a false notion that consumption of such drugs was safe.  It could mislead drug users and, in particular, young people into thinking that if it is legal, it must be okay.  When one considers cigarettes, for instance, it is perfectly legal to buy cigarettes over the counter but at the same time, there is a massive industry in the illegal sale of cigarettes at present.<\/p><p>I am not convinced and that is why I am more inclined to side with what I am hearing from the Government on this issue than with what is being proposed in the motion.  I have real concerns and even though Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan is motivated for all the right reasons, it is just we do not always agree on everything at all times.<\/p><p> I return to the damage being caused by drugs.  It is a major problem facing the Government and all of us, and should be our top priority.  The incidence of suicide is very high in the country and I believe many suicides are as a result of poly-drug use, which is in the majority of cases illegal drugs or even legal drugs being taken in conjunction with alcohol.  I believe this is a contributory factor to the enormous increase in the incidence of suicide.  From our constituencies and from being involved with communities and knowing so many people, sadly we all recognise the enormous increase in the incidence of suicide.  This wreaks devastation upon families, parents, children and neighbours.  Communities are being torn asunder from this.  There is not a family, townland, village or town that is not affected by suicide on a regular basis, which is terribly sad.<\/p><p> It is incumbent on the Government and all of us to ensure we do everything we can to tackle illegal drug use.  I have reservations about opening the debate on decriminalising some illegal drugs on the basis that it might allow for safer consumption.  I am not convinced of that argument which is why I am not in a position to support the motion before us tonight.  The Government should be concentrating on sorting out the existing addiction problems we have such as alcohol rather than making other substances legally available.  I do not believe the timing is right for that at present.  It is no harm to have tonight's debate on the floor of the House allowing everybody to make contributions.  Whether for or against, everybody's contribution is valuable and important.  We need to get the message from both Government and Opposition that we are serious about taking on the crime lords who are wreaking such havoc.  Because of their greed for money they are willing to take people's lives and tear lives asunder by importing and making freely available illegal drugs on the streets of our towns and villages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200044#RR00300","speaker":"1049","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349206500,"counter":632,"content":"<p>It is my pleasure to call upon the newly appointed Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy White, who has 20 minutes to speak.

I welcome the debate and I congratulate Deputy Maureen O Sullivan and her colleagues on tabling the motion.  There is considerable agreement between us although not total agreement and therefore I believe it is appropriate to ask the House to support the Government's amendment in this regard.<\/p><p>  At the outset I wish to recognise the very considerable work in which Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has been involved over many years with her colleagues and collaborators - if I may describe them as such - back to the involvement of the former Deputy, the late Tony Gregory, who did such extraordinary work not just in promoting the debate and discussion, but in taking a very fearless attitude and public stance over much of what was happening in his constituency and indeed throughout the country.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan may be aware that I have some involvement in one of the organisations she mentioned in the course of her speech, the SAOL project, with which I am very glad to have been associated over a number of years.  I acknowledge the work she mentioned that the SAOL project and others are doing.<\/p><p>  There is a high degree of agreement among us particularly on the harms caused by addiction, be it drugs, alcohol or other forms, to individuals, their families and friends and society in general.  There are approximately 14,500 known opiate users in Ireland.  Current figures indicate that more than 12,500 are in receipt of drug treatment, of whom more than 9,300 are in receipt of methadone treatment.<\/p><p>  Alcohol plays a complex role in Irish society.  Unfortunately, its consumption for enjoyment and sociability - along with its economic benefits - is overshadowed by the harm and health problems it causes when it is misused or consumed in a harmful and hazardous way.  The National Drugs Prevalence Survey 2010-2011 indicated that 87% of adults aged between 18 and 64 years are classified as current drinkers.  Some 58% of current drinkers, representing half of the State's population, are classified as consuming alcohol in a harmful manner.  These are stark figures.<\/p><p>  The Government is committed to maintaining the impetus in tackling the drugs problem through the full implementation of the national drugs strategy.  It sets out a series of actions to deal with the drugs problem under the five pillars.  I accept this requires a multifaceted and multifactorial approach and it cannot be reduced to one approach or another whether in the important criminal justice area or any other area - all of the areas must be brought together.  Those five pillars are supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research, each of which is important.<\/p><p>  Co-operation and interagency working between the statutory, voluntary and community sectors is crucial to the success of the national drugs strategy.  Expenditure on drugs services by Departments, State agencies and others is in the region of &#8364;250 million per year.  As I will outline, significant progress is being achieved across the five pillars of the strategy I mentioned.<\/p><p>  On supply reduction, I can assure the House that drug law enforcement remains a key priority area for An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and the Government.  An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na continues to proactively and resolutely tackle all forms of drug crime.  The Garda national drugs unit, works closely with divisional and district drug units and other national units, including the organised crime unit, as well as the Criminal Assets Bureau, in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.<\/p><p>  The association between the drugs trade and the use of violence and intimidation, as adverted to by some earlier speakers, remains a significant problem and the State will continue to utilise all resources at its disposal in pursuing those involved.  The recent brutal murders have shown the callous disregard some people have for human life and the Garda is determined to do everything it can to bring the perpetrators to justice.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner about all aspect of serious crime.  The Garda will continue to bear down heavily on the activities of those involved in gangland crime including drug crime.<\/p><p>  The use of intimidation in the pursuit of drug-related debts is a matter which is being treated as a priority by the Garda.  A framework is being developed between the Garda national drugs unit and the Family Support Network to assist persons who may be subject to the threat of drug-related intimidation.<\/p><p>  In targeting those involved in drug trafficking a number of strategies have been put in place by An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na to address the sale, supply, importation and distribution of illegal drugs.  This approach is continuing to result in significant drug seizures and the related arrests of those involved in this trade and other forms of criminality.  Provisional Garda figures for the period January to August 2012 indicate that 11,263 drug offences were detected, with 9,743 related arrests made.  Based on figures provided to An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na by the Forensic Science Laboratory, it is estimated that drugs with an approximate street value of &#8364;59.3 million were recorded as seized during the first six months of the year.  The seizure data do not include a number of significant seizures made at the end of the first six-month period which remain the subject of further analysis and which will be reflected in later Forensic Science Laboratory returns.  For example, in June as part of an ongoing intelligence-led operation targeting organised crime, the Garda national drugs unit, working with colleagues from the Revenue's Customs service, seized in excess of 400 kg of cocaine following searches in west Dublin and Kildare and arrested a number of key players involved in the drugs trade.  I commend An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and the customs authorities on their ongoing work in this regard.<\/p><p> This Government has taken concerted action to tackle the emergence of new psychoactive substances, often known as legal highs.  Since the middle of 2010, more than 260 psychoactive substances have been declared controlled drugs under the misuse of drugs Acts.  In addition, the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010, made it a criminal offence to sell or supply substances which have psychoactive effects on humans.  This combination of initiatives has had a huge effect on the availability of new psychoactive substances that were in the main being sold through head shops.  The Garda report that the number of head shops operating here has been reduced from more than 100 to three.  The Garda continue to monitor retail outlets involved in the sale of equipment that can be used to cultivate cannabis and investigate any incidents involving the availability of psychoactive substances through retail outlets.<\/p><p> As stated by colleagues earlier, under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, it is prohibited for a person to supply a prescription medicine by mail order, including over the Internet.  Furthermore, it is an offence to produce, import, export, sell, supply or possess substances controlled under the misuse of drugs Acts and regulations, except in accordance with a licence.  The Department of Health is currently reviewing the misuse of drugs regulations, to introduce additional controls on benzodiazepine medicines which are known to be traded illicitly.  The new measures will require import and export licences and create an offence for persons who possess these substances without a prescription, licence or other authority.<\/p><p> The strategy recognises the vital importance of promoting a greater awareness and understanding of the dangers of problem drug and alcohol use.  Prevention measures are in place, focusing on those most at risk as well as on the general population.  National media campaigns are undertaken by the HSE and include the development and-or support of information websites such as <i>www.drugs.ie<\/i>, <i>www.yourdrinking.ie<\/i>, <i>www.healthpromotion.ie <\/i>and regional awareness raising events such as drug awareness week.<\/p><p> The Government is particularly focused on ensuring that there is an increased emphasis on moving people from drug treatment to a drug-free life, where this is achievable.  The report of the working group on drugs rehabilitation, published in 2007, sets out the framework for a multifaceted approach to the delivery of rehabilitation.  Considerable progress has been achieved, with an increased number of places in the opiate substitution programmes, more detox beds and more places in rehabilitation programmes.  For example there are currently 142 beds available for medical and community-based detoxification and 642 residential rehabilitation beds for those suffering from addiction of various types, the majority of which are being utilised by people with problems relating to alcohol.  Additional detox beds were recently provided at a number of locations, including in Bruree, County Limerick; Farnanes, County Cork; Tullow, County Carlow and Ballyragget, County Kilkenny.  The HSE continues to prioritise treatment and is currently assessing demand for residential services, reviewing funding arrangements and standardising service level agreements.  There has also been an increase in the availability of needle exchange services, with the roll-out of the pharmacy needle exchange programme, in which more than 40 pharmacies are participating.  The programme is being expanded over a three year period.  <\/p><p> The HSE provides a wide range of services in respect of alcohol related harm.  These include health promotion activities and campaigns, outreach and counselling services, addiction services, family support, treatment of patients presenting with alcohol related harm in acute hospitals and support of voluntary organisations.  A review of the methadone treatment protocol in 2010 made a number of recommendations, including the involvement of more GPs in the methadone service, more emphasis on moving clients towards recovery, more opportunities for detoxification with appropriate follow-up and greater use of alternatives to methadone.  Implementation of these recommendations is overseen by the HSE's social inclusion governance group.<\/p><p> The Irish Prison Service continues to implement its drugs policy and strategy, entitled &quot;Keeping Drugs out of Prison&quot;.  This drugs strategy was launched in May 2006 and significant progress has been made to date.  The strategy seeks to reduce the demand for drugs within the prison system through education, treatment and rehabilitation services for drug-addicted prisoners.  Initiatives include the provision of detoxification, methadone maintenance, education programmes, addiction counselling and drug therapy programmes.<\/p><p> Any person entering prison with a history of opiate use and testing positive for opioids on committal is offered medically assisted symptomatic detoxification.  Patients can, as part of the assessment process, discuss with health care staff other treatment options which may include stabilisation on methadone maintenance for persons who wish to continue on methadone while in prison.  Methadone maintenance is available in nine places of detention, accounting for more than 80% of the prison population.  The Prison Service often engages with patients who have not accessed community-based treatment services.  The drugs treatment policy has also led to a reduction in the incidence of post release overdoses, since there is a strong emphasis on continuity of care between prison services and the community services.<\/p><p> As part of the Government commitment to deliver focused services to people in rehabilitation, 1,000 CE drug rehabilitation places have been ring-fenced within the community employment sector.  The drug rehabilitation places operate as CE schemes but with a special remit around rehabilitation and training to prepare participants to progress to employment.  The line between rehabilitation and recovery on the one hand and employment and training on the other is often blurred.  In the world of recovery from addiction, labour market participation is one of the surest ways to enhance self-esteem and reinforce stability and recovery.  This balance between rehabilitation and training has been at the core of community employment on drug task force projects and is reflected in the national drugs strategy.  In June 2012, there were 807 participants in CE drug rehabilitation projects.  The CE drug rehabilitation projects are working with the Department of Social Protection to ensure that there is adequate funding for the continuation of the valuable work undertaken by such schemes.<\/p><p> The role of the family in drug rehabilitation cannot be overstated.  The national drugs strategy states that families should be seen as service users in their own right; that service providers should actively seek the participation of families in the rehabilitation process and the reconciliation of families, if that is necessary.  The HSE works with a number of agencies to support prevention measures with families.  Some examples of these initiatives include roll-out of the strengthening families programme and delivery of a comprehensive concerned persons programme in support of family members who experience significant difficulties arising from alcohol and substance misuse.  The strengthening families programme is a 14 session, evidence based parenting skills, children's life skills and family life skills training programme aimed at preventing and reducing alcohol and drug misuse and anti-social behaviour and crime among young people.<\/p><p> The drugs task forces play an important role in tackling the drug problem in local communities.  They support more than 400 community-based drugs initiatives, which operate a range of interventions covering treatment and rehabilitation, drug awareness and prevention, community safety initiatives and support for families of problem drug users.  This year, the Department of Health is providing almost &#8364;31.5 million in funding to the drugs initiative, which primarily supports the activities of community-based drugs projects in drugs task force areas.  A review of the drugs task forces and associated structures has taken place and recommendations will be considered by the Government shortly.  The core objectives of the review are to strengthen the effectiveness of the drugs task forces, improve accountability for their activities and expenditure and streamline the funding arrangements to<i><\/i>the community drugs projects.<\/p><p>  I would now like to return to the question of alcohol and its place in our society.  The misuse of alcohol is responsible for a wide range of health and social harms in society.  A significant burden is placed on the resources of the State in dealing with the consequences of alcohol misuse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200045#SS00300","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349207100,"counter":635,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200046#TT00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1349207100,"counter":636,"content":"<p>Let us take a moment to consider the facts.  Alcohol misuse was responsible for at least 88 deaths every month in 2008.  It is a contributory factor in half of all suicides and in deliberate self-harm.  It is associated with the occupation every night of 2,000 beds in Irish acute hospitals and one quarter of injuries presenting to emergency departments.  Alcohol abuse is estimated to be associated with 16% of child abuse cases.  It was a trigger in a third of domestic abuse cases in 2005.  In 2007, alcohol related illness cost the health care system \u20ac1.2 billion and alcohol related crime cost an estimated \u20ac1.19 billion.  The cost of lost economic output in 2007 owing to alcohol was estimated to be \u20ac427 million.  In addition to the terrible human loss and suffering involved, alcohol related road accidents cost an estimated \u20ac530 million in 2007.<\/p><p>In addition, a range of disorders known as foetal alcohol spectrum disorders are caused by mothers drinking alcohol in pregnancy.<\/p><p> This state of affairs simply cannot continue.  The time has come for us to rethink our relationship with alcohol.  Irish people drink in a more dangerous way than people in almost every other country.  Irish adults drank 11.9 litres of pure alcohol <i>per capita<\/i>in 2010.  This equates to 482 pints of lager, 125 bottles of wine or 45 bottles of vodka.  Ultimately, 1.5 million Irish drinkers drink in a harmful pattern.<\/p><p> It is imperative that as a society we reduce the overall level of alcohol consumed in our society and tackle the problems of alcohol misuse.  The report of the national substance misuse strategy steering group was published last February.  It made a number of recommendations focusing on the supply, pricing, availability and marketing of alcohol, along with measures for the policy areas of prevention strategies, treatment, rehabilitation, alcohol and substance dependency research and information.  For example, it recommended an increase in the price of alcohol so it becomes less affordable, and the introduction of a legislative basis for minimum pricing and a social responsibility levy on the drinks industry.<\/p><p> The extent of alcohol misuse warrants such policies to address this pervasive threat to Irish public health.  Minimum pricing is ultimately a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels for alcohol products that must be legally observed by retailers.  The primary function of this measure is to reduce at-risk levels of alcohol consumption, especially by those who drink in a harmful and hazardous way.  It would also have a greater impact on discouraging children and young adults to drink.  In turn, this should diminish the effect of the misuse and over-consumption of alcohol on public services, crimes and public health, along, of course, with productivity in the economy.<\/p><p> The national substance misuse strategy sets out the future direction of policy to deal with the use and misuse of alcohol.  The Department of Health is preparing a concrete set of proposals on the basis of the national substance misuse strategy report, and it is intended to submit these to Government for consideration and approval as soon as possible.<\/p><p> The Government is fully committed to addressing the drugs problem, and as a Minister of State with responsibility in this area I intend to continue to drive the implementation of the drugs strategy and ensure that tackling the problem of addiction throughout Ireland remains very high on the Government's agenda.  I acknowledge the progress achieved by my predecessor, Deputy R\u00f3is\u00edn Shortall, in advancing the national drugs strategy.  I look forward to bringing proposals on an alcohol policy to the Government in the very near future, and in this regard I am confident my colleagues in government will support the timely finalisation and subsequent implementation of the national substance misuse strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200046#TT00300","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349207700,"counter":638,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  I wish the new Minister of State, Deputy White, well in his role.  I have no doubt the experience he brings from his work prior to being elected to the D\u00e1il will be of huge assistance, particularly in the area of drugs and substance misuse.  To repeat what previous speakers said, it is undoubtedly a scourge on society.  The country has faced a drugs problem for generations and more recently we have seen the obvious effects of the misuse of alcohol.  I pay tribute to the staff at Cuan Mhuire in Bruree, County Limerick, in my constituency who work in this area on a daily basis.  They do sterling work in assisting people on their road to recovery.  I find myself in the position of agreeing with Deputy Healy Rae, which is a first for me, as I am concerned about the blanket decriminalisation of certain drugs because I do not believe it is the path to take.  Various jurisdictions have had mixed experiences of this.<\/p><p>  We need greater co-operation, and the Minister of State's experience in a previous guise may help with this.  This is not an issue for one Department; it is multifaceted requiring the Departments of Justice and Equality and Defence to play a major role.  We saw the role of the Naval Service in the seizure of illegal substances off the west coast of Cork.  It is important that naval services in Europe and elsewhere share information on the traffic into and out of our territorial waters.  The availability of naval ships in Ireland is limited for the very good reason of budgetary constraints.  However, one would not put a west Cork garda in a Ford Fiesta with only first gear to patrol the entire country.  This is what we expect of the Naval Service.  The time has come for us to look to our neighbours, particularly our nearest neighbour which has a far greater maritime capability than we do, and ask for the collection and sharing of information on traffic into and out of our territorial waters in certain instances for this purpose.<\/p><p>  An issue raised with me recently is mail-order drug dealing.  A parent spoke to me about the damage being caused by benzodiazepines to families throughout the country.  This issue is gaining momentum.  I call on the Departments of Health and Justice and Equality to consider the effective programme put in place to deal with the scourge of child pornography and the use of the credit card details of those who solicited such information from websites.  Some of the websites selling drugs are hosted in countries where the law of the land is not the number one priority, but every one of these websites is dependent on an Irish bank or financial institution conveying information on the credit card details being used to make purchases.  We need a code of practice or stronger legislation put in place to go after the banks and credit and debit card companies which allow this to happen.  To a certain degree, an onus of responsibility should be placed on the sharing of information between those who transit the material into and out of the country, in particular couriers or post workers who bring large packages - these do not come in small packages - on a routine basis to the same people.  Perhaps there is also a role for the State agencies in information sharing, but certainly the credit facilities offered by banks to purchase these drugs online should be examined.  The work done to deal with child pornography was very effective.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State is correct that the scourge of alcohol abuse has been well documented.  However, there is another side to the alcohol and drinks industry.  It is very easy for Members of the House to be critical of the industry, and I agree that to a certain extent it has gone out of control, but in towns, cities and villages throughout the country we have responsible family-owned pubs which are good houses run by people who are part of the community.  They have been waiting for years for something to be done about the unregulated side of the market and I would welcome any measures taken in this regard.  In doing so, the Minister of State needs to level the playing field and engage with the responsible end of the industry.  These are ordinary people who pay their rates and exorbitant rates of tax on which we depend.  No contribution made so far this evening referred to the amount of money raised by the Exchequer from the alcohol industry.  A side of the industry is willing to engage with the Minister of State and wants to help address this problem.  It is important not to tar all of the drinks industry with the same brush.  I encourage the Minister of State to sit down with the representatives of the manufacturers, retailers and publicans.  They are in communities throughout the country and provide employment.  They do not want to act irresponsibly but, by the same token, they do not want pot shots to be taken at their industry every night.  Not all publicans or nightclub owners are bad; there are a few rogues who need to be rooted out.  I wish the Minister of State well and I support the amendment he has tabled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200047#UU00200","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1349207700,"counter":639,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, on his new role and wish him every success.  The motion is very timely given the recent tragic events in the city linked to drugs and gangland activity.  I hope in the coming months the Minister of State takes the opportunity to put his own stamp on this very important issue.  The people at the heart of this issue are the addicts, their families and children and their communities.  We need to focus on those struggling with addiction, whether to alcohol or illegal drugs.<\/p><p>We need to help their families to support them in their battle to get clean and re-start their lives.  We need to move forward with a methadone programme that does not keep people sustained on methadone but rather weans them off drugs altogether.  We need to help them access proper rehabilitation services and counselling and not be left waiting on long waiting lists to go into rehabilitation.  I welcome the review which has gone ahead, although I am not too sure what is in it.  This comprehensive review of task forces is vital to assess the work being done on the ground and to ensure projects and services funded through the task forces are connecting with the people they are serving.  There is a genuine need for accountability and responsibility.  Those projects that do the most must be recognised for their commitment to the provision of vital services for addicts.  Last month, I visited the Star Project in my own area in Ballyfermot where I met many of the participants, many of whom have been there for the past two years while others have been participating for a short period of time.  I heard one person describe how she had lost five family members through addiction.  This issue needs to be tackled urgently.<\/p><p> I cannot talk about drugs and addiction without taking alcohol abuse on board.  Here in this country, the levels of alcohol consumption is frighteningly high.  It is tolerated and socially accepted.  Young people now top up before they even go out on the town.  It is seen as our tradition in some people's eyes, which is a very sad reflection on our country - the drunken Irish.  Last week saw Arthur's Day, which was a great day but, by the evening, the city was in turmoil.<\/p><p> The drugs crisis in this country has existed for many years.  I have lived and worked in an area where drug addiction has devastated communities.  People were not allowed to go to their local shop and post offices closed down.  One particular pharmacist was allowed to treat 500 people per day on methadone.  Thank God those days are gone and people have taken on the responsibility of dealing with them.  The mindless violence and unlawful killing we have seen appear to have become the norm.  Criminals have taken the law into their own hands. This tit for tat killing in broad day light no longer shocks us, at least not until last week when innocent children saw their parents shot in front of them.  What is happening to our country and what was once a civilised society?  These are very worrying times for our communities and families.  People are frightened.  I met people from my area who will not even go to the local authority if they believe people are involved in drugs and gangland crime because they are afraid.  I commend the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and the national drugs strategy on the work they have been doing to try to deal with criminal activities.  People should contact the Garda, ring the helpline and not be intimidated because the people living there are the eyes of the community.  They know what is happening every day and they are the people with whom the Garda needs to connect.<\/p><p> The local drugs task forces and the local police forums are excellent in every community and well worth attending.  Some of the task forces are working very well but some of them are not working at all.  When the Minister of State puts his stamp on this portfolio, he will be able to weed out the ones that are not doing the work and support the ones that are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200047#UU00300","speaker":"1029","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349208300,"counter":641,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this very important debate.  I thank the Technical Group for moving this motion, especially Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, who has campaigned on this issue for many years, and her predecessor, the late Tony Gregory.  In the early 1980s when I was growing up, even though I was from a rural part of Cork but one which was near the city centre, I was unaware of the tragedies unfolding in the inner city in Dublin.  It was because of the campaigning of people like the late Tony Gregory and Deputy O'Sullivan that the drugs issue was brought to the fore.<\/p><p>  I believe the reason it was not to the fore was simply because it was affecting people who did not have a voice.  It was affecting inner city Dublin and people who were underprivileged and did not have a political voice.  It was not until such time as it spread out and started to infest other communities that it became an issue of national prominence.  It was a very sad reflection on ourselves as parliamentarians, political parties and a society that we ignored what was a serious blight on a generation of people in inner city Dublin.  That had a devastating impact on the community, families and individuals in that area.  We saw it culminating in many deaths, the arrival of vigilantes and all that flowed from that, such as the evolving criminality and paramilitaries moving into organised crime.  The proceeds of that are, unfortunately, visiting our streets regularly in Dublin and elsewhere.<\/p><p>  I congratulated the Minister of State and wished him the best of luck today in his absence.  I wish him well and hope he has success in delivering on what is a very important portfolio in the Department of Health and Children.  If I were the Minister of State, I would go back to the office, write out the delegation of ministerial functions order and get the Minister for Health to sign it tonight to make sure he has full authority and control over his destiny in delivering on primary care and all that flows from that.  In essence, primary care is critical in respect of what we are talking about because GPs and social workers are at the heart and to the fore in addressing drug addiction and abuse in our communities, along with law enforcement and trying to cut off the supply.<\/p><p>  I have gone through this motion and while there could be a difference of opinion with regard to one or two areas, we decided we would not move any amendment to it simply because it is a very detailed and thought-provoking motion before the D\u00e1il.  We can have the debate and we have a free parliamentary democracy where we can talk about decriminalisation and the opening up of that debate.  I would have concerns about it even though I know that in respect of the Netherlands or Portugal, where they decriminalised all illegal drugs in 2001, reports from the Cato Institute and others show the issue should at least be discussed.  Perhaps there are parts of it that are positive and which we could bring into our own system.  I am not sure, however, that as a society we could cater for the complete opening up and decriminalisation of illegal substances, but I am willing to listen to all sides of the argument from those at the coalface, such as the professionals and those who, unfortunately, have substance abuse issues, feel criminalised and withdraw from support services for fear of conviction and being criminalised.  Why not have this debate?  My instinct would be that we may not be ready for it.<\/p><p>  The one drug that is legal in this country is alcohol and is the cause of huge difficulties and social upheaval - domestic violence, child abuse and suicide.  It is something we must address right across the board.  Alcohol abuse is a key issue for the Government.  It is having a devastating impact on society.  These are not criticisms of the Minister of State and the Government, they are just observations as a Deputy, father and person who is interested in promoting health within our society.  The Minister of State will know when I want to criticise.  The issue of alcohol has been around for too long without us making any serious inroads into addressing the underlying problems and drift from alcohol use to alcohol abuse to drug abuse and all that flows from that.  There is a body of evidence in reports, surveys and research that is clearly evidential and shows quite clearly that there is a strong link and that it has a detrimental effect on our society and individuals.<\/p><p>  For all those reasons, the national substance misuse strategy steering group report and its recommendations must be acted upon very quickly because we are beginning to lose a generation of people again.  We saw it in respect of the Swedish House Mafia concert in the Phoenix Park and we see it every night of the week, particularly at the weekends, in our provincial towns and cities.  We know the consequences and causes of it.  We know that too much alcohol is being consumed in a binge drinking type atmosphere and we know about the drift towards illegal drugs as well, such as Benzodiazepines, opiates, alcohol and barbiturates.  When all these are mixed together, they can become a lethal cocktail.  We see it too often in coroners' reports with details of alcohol and polydrug mixes causing death.  Daily and weekly our accident and emergency departments are full.  In his speech, the Minister of State said that 2,000 beds per night were being used in acute hospitals because of alcohol related incidents.  I know we must broaden it out to talk about the other issues as well.<\/p><p>However, it is surely within our scope as a society to deal with this issue.<\/p><p> Other speakers stated the problem is multifaceted and that there is a multi-agency aspect, which is clearly the case.  Teachers tell us that children in national schools are experiencing difficulty because of alcohol abuse and use.  Therefore, we must not put our head in the sand any longer and decide that alcohol is a bit of craic and part of what we are; we must not decide to park the problem in the belief that the next generation will not be affected.  The problem is cyclical and ongoing.  Something needs to be done.<\/p><p> The 14 drugs task forces did some ground-breaking work on rehabilitation, training, community employment schemes and getting people back into the labour market.  The difficulty is that our labour market is very much diminished and, consequently, it is harder to make progress.  We will, therefore, need more supports in the supported labour market area.  We do not have the safety net that existed heretofore.  If there are not more supported labour market initiatives, there will be a backlog among people on rehabilitation programmes who used to use illegal drugs.  It is critical that we provide the supports.  I am not making criticisms but observations.<\/p><p> Let us consider the use of methadone as a substitute for heroin.  We know approximately 9,000 people are on methadone programmes at present.  If one hands out methadone continually without putting in place very serious supports, drug users drift back towards heroin use.  Evidence exists to support this view.  While we can set up treatment programmes and offer rehabilitation, we will not succeed without a multifaceted, streamlined approach.  Let us be honest: most of the drug users are very vulnerable and are under huge pressure.  They are addicted to a substance and may not have family or community supports.  They may have low self-esteem and all that stems therefrom.  Therefore, there ought to be a conveyor-belt system of supports available to them.  Any break in this process means one can slip back into drug abuse very quickly.<\/p><p> This area must be prioritised, for a number of reasons, if cuts to resources are being made.  If we talk about drug abuse, we must acknowledge it is contributing to homelessness, self-harm and suicide.  The figures in this regard are alarming.  This ought to be a priority for the Government.  All the supports should be built around the drugs task forces and made available at the coalface in communities, thereby giving people ownership of their destinies and the ability to deal with their community problems.  Prescriptive diktats from Departments or Governments do not always filter down as intended to communities.  The local drugs task forces are important in giving communities ownership and the resources needed to face their challenges.  I support this approach.  The fruits of it are to be seen.  Deputy O'Sullivan and others referred to the good work being done by the drugs task forces.  Politically, this matter may have fallen off the priority list.  I hope the Minister of State will reinvigorate it and put it back at the centre of Government policy, making sure that scarce resources are provided for those who need them most.<\/p><p> In noting the motion\u2019s acknowledgement of the good work being done by the drugs task forces and through the implementation of various strategies, we must acknowledge that resources to deal with the difficulties are key.  We must consider whether there are sufficient resources available to An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, the Customs and Excise, the Navy and Defence Forces to stop supply.  Having a land border with another jurisdiction and a vast coastline, we realise it is very difficult to cut off supply.  However, all the necessary resources must be made available.  X-ray machines are kept in Dublin Port for a few days and then driven to Rosslare for a few.  The drug smugglers wait in Britain until they find out the location of the X-ray machine and when they find it has been moved from a particular port they send their containers there.  We must use the technology available to us in conjunction with Interpol and the British authorities to deal with this problem head-on.<\/p><p> Let us be clear: some of the drug finds were accidental.  One of the biggest drug finds, which was off west Cork a couple of years ago, occurred when someone put diesel into a petrol boat.  It was a complete accident that the vast quantity of cocaine was found in the region.  If this was by accident, we must ask what is coming in unknown to us and under our noses.  We must provide resources to combat smuggling.<\/p><p> It is not a criticism of those who are on the high seas daily to state there are more resources devoted to chasing a few fishermen around west Cork than to chasing smugglers coming from Colombia in yachts and catamarans to the Irish coastline, from where they move farther on into Europe.  We must, therefore, get our priorities right if we are to be serious about cutting off supply.  Cutting off half or quarter of the supply is no good because all this does is inflate the cost of the products coming in.  This increases criminality, resulting in a circular problem.  We must deal with the problem head-on on a number of fronts.<\/p><p> I urge the Government to prioritise surveillance and co-operation with Interpol and other agencies on a pan-European basis and globally, particularly with the United States and other countries that have good intelligence on where drugs come from - South America and Africa, for example.  It should be within our gift to cut off the supply of major imports of drugs.<\/p><p> The criminal element and the activities of former members of the IRA, who are now moving into criminality and using their paramilitary experience in the process, are having a devastating consequence on cities.  Drug dealing is lucrative and will continue without appropriate sanctions.  To this day, the sanctions are not tough enough.  If one is caught with over \u20ac14,000 of illegal drugs, one receives a mandatory ten-year sentence.  I raised this in the House time and again.  I wrote to the President of the High Court and President of the Supreme Court stating we must have a sentencing policy that puts suppliers away for a very long time.<\/p><p> Those who are using drugs should not be criminalised.  We should regard drug use as a health issue.  It is a health issue for those who are addicted to substances, be it alcohol, illegal drugs or, in some cases, legal drugs.  We should have a good debate on decriminalisation but I have yet to be convinced that it would address the underlying problems in our society.<\/p><p> I ask the Minister of State, Deputy White, to put this matter centre-stage.  He should make a name for himself.  I know he will on the basis that he has done so already; that is why he is where he is.  He should make a bigger name for himself by ensuring that the alcohol and drugs strategies are central to everything he does, not only with the Department of Health but also with the Departments responsible for justice and education and those with lead roles in combating this insidious cancer in society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200048#VV00300","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349208900,"counter":643,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a ghabh\u00e1il leis an Aire St\u00e1it as ucht a phost nua.<\/p><p>  Drug and alcohol addiction, substance abuse and their strong association with suicide comprise some of the biggest problems facing society.

So far this year, the IDA has announced investments with the potential to create more than 6,000 further jobs as these projects come on stream.  <\/p><p>  Similarly, jobs in Enterprise Ireland companies started to grow again in 2011, for the first time in three years.

It is employment-intensive and covers every community in the country.  Combined with wholesale, the sector employs 258,000 people in Ireland \u2013 that is almost 15% of our total workforce.  Recognising its importance to the economy, the Action Plan for Jobs includes a number of specific measures aimed at supporting employment in the retail sector in 2012.  These actions are for delivery across a number of Departments and agencies and include a renewed focus on prompt payments, an assessment of the potential for future development of the retail sector, the introduction of a statutory code of practice for grocery goods undertakings and the provision of support to retail firms seeking to internationalise.  Other more general measures in the Action Plan which will also help to support employment in the retail sector include improved access to finance for businesses, the enactment of legislation to reform the statutory wage setting mechanisms and the acceleration of the programme of revaluation of commercial premises, which will provide a basis for the adjustment in commercial rates.  Other initiatives which the Government introduced as part of the Jobs Initiative in May of last year will also continue to help support employment in the retail sector.  These include the halving of employer\u2019s PRSI on earnings up to \u20ac356 per week and the reduction in the 13.5% VAT rate to 9% on certain goods and services.  I regularly meet representatives of the retail sector to hear about the challenges they face, including in relation to the costs of doing business.  My officials have also held separate discussions with retail representatives.  These engagements will assist us in implementing the commitments in the Action Plan for Jobs and in identifying any further actions that can be taken to support the retail sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200052#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Skills Shortages","time":1349210400,"count":682,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200052#WRC00450"},{"type":"question","time":1349210400,"counter":683,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[41651\/12]","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the discussions he has had with industry or their representatives in relation to skills shortages here; the reason, in view of our unemployment situation, that some employers cannot fill vacancies; if he has consulted with the Department of Education and Science in relation to the shortage of necessary graduates to fill vacancies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"1016","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200052#WRC00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1349210400,"counter":684,"content":"<p>The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs advises the Minister for Education and Skills and me, on behalf of the Government, on current and future skills needs of the economy and on other labour market issues that impact on Ireland\u2019s enterprise and employment growth.  In its most recent National Skills Bulletin, which was published on 25 July last, the Expert Group stated that it considers \"skills shortages\" to refer to a situation where there are an insufficient number of individuals who have the required qualifications, skills set, and\/or experience to fill a particular post.  The Expert Group considers that current skills shortages almost entirely have third level qualification requirements, coupled with experience and a specific skills mix.  The National Skills Bulletin found that the magnitude of shortages is unlikely to be greater than several hundreds in terms of headcount for the overall economy, with the exception of IT skills where the demand is greater especially for experienced personnel who are in demand and short supply globally.   Job vacancies were most frequent for sales and related occupations, including marketing (especially digital marketing) and customer services roles.  Vacancies also arose for IT professionals, science and engineering professionals, business professionals, administrative occupations, IT associate professionals, and personal care occupations.  Language skills continue to be important, particularly for sales and customer service roles but also at a professional level (e.g. ICT, engineering and finance).<\/p><p>  The conclusions of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs with regard to the incidence of shortages in specialist skills categories that require a specific skill mix, and also in relation to the persistence of some difficult to fill vacancies, concur with my own experience based on continuing discussions with employers and their industry level representatives.  The Government has brought education and training to the heart of its Action Plan for Jobs.  Initiatives such as Springboard, the ICT Conversion Programme and the target to double the annual number of honours degree ICT graduates to 2,000 by 2018 are aimed at delivering the skills needed by enterprise. n Graduates from these programmes are available to industry and increasing numbers will qualify over the next 18 months.  We will continue to depend on inward migration for highly experienced specialists in ICT who are in short supply globally.  While these are small in number; their recruitment is linked to the additional hiring of a team of graduates and professional staff.  In the area of multilingual skills requirements, I met exporting companies when I launched the Expert Group Report on Key Skills for Enterprise to Trade Internationally.  I am working with the Minister, Deputy Quinn, in the context of the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 to address the specific recommendations in relation to sales and foreign language skills development as identified by companies.

The enterprise development agencies North and South of the Border have for many years co-operated where this has added value to their activities, and this collaboration has greatly increased in recent years.  Enterprise Ireland, which stimulates the development of indigenous enterprise, has extensive contact with its Northern counterparts and works with them on a range of programmes.

Its main aim is to stimulate scientific excellence by supporting and encouraging the very best, truly creative scientists, scholars and engineers to be adventurous and take risks in their research.  Being investigator-driven or bottom-up in nature, the ERC approach allows researchers to identify new opportunities and directions in any field of research.

While this is not insignificant, there is certainly scope for improvement and I am confident that we will see more success in ERC grants by the end of FP7.  To get a better appreciation of Irish researchers' performance in securing EU funding one has to look at the success rate across FP7 as a whole.

The obligation to provide a Sunday Premium is derived from Section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 (OWT).  In summary, while the OWT Act specifies the means by which an employer should provide a premium for Sunday working, the nature and value of the premium rate is a matter for negotiation and agreement between the employer and trade union(s) representing employees or between the employer and employees who are affected by Sunday trading, in circumstances where employees are not unionised.  Thus, under section 14 any employee who is required to work on a Sunday, and his or her having to work on that day has not been taken account of in the determination of pay, shall be compensated by the payment to the employee of a reasonable allowance having regard to all the circumstances; or by increasing the employee\u2019s rate of pay by a reasonable amount having regard to all the circumstances; or by granting the employee reasonable paid time off from work having regard to all the circumstances; or by a combination of two or more of the above.<\/p><p>  Prior to the High Court ruling in the Grace Fried Chicken case that resulted in the striking down of all Employment Regulation Orders, many EROs had provided premium payments to those required to work on Sundays.  Where EROs had made provision for a Sunday premium, they had only prescribed the level of monetary compensation (e.g. double time; time plus one-third) and had excluded the possibility of the use of the other options under section 14 of the OWT Act.  These provisions were a source of significant concern to employers in sectors in which Sunday is a normal working day.  In some cases, such as the hospitality sector, it is the day of greatest demand for the services provided.  The Duffy-Walsh report accepted that there was validity in the argument that the arrangements in place in JLC sectors with regard to Sunday working were unduly burdensome, particularly in sectors in which Sunday is a normal working day.  In its decision, the High Court had particular regard to the absence of consistency across sectors in relation to such matters as to the requirement to pay a Sunday Premium and a confusion between what had been established in statute for universal application and what was being imposed through EROs.<\/p><p>  In this context, the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 provides for a new definition of &quot;remuneration&quot; for the purposes of formulating proposals for EROs.  The proposed new statutory definition will ensure that JLCs will no longer set Sunday premium rates or any other conditions of employment already covered by universal standards provided for in existing legislation.  Workers' entitlements to a Sunday Premium will, of course, continue to be reserved under Section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  To complement the removal of the Sunday Premium from the purview of JLCs, I have requested the Labour Relations Commission to develop a Code of Practice on Sunday Working in those sectors covered by JLCs.  The development of this Code will complement the provisions at Section 14 of the OWT Act and ensure that best practices are operated by all employers for those employees who are currently covered by JLCs and who work in sectors where Sunday working is widely practised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200052#WRC01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Export Statistics","time":1349210400,"count":703,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200052#WRC01850"},{"type":"question","time":1349210400,"counter":704,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[41620\/12]","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will provide the increase in the number of people employed in exporting companies; and his plans to increase the number of existing business that have an export potential.","asker":"984","askee":"1016","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200052#WRC01900"},{"type":"speech","time":1349210400,"counter":705,"content":"<p>Driving export growth is central to our economic recovery and is a key focus of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs.

Supporting new and existing indigenous and foreign-owned businesses, across all regions, is central to our plans for recovery, growth and jobs.  The Action Plan for Jobs contains a number of measures which are aimed specifically at the facilitation and incentivisation of national enterprise development from start-ups to growth companies.  The action plan is a whole-Government plan with a national focus across all regions.  The Enterprise Development agencies will be at the forefront of implementing the Action Plan for Jobs across all regions and will ensure enterprises can maximise their contribution to economic and jobs growth.  IDA Ireland\u2019s strategy document, Horizon 2020, sets out the agency\u2019s targets for the 2010-14 period.  These targets include creating 63,000 new jobs in Ireland over that time and securing 50% of these investments to locations outside Dublin and Cork.  The agency has invested heavily in the provision of property solutions tailored to meet the requirements of investors and has developed a network of high-quality Business Parks in locations throughout the Midlands and West regions.  There are a total of 120 IDA-supported companies employing over 17,500 people between both regions reflecting the considerable success that has been achieved in attracting high quality investment to both regions.<\/p><p>  A total of nearly \u20ac15 million was paid to Enterprise Ireland client companies in the Midland and Western regions in 2011, supporting more than 18,000 jobs.  Of the 92 High Potential Start-ups assisted by Enterprise Ireland throughout the country in 2011, four are based in the Midlands region and eight in the West.  As part of our support for early stage entrepreneurs, I announced an investment of \u20ac50,000 by Enterprise Ireland in each of four start-up companies in the West Region on 25 September 2012.  In addition, the Taoiseach announced the \u20ac200,000 Competitive Feasibility Fund for the West Region.  Support of up to 50% of eligible expenditure up to \u20ac25,000 per project is available and 17 October is the application deadline.  Following Exporting Awareness Events last March and May in Athlone and Galway respectively, further Get Export Ready Workshops were held in Athlone in April and in Galway in June and July 2012, with another event planned for 23 October 2012 in Tullamore.  Community Enterprise Centres located in both regions were approved funding under the Community Enterprise Centre Business Development Funding.  This programme supports funding of the creation of, or maintenance of, a business development function within the enterprise centres concerned.  <\/p><p>  In 2012, County and City Enterprise Boards in the Midlands and Western regions have allocated approximately \u20ac900,000 in support of over 100 Micro Enterprise Projects.  The Micro Finance Loan Scheme, which was launched last week, will initially facilitate \u20ac40 million in additional lending to businesses employing not more than ten people over the next five years, with provision for the scheme to be extended to provide an additional \u20ac50 million of lending over a further five years at that point.  Start-ups, sole traders and existing micro-enterprises will be eligible to apply for a loan under the Scheme.  In addition, the Credit Guarantee Scheme will also facilitate \u20ac150 million per annum in additional lending for SMEs who, because of a lack of collateral or because of the sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing traditional bank credit.  I am confident that the activities and initiatives being delivered by the Enterprise Development agencies and the County and City Enterprise Boards in both regions will continue to promote investment and employment opportunities among the communities concerned.  These will be kept under review as part of the Action Plan for Jobs of 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200052#WRC02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Written Answers Nos. 75-95","time":1349211000,"count":712,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200053#WRD00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Funding","time":1349211000,"count":713,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200053#WRD00150"},{"type":"question","time":1349211000,"counter":714,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[41253\/12]","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if County Kerry's status for grant aid will be more favourable in view of the lack of foreign direct investment in the county; if he will acknowledge that County Kerry is a very poor neighbour to the bordering counties of Cork and Limerick in the context of foreign direct investment; if any follow ups have been made by the Industrial Development Agency to companies that have relocated from County Kerry to the far east such as those (details supplied) to ascertain if there is any possibility of a return to County Kerry due to unforeseen difficulties at the new locations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1016","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200053#WRD00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1349211000,"counter":715,"content":"<p>The Regional Aid Guidelines govern the areas in which Member States may grant regional aid, more commonly known as investment aid.

The Agency has pointed out that, as it competes for high quality foreign direct investment (FDI), the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services. Ireland has only one Metro Region, the Greater Dublin area, so, in order to achieve regional economic development, IDA prioritises the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass (i.e. sufficient scale of population, skills, infrastructure, companies, business services etc.) and highlights the opportunities provided by other locations on an opportunistic basis, which are within commuting distances of these Gateways. The Gateways in the Mid-West and South West Regions include Limerick and Cork.  With continuing enhancement and improvements in physical and digital infrastructure, an FDI project secured for one Gateway Economic Region has a positive impact on other Gateway Economic Regions and their surrounding areas.<\/p><p>  At the end of 2011 there were 12 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kerry<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>  employing in the region of 1,300 people.

Approximately 70% of all FDI secured for Ireland is from the existing base of multinationals.  Accordingly, IDA Ireland has retained strong relationships with its existing client base across the country and will continue to work closely with them to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and the broadening of their mandate with a view to continuing re-investment in their sites. <\/p><p>  When IDA becomes aware that one of its client companies is considering downsizing or closing down its activities in Ireland, IDA engages with senior management in the company is question, both at local and corporate level, in an effort to persuade that company to alter its decision.

This report benchmarks business costs against a range of Ireland&#8217;s key competitor countries in a number of key areas, such as labour costs, property costs, utility costs and business and professional services.  The report also provides an analysis of cost profiles of the manufacturing and services sectors.  <\/p><p>  In its most recent Cost of Doing Business report, published in 2011, the NCC identified improvements in Ireland&#8217;s competitiveness, particularly in relation to labour costs and property costs.  However, the NCC also advised that further progress is required to ensure that Irish enterprises can compete internationally. <\/p><p>  Some operating costs for business are largely outside the control of Government.  For example, fuel and energy prices are primarily driven by external factors such as global fossil fuel prices.  However, the Government&#8217;s approach has been to identify those areas of policy it can influence to bring about cost reductions or provide supports to business.<\/p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 includes an extensive range of measures across Government which will help to reduce costs and support job creation.

Clustering can be geographically focused, but with advanced technologies and communications, it can be sectorally focussed and operate across regions.

Benefits of collaboration include: enhanced productivity and income; increased market share; increased innovation and knowledge transfer; and enhanced capability.<\/p><p>  One of the Action Points (2.4) in the Plan is to support industry-led clustering in key areas of opportunity, based on new models, industry proposals, and newly developed niche market strategies and in July last, I announced a new \u20ac2m pilot Clustering Programme designed to promote cooperation between businesses and create more jobs.  The Programme is a joint agency initiative, involving Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Forf\u00e1s.

It is also worth noting that the net change in the Manufacturing Sector showed only a slight reduction in numbers employed in 2011 in comparison to losses of almost 38,000 sustained in the previous three years.<\/p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs identifies a number of key targeted sectors in the Manufacturing and Services areas with the potential to create significant sustainable employment.  The Action Plan identifies the challenges facing each sector and sets out the measures required to ensure these sectors achieve their potential.  Ensuring that all of the measures in the 2012 Action Plan - and in the Action Plans for subsequent years - are implemented will provide the best means of ensuring that employment opportunities are maximised in each sector.   <\/p><p><b>Full-Time Job Gains and Job Losses in Enterprise Agencies assisted companies<\/b><div><table><tr><th colspan=\"2\"><\/th><th>2008<\/th><th>2009<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">Manufacturing<\/td><td>Job Gains<\/td><td><div>10,240<\/div><\/td><td><div>6,794<\/div><\/td><td><div>8,167<\/div><\/td><td><div>9,042<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Job Losses<\/td><td><div>-20,327<\/div><\/td><td><div>-28,711<\/div><\/td><td><div>-14,289<\/div><\/td><td><div>-9,423<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Net Change<\/td><td><div>-10,087<\/div><\/td><td><div>-21,917<\/div><\/td><td><div>-6,122<\/div><\/td><td><div>-381<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">International Services<\/td><td>Job Gains<\/td><td><div>8,856<\/div><\/td><td><div>5,099<\/div><\/td><td><div>8,932<\/div><\/td><td><div>8,625<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Job Losses<\/td><td><div>-7,055<\/div><\/td><td><div>-12,735<\/div><\/td><td><div>-7,429<\/div><\/td><td><div>-4,873<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Net Change<\/td><td><div>1,801<\/div><\/td><td><div>-7,636<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,503<\/div><\/td><td><div>3,752<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">Financial Services<\/td><td>Job Gains<\/td><td><div>2,764<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,011<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,536<\/div><\/td><td><div>2,085<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Job Losses<\/td><td><div>-1,169<\/div><\/td><td><div>-1,976<\/div><\/td><td><div>-1,672<\/div><\/td><td><div>-1,257<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Net Change<\/td><td><div>1,595<\/div><\/td><td><div>-965<\/div><\/td><td><div>-136<\/div><\/td><td><div>828<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">Other Sectors<\/td><td>Job Gains<\/td><td><div>1,624<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,058<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,753<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,286<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Job Losses<\/td><td><div>-1,800<\/div><\/td><td><div>-3,903<\/div><\/td><td><div>-2,412<\/div><\/td><td><div>-1,046<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Net Change<\/td><td><div>-176<\/div><\/td><td><div>-2,845<\/div><\/td><td><div>-659<\/div><\/td><td><div>240<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">Overall<\/td><td>Job Gains<\/td><td><div>23,484<\/div><\/td><td><div>13,962<\/div><\/td><td><div>20,388<\/div><\/td><td><div>21,038<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Job Losses<\/td><td><div>-30,351<\/div><\/td><td><div>-47,325<\/div><\/td><td><div>-25,802<\/div><\/td><td><div>-16,599<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Net Change<\/td><td><div>-6,867<\/div><\/td><td><div>-33,363<\/div><\/td><td><div>-5,414<\/div><\/td><td><div>4,439<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/div><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200053#WRD01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Small and Medium Enterprises","time":1349211000,"count":739,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200053#WRD01850"},{"type":"question","time":1349211000,"counter":740,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[41629\/12]","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his plans for targeted action to relieve pressure on small and medium sized businesses in the domestic economy in view of the fact that the pressure of keeping businesses open; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1016","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200053#WRD01900"},{"type":"speech","time":1349211000,"counter":741,"content":"<p>Supporting SME\u2019s in the current difficult economic climate is a key Government priority.

This legislation provides for certain statutory minimum rates of pay and conditions. <\/p><p>  The State provides a number of mechanisms through which these statutory employment rights can be vindicated and enforced. These are provided through the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), The Rights Commissioner Service, The Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT), The Equality Tribunal and the Labour Court.<\/p><p>  NERA seeks to secure compliance with employment rights legislation through the provision of education and awareness as well as through routine and complaint driven inspection of employers\u2019 employment records.  NERA also undertakes enforcement activity.  Where an employer has been identified as being in breach of the legislation NERA will request that the employer rectify the breach.  Where such a breach involves underpayment of wages due to an employee NERA will seek rectification for the employee by seeking payment of the monies due. Where an employer fails or refuses to rectify the breach or repay monies due NERA may initiate a prosecution. <\/p><p>  Where people have concerns that workers may be exploited or are receiving less than their statutory entitlements the matter should be reported to NERA for investigation.<\/p><p>  In other cases complaints may be made to Rights Commissioner Service, the EAT, the Equality Tribunal or the Labour Court depending on the nature of the complaint and the relevant legislation. The relevant body will convene a hearing where both parties will be afforded the opportunity to present their case and the relevant body will issue a determination or recommendation.<\/p><p>  It has to be acknowledged that the system that has developed over the years has become complex and in some cases involves long delays. However, I have commenced a root-and-branch reform with the objective of establishing a world-class Workplace Relations Service.  I am happy to report that significant progress has been made to date in that regard.  <\/p><p>  In addition to reforming the structures and processes, I also intend to provide for enhanced compliance measures and a new mechanism for enforcing awards of the Adjudicators and of Labour Court Determinations. <\/p><p>  The mechanisms I have outlined above relate to people who are legally entitled to work in the state. A situation where an individual, whose immigration status prohibits him or her from working legally in the State, takes up employment and is thus working illegally is different. In such cases both the employer and the employee may be committing an offence.  As the Deputy will be aware, from a recent High Court case, this may prevent a worker in such circumstances from seeking to benefit from the rights laid down in statute. <\/p><p>  While NERA, and other authorities, could pursue convictions regarding an employer in breach of certain employment legislation and employment permits legislation, in cases where the employment is illegal, and may succeed in securing penalties on the employer, they are not in a position to seek redress for the employee in such circumstances.  This is because a contract may be unenforceable if it is drawn up for an illegal purpose or in an illegal manner, or if the contract is prohibited by statute whether expressly or implicitly. <\/p><p>  On Friday 31st August 2012, Mr Justice Gerard Hogan of the High Court reversed a Labour Court award on the basis that person concerned had no standing to invoke the protection afforded by employment legislation since any contract of employment was an illegal one in the absence of an employment permit which he did not have. Justice Hogan therefore held that the Labour Court could not lawfully have made the awards as the employment contract was substantively illegal.<\/p><p>  The issue raised by the High Court judgment is one which has important policy and legal implications in the area of Employment Permits and also in terms of Employment Rights.<\/p><p>  As Justice Hogan noted in his judgement, \u201cthe Oireachtas must, of course, regulate the labour market by specifically deterring illegal immigrants from taking up employment, as failure to do so could have serious medium term implications for both employment and immigration policy\u201d. The relevant provisions of the Employment Permits Acts of 2003 and 2006 hold that where an employee, who was required to hold an Employment Permit, has failed to do so then he or she is guilty of an offence. Furthermore, while an employer may also be guilty of an offence in this matter, Justice Hogan points out that the legislation provides for a defence with regard to an employer but fails to do so with regard to an employee.<\/p><p>  As I understand it, this lack of defence affects the Courts\u2019 scope to interpret the statutory provisions and compels the Court to hold that the legislation has created an absolute offence so far as an employee is concerned. Importantly, Justice Hogan found that it must therefore be taken that the Oireachtas intended that a such a non-national employee automatically commits an offence if he or she does not have a work permit irrespective of the reasons for that failure and that this has implications so far as the civil law is concerned, in that such a contract of employment must also be taken to be void.<\/p><p>  The question which now arises is to what extent illegal immigrants should be dissuaded from working illegally in Ireland by virtue of there being a statutory offence to do so, versus, to what extent certain employment rights shall protect vulnerable migrants who find themselves unwittingly in such employment positions. <\/p><p>  The Deputy will recognise that this question requires careful consideration as the applicability of rights in one context can have far reaching consequences beyond that originally intended.<\/p><p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that I am very concerned by the facts of this case and I will be meeting the individual concerned this week. My Department is treating the matter with the utmost importance and various policy options are currently being considered with a view to an early response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200053#WRD02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National

Regular meetings of the Transport Sectoral Council are held, where transport issues, including investment, are discussed. The next Transport Sectoral is due to take place on 5 October 2012.<\/p><p>  In relation to the A5 cross-border roads project, as the Deputy will be aware in 2006 the previous Fianna F\u00e1il led Government gave a commitment to co-fund the construction of the A5.  However, they made no provision to meet the costs of the A5 post 2012 in either the Four Year Plan or the Infrastructure Investment Priorities Plan 2010 to 2016.  Given that \u00a3400 million sterling was due to fall between 2013 and 2016 and given the current state of the country\u2019s Exchequer, it was not feasible to provide this level of funding in the coming years.<\/p><p>  Therefore at the NSMC Plenary meeting on 8th November 2011, Ministers noted that the provision of further funding by the Irish Government for the A5 road was being deferred but that the Irish Government will provide \u00a325m per annum in 2015 and 2016 towards the project.  At the subsequent June 2012 NSMC Plenary meeting, it was noted that the N.I. Executive had announced an investment package of major roads including two sections of the A5 project.  In addition it was noted that the Irish Government remains committed to the completion of the co-funded A5 project which is of strategic importance to the North West Region and the island as a whole, but that the Government is not in a position to making funding commitments for the period past 2016 in advance of its consideration of the next capital review framework.  The NSMC Plenary did approve a funding implementation plan for the A5 project to the end of 2016 which incorporated the \u00a350m committed by the Irish Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200054#WRE00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Responsibilities","time":1349211600,"count":775,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200054#WRE00350"},{"type":"question","time":1349211600,"counter":776,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[41270\/12]","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","question":"the statutory powers that have been delegated to Ministers of State in his Department;

Officers serving in designated &#8220;hardship&#8221; posts may also be entitled to a hardship allowance as part of their LPA.  Where payable, this hardship element takes account of factors such as personal security and political tension, health, environmental factors, climate and isolation.

It must ensure their safety and security and work to prevent atrocities such as genocide, ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity and war crimes \u2013 atrocities which have caused the concept of \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d to be developed in the first instance.  Any objective appraisal of what has occurred in Syria over the past eighteen months will conclude that the Syrian Government has failed utterly in this basic responsibility.

I also made clear that, while the violence is indiscriminate and on an appalling scale, it is not confined to one side.<\/p><p>  If the concept of \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d is to have any meaning or relevance for the Syrian people, it is incumbent on the UN Security Council, as the body charged with the maintenance of international peace and security under the UN Charter, to act with one voice in seeking to promote the earliest possible ceasefire and initiation of a political process leading to transition.  That is why I also made clear in my address to the General Assembly that what is now needed, above all else, is a strong Security Council resolution which will authorise targeted sanctions.  This must include a comprehensive arms embargo, against all those who are responsible for violating the human rights of the Syrian people.  That is what the Syrian people want from us, and what they have a right to expect.<\/p><p>  There must also be full accountability for human rights abuses.  To prevent further atrocities now, and to save lives now, we must make it clear that atrocities will not go unpunished.

Any estimates provided are calculated on the basis that each change mentioned in the question is taken in isolation.  <u>Reducing tax relief on pension contributions to the standard rate.<\/u><\/p><p>  I assume the Deputy is referring to individual pension contributions, the tax relief on which is allowed at the taxpayer&#8217;s marginal tax rate &#8212; the standard or higher rate of income tax as appropriate in each case.  A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is not available by income tax rate, as tax returns by employers to the Revenue Commissioners of employee contributions to such schemes are aggregated at employer level.  An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans &#8212; retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts &#8212; by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers.<\/p><p>  There is, therefore, no statistical basis for providing definitive figures.  However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, it is estimated that the full-year yield to the Exchequer from confining tax relief to the standard rate of 20% in respect of pension contributions to occupational pension schemes, retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts and confining tax relief for the Public Service pension related deduction to the standard rate of 20% would be approximately &#8364;560 million.<\/p><p><u>Reducing the Standard Fund Threshold from &#8364;2.3m to &#8364;622,500<\/u><\/p><p>  The Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) is the maximum allowable pension fund on retirement for tax purposes which was introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2006 to prevent over-funding of pensions through tax-relieved arrangements.  The SFT was reduced in Budget and Finance Act 2011 by over 50% to a level of &#8364;2.3 million with effect from 7 December 2010 with transitional arrangements to protect the capital values of the pension rights of individuals where these exceeded the reduced SFT on that date.<\/p><p>  There is currently no underlying data available to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners on which to base reliable estimates of the savings from a further reduction in the SFT to the level indicated in the question.  Information on the numbers and values of individual pension funds or on individual accrued benefits are not generally required to be supplied to the Revenue Commissioners by the administrators of pension schemes and personal pension arrangements.  For these reasons, the estimated savings included in respect the Budget and Finance Act 2011 change in the SFT were quite conservative, based as they were, on incomplete data and using very broad assumptions.<\/p><p>  My Department has been engaging with representatives of the pensions industry with a view, among other things, to gathering private pensions-related data which may be of value into the future in estimating the costs of potential changes in the pensions&#8217; tax area.  These engagements are ongoing.<\/p><p><u>Reducing the annual earnings limit from &#8364;115,000 to &#8364;75,000<\/u><\/p><p>  I assume that the Deputy is referring to the current annual earnings cap of &#8364;115,000 which operates to limit the level of tax-relieved personal pension contributions in any one year.  The annual earnings cap acts, in conjunction with age-related percentage limits of annual earnings, to put a ceiling on the annual amount of tax relief an individual taxpayer can obtain on pension contributions.  A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is not available by income tax rate, as tax returns by employers to the Revenue Commissioners of employee contributions to such schemes are aggregated at employer level.  An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans &#8212; Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) &#8212; by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers.  There is, therefore, only a limited statistical basis for providing definitive figures.<\/p><p>  However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, the Revenue Commissioners inform me that the combined estimated full year yield to the Exchequer from reducing the current annual earnings cap of &#8364;115,000 to &#8364;75,000 in respect of individual contributions to occupational pension schemes, RACs and PRSAs would be about &#8364;113 million.<\/p><p><u>Reducing the maximum tax-free lump sum payment allowable at retirement to &#8364;122,500<\/u><\/p><p>  The following arrangements currently apply to retirement lump sums paid under pension arrangements approved by the Revenue Commissioners.  Lump sum amounts up to &#8364;200,000 are paid free of tax.  They are also paid free of USC. The portion of a lump sum between &#8364;200,001 and &#8364;575,000 is taxed on a ring-fenced basis at 20%.  This means that no tax credits or other tax reliefs can be set against this portion of the lump sum.  No USC is chargeable.  Any amount of a lump sum in excess of &#8364;575,000 is taxed at the individual&#8217;s marginal rate of tax (credits and other tax reliefs are available).  In this instance, USC is chargeable on the excess.  These amounts are lifetime amounts with prior lump sums aggregating with later lump sums.<\/p><p>  I assume from the Deputy&#8217;s question that he is proposing that retirement lump sums in excess of &#8364;122,500 be taxed as outlined above.  As there is no general requirement for data on the number of persons who are receiving payments of retirement lump sums of less than &#8364;200,000 to be returned to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners, I am not in a position to provide definitive figures on the Exchequer impact of reducing the tax-free retirement lump sum amount from &#8364;200,000 to &#8364;122,500.<\/p><p>  As an exercise that might provide some indication of the scale of the savings involved, it is estimated that just under 10,500 individuals in the public service would be on salaries of over &#8364;82,000 and less than &#8364;133,500 which, under existing pension scheme arrangements generally applying across the public service, would deliver retirement lump sums of between &#8364;122,500 and &#8364;200,000.  If it is assumed that these individuals would retire in line with retirement trends from the public service in a normal year (about 2.5%), then the additional tax yield from taxing lump sums in excess of &#8364;122,500 at 20% could be approximately &#8364;2m in a full year.  I have no data on which to provide a similar estimate in relation to the private sector.  I should point out, however, that one significant difference between public sector and private sector pension schemes is that private sector schemes invariably allow scheme members the option of commuting part of their pension fund for a tax-free lump sum. This option is not available to members of public sector schemes.  Depending on the impact of any tax charge on retirement lump sums, the option to commute part of a pension fund may no longer be exercised by private sector pension scheme members or may be exercised in a manner that reduces the value of the lump sum taken to minimise or avoid any immediate tax charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200054#WRE03400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Allowances","time":1349211600,"count":821,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200054#WRE03450"},{"type":"question","time":1349211600,"counter":822,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[41413\/12]","dept":"Department of Finance","question":"if he will publish details of all allowances paid to staff in his Department; the business case made by his Department in respect of these allowances to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform; the cost of each individual allowance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"986","askee":"955","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200054#WRE03500"},{"type":"speech","time":1349211600,"counter":823,"content":"<p>The following table outlines the details of allowances paid out to weekly and fortnightly paid staff in my Department in pay period 201239.

The effect of this ruling is that all private insurance contracts concluded for the first time from 21 December 2012 as well as any  agreements between parties to extend contracts from that date are prohibited by law from differentiating by gender on price or benefits. <\/p><p>  The Department of Justice and Equality is responsible for making the necessary legislative amendments to the Equal Status Act to ensure that they reflect the judgement of the European Court of Justice.

Neither the Central Bank nor the Department of Finance has a statutory function in relation to interest rate decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time. <\/p><p>  However, notwithstanding that, I have received the following input from the covered banks in response to your question:<\/p><p><b>PTSB:<\/b><\/p><p>  I am informed by PTSB that it does not have a significant amount of business loans and therefore this question has little relevance to that institution. <\/p><p><b>AIB:<\/b><\/p><p>  AIB doesn&#8217;t wholly fund itself via the ECB and so reductions in ECB rates don't necessarily lead to a reduction in funding costs for the bank. As part of the restructuring of the bank AIB is required to reduce its levels of ECB funding in exchange for retail \/ business deposits and historical wholesale market funding. In the case of business loans, most business loans in AIB reference EURIBOR or a form of EURIBOR (e.g. AIB's Business Loan Rate (BLR) is an average of 3 month's historic 3 month EURIBOR fixings). A liquidity premium and margin to cover cost of risk, operational costs and funding costs, is then added to this reference rate to arrive at a total interest rate for the customer. AIB keeps these rates under constant review.<\/p><p><b>IBRC:<\/b><\/p><p>  The majority of IBRC&#8217;s commercial loan book references money market interbank offer rates &#8211; for Euro based loans, rates are set at a margin above EURIBOR and for sterling based loans interest rates are set as a margin above LIBOR.  Changes in money market Interbank offer rates (i.e. LIBOR or EURIBOR) are applied to individual loan accounts in accordance with the contractual interest reset dates agreed with the borrower. Typically interest rates on IBRC commercial loans are scheduled to reset every month or every three months.<\/p><p><b>BOI:<\/b><\/p><p>  Business lending by Bank of Ireland (BoI) is not linked to ECB rates and therefore BoI has not passed on recent ECB rate reductions on its standard variable rate small business loans. BoI sets interest rates on standard variable rate business loans with reference to BoI&#8217;s cost of funding.  <\/p><p>  Prior to 2008, the Bank&#8217;s cost of funding was directly linked to official interest rates (e.g. Euribor). When official interest rates moved, it was appropriate to pass on the benefit or cost of that movement to borrowers through the banks standard variable rate. Since 2008, BoI&#8217;s cost of funding has become disconnected from official market interest rates due to:<\/p><p>  &#8211;the intense competition for customer deposits: as a result deposit rates have not reduced in line with reductions in official interest rates, and;<\/p><p>  &#8211;the increased cost of issuing stable term wholesale funding, reflecting distressed market conditions, the reduced credit rating of BoI and the Sovereign and heightened concerns regarding the overall euro area.<\/p><p>  The result of this disconnection is that the Bank&#8217;s cost of funding is no longer directly linked to official interest rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200055#WRF02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Review Office","time":1349212200,"count":864,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200055#WRF02550"},{"type":"question","time":1349212200,"counter":865,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[41563\/12]","dept":"Department of Finance","question":"the total number of referrals to the Credit Review Office; the number of appeals that have overturned the original decision; the breakdown of this number by county; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1106","askee":"955","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200055#WRF02600"},{"type":"speech","time":1349212200,"counter":866,"content":"<p>I have been informed by the Credit Review Office that it has received 202 formal applications since the establishment of the Office.

Revenue's systems were upgraded to implement the 30% rate last December and Revenue has since been communicating with the various lenders in regard to their IT enhancements, but the speed of upgrading has not been uniform across all lenders. To date, the IT upgrades required to give effect to the 30% rate have been completed by all but one of the lenders and these lenders have either implemented the rate or will do so with effect from next month.  <\/p><p>  Revenue is currently in direct contact with the remaining lender to ensure that the additional 5% due to borrowers is paid within the current year and applied retrospectively.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. <\/p><p>  It should also be noted that in common with many other psychological services, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for a pupil's initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. I have made enquiries in respect of this case and can inform you that, to date, no request has been made to the assigned NEPS psychologist in relation to the assessment of the child referred to in the Deputies question.<\/p><p>  It is the responsibility of the school Principal in the first instance to identify and prioritise pupils for assessment under the process described above.

The report identified serious issues with curricular overload at primary level.  The NCCA's advice recommended for the present modern languages should not be part of the Primary School Curriculum as an additional and separate subject.

These changes affect new allowances payable to both existing teachers and to new appointees in the future.<\/p><p>  Under Budget 2012 teachers appointed before 5 December 2011 are not paid an allowance where they acquire further qualifications after that date.

Allowances are not payable to new entrants from 1 February 2012.

All schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2012\/13 school year by 16th March, 2012. All schools have now been advised by the NCSE of their SNA staffing allocation for the coming school year. Details of the allocations which have been made to each school are available at www.ncse.ie. In making allocations for SNA support for schools, the NCSE considers all of the applications made by schools for  children who have been identified in medical reports as having care needs. The NCSE also reviews any existing SNA provision. In cases where children have diminishing care needs, the NCSE may reduce SNA support for those children.

However, the budget measure that requires schools to manage the provision of guidance from within their standard staffing allocation must be seen in the context of the major challenges we have as a Government in trying to shelter public services to the greatest extent that we can in these exceptional times. The net impact on overall teacher numbers in our schools has been minimised to the greatest extent possible. Teacher allocations to post primary schools for the 2012\/13 school year have effectively been settled at this stage and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students. Decisions on how this is done are taken at school level and I am confident that schools will act in the best interest of students when determining precisely how to use the teaching resources available to them.<\/p><p>  A key priority for me is to continue to prioritise and target available funding at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage. All 195 second-level school in DEIS have been given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools. My Department also provided some limited short-term support to schools through curricular concessions in order to help them manage within their approved teaching allocation. <\/p><p>  It is established policy that guidance is a whole school activity and under existing arrangements each school develops a school guidance plan as a means of supporting the needs of its students. While the school's guidance planning should involve the guidance counsellor(s) in the first instance, other members of school staff and management also have key roles to play. Parents and students must be seen as an essential part of the process. Through this process schools can, for example, consider the following options for maximising the use of their available resources for the provision of guidance: Optimise the delivery of personal educational, career and vocational guidance in class group settings; Enable students to use directly the extensive range of guidance tools available through the internet from relevant websites (e.g. Qualifax, Careers Portal); Enable some of the curriculum elements of the planned guidance programme to be delivered through other teachers such as SPHE staff; Maximise the role of the pastoral care team in schools; and, Ensure that the guidance counsellor has 1:1 time towards meeting the counselling needs of students experiencing difficulties or crisis. <\/p><p>  Psychologists from my Department's National Educational Psychological Service ( NEPS ) also provide a range of supports to schools. These include the promotion of positive mental health among the general student body and assistance in supporting pupils with particular social, emotional or behavioural difficulties. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200058#WRJ03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teaching Qualifications","time":1349214000,"count":1043,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200058#WRJ03050"},{"type":"question","time":1349214000,"counter":1044,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[41925\/12]","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","question":"his views on whether it is fair that teachers are to be disproportionately impacted by the cut to allowances for new entrants to the public service; if he accepts that qualification allowances for teachers are important in terms of ensuring we have a highly educated teaching force; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1035","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200058#WRJ03100"},{"type":"speech","time":1349214000,"counter":1045,"content":"<p>The Government recently approved a number of measures relating to public service allowances for new beneficiaries.  This follows a public service-wide review of allowances and premium payments conducted by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The main measure affecting teachers is the withdrawal of qualification allowances for new entrant teachers.  The Government has decided that the payment of allowances for the basic qualifications required for entry to the teaching profession is no longer appropriate or necessary.  This allowance goes back many years to the time when a distinction was made between teaching colleges and university qualifications.  It is not considered justifiable to incur a permanent cost to the public service pay and pensions bill where a public servant acquires an additional qualification.  The payment of allowances, such as the Gaeltacht and island allowances, are being withdrawn or altered for all new beneficiaries in the public service, including new teachers. These allowances are no longer considered the most appropriate way to meet the business needs of public service employers or the service delivery needs of Irish language speakers.  The Government was mindful of the impact of the abolition of the qualifications allowance on new teachers given that the allowances have come to be viewed as an element of basic pay.  It therefore sought to ensure broad consistency of impact across sectors. In this context, it has been agreed that new entrant teachers will no longer receive qualification allowances but will start on a salary of \u20ac30,702 which is equivalent to the fourth point of the existing salary scale.  They will also have the option of being paid a pensionable allowance of \u20ac1,592 for supervision and substitution, thereby bringing their starting salary to \u20ac32,294.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200058#WRJ03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staffing","time":1349214000,"count":1046,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200058#WRJ03250"},{"type":"question","time":1349214000,"counter":1047,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[41926\/12]","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","question":"the number of teachers that will be affected by the cuts to allowances for new entrants to teaching in 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1035","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200058#WRJ03300"},{"type":"speech","time":1349214000,"counter":1048,"content":"<p>The information as requested by the Deputy is not available as new entrants to teaching may commence in certain categories of teaching posts until the end of the current calendar year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200058#WRJ03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staffing","time":1349214000,"count":1049,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200058#WRJ03450"},{"type":"question","time":1349214000,"counter":1050,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[41927\/12]","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","question":"the number of second level teachers who are on temporary contracts; the number of these contracts that are for one year or less; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1035","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200058#WRJ03500"},{"type":"speech","time":1349214000,"counter":1051,"content":"<p>The information as requested by the Deputy is not currently available as the managerial authorities of second level schools may appoint teachers to temporary contracts until the first working day in November.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200058#WRJ03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staffing","time":1349214000,"count":1052,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200058#WRJ03650"},{"type":"question","time":1349214000,"counter":1053,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[41928\/12]","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","question":"the number of second level teachers who are on reduced or part-time hours; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1035","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200058#WRJ03700"},{"type":"speech","time":1349214000,"counter":1054,"content":"<p>Teachers in secondary and community \/comprehensive schools are appointed by the managerial authorities of the schools in which they are employed.

Expenditure on capital projects typically occurs in large tranches at fixed milestones, unlike current expenditure which is generally continuous throughout the year.

In addition, public financial rules require that payments are only made on foot of matured liabilities, so payments made in the later parts of the year are made on foot of work that has already been satisfactorily completed.

These projects will form the first phase of a new programme of PPP's designed to stimulate economic growth and create employment.  As the Phase 1 projects are progressed and as funding permits, projects that could be delivered as part of further phases will be considered.<\/p><p>  Job creation is a critical priority for Government.  This stimulus will help sustain jobs in the construction sector which has been very badly hit during the recession.  The investment in this Phase 1 package is expected to generate significant numbers of jobs: previous analysis of each sector indicates that the investment will generate around 13,000 jobs.  It will also create much needed social and economic infrastructure and aid economic recovery.  The projects selected are from the education, health, transport and justice sectors.  Further information about the stimulus package and about the PPP projects is available on the website www.ppp.gov.ie. <\/p><p>  My Department and the NDFA are closely engaged with the relevant line Departments and their agencies to ensure that their projects are progressed promptly.  It is expected that tenders will issue across the sectors in 2013 and 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200059#WRK02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pensions","time":1349214600,"count":1151,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200059#WRK02650"},{"type":"question","time":1349214600,"counter":1152,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[41908\/12]","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will consider making the compulsory payment of the spouses' and children's contributory pension scheme within the Civil Service a voluntary payment thereby reducing the deductions in civil servants\u2019 salaries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1012","askee":"1097","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200059#WRK02700"},{"type":"speech","time":1349214600,"counter":1153,"content":"<p>There are no plans to make any changes with regard to contributions to existing  spouses' and children's schemes.

It did not recommend any change either in the rules providing for automatic membership of the spouses' and children's schemes or in the refund arrangements for membership contributions.  <\/p><p>  Public Service spouses' and children's schemes are generally structured on a group insurance basis and the member contribution rates take account of the fact that payment of benefits will not arise in respect of all members.  It is also to be noted there is now a wider range of scheme beneficiaries under the schemes than heretofore.  The Revised Spouses' and Children's Schemes, introduced in most parts of the Public Service in 1984 or shortly afterwards, provide cover for marriages and children born after retirement.

This represents 47% of the total net capital estimate (\u20ac3.6 billion) for the year, which means that \u20ac1.9 billion remains to be spent.  For the same period last year, capital expenditure of \u20ac2.2 billion accounted for 50% of the 2011 net provisional outturn figure of \u20ac4.4 billion.  Individual Departments are responsible for the projects and programmes in their areas and further details about spending on projects and programmes can be obtained directly from the relevant Departments.  Given the uncertainties about precise issues of timing, and given the over-arching requirement to manage both capital and current expenditure within the overall allocations, it is too early at this stage to say what the final capital outturn for 2012 will be for each area.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, capital spending has general characteristics which influence the allocation drawdown pattern.  Expenditure on capital projects typically occurs in large tranches at fixed milestones, unlike current expenditure which is generally continuous throughout the year.  Obviously, this affects the phasing and profiling of capital expenditure.  In addition, public financial rules require that payments are only made on foot of matured liabilities, so payments made in the later parts of the year are made on foot of work that has already been satisfactorily completed.  The trend is therefore that the bulk of capital expenditure takes place in the final quarter of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200059#WRK03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drainage Schemes","time":1349214600,"count":1163,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200059#WRK03250"},{"type":"question","time":1349214600,"counter":1164,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[41318\/12]","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will arrange for the Office of Public Works to investigate and examine the need for the dredging of part of the Cordal River adjacent to Cordal GAA grounds, County Kerry, in view of the fact that the playing area is affected when the river floods; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"1097","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200059#WRK03300"},{"type":"speech","time":1349214600,"counter":1165,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works does not have any responsibility under the Arterial Drainage Act for the stretch of the Cordal River at the location in question.

This plan identified procurement reform as a key instrument that can assist the public service to deliver services in an efficient manner. <\/p><p>  The National Procurement Service (NPS) has put in place a number of national arrangements designed to secure better value for money from leveraging the public service\u2019s buying power in relation to a range of goods and services that are commonly purchased across the public service. These national arrangements have benefits that include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency; and enhanced service levels. In some instances the take up of the NPS arrangements has been low. In order to increase the usage of the NPS arrangements and thereby secure best value for money, the Government decided that it should be mandatory for public service bodies to use specified national procurement arrangements.  <\/p><p>  Circular 06\/12 implements the Government decision by making it a mandatory requirement that public service bodies avail of specified national arrangements put in place by the NPS. The list of categories subject to national procurement arrangements includes: electricity; natural gas; stationery and office supplies; paper; ICT consumables; managed print services; print media advertising;  and, motor vehicles. These national arrangements will secure best value for money and facilitate contracting authorities to deliver services within their budgetary constraints. <\/p><p>  In relation to the issue of whether public service bodies have scope to purchase goods and services locally at prices lower than those under national arrangements - the position is that a public service body making such a purchase will need to explain the rationale for not using the NPS arrangement and provide a value for money justification that takes account of the full costs incurred in managing its own procurement process. <\/p><p>  While the key purpose of Circular 6\/12 is to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money, it is worth noting that such aggregation arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money with a minimal negative impact, or indeed a positive impact, on SMEs. While a number of the categories of goods and services mandated under the Circular are suited to single supplier national arrangements, it should not be taken that single supplier frameworks are to be accepted as the norm. The greater use where appropriate of multi-supplier frameworks can address local supplier issues while also ensuring ongoing cost competitiveness of the framework itself. Such multi-supplier frameworks may also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions. <\/p><p>  In relation to managed print services (MPS), the value of this national arrangement is estimated to be \u20ac100 million over two years. Given the potential value of contracts under the national arrangement and the fact that suppliers are required to provide all of the print and imaging devices upfront, from their own resources, the view was taken by the NPS that the \u20ac10 million minimum turnover requirement was proportionate.  Furthermore, in order to facilitate SMEs, tenderers who did not have the required turnover in their own right were invited to partner with other entities to satisfy this requirement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRL01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Croke Park Agreement","time":1349215200,"count":1188,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRL01800"},{"type":"question","time":1349215200,"counter":1189,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[41766\/12]","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the savings to be pursued by him under the Croke Park Agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"986","askee":"1097","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRL01900"},{"type":"speech","time":1349215200,"counter":1190,"content":"<p>Significant savings have accrued as a result of initiatives already carried through using the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014.

Reducing administrative burdens   has the potential to deliver cost savings and efficiencies for businesses which will assist them in growing employment. This is a key focus for my Department and its Offices and Agencies.<\/p><p>  Significant progress has been made by my Department, with a reduction in administrative burdens of 24.8% already achieved in the areas of Employment Law, Company Law and Health &amp; Safety Law; this amounts to annual savings for business of almost \u20ac207 million.  Details of all the initiatives making up this total are available on my Department\u2019s website www.djei.ie.<\/p><p>  Successful initiatives resulting in significant savings include:<\/p><p>\u00a7\t  In Company Law, savings of \u20ac82 million per annum have already been realised, more than \u20ac33 million of which are due to the work of the Companies Registration Office (CRO), as companies can submit their annual returns online via the CRO website and can now use digital signatures for the B1 Form and Accounts. <\/p><p>\u00a7\t  The audit exemption threshold has been increased to the maximum level permitted under EU law.  This will achieve potential additional savings for Irish SMEs of approximately \u20ac2.8 million annually.<\/p><p>\u00a7\t  In Health &amp; Safety Law, a total of \u20ac123 million in annual administrative savings for business has been delivered by the HSA via two key projects: the BeSMART online tool for preparing the Risk Assessment and Safety Statement (\u20ac59m), and the SMP20 Guidelines (\u20ac64m), which assist construction firms with fewer than 20 employees in establishing and maintaining an effective safety management system.<\/p><p>  The reform of the State's Workplace Relations Services, that I set in train last year, will, among other matters, deliver a simplified two-tiered structure comprising a single body of first instance, the Workplace Relations Commission, and a single body of appeal, in effect an enhanced Labour Court. This new structure will provide a better service for both employees and employers, with fewer delays and reduced administrative burdens. Already there has been some significant early progress, including the development of a single complaint form for all workplace relations complaints, the establishment of a single contact portal, Workplace Relations Customer Services, to handle all complaints and enquiries, the launch of a single website, www.workplacerelations.ie, containing all relevant information on employment rights and industrial relations and the commencement of a Pilot Early Resolution Service which will seek to resolve disputes without recourse to adjudication or inspection. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to this new structure.<\/p><p>  My Department also coordinates the cross-Government measurement and reduction of administrative burdens towards the 25% target by the end of 2012.  A project to measure the burden imposed by regulation under the responsibility of seven Departments and Revenue was initiated in September 2011.  Following completion of its measurement exercise, each participating Department must then set out how it will achieve the remaining reductions necessary to reach the target and report to Government with its Simplification Plan. Revenue\u2019s report on its administrative burden reductions, which has reached the 25% target, has been published on its website.<\/p><p>  The current overall reduction is just over 15% which includes the 24.8 % achieved by my Department, the 25% achieved by Revenue and a 30% reduction achieved by the CSO.<\/p><p>  A further initiative, which will be of benefit to small businesses, in particular, has been the launch of businessregulation.ie.

The role involves extensive out of hours working and a high degree of individual responsibility for decision making in an often unsupported environment. The nature of industrial dispute intervention by an IRO is a dynamic and unpredictable activity, not amenable to structure in the normal sense of working time organization. The employer receives a commitment on the part of the officer to prioritise his \/ her work demands, often at short notice, over any other aspect of their time. The employer receives delivery of extensive additional hours working without additional remuneration. It is considered that the degree of individual responsibility undertaken by HEO&#8217;s in the role exceeds that normally undertaken by officers of the grade.<ul style=\"margin-left:20px\">(2)  <b>Is the allowance cost effective\/represent value for money?<\/b><\/ul>  It is not practicable to envisage the delivery of a conciliation system based on overtime working or on the basis of a &#8216;time in lieu&#8217; arrangement. The operation of an allowance based system ensures maximum productivity from available resources and removes issues around availability of officers from the challenge of providing a responsive service to parties in dispute. In the view of the Commission, the allowance at current rates represents good value for money.<ul style=\"margin-left:20px\">(3)  <b>Other Pertinent Issues (e.g. why duties cannot form part of grade\/post; impacts\/risks if duties\/responsibilities not undertaken) <\/b><\/ul>  The Industrial Relations Act, 1990 commits the State to the provision of a Conciliation Service. That service consistently resolves 80% of all disputes referred to it. Access to the service is on a voluntary basis and the parties demand and expect that service delivery will be structured in a manner that responds to the pressures under which the parties operate. Conciliation Service delivery is consistently acknowledged by the Minister and the parties as fundamental to the effective working of our industrial relations system and any diminution or restriction of the service would have significant impacts in terms of dispute activity leading to days lost due to industrial action in the economy. The nature of service delivery requires that the HEO officers are willing and mandated to make decisions and take responsibility for the trajectory of dispute negotiations in an often unsupported environment. It is considered that the degree of such responsibility demanded of HEO IROs is beyond what would normally be demanded of officers in the HEO grade.<\/p><p><b>Labour Inspector Allowance<\/b><ul style=\"margin-left:20px\">(1)  <b> What does the employer receive in return for the allowance?<\/b><\/ul>  The Labour Inspectorate of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including immigrant workers. <\/p><p>  Labour Inspectors deliver an enforcement and information service in relation to employer obligations and employee rights\/entitlements\/protections falling due under a wide-ranging body of employment legislation and under Employment Regulation Orders and Registered Employment Agreements. The enforcement authority and powers in this regard, in respect of which the Inspectors are warranted and certified, are provided for in various legislative enactments.<ul style=\"margin-left:20px\">(2)  <b>Is the allowance cost effective\/represent value for money?<\/b><\/ul>Yes. Inspectors conduct comprehensive audits\/inspections of employers to check their compliance with relevant legislative requirements.

The report also provides an analysis of cost profiles of the manufacturing and services sectors.  <\/p><p>  In its most recent Cost of Doing Business report, published in 2011, the NCC identified improvements in Ireland\u2019s competitiveness, particularly in relation to labour costs and property costs.  However, the NCC also advised that further progress is required to ensure that Irish enterprises can compete internationally. <\/p><p>  Some operating costs for business are largely outside the control of Government.  For example, fuel and energy prices are heavily influenced by external factors such as global fossil fuel prices.  However, the Government\u2019s approach has been to identify those areas of policy it can influence to bring about cost reductions or provide supports to business.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 includes an extensive range of measures across Government which will help to reduce costs and support job creation.  <\/p><p>  A range financial and non-financial supports and incentives are also available from Government Departments, Offices and Agencies to support employment creation in all sectors.

Also, recent jobs losses which have occurred in the FDI sector in Ireland are largely the result of the continuing restructuring process that is on-going in Ireland and other developed economies, driven by competitive pressures and technological change.  This can result in jobs at the lower end of the value added scale being either phased out completely or relocated to lower cost locations.<\/p><p>However, the most recent report from the National Competitiveness Council, <i>&#8220;Ireland&#8217;s Competitiveness Scorecard 2012&#8221;<\/i>  , has pointed out that Ireland has become significantly more cost competitive. In terms of international measures, the World Economic Forum (WEF) rankings showed Ireland&#8217;s position improving two places to 27th last September, while the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook released in May showing Ireland&#8217;s headline position recovering back into the top 20 (up from 24th) and 8th out of the 24 EU countries featured.  <\/p><p>  Our current policies are geared to bring about a transformation of the Irish enterprise sector to ensure that we are in a position to avail of the opportunities that will arise as the global economy returns to growth.  <\/p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs aims to transform the operating environment for business in order to support enterprise growth and job creation.  The Government will achieve this objective by systematically removing obstacles to competitiveness, putting downward pressure on business costs, promoting innovation and trade, supporting new and existing businesses to develop and expand, and by deepening the impact of foreign direct investment in Ireland.  The Government has identified, in the Action Plan, a number of key sectors where Ireland can gain competitive advantage in global markets.  The Plan has also set a target of supporting the creation of 100,000 net new jobs over the period 2012 to 2016, with the longer term objective of having two million people at work by 2020 as part of our goal of making Ireland the best small country in which to do business.  <\/p><p>  We are reforming supports to small businesses, we have published the National Research Prioritisation Exercise, and we have launched the Succeed in Ireland scheme to help identify and encourage companies that might set up in Ireland.   <\/p><p>  In addition to the wide-range of programmes being delivered by the Enterprise Agencies, I am also focusing on other measures to address the challenge of access to finance being faced by SMEs.

However, while upward only rent reviews are one of a number of factors which are causing pressure on the commercial and retail sectors at the present time, there are other factors influencing decisions of individual retailers to cut jobs.  The retail sector has seen a disproportionate fall in activity due to the fall in consumer confidence and a reduction in discretionary spending by the Irish consumers. <\/p><p>  The Government recognises the importance of the Retail sector to the economy.

Recognising its importance to the economy, the Action Plan for Jobs includes a number of specific measures aimed at supporting employment in the retail sector in 2012.  These actions are for delivery across a number of Departments and agencies and include a renewed focus on prompt payments, an assessment of the potential for future development of the retail sector, the introduction of a statutory code of practice for grocery goods undertakings and providing support to retail firms seeking to internationalise.<\/p><p>  Other more general measures in the Action Plan will also help to support employment the retail sector including:<ul style=\"margin-left:20px\">\u00b7  improved access to finance for businesses;<\/p><p>\u00b7  the enactment of legislation to reform the statutory wage setting mechanisms; and<\/p><p>\u00b7  acceleration of the programme of revaluation of commercial premises, which will provide a basis for the adjustment in commercial rates. <\/ul>  Initiatives which the Government introduced as part of the Jobs Initiative in May of last year will also continue to help support employment in the retail sector.

As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I have set-out an approach which is focused on economic recovery, by delivering improvements in competitiveness, ensuring companies have access to the finance they need to grow and by prioritising innovation as a key driver of success which will lead to jobs and export growth.<\/p><p>  My Department and the relevant State Agencies under its remit, have a clear focus on the potential and opportunities that exist and can be created. Enterprise development Agencies, Enterprise Ireland, IDA and Science Foundation Ireland,  provide a spectrum of innovation and technology development programmes that deliver  financial, technical and experiential support to help companies become more innovative, encourage and support competitiveness, and help them grow their sales and exports in order to create a climate in which  sustainable employment will grow and expand. It is my view that Innovation and the use of technology will be among the core drivers of job creation in Ireland\u2019s key sectors during 2012 and into the coming years.<\/p><p>  A wide range of programmes are being delivered by the Enterprise Agencies - Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland  and Science Foundation Ireland, to promote research &amp; development and innovation and give Irish enterprise a competitive edge in the global market place.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland, the agency responsible for the development and promotion of the indigenous business sector, is focused on the growth of world-class Irish companies to achieve strong positions in global markets. Enterprise Ireland provides research, development and technological innovation support relevant at all stages of company development, enabling companies to progress from undertaking an initial research project to higher level innovation and R&amp;D activities. Enterprise Ireland funds the undertaking of R&amp;D to support significant in-company projects which have the potential to develop new processes, products and services.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland has a range of programmes and soft supports focusing on research, development and innovation to facilitate and support businesses to compete sustainably in international markets. Information on all supports for research and development is available on the websites of Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards.<\/p><p>  In addition, Enterprise Ireland is engaged in efforts to extract maximum value from Ireland\u2019s research system \u2013 the objective is to work with companies to secure commercial purpose, leading to jobs and sales, for technologies and ideas developed in Irish research institutions. Enterprise Ireland also operates a range of supports to help companies engage with third level researchers to undertake collaborative research for the benefit of the company. Larger collaborative research projects involving groups of companies are also supported.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland are engaged in a number of specific opportunities to assist the SME sector to avail of its support programmes.<\/p><p>  For example, through the Enterprise Europe Network which includes Enterprise Ireland and the Chambers of Commerce of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Sligo and Waterford, Enterprise Ireland produced a new on-line directory of innovation supports to assist companies and their advisers in sourcing the various forms of support required to promote innovation and R&amp;D.  This new directory was promoted through a series of workshops and seminars held in the various regions.  The new directory is now available through the internationally co-ordinated Enterprise Europe Network website.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland has appointed a panel of 38 Advocates whose role is to assist companies in formulating projects to develop their business through innovation and R&amp;D.  This follows on from previous successful Advocate programmes which have assisted companies to identify their best options for development of new products, processes and services in order to grow sales into new international markets.<\/p><p>  The Industry Research &amp; Development Group (IRDG) Innovation Network, supported by Enterprise Ireland, has been undertaking a range of successful seminars around the country including seminars on R&amp;D Tax Credits (including a workshop on Audits), an event devoted to Services Innovation in Waterford and promotion of collaboration through the \u201cSupporting Business In The Mid-West\u201d seminar held at the University of Limerick.  This seminar was designed to highlight the benefits of collaboration with Higher Education Institutes for businesses in the Mid-West.<\/p><p>  The Irish Software Innovation Network (ISIN), funded by Enterprise Ireland and managed by the Irish Software Association (ISA), offers a free matchmaking and knowledge-brokering service to help software companies to identify and engage with relevant third-level research institutes.<\/p><p>  The Construction Information Technology Alliance (CITA), funded by Enterprise Ireland, aims to leverage Building\/Business Information Modelling (BIM) to facilitate integrated project delivery and reduced costs in construction industry.<\/p><p>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs Enterprise Ireland is actively working with IDA Ireland to attract companies to avail of R&amp;D tax credits for the first time.  The preliminary work involves the development of an updated R&amp;D tax credit brochure, which will be jointly issued by the two agencies later this year. The next stage will involve a series of agency workshops which will promote an understanding and use of \u201cR&amp;D tax credits\u201d.<\/p><p>  Research and development support programmes and initiatives will continue to be delivered by the enterprise agencies in support of Irish businesses in order to drive growth, sustainability, exports and job creation.  My department and its enterprise agencies will continue to promote the application of research &amp; development and innovation to gain competitive advantage and to build on the strengths that have emerged from the investment to date in Science Technology and Innovation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200061#WRM03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1349215800,"counter":1284,"content":"<p>Question No. 254 answered with Question No. 243.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Written Answers Nos. 255-274","time":1349216400,"count":1285,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200062#WRN00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1349216400,"counter":1286,"content":"<p>Question No. 255 answered with Question No. 76.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","time":1349216400,"count":1287,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200062#WRN00250"},{"type":"question","time":1349216400,"counter":1288,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[42669\/12]","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will list all the current positions, where the appointment was made by his Department held by retired senior civil servants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"1016","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200062#WRN00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1349216400,"counter":1289,"content":"<p>Since my appointment as Minister, I have not appointed any senior retired civil servants to any position within my Department or to any position within any of the State Agencies under the aegis of my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200062#WRN00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Supplementary Welfare Allowance Appeals","time":1349216400,"count":1290,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200062#WRN00450"},{"type":"question","time":1349216400,"counter":1291,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[41229\/12]","dept":"Department of Social Protection","question":"the reason an oral hearing was not granted in respect of an application for supplementary welfare allowance in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200062#WRN00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1349216400,"counter":1292,"content":"<p>The legislation provides that an Appeals Officer may decide a case before him\/her on the basis of the documentary evidence.

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice. The first two involve the enhancement of the website    and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears. <\/p><p>  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders. This advice will be provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main recognised accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.<\/p><p>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender will advise the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &#8364;250 to an accountant of the borrower&#8217;s choosing for the provision of this advice.<\/p><p>  An operating protocol for the provision of this advice has been agreed between the main recognised accountancy bodies and the lenders. The general scope of the advice will be limited to the borrower&#8217;s principal private residence. <\/p><p>  The advisory framework has commenced with practising accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.  <\/p><p>  There is nothing to inhibit other financial intermediaries from continuing to give advice on mortgages as requested by borrowers. While the advisory framework will be monitored on an on-going basis, it is not intended to conduct a formal review of the scheme before the due date of  2013. At this time, other interested parties who meet the criteria in terms of qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance, etc., may be considered for inclusion.   <\/p><p>The accountancy bodies have notified their members about the new service and a panel is available on a county by county basis on the website <u><font color=\"#0000FF\">.<\/font><\/u><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200062#WRN01600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Eligibility","time":1349216400,"count":1306,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200062#WRN01650"},{"type":"question","time":1349216400,"counter":1307,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[41295\/12]","dept":"Department of Social Protection","question":"if there has been a change in policy in 2012 in respect of housing applicants who have been approved for rent assistance and where the social housing needs assessment has post dated the commencement of the tenancy, sometimes by months; if a change has been made to refuse to pay arrears; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"946","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200062#WRN01700"},{"type":"speech","time":1349216400,"counter":1308,"content":"<p>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.

QCIs are paid as supplements to weekly social welfare benefits and allowances in recognition of the need for greater incomes among benefit-dependent households with dependent children. The current full rate of payment is &#8364;29.80 per week per dependent child having increased in recent years after a considerable period of being frozen in value. The estimated expenditure on qualified child increase in 2012 is around &#8364;675 million. <\/p><p>  QCI payments do not of themselves constitute a specific social welfare scheme and entitlement to the appropriate primary adult payment must be established in the first instance.  <\/p><p>  Social welfare payments consist of a personal rate with increases for qualified adults and children depending on the household composition. In order to be regarded as a qualified child the child must be ordinarily resident in the State (except where EU rules provide otherwise), not be in legal custody, satisfy the age condition attaching to the particular payment and normally reside with the claimant. Where children continue in full-time education, payment of the QCI can continue up to 22 years of age or up to the end of the academic year in which the child reaches 22 in the case of long-term payments as well as short-term payments that have been in payment for at least 156 days.  A full rate QCI is payable where a qualified adult increase is also awarded or for those claimants who are parenting alone.  A reduced rate QCI is payable for children in cases where the claimant&#8217;s spouse\/partner&#8217;s income exceeds a certain limit. The upper income limit is currently set at &#8364;400 a week.  <\/p><p>  Child benefit is a universal payment that assists parents with the cost of raising children and it contributes towards alleviating child poverty. The estimated expenditure on child benefit for 2012 is around &#8364;2 billion. Child benefit payment is non means-tested and non-taxable and is payable to the parents or guardians of children. There is no specific requirement for an applicant to be in receipt of child benefit payment in order to qualify for payment of a qualified child increase.<\/p><p>In cases where the circumstances so warrant, arrangements may be made for a qualified adult, or another person, to receive a specified amount of a social welfare payment, including the amount payable as a qualified child increase, on behalf of the claimant, most usually where it is likely that the amount of benefit payable would not otherwise be used for the subsistence of the family unit.

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than \u20ac356 per week, the rate of employer\u2019s PRSI is 4.25%).  <\/p><p>  Any changes to the PRSI system to extend the full range of social insurance benefits to self-employed persons would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.   <\/p><p>  The recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund as at 31 December 2010 looked at the break-even contribution rates required to provide invalidity pensions and jobseeker\u2019s benefit for self-employed workers.   The report found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 3.7% effective rate currently paid by the self-employed.  An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker\u2019s benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.  The average contribution rate required for the core State pension (contributory) plus the invalidity pension and jobseeker\u2019s benefit is estimated to be in the region of 17.3%.<\/p><p>  I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year and one of the issues that the Group is currently considering is the issue of providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  The Advisory Group\u2019s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.  The Group has been considering the issue of social insurance coverage for the self-employed and will submit its report once its examination of the various questions has been completed. <\/p><p>  Any proposals to extend additional cover to the self-employed will have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the finding of the Actuarial Review that the self-employed achieve very good value for money compared with the employed \u2013 when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  <\/p><p>  Self-employed individuals may, however, establish entitlement to assistance-based payments such as the means-tested jobseeker\u2019s allowance if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for assistance-based payments, the means of husband\/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200063#WRO03600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals","time":1349217000,"count":1399,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200063#WRO03650"},{"type":"question","time":1349217000,"counter":1400,"qnumday":294,"qnumall":"[41728\/12]","dept":"Department of Social Protection","question":"the position regarding a social protection appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"946","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200063#WRO03700"},{"type":"speech","time":1349217000,"counter":1401,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 23 August 2012 and will be referred to an Appeals Officer who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.<\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.<\/p>if she will review the case of persons (details supplied) in Kildare whose rent allowance was approved from a date six months after they had taken up occupancy of a residential unit and in a situation in which their father has been continuously included on the council's assessment of need since 2008; and if she will make a statement on the matter.<b><font color=\"blue\">[41453\/12]<\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200063#WRO03800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1349217000,"counter":1402,"content":"<p>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.

Implementation of the plan commenced on Monday 3 September and will be closely monitored and managed to ensure it achieves its objectives. However, it will take a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.

The advisory framework will be monitored on an on-going basis and it is intended to review the operation of the framework in June 2013 at which point other interested parties who meet the criteria in terms of qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance, etc., may be considered for inclusion.   <\/p><p>The accountancy bodies have notified their members about the new service and a panel is available on a county by county basis on the website www.keepingyourhome.ie.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200064#WRP00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1349217600,"counter":1434,"content":"<p>Question No. 299 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","time":1349217600,"count":1435,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200064#WRP00950"},{"type":"question","time":1349217600,"counter":1436,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[41749\/12]","dept":"Department of Social Protection","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will receive a decision on an application for carer's allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"946","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200064#WRP01000"},{"type":"speech","time":1349217600,"counter":1437,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department is in receipt of an application for carer\u2019s allowance from the person in question.

Each week, over 1.4 million people receive a social welfare payment and, when qualified adults and children are included, over 2.2 million people benefit from weekly payments.  Some 600,000 families receive child benefit payments in respect of over 1.1 million children each month.  The day to day activities of the Department included (full year 2011): <ul style=\"margin-left:20px\">\u00b7  2.2 million applications processed; <\/p><p>\u00b7  87.6 million scheme payments made; <\/p><p>\u00b7  982,000 control reviews; <\/p><p>\u00b7  6.8 million telephone calls answered; <\/p><p>\u00b7  34,000 social welfare appeals finalised; <\/p><p>\u00b7  153,000 PPS numbers allocated. <\/ul>  Most of the related schemes and services have been, or will be, addressed under the programme for Service Delivery Modernisation.<\/p><p>  Each project under the modernisation programme is focused on business process improvements in the relevant business area with major changes to how staff work and interact with customers, and supported through new technology solutions on the department&#8217;s modern integrated technology platform.  Each of these projects is rigorously assessed, governed and implemented based on specific business requirements and its contribution to the overall strategic objectives of the department.<\/p><p>  Benefits have been achieved over time, not only in improved customer service but in administration of schemes through integrated systems; reduced system &#8216;downtime&#8217; (1.21% in 2011 compared to 2.13% in 2009); agile response to required change including budget changes under the Social Welfare Act; enhanced work flow to maximise resources; integration with payment and reconciliation systems; ability to take on increased workload without commensurate increase in staff resources; more efficient and flexible communication products such as automated customer communications and use of text messaging; use of integrated scanning technologies to support end-to-end processing of claims; authenticated online services; support for major service initiatives such as moving customers from payable orders to electronic payment mechanisms; agile development environment to support introduction of new schemes such as the early child care supplement; robust infrastructure that supports on-going system improvements through a monthly release cycle; parallel project development; enhanced certification processing to support customer communications and control functions such as child benefit Irish residency certificates, and changes to continuing eligibility, residency and employment; improved overpayment and debt management; and ability to deliver new functionality such as statements of customer contributions and a new PRSI refunds application.<\/p><p>  Examples of benefits achieved include:<\/p><p>\u00b7  There has been a significant increase in claims activity in local offices since mid-2008.  The number of claims processed in 2008 increased by 88% (216,000 additional claims) and a further 43% in 2009 (198,000 additional claims), with activity falling slightly through 2010 and 2011\/12.  <\/p><p>\u00b7  In 2011 there was in excess of 500,000 claims processed in local offices nationally &#8211; this was double the level of activity in 2007.  <\/p><p>\u00b7  It should be noted that a similar number of claims (500,000) were also closed in local offices in 2011, giving a total &#8216;claim churn&#8217; of over 1 million customers in 2011.<\/p><p>\u00b7  Average processing times for jobseeker allowance and jobseeker benefit claims have stabilised at 5 weeks and 2 weeks respectively, lower than peak processing times in 2009. <\/p><p>\u00b7  Some 95% of state pension contributory claims are paid by due date.<\/p><p>\u00b7  Average processing times for family income supplement has remained at 17 weeks over the last two years.<\/p><p>\u00b7  The department received 1.4 million claims for various non-weekly schemes such as child benefit (144,386 claims received, roughly half in respect of new births), household benefits, treatment benefits and supplementary welfare allowance.  The average processing time for circa 80% of these claims is now 1 week and almost all of the remainder are processed within a month.<\/p><p>  There are some schemes which are receiving particular attention. For example, processing times for carers allowance and invalidity pension which amounted to 3% of received claims in 2011 are not acceptable.  Increased demand by individuals for these schemes has put pressure on the administration of the department to service this demand, resulting in a requirement to increase productivity.  To this end major service delivery modernisation projects have taken place in these business areas over the last 2 years to improve the efficiency of their administration.  These projects involve the deployment of information technology solutions and associated business processes.  The new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customers by optimising performance and providing improved customer service.  However, change of this magnitude needs time to build and bed in and it is expected to be a number of months before the backlogs are reduced to an acceptable level.<\/p><p>  The department&#8217;s modernisation programme is a fundamental part of government&#8217;s public service reform agenda and in this regard the department is currently undergoing another period of major transformation moving from a passive transaction focused model of income support to a proactive model which is customer centric and progressive.  The integration of the community welfare service, and employment and community services of F\u00e1s was made possible through the investments in modern technology over the preceding years.  Change on this scale also requires substantive changes for staff and these initiatives are being delivered under the auspices of the Public Service Agreement (PSA) and with significant input from staff who are required to make major changes to how they work.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the investments made in the modernisation of systems and processes represent good value for money and have positioned the department to best meet the needs of customers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200065#WRQ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","time":1349218200,"count":1485,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200065#WRQ00850"},{"type":"question","time":1349218200,"counter":1486,"qnumday":319,"qnumall":"[42009\/12]","dept":"Department of Social Protection","question":"of the 1628 appeals on medical grounds submitted for carer's allowance in 2011, the number awaiting a decision on 1 January 2012; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"946","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200065#WRQ00900"},{"type":"speech","time":1349218200,"counter":1487,"content":"<p>A total of 2,359 appeals in relation to carers allowance\/benefit were received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2011, which were added to the 2,218 on hands on the 1st January of that year.

The day to day activities of the Department included (full year 2011): <ul style=\"margin-left:20px\">\u00b7  2.2 million applications processed; <\/p><p>\u00b7  87.6 million scheme payments made; <\/p><p>\u00b7  982,000 control reviews; <\/p><p>\u00b7  6.8 million telephone calls answered; <\/p><p>\u00b7  34,000 social welfare appeals finalised; <\/p><p>\u00b7  153,000 PPS numbers allocated. <\/ul>  Most of the related schemes and services have been, or will be, addressed under the programme for Service Delivery Modernisation.<\/p><p>  Each project under the modernisation programme is focused on business process improvements in the relevant business area with major changes to how staff work and interact with customers, and supported through new technology solutions on the department&#8217;s modern integrated technology platform.  Each of these projects is rigorously assessed, governed and implemented based on specific business requirements and its contribution to the overall strategic objectives of the department.<\/p><p>  Benefits have been achieved over time, not only in improved customer service but in administration of schemes through integrated systems; reduced system &#8216;downtime&#8217; (1.21% in 2011 compared to 2.13% in 2009); agile response to required change including budget changes under the Social Welfare Act; enhanced work flow to maximise resources; integration with payment and reconciliation systems; ability to take on increased workload without commensurate increase in staff resources; more efficient and flexible communication products such as automated customer communications and use of text messaging; use of integrated scanning technologies to support end-to-end processing of claims; authenticated online services; support for major service initiatives such as moving customers from payable orders to electronic payment mechanisms; agile development environment to support introduction of new schemes such as the early child care supplement; robust infrastructure that supports on-going system improvements through a monthly release cycle; parallel project development; enhanced certification processing to support customer communications and control functions such as child benefit Irish residency certificates, and changes to continuing eligibility, residency and employment; improved overpayment and debt management; and ability to deliver new functionality such as statements of customer contributions and a new PRSI refunds application.<\/p><p>  Examples of benefits achieved include:<\/p><p>\u00b7  There has been a significant increase in claims activity in local offices since mid-2008.  The number of claims processed in 2008 increased by 88% (216,000 additional claims) and a further 43% in 2009 (198,000 additional claims), with activity falling slightly through 2010 and 2011\/12.  <\/p><p>\u00b7  In 2011 there was in excess of 500,000 claims processed in local offices nationally &#8211; this was double the level of activity in 2007.  <\/p><p>\u00b7  It should be noted that a similar number of claims (500,000) were also closed in local offices in 2011, giving a total &#8216;claim churn&#8217; of over 1 million customers in 2011.<\/p><p>\u00b7  Average processing times for jobseeker allowance and jobseeker benefit claims have stabilised at 5 weeks and 2 weeks respectively, lower than peak processing times in 2009. <\/p><p>\u00b7  Some 95% of state pension contributory claims are paid by due date.<\/p><p>\u00b7  Average processing times for family income supplement has remained at 17 weeks over the last two years.<\/p><p>\u00b7  The department received 1.4 million claims for various non-weekly schemes such as child benefit (144,386 claims received, roughly half in respect of new births), household benefits, treatment benefits and supplementary welfare allowance.  The average processing time for circa 80% of these claims is now 1 week and almost all of the remainder are processed within a month.<\/p><p>  There are some schemes which are receiving particular attention. For example, processing times for carers allowance and invalidity pension which amounted to 3% of received claims in 2011 are not acceptable.  Increased demand by individuals for these schemes has put pressure on the administration of the department to service this demand, resulting in a requirement to increase productivity.  To this end major service delivery modernisation projects have taken place in these business areas over the last 2 years to improve the efficiency of their administration.  These projects involve the deployment of information technology solutions and associated business processes.  The new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customers by optimising performance and providing improved customer service.  However, change of this magnitude needs time to build and bed in and it is expected to be a number of months before the backlogs are reduced to an acceptable level.<\/p><p>  The department&#8217;s modernisation programme is a fundamental part of government&#8217;s public service reform agenda and in this regard the department is currently undergoing another period of major transformation moving from a passive transaction focused model of income support to a proactive model which is customer centric and progressive.  The integration of the community welfare service, and employment and community services of F\u00e1s was made possible through the investments in modern technology over the preceding years.  Change on this scale also requires substantive changes for staff and these initiatives are being delivered under the auspices of the Public Service Agreement (PSA) and with significant input from staff who are required to make major changes to how they work.<\/p><p>  Expenditure on all the Department&#8217;s SDM related projects in the period since commencement, some eleven years ago, amounts to just over &#8364;82m at the end of 2011.  It is expected that expenditure on the service delivery modernisation programme in 2012 will amount to some &#8364;4.8m. Further information in relation to the Department&#8217;s modernisation programme, including costs, are provided in the department&#8217;s annual report which can be found on the website www.welfare.ie.  <\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the investments made in the modernisation of systems and processes represent good value for money and have positioned the department to best meet the needs of customers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200065#WRQ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","time":1349218200,"count":1546,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200065#WRQ00850"},{"type":"question","time":1349218200,"counter":1547,"qnumday":319,"qnumall":"[42009\/12]","dept":"Department of Social Protection","question":"of the 1628 appeals on medical grounds submitted for carer's allowance in 2011, the number awaiting a decision on 1 January 2012; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"946","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200065#WRQ00900"},{"type":"speech","time":1349218200,"counter":1548,"content":"<p>A total of 2,359 appeals in relation to carers allowance\/benefit were received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2011, which were added to the 2,218 on hands on the 1st January of that year.

The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.<\/p><p>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&#8217; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.<\/p><p>  The National Broadband Plan contains a commitment that my Department will undertake a full mapping exercise in respect of high speed broadband deployment.  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  Until that process is complete, the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention will not be known.  I would reiterate however, that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including areas such as Fossa and Ballydesmond, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.<\/p><p>  My Department has already begun some of the necessary preparatory work, and the full mapping will commence as soon as the current spectrum auction being managed by ComReg is completed and final decisions are taken by the ComReg in respect of Next Generation Access regulation.  It is necessary that both these processes are finalised before the mapping exercise begins, as they will critically inform the investment plans for telecommunications service providers over the coming years.<\/p><p>  I have already emphasised to industry the importance of my Department securing full cooperation from all the commercial operators in completing this aspect of the Plan&#8217;s implementation.<\/p><p>  As regards current broadband speeds, the Communications Regulator, ComReg, publishes on its website, , details of broadband packages available in all counties, including County Kerry.

Interconnection also facilitates the penetration of wind generation and the East West Interconnector will facilitate export of surplus electricity generation output.<\/p><p>  I do not have a statutory function in the setting of energy prices, whether in the regulated or unregulated market.  Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  <\/p><p>  Prices in the retail business and residential electricity markets are now fully deregulated.  Since 1 October, 2011 residential gas customers supplied by Bord G\u00e1is Energy are the only segment of the electricity and gas markets where prices are still regulated by the CER.  Prices in the electricity and gas markets, with the exception of residential gas customers supplied by Bord G\u00e1is Energy, are wholly commercial and operational matters for the suppliers concerned. Ireland\u2019s electricity and gas markets, both wholesale and retail, are characterised by vigorous competition regulated by the CER.<\/p><p>  The domestic retail electricity market is a competitive market and consumers are able to switch their business between suppliers, who in turn purchase their power on the all island wholesale market, the Single Electricity Market (SEM).  Overall electricity prices in Great Britain are lower than those in Ireland and, as might be expected in this situation, there has been strong interest from traders on the interconnector in importing power into Ireland from Britain.  The interconnector in these circumstances is capable of carrying additional power into Ireland from a lower cost market, to the extent of 500MW, with that capacity representing more than that of an average modern power station.  The interconnector therefore means that there can be even greater competition for existing generators operating in the SEM leading to additional downward pressure on the wholesale prices otherwise charged by generators.<\/p><p>  It is difficult in the deregulated electricity market to identify the precise impact of the downward pressure on prices brought about specifically by the interconnector, as against the impact of any other factors at play in the wholesale and\/or retail market.

For that reason annualised data sets for the period 1992 to 2007 inclusive are not available.<\/p><p>  However, the Housing Agency&#8217;s Housing Needs Assessment 2008 and 2011 reports break down the categories of housing need, including in respect of homelessness, for all 88 housing authorities nationwide.

This statutory assessment of housing need, carried out every three years by all housing authorities, only counts homeless persons where an application has been made to a housing authority.<\/p><p>  The extent of homelessness in the Dublin region, where numbers are most pronounced, was reviewed and updated using the now fully operational Pathway Accommodation &amp; Support System (PASS) and crosschecked against each of the Dublin local authorities&#8217; housing management data systems to give an accurate figure of the known homeless population in Dublin. Following extensive cross checking and quality control to remove duplications and ensure accuracy of all data entries, the confirmed extent of homelessness in the Dublin region as at September 2011 was 1,891 persons. PASS, which commenced operation in the Dublin region in 2011, is being extended nationally on a phased basis with work currently underway in other regions. The PASS system will in future provide good quality, timely, data on homelessness nationally as an evidence base for all homelessness services.<\/p><p>  On 6 September 2012, the CSO published its special Census report, <u>Homeless Persons in Ireland<\/u> and it indicated that 3,808 persons were either sleeping rough or in accommodation designated for the homeless on the night of 10 April 2011. The rough sleeper count was 64, with 59 of those people located in Dublin.  It is not tolerable that anyone should sleep on the streets but it is important that the homeless figures released are not confused with the number of people sleeping rough.  The vast majority of people classified in the CSO's report as homeless are in long-term or emergency accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200067#WRS05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regeneration Projects","time":1349219400,"count":1668,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200067#WRS05400"},{"type":"question","time":1349219400,"counter":1669,"qnumday":373,"qnumall":"[41584\/12]","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he has provided assistance to Limerick regeneration conditional on local community participation by community representatives that live in the area due for regeneration and elected by the communities themselves; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"967","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200067#WRS05500"},{"type":"speech","time":1349219400,"counter":1670,"content":"<p>My Department currently supports an ambitious programme of regeneration in Limerick with projects that seek to deliver social, economic and physical regeneration with a strong community involvement in the process.

This holistic, multi-agency approach ensures that regeneration is sustainable, beyond just the initial construction phases, and generates long-term advantages. The Regeneration Process in Limerick seeks to reinvigorate and revitalise communities that have witnessed considerable neglect and breakdown over decades by acting as a catalyst for more integrated, responsive and effective public service provision and enhanced resident participation in matters that affect them.

It is co-funded by Government Departments\/State Agencies, Atlantic Philanthropies and the University of Limerick.

The new register comes into effect each year on 15 February.  The draft register is published in November each year in preparation for the coming into effect of the register on the 15 of February following.  The public is invited to check the draft during this period so that people can make sure that they are correctly registered.  Any errors or omissions in the draft should be brought immediately to the attention of the registration authority.  Claims for the addition or deletion of names are ruled on by the county registrar who is a legally qualified court officer.  The ruling is made in public and any person may attend and give evidence. <\/p><p>  Provision is also made in electoral law for inclusion in the supplement to the register.  If a person is not included in the register of electors currently in force but considers that he or she qualifies for registration - for example if they have come of age to register or if they have changed address - the person may apply for entry in the supplement to the register which is open year round subject to certain practical limits in the weeks before a polling day.  The closing date for the supplement to the register for the forthcoming referendum is Tuesday, 23 October 2012. <\/p><p>  The detailed requirements regarding the inclusion of persons in the supplement are set out in section 15, and Part 2, of the Second Schedule to the Electoral Act 1992.  An applicant for inclusion in the supplement to the register must apply directly to his or her registration authority.  The application must be signed by the applicant in the presence of a member of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na from the applicant\u2019s local Garda station who must first be satisfied as to the person's identity before signing, dating and stamping the form.  The Garda may request photographic or other identification.  Where the applicant establishes in writing that he is unable to progress the application in this way, the form can be signed by the applicant in the presence of an official of the registration authority who is satisfied as to his or her identity.  Again, photographic or other identification may be required.  If neither option is viable due to physical illness or physical disability, the application form must be accompanied by a medical certificate. <\/p><p>  Student campaigns which encourage people to register to vote are to be welcomed.  However, it is important that the requirements of electoral law are met.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200069#WRU01700","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","time":1349220600,"count":1744,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200069#WRU01750"},{"type":"question","time":1349220600,"counter":1745,"qnumday":404,"qnumall":"[42665\/12]","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will list all the current positions, where the appointment was made by his Department held by retired senior civil servants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"967","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200069#WRU01800"},{"type":"speech","time":1349220600,"counter":1746,"content":"<p>Mr. David O'Callaghan is current Chair of the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management.

On the basis of a value for money review, it was clearly established that the vast majority of the money allocated to PwDI was being spent disproportionately.  The largest proportion of PwDI\u2019s annual budget was spent on the operation of its office headquarters and on administration rather than on the creation of projects which would directly benefit people with disabilities.  This was an untenable situation that could not be allowed to continue as the conclusions of the VFM report show that people with disabilities were benefiting very little from the allocation in real terms. <\/p><p>  It is my wish to ensure that people with disabilities directly benefit from any money allocated to this sector.  With this in mind, I just recently oversaw the finalisation of a major Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services in the Department of Health to ensure that existing funding allocated for people with disabilities is spent to best effect.  I am also interested in hearing what people with disabilities have to say on issues affecting them.  I have established and am personally chairing a new National Disability Strategy Implementation Group to develop and progress disability strategy.  The new group includes representation from a number of disability stakeholder organisations, also three former members of PwDI and a number of people with disabilities who are able to bring their lived experience directly to bear on the very important work of this high level group.  This ensures the voice and perspective of people with disabilities will continue to be heard in a more focused and cost effective way.<\/p><p>  At my request the National Disability Authority held the first National Disability Forum event in June 2012.  This event, which is hoped will be held on an annual basis, was primarily about listening to the views of individual people with disabilities, their families and carers in relation to the key policy areas and service developments that impact on their lives.<\/p><p>  The Government must ensure that funding is allocated for maximum provision of services for people with disabilities, having regard to overall resource constraints which affect all sectors at this time.  Specialist disability services are provided in a variety of community and residential settings.  The integral role of the non-statutory, voluntary and community groups is of particular relevance to the provision of health and personal social services to people with a disability.

The new register comes into effect each year on 15 February.  The draft register is published in November each year in preparation for the coming into effect of the register on the 15 of February following.  The public is invited to check the draft during this period so that people can make sure that they are correctly registered.  Any errors or omissions in the draft should be brought immediately to the attention of the registration authority.  Claims for the addition or deletion of names are ruled on by the county registrar who is a legally qualified court officer.  The ruling is made in public and any person may attend and give evidence. <\/p><p>  Provision is also made in electoral law for inclusion in the supplement to the register.  If a person is not included in the register of electors currently in force but considers that he or she qualifies for registration - for example if they have come of age to register or if they have changed address - the person may apply for entry in the supplement to the register which is open year round subject to certain practical limits in the weeks before a polling day.  The closing date for the supplement to the register for the forthcoming referendum is Tuesday, 23 October 2012. <\/p><p>  The detailed requirements regarding the inclusion of persons in the supplement are set out in section 15, and Part 2, of the Second Schedule to the Electoral Act 1992.  An applicant for inclusion in the supplement to the register must apply directly to his or her registration authority.  The application must be signed by the applicant in the presence of a member of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na from the applicant\u2019s local Garda station who must first be satisfied as to the person's identity before signing, dating and stamping the form.  The Garda may request photographic or other identification.  Where the applicant establishes in writing that he is unable to progress the application in this way, the form can be signed by the applicant in the presence of an official of the registration authority who is satisfied as to his or her identity.  Again, photographic or other identification may be required.  If neither option is viable due to physical illness or physical disability, the application form must be accompanied by a medical certificate. <\/p><p>  Student campaigns which encourage people to register to vote are to be welcomed.

On the basis of a value for money review, it was clearly established that the vast majority of the money allocated to PwDI was being spent disproportionately.  The largest proportion of PwDI\u2019s annual budget was spent on the operation of its office headquarters and on administration rather than on the creation of projects which would directly benefit people with disabilities.  This was an untenable situation that could not be allowed to continue as the conclusions of the VFM report show that people with disabilities were benefiting very little from the allocation in real terms. <\/p><p>  It is my wish to ensure that people with disabilities directly benefit from any money allocated to this sector.  With this in mind, I just recently oversaw the finalisation of a major Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services in the Department of Health to ensure that existing funding allocated for people with disabilities is spent to best effect.  I am also interested in hearing what people with disabilities have to say on issues affecting them.  I have established and am personally chairing a new National Disability Strategy Implementation Group to develop and progress disability strategy.  The new group includes representation from a number of disability stakeholder organisations, also three former members of PwDI and a number of people with disabilities who are able to bring their lived experience directly to bear on the very important work of this high level group.  This ensures the voice and perspective of people with disabilities will continue to be heard in a more focused and cost effective way.<\/p><p>  At my request the National Disability Authority held the first National Disability Forum event in June 2012.  This event, which is hoped will be held on an annual basis, was primarily about listening to the views of individual people with disabilities, their families and carers in relation to the key policy areas and service developments that impact on their lives.<\/p><p>  The Government must ensure that funding is allocated for maximum provision of services for people with disabilities, having regard to overall resource constraints which affect all sectors at this time.  Specialist disability services are provided in a variety of community and residential settings.  The integral role of the non-statutory, voluntary and community groups is of particular relevance to the provision of health and personal social services to people with a disability.

I am further informed that both areas are subject to regular patrols by local uniformed personnel, augmented by uniformed and plain clothes units from the District Headquarters in Ashbourne, together with the Divisional Traffic Unit and the Regional Support Unit as required.<\/p><p>  Local Garda management closely monitors such patrols, and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities in these areas to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources to provide the best possible Garda service to the public.

Operation Fiacla is intelligence driven and specific burglary initiatives have been implemented in each Garda Region to target suspect offenders.  I am informed that over 1,700 persons have been arrested and that almost 1,000 persons have been charged in the first six months of the Operation, reflecting the substantial efforts being made by the Garda\u00ed to tackle those involved in burglary and property crimes.<\/p><p>  An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na also places great emphasis on the importance of the partnership between An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and the community in preventing and detecting crime, and maintaining a safe environment for everyone.  An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na continues to invest time and energy in these partnerships and relationships to the benefit of all. In this regard, last week the Garda Commissioner launched the second national public awareness week this year under the 'Garda Supporting Safer Communities Campaign\u2019. This important campaign highlights a range of key issues, in particular burglary prevention. The primary objective of this Garda Community Safety Campaign is to engage with, and raise awareness within communities of initiatives aimed at preventing crime, reducing the fear of crime and promoting community safety.<\/p><p>  Insofar as the number of arrests made in the specific areas referred to are concerned, I am informed that this would require a disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources to compile due to the fact that persons arrested in these areas will, in general, be brought to either Navan or Ashbourne Garda Stations, which are both District Headquarters and have full custody facilities.

It is the Revenue Commissioners who are responsible for tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products and they have advised as follows.  Revenue has adopted a comprehensive tobacco strategy which is published on Revenue&#8217;s website <i>www.revenue.ie.<\/i>    The strategy includes a number of programmes, which are designed to complement each other in targeting the supply and demand sides of the market for contraband tobacco in Ireland. Key elements include developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, development of analytics and detection technologies, and ensuring optimum deployment of resources at point of importation and within the country, in order to intercept the contraband product and to prosecute those involved.<\/p><p>  With regard to the level of penalties for illicit importation and sale of tobacco products, the threat to tax revenues from criminal activity in the cigarette market is viewed very seriously, and substantially increased penalties were introduced in the Finance Act 2010 as a deterrent.  The penalties for the smuggling of tobacco products are contained in Section 119 of the Finance Act 2001 as amended and the penalties for the illegal sale of unstamped tobacco products are contained in section 78 of the Finance Act 2005, as amended. In 2012 to date a total of 81.1m cigarettes with a retail value of &#8364;36.6m and 3,338kgs of tobacco with a retail value of &#8364;1.2m have been seized by Revenue.

This year Cosc has provided grants totalling \u20ac241,820 to 59 successful applicants throughout the country. In 2011 \u20ac298,153 was granted to 58 different groups from the scheme. Guidelines devised by Cosc in 2011 in relation to the grant scheme aim to encourage a shift from a focus on activities only relating to the victim to an inclusion of a focus on the perpetrator and bystander whilst also ensuring that information on support services continues to be made available to victims\/survivors.<\/p><p>  The bystander approach aims to both engage individual members of society in challenging the social norms that allow sexual and domestic violence to occur and to encourage individuals to assist victims of such violence rather than isolating them. One example of this approach has been a partnership between the Union of Students of Ireland and Cosc over the last two years to increase awareness of domestic and sexual violence among students attending third level institutions. The purpose of this campaign was to make students as bystanders more aware of intimate partner violence in the college setting and to intervene where relevant. There have been three stages to date in this work: an awareness raising art work competition, distribution of colourful wristbands with a slogan and website details for more information, and the circulation of a free postcard, visually based on the winning piece from the art competition, containing information about abusive relationships and the helplines to contact. The theme of the campaign could be summarised by one of the slogans used &quot;If you see something, say something&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200070#WRV03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Written Answers Nos. 435-454","time":1349221800,"count":1869,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200071#WRW00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Prevention","time":1349221800,"count":1870,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200071#WRW00150"},{"type":"question","time":1349221800,"counter":1871,"qnumday":435,"qnumall":"[41982\/12]","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","question":"his views on the concerns of persons in rural locations such as Connemara, County Galway, regarding the effectiveness of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na at crime prevention and the upholding of the law and public order in the face of possible closure of rural Garda stations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"1025","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200071#WRW00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1349221800,"counter":1872,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Commissioner is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, throughout the organisation and I have no direct function in the matter.

The Report, which is publicly available on the Law Society's website (www.lawsociety.ie), details the arguments that were put forward both in favour of and against the introduction of this regulation and explains the reasons behind the decision to propose its adoption.

In order to make the necessary savings it was proposed to make technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria to ensure that the aid payment is focused on farmers whose farming enterprises are situated primarily in DAS areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme, which are defined in the governing EU legislation as follows: To ensure continued agricultural land use and thereby contribute to the maintenance of a viable rural community; To maintain the countryside; To maintain and promote sustainable farming systems which, in particular, take account of environmental protection measures.<\/p><p>  Processing of high volume application schemes, such as the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and the Single Payment Scheme, require significant hands-on from the management teams and a willingness and ability to focus resources on the varying priorities that arise throughout the process.  One very important element of the process is dealing with the many and varied enquiries from applicants, by telephone, letter, email or on-line.  The 2012 processing campaign is currently well advanced, with the necessary arrangements in place to deal with farmers\u2019 queries.  The record number of applications submitted on-line in 2012 has further contributed to the smoother processing of applications.<\/p><p>  While changes were introduced in respect of the minimum stocking density requirements, specific provision was made for those farmers who had a stocking density less than 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, where that lower stocking density was as a result of adherence to a recognised agri-environmental measure.  The principles of force majeure\/exceptional circumstances were also provided for in the process. Provision was also be made for new entrants to farming.<\/p><p>  All 10,046 applicants, whose stocking density was below 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, were written to formally and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that his or her participation in such an agri-environmental measure resulted in the lower stocking density.  The Department is currently working on those applicants who applied for derogation, good progress has been made to date with many already paid.  All applicants are being advised, in writing, of the success or otherwise of their application.  Those unsuccessful applicants are being afforded the opportunity of appeal to the DAS Derogation Appeals Committee.  This Committee, to be chaired by Padraig Gibbons, is to be constituted shortly, to adjudicate on those further appeals from farmers dissatisfied with Department decisions on their derogation applications.<\/p><p>  Payments under the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme started issuing, on schedule, on 26 September 2012 and, to date, payments worth in the region of \u20ac159 million have issued; these payment levels are very much in line with previous years.  Included in this figure are payments to a sizeable number of farmers who successfully applied for derogation from the revised stocking density requirement, included as part of the range of technical adjustments necessitated by budgetary requirements.

The objective of the review was to deliver a policy which would ensure an economically and biologically sustainable fishery. I received over 20 sets of proposals and comments in relation to herring stocks management. It was very clear from these documents that there was no agreement within the industry as to how the future herring fishing opportunities should be managed. I asked my Department to examine the proposals received and to prepare for me a number of options, which as far as practically possible, took the views of stakeholders into account while delivering proper and effective management.  <\/p><p>  On 22 December 2011, I published a draft policy document on the matter which I believed meets the objectives to the greatest extent possible. I consulted and met industry regarding the draft policy and again there was no consensus.  Having considered all views and having regard to the sustainability of the fisheries, I came to a decision which I believe provides for the proper and effective management and conservation and rational exploitation of the herring stocks. On 8 June 2012 I published a policy, based on giving access to each of the fisheries to those with recent track record in that particular fishery.  The track record involves vessels having landed a minimum of 5 tonnes of herring in 2009 or 2010 or in 3 of the 5 years during the period 2006 to 2010.  In addition, there are some very limited specified  circumstances where an earlier track record may be taken into account.<\/p><p>  These are the criteria under which future herring authorisations will be granted and I believe that these track record criteria are objective, transparent and non-discriminatory.  The only exception to track record relates to small vessels in the Dunmore area for the Celtic Sea fishery where a small scale local fishery is permitted in line with the Rebuilding\/Management Plan for the fishery. The policy also provides for a modest restricted quota for smaller vessels without a track record in both the Celtic Sea and Area VIa.<\/p><p>  The decision made was based on a clear, detailed and objective assessment of the fisheries in recent years.  This policy is intended to ensure the long term sustainability of the herring fisheries by limiting participation in the main fisheries to those vessels which have participated in the fishery, in the 5 years prior to the commencement of the review, even at a low level.  I set down this fishing boat licensing aspects of this policy in Policy Directive 1 of 2012 which I issued to the Registrar of Sea Fishing Boats on 19 September 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200073#WRY00400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Payments","time":1349223000,"count":1988,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200073#WRY00450"},{"type":"question","time":1349223000,"counter":1989,"qnumday":468,"qnumall":"[41585\/12]","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding an application under the dairy equipment grant scheme in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"994","askee":"991","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200073#WRY00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1349223000,"counter":1990,"content":"<p>The person concerned is an applicant under the Dairy Equipment Scheme and submitted an application under the tranche which closed at end-July 2012.

While the Department was successful in maintaining all three support programmes despite the budgetary constraints that the Government is facing, it was necessary to revise certain payment rates and subvention levels under each programme. <\/p><p>  The ECCE programme provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  Approximately 95% of children in the year before school are availing of the free pre-school provision at this time.  The ECCE programme is being maintained on a universal and free basis but a reduction of &#8364;2 per week was made to the capitation rates paid to providers from September 2012.  However, to give some flexibility to childcare services to manage this modest reduction, the staff to child ratio for the pre-school element of childcare will increase from a ratio of 1:10 to a ratio of 1:11. <\/p><p>  The ECCE programme, which will be evaluated and developed as resources permit, continues to provide a guaranteed source of income, payable in advance of each term, to participating childcare services, and is considered a very beneficial support for the private childcare sector at this time of economic difficulty. <\/p><p>  The CCS programme enables community-based childcare services to provide childcare at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income families.  From September 2012, the higher subvention rate payable for full day care, under this programme, of &#8364;100 per week has been reduced by &#8364;5 to &#8364;95.  Parents in receipt of a social welfare payment but who do not have a medical card entitlement qualify from September 1, 2012 for a payment of &#8364;50 per week for full day care. <\/p><p>The CETS programme was introduced in September 2010.

The number of services with one staff member qualified to HETAC Level 8 and above and HETAC Level 9 above is 22.3% and 3.2% respectively. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware my Department has commenced work on Ireland\u2019s first-ever Early Years Strategy and in the terms of reference, as approved by Government, I expressly included the need to consider \u201ca robust system of regulation and inspection\u201d, for the new Early Years Strategy. Part of this will include improving access to quality reliable information on services and performance.  I have asked the recently\u2013established Expert Advisory Group to prioritise a review of this matter.<\/p><p>  The employment of suitably qualified staff is a matter for each individual child care service. It is expected that in time a register of staff qualifications will be developed and providers should encourage staff to record the relevant details of their qualifications there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200075#WRAA00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services","time":1349224200,"count":2074,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200075#WRAA00350"},{"type":"question","time":1349224200,"counter":2075,"qnumday":498,"qnumall":"[41842\/12]","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the protections that are in place regarding child-minders; if she will confirm if they will be subject to the children first legislation and if not the reason for same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1018","askee":"1009","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200075#WRAA00400"},{"type":"question","time":1349224200,"counter":2076,"qnumday":499,"qnumall":"[41843\/12]","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will provide a figure on the number of independent child minders currently looking after children who are not deemed to be familial relatives.","asker":"1018","askee":"1009","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200075#WRAA00500"},{"type":"question","time":1349224200,"counter":2077,"qnumday":502,"qnumall":"[41846\/12]","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will provide D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann with the legal definition, as defined by her, of the term child minder; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1018","askee":"1009","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200075#WRAA00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1349224200,"counter":2078,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 498, 499 and 502 together.<\/p><p>  The Children First National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children, which I published in 2011, provides clarity and guidance for individuals and organisations in identifying and responding appropriately to child abuse and neglect.  It also sets out what organisations that care for or work with children should do to ensure they are safe whilst in the care of the organisation. The Government has committed, as a priority, to the introduction of legislation to underpin Children First.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I published the Heads of the Children First Bill   in April 2012. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that organisations and professionals who work with children have a statutory responsibility to report reasonable concerns about the abuse or neglect of children in their care to the HSE Child and Family Services.<\/p><p>  I asked the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children to consider the Heads of the Children First Bill and make recommendations.  I received their comprehensive Report in July and  I thank the Committee for its work on this matter. My Department is currently considering the broad range of submissions to, and recommendations of the Joint Committee, including those submissions pertaining to the issue of childminders.<\/p><p>  Preschool services are regulated under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No.2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991.   &quot;Childminder&quot; is defined in the  Regulations as &quot;a person who provides a childminding service as defined in the Regulations&quot;.  A &quot;childminding service&quot; is defined in the Regulations as &quot;a preschool service which may include an overnight service offered by a person who single-handedly takes care of preschool children, including the childminder's own children, in the childminder's home for a total of more than 2 hours per day, except where the exemptions provided in Section 58 of the Child Care Act 1991 apply.&quot;<\/p><p>  Services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Pre-School Inspectorate of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and are subject to inspection and report by the Inspectorate on a regular basis.  Services covered by the Regulations include full-time, part-time and sessional services as well as childminders taking care of more than three preschool children from different families in the childminder\u2019s home.  Childminders taking care of not more than three preschool children from different families are not covered by the Regulations, recognising parental choice to place children with friends and neighbours, and the challenges of the over-regulation of the more informal arrangements chosen by parents.  As a result of this exemption it is not possible to provide a figure for the number of childminders currently providing childminding services.<\/p><p>  The National Guidelines for Childminders, compiled by the National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee which oversees the development of an integrated child care infrastructure throughout the country, provide guidance to childminders on good practice, and assist them to decide whether they are subject to the Regulations, as well as providing other useful information on the role of the childminder in the provision of child care services.<\/p><p>  The 2006 Regulations replaced the earlier Regulations, introduced in 1996, and made a number of improvements to the regulatory environment, including the introduction of a requirement for all staff and students working in a preschool service to have been Garda vetted.<\/p><p>  As is the case with all regulatory requirements, the Child Care Regulations set the minimum standards which services are legally required to comply with.  However, my Department is proactive in monitoring, promoting and developing the highest standards of care and education throughout the sector, including the regulatory environment, given the important role which these services play in this crucial phase of children\u2019s lives.<\/p><p>  My Department also has begun work on Ireland\u2019s first Early Years Strategy which I envisage will be a creative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland\u2019s Early Years sector aimed at providing a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to age six.   One of the issues of policy which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the new Strategy is the development of the childminding sector as a fully-integrated component of early childhood care and education, in particular for the under-one age group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200075#WRAA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Preschool Services","time":1349224200,"count":2079,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200075#WRAA00750"},{"type":"question","time":1349224200,"counter":2080,"qnumday":500,"qnumall":"[41844\/12]","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will provide an update on the expansion of the free pre-school year in early childhood care and education programme; if such an extension will begin for children at the age of two years, thus allowing them two years of pre-school learning; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1018","askee":"1009","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200075#WRAA00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1349224200,"counter":2081,"content":"<p>The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme was introduced in January 2010 and provides a free preschool year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.

This reform programme contains a number of critical elements:<ul type=\"disc\"><li>  The continued and urgent implementation of a comprehensive change programme to improve the quality and consistency of child welfare and protection services;<li>  The commitment to introduce legislation to place Children First on a statutory basis;<li>  The establishment for the first time of a dedicated budget for children and family services, providing transparency and accountability for the use of resources to meet national priorities;<li>  The transition of existing HSE child protection and welfare and services into the new Agency;<li>  The merger of the existing Family Support Agency with a budget of over &#8364;26 million into the Child and Family Support Agency;<li>  Consideration of the potential for further rationalisation of services for children under the new Agency.<\/ul>  The new Agency will assume responsibility for Children and Family Services, currently provided by the HSE, and the Family Support Agency.  It will have a workforce of approximately 4,000 staff, and a combined existing budget of over &#8364;590 million.

These include glucosamine, omega-3 triglyceride products, orlistat, and gluten-free products.<\/p><p>  Glucosamine is indicated for the management of symptoms of osteoarthritis.  The National Centre for Pharmoeconomics (NCPE) have assessed the cost-effectiveness of glucosamine on two occasions and concluded that it did not offer value for money to the HSE.

Her question has also been replied to in previous representations and Parliamentary Questions.

Approximately 1,000 of these women were infected with Hepatitis C and were therefore eligible to apply to the Tribunal for compensation.

The NTPF capability is a core part of the SDU's performance improvement role in holding public hospitals to account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200077#WRCC03500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Speech and Language Therapy","time":1349225400,"count":2233,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200077#WRCC03550"},{"type":"question","time":1349225400,"counter":2234,"qnumday":554,"qnumall":"[41751\/12]","dept":"Department of Health","question":"the steps he has put in place and the progress that has been made to reduce the waiting time for speech therapy in view of the fact that the Health Service Executive reported in May of this year that 653 young persons were waiting between nineteen and thirty nine months in Carlow\/Kilkenny","asker":"968","askee":"952","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200077#WRCC03600"},{"type":"speech","time":1349225400,"counter":2235,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200077#WRCC03700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service","time":1349225400,"count":2236,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200077#WRCC03750"},{"type":"question","time":1349225400,"counter":2237,"qnumday":555,"qnumall":"[41752\/12]","dept":"Department of Health","question":"the position regarding correspondence from the Health Service Executive Bray to recipients of the home care cash grant informing them that this grant is to be reduced by 10% effective immediately in order for the HSE to operate within its financial allocation from Government in 2012; if this decision will be reversed in view of the essential services that the grant is used to pay for, that is, to enable persons to remain in their own homes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1104","askee":"952","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200077#WRCC03800"},{"type":"speech","time":1349225400,"counter":2238,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200077#WRCC03900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","time":1349225400,"count":2239,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200077#WRCC03950"},{"type":"question","time":1349225400,"counter":2240,"qnumday":556,"qnumall":"[41811\/12]","dept":"Department of Health","question":"if he will respond to a query (details supplied) regarding hospital consultants roster arrangements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"952","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200077#WRCC04000"},{"type":"speech","time":1349225400,"counter":2241,"content":"<p>The new arrangements agreed between health service management and the consultant representative bodies at the LRC include provisions relating to 24\/7 rostering.

This Programme is being implemented nationally over the period 2012 to 2015 to remodel the provision of Outpatient Services to patients in acute hospitals.  The programme will be delivered in a phased manner and a series of Technical Guidance documents will issue to all hospitals covering amongst others (a) Governance and Accountability structures (b) the Management of Referrals (c) the Management of Waiting Lists, Booking and Scheduling (d) the Management and Delivery of Outpatient Clinics (e) the Management of DNAs (f) Clinical Outcome Management and (g) Discharging Patients from Outpatient Services.

The main area of waste resulting from patients not attending scheduled clinics is the effort invested in the pulling and preparation of health care records (charts) and the smaller, albeit significant cost, of processing appointment letters and associated costs such as postage, text messages, etc.<\/p><p>  In situations where patients do not attend, for the most part, staff are occupied attending to other patients in the outpatient area (as many clinics are over-booked) and thereafter, return to their other duties in the general hospital, such as ward work, theatre work and medical administration work such as the typing and processing of medical notes and charts.<\/p><p>  Most importantly, however, is the effect of DNAs on outpatient waiting lists and wait times.  In 2010, almost 600,000 appointments were missed by patients on hospital waiting lists.  Current outpatient waiting lists do not exceed 400,000 patients.  It is clear, therefore, that the already limited capacity for the system to attend to all patients on the waiting list in a timely manner is being impacted further by these missed (and therefore wasted) appointment slots which prevents this slot being utilised by another patient still waiting for his\/her appointment.<\/p><p>  I am determined to do all that is possible to minimise this waste and reduce waiting lists.

Over the same period they received funding of &#8364;620,000 from my Department for the development of a Greenway within Westport Town.<\/p><p>  In 2012 the National Cycle Network funding scheme was launched. Mayo County Council submitted only one proposal under this funding scheme, for a Greenway route in Castlebar. This project requested &#8364;725,000, and following a competitive process has been allocated this amount. <\/p><p>  Also in 2012 Mayo County Council applied to my Department under the Active Travel Towns Programme for &#8364;225,000 for the town of Ballina to construct an 8.8km leisure cycling and walking loop route (Belleek Loop), and for &#8364;60,000 for the town of Louisburgh to provide a 1km Greenway link by upgrading an old disused off road track between Old Head and the town. There was considerable interest in the programme and significantly more proposals were submitted than funding was available. Both proposals were unsuccessful in securing funding.\u00a0\u00a0An assessment panel considered all the applications submitted and\u00a0selected those applications which best met\u00a0the objectives outlined in the funding call. The Belleek Loop proposal was considered\u00a0worthwhile\u00a0in its\u00a0support for\u00a0active travel, leisure cycling\u00a0and tourism, however, the assessment panel\u00a0considered that\u00a0it\u00a0lacked sufficient focus\u00a0on urban\u00a0modal shift and focused instead\u00a0to a great degree on\u00a0leisure cycling.\u00a0It therefore did not fully meet with the objectives of the Active Travel Towns programme and was not ranked high enough for inclusion in the final selection. The Louisburgh Greenway proposal was ruled out because the population size of the town fell outside the terms set for the programme.<\/p><p>  In addition to the above, it should also be noted that Westport Town is\u00a0a Smarter Travel Area (along with Limerick City and Dungarvan) and that significant on-going investment in sustainable transport infrastructure, including Greenways, is taking place in these towns. \u00a0<\/p><p>  There are currently no funding streams open within the Department suited to applications for Greenway route development, and therefore no such applications being considered. <\/p><p>  The table below summarises funding for Greenway type infrastructure within Co.
