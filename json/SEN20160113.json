This matter relates to Four Masters Bridge and Lennox Bridge which connect Kinlough in north County Leitrim to Bundoran and Ballyshannon in County Donegal.  Lennox Bridge is a single lane bridge that has been in place for many years.  It is cracked and the most recent head-on collision on it happened last weekend.  On this occasion there were relatively minor injuries, but it is one of the worst roads in the country.  Urgent action by the Government is required to upgrade it to a two lane bridge and make it safe.<\/p> <p>Four Masters Bridge is further downstream on the River Drowse which separates the two counties.  It was badly damaged by the recent flooding and is unsafe.  It is a protected structure and the road is closed.  Approximately 4,000 crossings take place each day on Lennox Bridge as members of the local communities go about their daily business in Ballyshannon and Bundoran in doing the shopping, commuting to schools and engaging in other administrative tasks.  Following the closure of Four Masters Bridge, the number of crossings has increased.  However, as I have illustrated, accidents occur frequently and, sadly, a fatal accident may not be far away.  As we witnessed in Leenane, County Mayo, these are old bridges that could be swept away in future flooding.  This could cut the communities in question off completely.<\/p> <p>I am not aware of plans for the immediate upgrade of the two bridges.  I have contacted the managers of Donegal and Leitrim County Councils in the hope they will urgently petition the Minister for immediate funds and support in this regard.  It is a critical issue in this part of the country, not least in the context of the tourism industry.  The Drowse fishery is important.  I spoke to the owner and he has said this time of year is as crucial to this part of the country as 12 July is to some in Northern Ireland in terms of tourism revenue.  People are trying to catch the first salmon of the season which has yet to be caught.<\/p> <p>When there are crises in this country, whether they are related to refugees, flooding, homelessness and so on, regardless of the financial constraints on Departments, the Government can come up with funds when it is forced to do so.  All of these causes are worthy of Government support and moneys can always be found to attempt to solve these difficulties, but the communities of north Leitrim and south Donegal are no less deserving.  These two bridges have been left to the elements for too long.  The integrity of Four Masters Bridge has been seriously damaged and it is closed, while Lennox Bridge is a single-lane, accident prone crossing point.  I appeal to the Minister to do all he can to liaise with both councils to come up with an urgent remedy for both crossings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016011300002#B00200","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1452695400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I offer the Senator and the House best wishes for the new year.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2244\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity to perhaps give a wider perspective on what has happened to the transport infrastructure across the country.  I will also be doing so in the D&aacute;il this afternoon.<\/p><p>As the Senator is aware, the most extensive impact of the weather to date for the transport sector has been on the road network and within that I include the kinds of bridges to which the Senator refers.  It has caused very serious disruption to daily life in many areas and led to the cutting off in some cases of small communities and households from others.  The priority of local and national agencies to date has been public safety and there has been ongoing communication between local authorities, State bodies and residents in affected areas to ensure  people were aware of the safety messages that issued relating to travelling in flooded areas and road closures or diversions.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authority staff, along with other relevant agencies, have worked closely to ensure that warning signs have been put in place, diversion routes organised and signposted, with information and advice made available to the public via websites, social media and local radio.  The Road Safety Authority has been very active over the past month in supporting and disseminating safety measures for all road users.<\/p><p>With regard to the scale of damage and responding to the issue raised by Senator MacSharry, local authorities and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, have advised my Department that it is not possible to get a comprehensive view of damage to road pavements until the floods fully recede and investigations and assessments are carried out.  Bridges damaged as a result of flooding and storms, including bridges mentioned by the Senator, will need to be inspected, with a detailed assessment of the damage undertaken.  TII has engineering consultants on a bridge framework available to commence inspections once flooding has subsided.  Underwater inspection is a specialist area and only a limited number of consultants have the capability to undertake such inspections.  The chief executive of TII has written to local authorities offering the services of the framework consultants if there are non-national road bridges of concern that they consider need to be inspected.  In certain cases, it may be months before full information is available on the cost of repairs whereas in other cases, where water levels have receded more quickly, the timeframe will be shorter.  In any event, my officials and those in TIl will engage with local authority officials to minimise the timeframe associated with critical repair works.<\/p><p>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has been taking the lead in responding to the immediate needs of local authorities arising from the storms and flooding and provided funding to local authorities to allow them to deal quickly with the clean-up and measures needed to protect public safety.  That Department has also sought submissions from local authorities setting out both the estimated short-term costs and the costs related to damage to infrastructure, including transport.  This is to give a full picture of the full cost, and I am working on putting that cost together.<\/p><p>So far, 25 of the 28 local authorities have reported on their estimated infrastructure damage costs and my Department is now reviewing these estimates.  The capital budget for my Department for this year is very tight and I have asked my officials as a matter of urgency to assess areas - such as those referred to by Senator MacSharry - where funding can be reprioritised or reallocated in order to deal with the consequences of the storms.  The scale of the damage incurred and the overall cost will be very large and require a response across the Government and I am working with Ministers on that.  The infrastructure mentioned by the Senator is an example of the kind of work that I accept we will need to respond to in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016011300002#B00300","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1452695400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The chronic traffic situation we experience in Galway on an ongoing basis is getting worse.  I propose one immediate solution to bring some relief which I want to discuss with the Minister and seek his advice on its implementation.  The issue is the need for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to discuss the effectiveness of high-occupancy vehicles - those carrying two, three or more persons - being allowed to use bus lanes in Galway city and how we would go about its implementation.  I have looked at international evidence and I suggest this to the Minister as a short-term measure to alleviate gridlock and traffic delays, including panic and danger, as I will outline to the Minister.  I suggest it also on the basis that the bus system is not optimised in Galway city.  The system is very poor and I have had discussions with the National Transport Authority which confirms that the bus system is not optimised.  Galway City Council and the NTA will report on a major traffic study in February but immediate traffic solutions are needed for Galway city.  I have prepared a website called <i>galwaytraffic.ie <\/i>in which I propose four solutions of which this is only one.<\/p><p>The first one I propose is a dedicated school bus system for Galway city.  There are approximately 30 schools in Galway city and the traffic is better during school holidays.  The situation would be better if those kids were using a bus instead of relying on parents to drive them, because mostly there is only one child per car.  The evidence is that only about 3% of people use buses in Galway while 80% use cars.  Those figures are confirmed by two studies carried out by Galway Chamber of Commerce and Lewis Lesley, who has a long-standing interest in this area.  The other solution I have mentioned is the high-occupancy vehicles, HOVs, which I will speak about here.<\/p><p>There is no bus lane across the Quincentenary Bridge.  In Galway, people live mostly on the west side of the city whereas most people work on the east side.  There is no bus lane, which means that everyone has to go through the city centre, which is ridiculous.  Of course, an engineering solution would need to be found to make that safe.<\/p><p>Finally, I propose a light rail system for Galway city.  At least 30 cities in Europe with fewer than 100,000 people have light rail systems.  It is possible and I am very aware of the peak hour passenger figures that are needed for that.  I am working with the NTA on that and we are about to carry out a peak hour passenger count.  I can assure the Minister that, based on the evidence I have, there is support for it.<\/p><p>To return to the issue of the high occupancy vehicle that I mentioned, peak hour traffic is very bad between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. and 4.30 p.m. and 6.30 p.m.  Outside those times, it is not so bad.  The Minister will not be surprised that at 3 a.m. the streets are empty.  Immediate action is needed to ease peak hour congestion and that is why I suggest this solution, which as I say is a short-term solution in the absence of real solutions.  At the moment, four out of five peak cars have only one passenger; the remaining cars have two or more.  We need to incentivise this.  As a pilot study, during one peak hour, cars carrying two or more passengers should be allowed to use the bus lanes.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fidelma Healy Eames:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2223\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2223&amp;amp;pid=FidelmaHealyEames&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is evidence that chronic traffic delays elsewhere in the world have been reduced by 30%.<\/p><p>I would not be making this proposal to the Minister if we had an adequate bus system in Galway.  The NTA has pointed out to me that if we had an adequate bus system for peak hours, there should be buses running every three minutes.  There are just five bus lanes in Galway city, with only an occasional bus using them.  This is a waste.  Can the Minister imagine how frustrating it is for people to sit in chronic traffic while there is an empty lane to the left with an occasional bus or taxi in it?  I understand the importance of compliance and so on and the importance of safety in the context of how the lanes would merge.  However, because the bus lanes are only in certain areas, traffic is obliged to merge at the end of the lanes in any event.  I do not believe, therefore, it would cause any unnecessary dangers.  The evidence also shows that this measure would be very symbolic and that it would encourage people to start talking about how to car-pool and to consider how to improve our environment.  The Minister knows that Ireland is facing huge environmental fines after 2020 if we do not look at transport as a major cause of emissions.  This measure could be effective in the short term, it is highly symbolic and it will start people talking about solutions.  I know the Minister is going to report that there is a by-pass in the offing, but that may or may not happen.  That is the history in Galway and I will conclude by putting it to the Minister that Galway needs immediate traffic solutions now.  I am keen to hear his response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016011300002#D00400","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1452695400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  I agree there is a need to reduce traffic congestion within Galway city and county, to improve commuting times and to reduce emissions.  No one would argue against encouraging higher vehicle occupancy where possible.  Four people travelling in one car is a much more efficient way of using resources than each taking a separate car.  However, the specific point raised by Senator Healy Eames relates to whether allowing multi-occupancy vehicles to use bus lanes would be an appropriate way to encourage multi-occupancy.  The short answer is that it would not.<\/p> <p>We must remember what is the purpose of bus lanes and why they are in place.  The rationale for creating the bus lane network was to provide on-street priority for buses.  The intention is to make bus services faster and more reliable to attract more people out of their cars and onto public transport.  This helps to reduce congestion and pollution.  The construction of the bus lane network was done at some expense to the public in order to enable this to happen.  The legislation governing usage of the bus lanes is set out in the Road Traffic Regulations 1997, as amended.  Under this legislation, buses and bicycles are allowed to avail of bus lanes, as are taxis in the case of with-flow bus lanes only.  Cyclists were permitted to use bus lanes as they are inherently vulnerable as road users and are considered safer in bus lanes rather than in general traffic.  It may interest the House to know that taxis were initially not allowed into bus lanes.  It was only after the introduction of bus lanes that it was agreed to allow taxis to also use them.   This was done after much consideration and was a concession based on the fact that taxis are available for on-street hire.  Vehicles used by members of the emergency services - the Garda, the fire brigade and the ambulance service - in the course of their duties may also be driven in bus lanes in order to prevent delay in reaching the scenes of emergencies, transporting people to hospital, etc.  Since the introduction of the bus lane network, my Department has received numerous requests - indeed I have been in this House on many occasions to discuss such requests - in respect of the need to open bus lanes to other categories of road users.  Some of those requests related to multi-occupancy cars.  In all cases, my predecessors and I have taken the view that extending the use of bus lanes to other categories of vehicles would undermine the original purpose of the lanes.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2244\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The overriding concern in considering these applications is the carrying capacity of bus lanes.  We do not want their primary role of providing bus priority to be undermined by allowing other vehicles access.<\/p><p>As a result, we have chosen to maintain the current restrictions on use of bus lanes.  While in some cases the numbers of vehicles involved might not be large, conceding access to bus lanes to any new class of vehicles would make it difficult to argue against doing so for any other.  We also need to remember that last year in this city alone, passenger numbers on the Dublin Bus network rose to 122 million on the company's 110 public service routes.  In the Senator's city, the numbers using Bus &Eacute;ireann's services are up from 3.5 million in 2012 to more than 4 million in 2014, a huge increase of 14%.<\/p><p>As the country gets back to work and the recovery strengthens, we must ensure that taking the bus to school, college or work is an attractive option, so that people leave their cars behind and reduce congestion on our roads.  One of the ways to do that is by ensuring bus lanes are free flowing and journey times are as short as possible.<\/p><p>In light of the original reasons for creating bus lanes and the sound reasons for rejecting previous proposals to extend access to other classes of vehicle, I remain of the view that there is no ground for changing the law to allow multi-occupancy vehicles into bus lanes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016011300002#E00200","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1452695400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his answer, which is disappointing because I proposed a solution in the absence of adequate buses.

The short answer from a public transport perspective is that we need to provide more buses.  We have funding in our capital plan to do that, which is the very reason I do not want to change the use of bus lanes.  If we increase the number of buses available across the country, which we will, it will be up to Bus &Eacute;ireann to decide where to deploy those buses.

It is level with the national park where the deer are free to roam.  At a recent inquest, the coroner said that while he could not find traces of deer in that fatal accident, there were traces of deer in three fatal accidents previously.  Many minor accidents have occurred on that stretch of road.  Last week, I spoke to a woman who told me a deer wandered onto the road, hit the windscreen of her car and smashed it and broke the mirror.  Many such accidents occur at that location but many people do not report them.  I have been on to garda&iacute; in Killarney who told me they get between 70 to 100 calls every year from people reporting deer on the road posing a danger.<\/p><p>The Minister will appreciate that if a farmer had livestock in a field, he would have to have a ditch or a fence to stop cows, sheep or other animals wandering onto the main road where an accident could happen.  There used to be a high wall at that location but for some reason, it was removed and there is nothing in its place to prevent the deer wandering onto the road.  The Minister should not get me wrong.  I love the deer.  They are a big draw in terms of visitors to Killarney town and we are very proud of them but we must ensure the safety of motorcyclists and pedestrians on that stretch of road.  It is the main Ring of Kerry road on which many tourists travel.  There is a warning sign with a deer on a yellow background and there is also another one indicating that horses are crossing as the road is used by a riding school.  Signs should be erected that will have more of an impact on tourists and make them aware that accidents occur at this location and that deer wander onto the road.  <\/p><p>I am aware there has been some resistance to putting up a fence in this area.  It is difficult to establish who owns the land because in response to a motion put down by someone, the council said the land was in the ownership of Bord F&aacute;ilte.  I would have thought it was in the ownership of the Office of Public Works but I believe now that it is under the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  We should try to establish who has responsibility for that stretch of land and ask that a barrier be put up to stop the deer jumping onto the road and causing many accidents in that location.  I will await the Minister of State's reply before I refer to the matter further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016011300002#F01400","speaker":"1132","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1452695400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Moloney for raising the matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys.  Wild deer in the State are protected under the Wildlife Acts.  It should be noted that while the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht licenses hunting of deer, the Department does not own the deer population.  They roam freely throughout the countryside and are present in many parts of the country.  The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine published Deer Management in Ireland - Framework for Action in March last year, which recommends a series of actions on deer management and conservation in a number of areas, including addressing the impact of deer in places where they are widespread.  An Irish deer management forum has been established to implement the various actions listed in the report.  The forum comprises representatives from the main stakeholder areas such as landowners, forestry, hunting and conservation organisations as well as representatives from both Departments.<\/p> <p>With regard to calls for increased fencing relating to incidents of deer presence on public roads in Kerry, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has no plans to fence the national park.  Deer, albeit larger, are like other wild animals in this country and I am advised it is not part of the remit of the Department to cordon them onto specific areas of land.  Moreover, fencing the national park would not be a viable solution and would not achieve the desired results for a number of reasons.  The presence of deer is not confined to the national parks and so fencing of these properties would serve no practical purpose in terms of wild deer control or management.  The park is more than 10,000 ha in size, including some rugged terrain.  Fencing this area would be an enormous task which is unlikely to result in the desired objective.  Sika deer are capable of going under fencing that is 8 in. off the ground while red deer are capable of knocking fences that are preventing them from reaching traditional feeding and shelter grounds.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Gerald Nash:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2281\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The erection of a fence of this scale could also impact on the sensitive habitats within the park.  There are many deer outside the park boundaries which would still be capable of running into the path of motorists.  The Department is of the view that improving sight lines for motorists as well as improved, possibly larger, signage is likely to be the most effective measure to assist motorists in remaining vigilant when driving through areas where populations of deer can be expected.  Officials from the Department have discussed this with Kerry County Council and I understand the council has recently undertaken works to improve sight lines in the Ballydowney area for the benefit of motorists.  Additional or relocated advance deer warning signs, or both, may also be provided by the local authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016011300002#G00200","speaker":"1067","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1452695400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has said that wildlife in the country is protected under the Wildlife Acts, which is true, but who is going to protect the people?

Decisions on which medicines are licensed for use in Ireland and reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE.  The NCPE conducts the health technology assessment of pharmaceutical products for the HSE and can make recommendations on reimbursement to assist the HSE in its decision-making process.  The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes, in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  It is appropriate that there should be no political or ministerial decisions and that a scientific and evidence-based approach is taken to determining the extent to which patients can benefit from treatment with expensive new drugs.<\/p><p>As the Senator may be aware, Orkambi is a combination drug for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, CF, in patients with two copies of a specific CF gene mutation.  The drug was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in July 2015 and the European Medicines Agency on 19 November 2015.  In other words, Orkambi has only been licensed for use in the European Union within the past few months.  Its manufacturer, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, submitted a rapid review application to the NCPE on  26 November 2015.  This rapid review represents the first step in a pricing and reimbursement application.  The NCPE has completed the rapid review and recommended a full health technology assessment of the drug.<\/p><p>Based on pricing details in the rapid review file, the HSE estimates that reimbursement would cost approximately &euro;90 million per year.  However, the company has yet to submit a full pricing and reimbursement application to the HSE&rsquo;s primary care reimbursement service.  Since early 2013, the HSE has reimbursed more than &euro;60 million for CF patients receiving Kalydeco and there are approximately 140 patients being treated with this drug.  In the next decade the HSE expects to spend well over &euro;200 million on this small but unique group of patients.<\/p><p>While I appreciate that some may take the view that the taxpayer should reimburse every licensed medicine for whatever price a drug company demands, the interests of the health service as a whole require that we only reimburse the most effective medicines and only at a fair price.  I also appreciate and fully understand people suffering from cystic fibrosis will be most anxious for an early and positive decision on reimbursement for Orkambi.  However, it would not be appropriate for me to appear to prejudge decisions which are for the HSE in the first instance under legislation passed by the Oireachtas in 2013.  I trust that the Senator will understand the position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016011300002#H00800","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1452695400,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her clarification that the process is ongoing and that subsequent to its evaluation, a pricing conversation will be held with the manufacturer.

If Orkambi can do what is said it can, I ask her to ensure an early and favourable decision is made on the issue.  By all accounts, people suffering from cystic fibrosis could benefit enormously in terms of their quality of life.  The Minister of State has been involved in a similar issue previously and I would like to hear her personal view in this instance which would be appreciated.

Even those who advocate on behalf of the CF community, some of whom I know, admit that this drug is too expensive.  As regards to if and when it is approved, I have no opinion on that and I do not think it would be right for me to offer an opinion on it at this stage.  This issue should be dealt with on a Europe-wide basis.  Even though our CF numbers are exceptionally high, it is easy to take a small country like Ireland and pick us off saying, \"There's our price and that's what we're getting.\"  It is much easier to deal with a greater population base, so the EU should come together to negotiate the purchase price for all drugs on a Europe-wide basis.  <\/p> <p>As I said, even those advocating on behalf of the CF community admit that, as it stands, this drug is way too expensive.  These people are not foolish; they know the consequences and the possible effect it could have.  Equally, however, they understand that there is not a bottomless financial pit.  While it is important for us to take on board what they are saying, we need to move swiftly towards the point where Europe negotiates with the pharmacological industry, rather than smaller countries and regions doing it alone, such as in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Luxembourg or Liechtenstein.

According to a recently published report, the starting salary for a garda is &euro;23,171 per annum.  The comparable rate of pay for a PSNI trainee, in euro terms, is &euro;32,000.  As Members will be aware, the rent allowance for garda&iacute; of up to &euro;4,000 per annum, along with 29 other allowances, has been abolished.  Some of our best and brightest are joining the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, within which a two-tier system in terms of pay now operates.  This issue needs to be addressed.  The Government, rather continuing to reduce taxes for the highest paid workers in this country, needs to ensure protection of our front-line services, particularly in this instance An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The starting salary for a member of the London Metropolitan Police Service is &euro;35,000, which means pay scales here are way out of kilter.<\/p> <p>Garda numbers also need to be increased significantly.  Fianna F&aacute;il, if returned to government after the next general election, is committed to increasing Garda numbers to 14,000 over the lifetime of the next Government.  It is important there is pay equality in this area.  Will the Leader raise this matter directly with the Minister for Justice and Equality?  It needs to be addressed and the Government needs to make a statement in this regard.  It is not equitable that a garda protecting our State would be paid significantly less than another garda doing the same job.  Reform in this regard needs to start with Garda recruits.  I do not think anybody would agree that it is right that the starting salary for a Garda, on completion of his or her training in Templemore, would be just over &euro;23,000.<\/p> <p>I note the Leader's comment that a debate on flooding is being held in the D&aacute;il today and that a similar debate will be held in this House next week.  I welcome that.  I am not sure if Members are aware of the OPW's catchment flood risk and management, CFRAM, study of flood risk areas throughout the country, which was commenced prior to the recent flood events and seeks to determine whether particular areas are flood plains.  My concern in this regard is the lack of notice given to householders or landowners living in those areas.  The deadline for observations on this study was 23 December 2015, which was the day before Christmas Eve.  I understand that in the case of the Leinster region, only 12 submissions were made by the public to the Office of Public Works.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Darragh O'Brien:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2178\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=01&amp;amp;day=13\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The reason for that was that people were not aware that this study was taking place.<\/p><p>I have further found out that the OPW in its draft report did not even use its own flood maps.

While we need to ensure that we protect areas from flooding and that we map where future areas at risk of flooding may be, surely to God the OPW should be basing its study on its own maps and, more importantly, it should seek submissions from the public who have that information.  Something has gone desperately wrong if only 12 submissions have been made in the whole of Leinster.  That is because people do not know about it.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, to pause this process right now and to republicise what the OPW is doing in order to let people have their say and to let home owners and landowners make their submissions.

A number of constituents have raised with me the upper age limit of 35 for garda recruits and I am sure it has been raised with others.  I raised the matter with the then Minister of State, Mr. Brian Hayes, MEP, in 2013.  At that point, he said there would be a review of the upper age limit to see if it could be raised.  I understand the age in Northern Ireland is higher and it seems to be a somewhat arbitrary cut-off point for recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly now that recruitment has reopened, which is a very welcome development.<\/p> <p>I commend those United Nations workers who have been engaged in delivering aid to the besieged citizens in Syria.  I support the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, who spoke today about the need to end war crimes in Syria, noting that 400,000 Syrian people are living under siege in 15 locations across Syria and that besiegement of civilian populations is being used as a war crime by a number of parties to the conflict, notably by the Syrian Government.  I commend all those humanitarian workers engaged in providing such much-needed assistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016011300002#P00400","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1452695400,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to call in the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, to discuss the EPA.

Our time in this Seanad is running out and it is time for action because the time for reports is over.  We need answers to establish why the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, behaves as a lazy, lax, limp and lame lapdog instead of as a watchdog in the public interest.  No one watching Mark Coughlan's report on \"Prime Time\" last Thursday night could have had a scintilla of confidence in the so-called Environmental Protection Agency.   I do not and those at the top, including the director of environmental enforcement and the director general, should step aside if they have any respect for their jobs or the organisation they purport to represent.

It is somewhat extraordinary that, on one hand, the Labour Party speaks about inequality and unfairness in society and states that it is part of its philosophy to address it while , on the other hand, in the past week alone it has been statistically proven that young graduates are leaving this country in droves.  These include young people involved in nursing and teaching who do not receive or enjoy proper pay or conditions.  Garda&iacute; putting themselves in the line of fire are being treated abysmally in terms of pay and conditions.  It is rather interesting to hear the spin being put on the fact that recruitment has restarted because the reality in this regard shows a net reduction in numbers as a result of retirements, career breaks, etc.  The Garda force is currently over 200 short of 12,000, which is way below the figure that we in Fianna F&aacute;il have proposed if we are returned to Government.  We favour a restoration of the force's strength to 14,000.  Such a move is necessary and anybody living in rural Ireland in particular will know that more garda&iacute; are required on the ground.<\/p><p>There is a very well-educated cohort in society that wants to stay, work and live in Ireland.  These people have graduated as nurses and were told there was a nursing shortage but the Government has failed abysmally to attract back nurses under a scheme proposed last year.  One figure indicates that fewer than 50 people have taken it up.  Why is this?  It is because they are not receiving or enjoying the proper pay and conditions commensurate with what they have learned.  Not only that, it is a competitive environment and they are being attracted elsewhere.  It is extraordinary that a couple of years ago we had teachers who could not get jobs but now we have a teacher shortage that will, according to the information publicly available, get worse.  This is despite the Government's indication that it will provide a significant number of extra places next September.  There will be no teachers around at that stage because they will be in Dubai where they can get more pay than they do here and it will be tax free.<\/p><p>I call on the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, to come before the House to debate the position with regard to this group of people and what the Government, in its dying days, is planning to do in order to give some meaning to the question of how to treat people in society who have gone through the educational system, who have a reasonable expectation of having jobs in their own country but who find they cannot do so because they will not receive sufficient pay and the conditions under which they are asked to operate are totally unacceptable.

The EPA must answer questions on wider issues to answer in this regard.  There are plants that can operate efficiently, effectively and within the rules.  I am not suggesting that this is happening but if certain plants are taking shortcuts, perhaps for economic benefit, and,  consequently, are a danger to the environment - not just an apparent danger but are having a real and current effect - as a result, then the EPA must to be held to account and get its act together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016011300002#S00400","speaker":"1166"},{"type":"speech","time":1452695400,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I agree with everyone else who has wished us all a very successful new year.

I grew up in the tourist business and believe we have not done enough to encourage tourism.  Ireland is losing potentially hundreds of thousands of tourists compared to other countries.  Schengen countries such as France attract many more tourists, for instance from China, as it is much easier for tourists to visit such countries.  In Ireland holiday visas are only granted for short stays and never exceed 90 days.  If we were to increase visa length, we would cut down on red tape and paperwork and encourage more people to visit.  It would make sense to increase the length of visas, perhaps not to ten years as happens in the United States but to a period that would result in a decrease in red tape and an increase in tourist numbers.  We also need to think about reducing the overall paperwork involved.  A lot could be done on that basis.<\/p><p>The other issue being talked about today and which is on everyone's mind is flooding.  We should look at a clean-up of rivers which contain masses of rubbish.  It would have a massive benefit for the environment and also help tourism.  There is potential for schoolchildren and volunteers to become involved.  I will quote from an article in a British paper on a massive ongoing project in the United Kingdom which is experiencing great success:  <\/p><blockquote>There were shopping trolleys galore, of course, including 24 in a Sheffield lock alone; countless bikes and hundreds of tyres. Thousands of plastic bags, umpteen gas bottles, several car batteries and other debris were among the other objects removed from rivers, canals, locks and bridges during clear up operations across England and Wales by the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust.<\/blockquote> <p>The article in <i>The Guardian<\/i>is entitled, From a hand grenade to a Mercedes.  It actually found a hand grenade dating from the Second World War in the clean-up of rivers and it still had the pin in it.

Will the Leader arrange a debate on the HSE's programme for progressing disability services for children and young people?  If not on that specific topic, perhaps the debate might be on the more broader themes of primary care facilities and disability services in general.  Members are aware that &euro;4 million for an additional 80 posts was provided under that programme in 2014 and that an allocation of &euro;6 million was announced in 2015 for 120 new staff appointments.  The rationale was to achieve a targeted reduction of waiting lists, but the reality is that this did not happen.  In figures released to me in debates on Commencement matter in this House and through direct interaction with the HSE we find that waiting list numbers for appointments for children's physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy are phenomenally high.  We need to make sure disability services are cognisant of demographic changes and that the funding provided has been increased to cope with additional demand.<\/p> <p>I will highlight some waiting lists figures in County Cavan.  There are 102 children who have been waiting for six months or more for physiotherapy; 177 children have been waiting for six months or more for occupational therapy, while 25 children have been waiting for six months or more for speech and language therapy.  With regard to speech and language therapy waiting lists, national figures at the end of September 2015 showed that 12,587 were waiting for assessment, while 8,437 were awaiting treatment across all services.  The issue is not confined to one region; it arises right across the State.  I know that the Minister of State has addressed Commencement matters in this House, particularly issues affecting my county of Cavan, but it is important, in the context of the upcoming general election, from which none of us can hide, that this issue be at the front and centre and that children have access to assessments and services when needed.

We have been looking for answers from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which is one of the biggest bloody oxymorons in the lexicon of Government agencies because it does not protect the environment, high up or low down.  The director general of the EPA has said that she does not see her role as being one of a watch dog or of prosecuting polluters.  We in this Chamber have called time and again for immunity to prosecution to be removed from the EPA.  If the EPA is doing its job correctly, there is no need for it to be protected by immunity to prosecution.  What is it afraid of?  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, and the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Ann Phelan, told us here that they would report to us on the immunity but they have not bothered to do so.

On this day, 13 January 1800, Daniel O'Connell made the first of many speeches opposing Ireland's union with Britain.  It was his first ever speech and it was made in Dublin at a protest meeting against the union.  As Members will be well aware, the introduction of that Act was the exact opposite of the aims of the United Irishmen and the purpose of the 1798 rebellion which, it is important to remind ourselves, was supported by Protestant, Catholic and dissenter, and it might be useful to draw on a short excerpt of a speech by Daniel O'Connell, which expresses his sentiments in this regard.  He stated: \"Let every man who feels with me proclaim, that if the alternative were offered him of Union, or the re-enactment of the Penal Code in all its pristine horrors, that he would prefer without hesitation the latter, as the lesser and more sufferable evil.\"  O'Connell went on to proclaim that he would rather confide in the justice of his brethren, the Protestants of Ireland who liberated him, than lay his country at the feet of foreigners.<\/p> <p>In this centenary year of the Easter Rising, it is appropriate that we rededicate ourselves to complete the final chapter in ending British involvement in Ireland or, more precisely, in the Six Counties, as De Valera famously put it at his meeting with Chamberlain in London in April 1938.  A debate in this House on achieving that objective would be a fitting tribute to the sentiments of Daniel O'Connell, the memory of the patriots of 1916 and the subsequent patriots in our War of Independence.  I hope the Leader can find time to accommodate that request before the election is called.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016011300002#W00200","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1452695400,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I wish to briefly mention the issue of obesity, which I have been raising for the past five years.

We are exporting weanlings to Italy, Tunisia and other countries, but we cannot sell our animals just a couple of miles across the Border where there are buyers and there is demand and where the benefit would be a greater yield and return to farming families throughout this country.  This issue needs to be examined as it is an anti-competitive practice. <\/p> <p>Other issues of concern include the reduced competition in terms of processors.  With respect to all those involved in processing, it seems that the well known Slaney and Irish Country Meats plant at Camolin is set to merge with one of the larger players.

In a nutshell, he lit up every room he came into and that was widely felt at his funeral yesterday in Galway.<\/p> <p>I support the call for a debate on the health impacts of excessive sugar consumption.  That was quite a documentary broadcast this week by RTE.  There must be legislative solutions in this regard.  As we have said for a long time, there is an urgent need for a debate on career guidance given the high number of drop-outs in third level education, particularly in first year.  However, the main reason I rise is to speak about the human misery that has befallen those affected by flooding.  Half of Ireland is under water and has been for the last month.  The bottom line is that anyone whose property was flooded last year and in 2009 has been failed by this State and the Government.  We have a great example of successful works in Moneymore, Oranmore, where we got all the agencies into a room and got the National Parks and Wildlife Service to agree that the OPW could take the lead.  Some 52 farmers worked together and these families are relieved their properties have not been flooded again this time.<\/p> <p>We must examine various solutions, some of which were mentioned by Senators Mullins and Quinn today.  The Woodland League has approached me with an interesting solution that has worked in Wales, in particular.  A Bangor University study, led by farmers, has shown that where uplands are planted by native trees with deep roots, they can absorb rainfall 67 times faster than grassland.  In Wales, they have experienced a 29% decrease in flooding in their lowlands with just an extra  5% planting of native trees.  That is good news and something we should seek to replicate.<\/p> <p>Norway has almost no flooding because it has allowed for the natural regeneration of its forests for 50 years.  We have not done that.  I am glad the Leader has said the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine will attend this House next week.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, should seriously examine this recommendation.  We need to discuss planting perhaps 10% of our uplands.  At a conservative estimate, this could result in 40% less flooding.  <\/p> <p>Last week, Bob Geldof visited Thoor Ballylee and committed to help us raise funds to alleviate the awful flooding there.

I call for a debate on the accident and emergency department crisis.

However, things have deteriorated quite rapidly in the intervening period.  Last week, a wheelchair user had to sleep in a wheelchair in Beaumont Hospital for two nights because there were no trolleys or beds available.  The situation is very serious, so I ask the Leader to try to schedule a debate on that with the Minister for Health.<\/p> <p>I ask the Leader to contact the Minister for Foreign Affairs to express concern about the health of a Palestinian journalist, Muhammad al-Qeq, who is currently on hunger strike.  He was sentenced to six months without any trial under Israel's system of administrative detention.  His health is deteriorating rapidly and there are serious concerns that he is near death.  This is an issue Ireland should raise with the Israeli authorities - not just the individual circumstances but also Israel's blatant violation of international law in its use of administrative detention to send people to prison for months or years on end.  Thousands of Palestinians have been sent to prison without charge, trial or due process.

He is quite correct in that new trainee garda&iacute; receive a basic allowance of &euro;184 a week, plus a living allowance of &euro;77.92.  After 32 weeks training, they are attested and put on the first point of the garda salary scale, &euro;23,171, rising to a maximum of &euro;45,793 after 19 years service.  The garda pay scale does not include allowances and does not reflect the full earnings of a garda.  Newly attested garda&iacute; are assigned to front-line duties and work the garda roster, work which attracts unsocial hours payments.  Such payments amount to between 25% and 30% of their earnings.  Even at the entry level of &euro;23,171 and the lower end of the unsocial hours scale, the payments will add almost &euro;5,800 to the salary of a new garda.

She has suggested we are not doing sufficient in this regard and called for the introduction of a sugar tax.  Her call was supported by Senator Gerard P. Craughwell.  As we have previously debated the issue, perhaps she might consider tabling it for discussion as a Commencement matter, at which time she could obtain the up-to-date position from the Minister for Health.  <\/p><p>Senators Gerard P. Craughwell, Terry Brennan and Hildegarde Naughton spoke about the untimely death of Christy O'Connor Jnr. who was a wonderful ambassador not only for his sport but also for the whole country.  The presence of the Ryder Cup in the church during his funeral mass was seen as a great gesture.  <\/p><p>Senator Gerard P. Craughwell also raised the issue of having no-fry zones in schools in tackling the problem of obesity, a matter I have already addressed.<\/p><p>Senator Marc MacSharry spoke about agriculture and called for a debate on the need to address anti-competitive practices in the meat industry.  I will try to arrange for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to come to the House for such a debate.  Deputy Simon Coveney has been one of the best Ministers for agriculture we have had in many a long year.  Naturally, I would say that, but I also believe it to be the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016011300002#CC03100","speaker":"1130","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1452695400,"counter":165,"content":"<p>The Senator has been the best Leader of the Seanad for many a long year, too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016011300002#DD00200","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1452695400,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames raised a number of pertinent matters related to flooding, an issue on which we have a debate next week.
