The 65 whole-time equivalents would be made up a combination of core staff which would be employed all year round and seasonal staff. This provided for the staff in SUSI to rise during the peak processing months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000053#WRB01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Retirements","counter":55,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000053#WRB01850"},{"type":"question","counter":56,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[51305\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000053#WRB01900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the amount, if any, of the miscalculation of the cost of recent retirements within his Department; if he will also clarify any other costs which were miscalculated and which will impact upon cuts to education in Budget 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":57,"content":"<p>Due to the unique circumstances surrounding the public service retirement package this year, it was difficult to forecast an exact cost of superannuation payments on my Vote for 2012.

Seven short courses, including short courses on Digital Media Literacy and in Programming\/ Coding, are currently being developed by the NCCA for use by schools from 2014.

The escalation of PKK terrorist attacks makes it much harder to reach a solution, but the fight against terrorism must be conducted with due regard for human rights. As I stated in this House last week, Turkey, as an EU candidate, is expected to uphold the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms that are core values of the EU. These are issues which will continue to be raised in the context of the EU&rsquo;s ongoing dialogue with Turkey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRD00900","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Programmes","counter":168,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRD00950"},{"type":"question","counter":169,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[51174\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRD01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the new European Endowment for Democracy; the contribution if any, Ireland will make to this organisation; Ireland's representation in the governance of this organisation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1010","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":170,"content":"<p>The European Endowment for Democracy (EED) is a new initiative established on foot of a Declaration adopted in December 2011 by the Member States and the EU Institutions that, in the words of its Statute, seeks to &ldquo;to foster and encourage democratization and deep and sustainable democracy in countries in political transition and in societies struggling for democratisation&rdquo;.

The Board of Governors of the EED includes representatives from all the Union&rsquo;s 27 Member States.

The Board of Governors chooses the EED&rsquo;s Executive Director and its Executive Committee.  <\/p><p>  The EED currently has funding of some &euro;15 million pledged by the Commission and several Member States.

However the EED Statute provides for Member States to make contributions in kind.

Present Government policy on remuneration dictates that no employee, at the covered institutions may receive more than &euro;500,000 (excluding pension contributions) per annum and remains in force. <\/p><p>  Numerous engagements by my officials and Mercer have taken place since the awarding of the contract.  I am expecting the consultant&rsquo;s report to be delivered by year end whereupon consultations with the various stakeholders will commence.  As I have said previously, I fully recognise that there is a real public interest in the levels of remuneration at the covered institutions and have committed to placing the details underpinning the review into the public domain&rdquo;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRD03900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":213,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRE00150"},{"type":"question","counter":214,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[51026\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRE00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons who availed of the dual abode allowance for Ministers in each year since it was introduced; the value of the allowance that was availed of each year; the Ministers who availed of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":215,"content":"<p>The position is that the dual abode allowance was introduced as and from the income tax year 1966\/67.

In line with each of the previous quarterly reviews, Ireland has met all of the commitments and our continued strong programme implementation has been recognised by the Troika.   My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and I met the EU-IMF delegation during the recent quarterly review of the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.  These meetings were also attended by senior officials from both Departments.  A wide range of topics was covered at these meetings, including financial reforms, structural reforms, economic developments and the progress of the Programme.

In addition, the Deputy should recall that we previously secured an extension of this timeline from 2014 to 2015.  Any further extension of the fiscal consolidation timeframe would most likely mean a higher peak debt ratio and more of the State&rsquo;s resources going towards debt servicing costs.  Both the debt and debt servicing costs are at a very high level already.  It is important they are stabilised and then reduced as quickly as possible.  The State entered into excessive deficit in 2008.  Based on the current plan, the State will be in excessive deficit for seven years, coming out of it only in 2015.  This is a long period of time to be running deficits in excess of 3% of GDP.  The Government is of the view that a 2015 deadline for correcting the deficit strikes the right balance between allowing the economic recovery to take hold but at the same time restoring sustainability to the public finances in a phased, timely manner.

Included in the response is an additional disclosure to its Interim accounts, stating that the Group now advises that it recorded an accounting write off amounting to &#8364;2.3 million of its impairment provisions in respect of Residential Mortgages in the Republic of Ireland in the six months ended 30 June 2012. <\/p><p><b>Bank of Ireland Statement<\/b>:<\/p><p>  &#8220;The level of disclosure that Bank of Ireland gives on its Irish Residential Mortgage portfolio has been favourably commended by investors and market commentators.<\/p><p>  Bank of Ireland gives significant and comprehensive disclosure on its provisioning policies per pages 124-126 of its Annual Report for the year to 31 December 2012.  There have been no material changes to these policies since then.  Bank of Ireland gives significant and comprehensive disclosure on its asset quality including in connection with Retail Ireland residential mortgages in pages 25-29 of its Interim Report for the 6 months to 30 June 2012 and gives further significant and comprehensive disclosure on its Retail Ireland Residential Mortgage portfolio in pages 107-117 of that Interim Report including that it had formally restructured or modified 15,861 mortgages at that date.  The Bank also has a significant number of informal temporary arrangements with customers.<\/p><p>  In its Interim Management Statement issued to the Stock Market on 13 November 2012 Bank of Ireland commented on its Irish Residential Mortgage book as follows:<\/p><p>  &#8220;We continue to actively focus on credit quality and our exposures to the Irish SME sector and our Irish Mortgage book continue to be key priorities.  With regard to our Irish Mortgage book, the pace of arrears formation has continued to reduce and we have continued to formally restructure and modify a significant number of customer mortgages on a sustainable basis.  86% of those customers whose mortgages are currently in formal restructure or modification are fully meeting their revised arrangements&#8221;.<\/p><p>  Bank of Ireland is conscious that this question was also asked at Bank of Ireland&#8217;s appearance at the recent meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Expenditure and Reform on 1 November 2012 and Bank of Ireland came in for some criticism in relation to its response to that question.  Bank of Ireland wishes to put this matter into context.  <\/p><p>  In such public appearances the Bank wishes to be as open as possible with members of the Committee.  It must also, however, be conscious of its responsibilities as a public company to adhere to the disclosure obligations of the various Stock Exchanges where the Bank is listed, including disclosure of matters the Bank considers to be commercially sensitive.  On this occasion, as previously, Mr Boucher stressed this responsibility, for the information of Members, in his opening remarks:<\/p><p><i>&#8220;The Bank is a public company that is subject to the listing rules of the Irish, London and New York stock exchanges.  The presentation is a public document and is presented under the rules of the aforementioned stock exchanges.  All comments I make are governed by the stock exchange disclosure rules.&#8221;  <\/i><\/p><p>  The Bank&#8217;s appearance before the Committee on 1 November 2012 was prior to it giving a Trading Update to the Stock Exchanges which was released to the markets on 13 November 2012 and on 13 November 2012, in conjunction with its Trading Update, the Bank successfully launched the first public non-Government guaranteed bond issued by an Irish Bank since 2010 raising &#8364;1billion in the process.  There would be very strict disclosure obligations prior to, at the time of and post events such as these. <\/p><p>  Spokespersons for the Bank cannot make incremental accounting disclosures for prior accounting periods unless they are described as being such when being made and have been extensively verified before being made.<\/p><p>  Consistent with its accounting policies, the Group only writes off debt once all avenues to recover the loans have been exhausted.  In the case of Residential Mortgages in the Republic of Ireland, this happens after the property has been repossessed \/ sold and all other means of recovering any residual amount owing have been exhausted.  As an additional disclosure to its Interim accounts, the Group now advises that it recorded an accounting write off amounting to &#8364;2.3 million of its impairment provisions in respect of Residential Mortgages in the Republic of Ireland in the six months ended 30 June 2012.<\/p><p>  Bank of Ireland has made several appearances in front of Oireachtas Committees in recent years and has at all times, provided significant information and sought to be helpful and cooperative in such engagements.  On the occasion of the previous appearance with the Committee on Finance, Expenditure and Reform in September 2011, members of the Committee were publicly complimentary on the openness and comprehensive nature of the contributions from the Bank.<\/p><p>  On the most recent occasion the Bank, once again, welcomed the opportunity to update members of the Committee on progress made by Bank of Ireland on its strategic objectives and to provide as much detail as possible on the Group&#8217;s business.  In this respect the Bank submitted, in advance, a detailed 31 slide presentation on its business and also responded to a lengthy questionnaire issued by the Committee.  <\/p><p>  Bank of Ireland is very much conscious of the support provided by the taxpayer, has always acknowledged this, and wished to provide an update on progress to a shareholder representing 15% of the Group&#8217;s stock.  In his opening remarks Mr Boucher stressed this point at some length:  with specific reference to slide 27 in the presentation he said:<\/p><p><i>&#8220;As investors and representatives of the taxpayer, we try to demonstrate [to you] what the taxpayer is getting out of its support for Bank of Ireland.  Our first task is to reduce the risk to the taxpayer from support provided by the taxpayer.  We believe the capital we have raised, the restructuring and deleveraging, the cost-reduction programmes we have undertaken, the agreement of our EU viability and restructuring plans, and the enhancement of our franchises &#8211; including the franchise in the UK, further protected by the extension of the Post Office contract &#8211; have been a very important part of reducing the risk to the taxpayer.  The most significant contingent liability the taxpayer has is in respect of the eligible liabilities guarantee or ELG.  Through a range of initiatives, particularly deleveraging and increasing our deposit franchises, we have reduced the liabilities under the ELG from &#8364;136 billion at their peak in September 2008 to &#8364;36 billion at the end of June.  They will have reduced further since that date.  Bank of Ireland notes that the ELG is due to expire on 31 December and we are prepared for that.<\/i><\/p><p><i>The State invested &#8364;4.8 billion in cash in Bank of Ireland in the period up to June 2012, and Bank of Ireland returned &#8364;2.5 billion in cash to the State in that period.&#8221;<\/i><\/p><p>  The presentation also noted rules governing profit disclosure, forward guidance etc at Page 2.<\/p><p>  The issues of disclosure and commercial sensitivity arose on a number of occasions during a lengthy hearing and Mr Boucher attempted to explain that, while wanting to be helpful, he was operating under disclosure obligations that inevitably constrained his ability to respond in full to some questions.  At one point in the transcript during an exchange where Mr Boucher was explaining this point he said:<\/p><p><i>&#8220;I apologise if I sound pedantic but I operate under strict rules.&#8221;<\/i><\/p><p>  The Bank understands the frustration expressed by some members of the Committee, in particular in relation to a perceived inconsistency with the position of other witnesses appearing before it.  Bank of Ireland cannot speak for other institutions but stresses that it has always been and must continue to be entirely consistent on its obligations as a public company.  <\/p><p>  The Bank regrets the frustration expressed by members of the Committee in this respect but asks for the Committee&#8217;s understanding of the Bank&#8217;s public company obligations and the Bank again reiterates its willingness to participate in the public engagement process including with Oireachtas Committees.  <\/p><p>  The Bank would also ask that any consideration of this matter include a review of the Bank&#8217;s presentation and submission as well as the full transcript of a lengthy hearing where, the Bank believes, it attempted to put important and relevant information on the public record and to help the Committee&#8217;s deliberations.&#8221; <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":293,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRG01350"},{"type":"question","counter":294,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[51268\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRG01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the date on which the 65 year limit for DIRTexemption was introduced; when did the exemption become automatic other than be subject to an application for a refund.","asker":"961","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":295,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[51407\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRG01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the date on which the DIRT exemption for those over 65 years of age was introduced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":296,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 211 and 223 together. <\/p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, from the time Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) was first introduced in the tax year ended 5 April 1987, where an individual or their spouse was aged over 65, they were exempt from DIRT where their total annual income did not exceed the exemption limit.

The Code highlights the importance of a borrower contacting their lender when they are in arrears or pre-arrears.  A key protection is a 12 month moratorium on action by lenders.

Applied Behavioural Analysis, or ABA, is one of the approaches used in special classes for children with autism. <\/p><p>  The use of ABA as part of the range of interventions is particularly useful for addressing behavioural issues. My Department supports the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use. However, the Department does not accept, based on research, advice and best practice, that ABA should be the only approach used. While ABA helps to improve behaviour, other approaches, such as Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) are just as important in developing children's communication and speech skills. It is important that children have access to a range of approaches so that their broader needs can be met. As children differ significantly from one another and as children's needs vary and change over time, it is not possible to impose a method or approach that will work for all children with autism.  This child centred approach is based on advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS, the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may be interested to note that teachers in special schools have been using ABA principles for more than 25 years.

The effectiveness of behavioural interventions to improve the performance of children with autism and to ameliorate behavioural difficulties has been recognized for decades.<\/p><p>  To clarify the position regarding psychological assessment reports prepared by health service staff which identify a child's educational needs, the Health Service Executive (HSE) circulated guidance to their staff earlier this year.

In line with this approach the policy is to promote a child-centred approach to education of all children with special educational needs including those with autism. As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.<\/p><p>  Children with autism present with a wide range of needs. Some children are capable of being fully integrated into mainstream schools without additional teaching or care supports. Others are able to attend mainstream schools but need additional teaching and\/or care assistance. Many are best enrolled in autism-specific classes where more intensive and supportive interventions are required. Some may move from one setting to another as they get older and differing needs\/strengths\/abilities emerge.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be familiar with the standards associated with qualified teachers, the registration of qualified teachers required by the Teaching Council, the probationary process, whereby teachers are supported and advised by the inspectorate during their first year of teaching. Furthermore the Department recognises that specialised training and continued professional development (CPD) is important for staff working with children with special educational needs and supports the provision of CPD through the Special Education Support Service (SESS) which was specifically established for this purpose. The SESS co-ordinates and delivers a range of professional development initiatives and support structures for school personnel working with students with special educational needs.<\/p><p>  Autism classes are established with a staffing ratio of 1 teacher and a minimum of 2 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for every 6 children. Other SNAs may be allocated if required to meet the care needs of the children. Start-up grants are provided to the schools to enable special equipment to be purchased. Enhanced capitation is paid in respect of each child and assistive technology is funded where this is recommended.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years.

The purpose of the report, which I requested, was to identify new possible structures to improve initial teacher education in Ireland so that it is comparable with the best in the world. <\/p><p>  The international panel of education experts recommended that teacher education be provided in six &quot;centres for teacher education&quot;. Currently there are 19 state funded providers of ITE (and three non-state funded) offering more than 40 college programmes in primary and post-primary teaching. The new collaborations recommended by the international panel will mean that a smaller number of centres for ITE exist, but that they offer education across multiple sectors from early childhood to primary, to post primary to adult education. These centres for teacher education will also possess a critical mass in terms of research capacity which is not always possible in smaller institutions. The new configurations will mean strong research bases can be created in each centre.<\/p><p>  The HEA has been requested to consult with the relevant parties and to prepare a detailed plan on how to implement the recommendations of the Panel. I understand that this process has started and a plan is expected by the end of the year.

Its research provides a valuable input to the development of training course curricula for national training providers and has also informed the development of new competitive funding models of provision to address emerging skills needs.<\/p><p>  The Government's activation policy, 'Pathways to Work', provides for engagement by the Department of Social Protection's INTREO Employment and Support Service with unemployed people, particularly the long-term unemployed, with a view to assisting them in finding jobs or referrals to appropriate education and training.<\/p><p>  To complement this policy, and despite reducing resources, my Department will fund over 450,000 education and training places across the range of provision in the higher education, further education and training sectors in 2012. My Department and its agencies are prioritising places, including in the further education and training sector, specifically for those on the Live Register for 12 months or more.<\/p><p>  In 2012 F&Aacute;S aim to facilitate over 81,000 unemployed individuals through a range of training programmes, that provide industry\/occupational specific skills as well as preparatory type training, to enable a diverse range of unemployed individuals referred to F&Aacute;S by the Department of Social Protection, to gain a recognised qualification, access job opportunities or progression opportunities to further\/higher education\/training. The Department of Social Protection provides appropriate guidance and advice, as required, to unemployed individuals relating to F&Aacute;S courses. The re-alignment of F&Aacute;S training programmes with evolving labour market needs is evidence-based. This is facilitated by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) and other relevant international and national sources including employers.<\/p><p>  More than 10,000 higher education places are being provided in areas of identified skills need under the Springboard programme and 6,500 places are being rolled out under the new Labour Market Education and Training Fund which will be managed by FAS.<\/p><p>  In addition, the joint Government-Industry ICT Action Plan, which has been developed as a direct response to identified ICT skills shortages, contains a comprehensive range of measures to build the domestic supply of ICT graduates, including through the roll out of over 800 places on graduate skills conversion courses from March 2012. A roll-out of a second phase of the conversion courses is scheduled for early 2013.<\/p><p>  The Irish Further Education and Training sector is undergoing major structural reform.  The creation of a new further education and training authority, SOLAS, will facilitate a coherent integrated strategic national response across the further education and training sectors and will ensure a greater focus on the evolving requirements of the unemployed and of industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRJ03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1042"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":448,"content":"<p>Question No. 268 answered with Question No. 117.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":449,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRK00250"},{"type":"question","counter":450,"qnumday":269,"qnumall":"[51582\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRK00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the total number of primary schools throughout the country currently dependant on prefabricated accommodation; his plans to address this issue in the next three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":451,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[51583\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRK00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the total number of post- primary schools throughout the country currently dependant on prefabricated accommodation; his plans to address this issue in the next three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":452,"content":"<p>I propose to take questions 269 and 270 together.<\/p><p>  Currently, there are 496 primary schools renting 1,283 prefab units and 47 post-primary schools renting 131 prefab units throughout the country.

To this end, the identification of staff surpluses is underway across the public service (including the health service).

The Action Plan for Jobs contains a number of measures which are aimed specifically at the facilitation and incentivisation of national enterprise development from start-ups to growth companies.  The Enterprise Development agencies, under the aegis of my Department, are at the forefront of implementing the Action Plan for Jobs across all regions and will ensure that enterprises can maximise their contribution to economic and jobs growth.<\/p><p>  In 2011, Enterprise Ireland paid over &#8364;5.4m in financial support to its client companies to assist them to develop their business and create employment in South County Dublin including Tallaght.  The New Frontiers Programme, which focuses on developing a person&#8217;s entrepreneurial abilities is co-ordinated by Enterprise Ireland and is providing &#8364;4.25m in funding to enable the Institutes of Technology, including Tallaght IT, to deliver the Programme at a local level.  Participants receive financial support of &#8364;15,000.  So far this year, 23 people participated in Phase 1 of the Programme at Tallaght IT and 15 applicants are currently completing Phase 2.A new Community Enterprise Centre Development Programme was launched this year for the maintenance or establishment of a strong business development function in the Community Enterprise Centres, funded by Enterprise Ireland.  Three Community Enterprise Centres in the Tallaght Area were successful in securing this funding in 2012, including Partas Centres in Killinarden and Brookfield.<\/p><p>  The South Dublin County Enterprise Board provides support for small businesses with 10 employees or fewer in the start-up and expansion phases, to develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level. In 2011 the Board paid out &#8364;357,682 in grant assistance to 38 microenterprise projects in the county.  This year, the Board will continue to be actively involved in economic development in the area and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development.<\/p><p>  From IDA Ireland&#8217;s perspective, Tallaght continues to be well-equipped to compete for potential Foreign Direct Investment, with superb infrastructure facilities at City West and Grange Castle.  IDA announcements in 2012 include Xilinx &#8211; a &#8364;50m expansion in its operations; SAP &#8211; creation of 150 jobs; Microsoft &#8211; US$130m expansion in its operations.  As recently as September 2012, Aspen, announced the creation of 44 jobs at its facility in City West.  <\/p><p>  Ensuring that more micro and small businesses can start up, expand and export is a key pillar of the Government&#8217;s plans for jobs and growth.  That is why the Government has decided to implement an ambitious reform in the delivery of service to small and micro business.  This will include the:-<\/p><p>- Development of a new Small and Micro Business Division within Enterprise Ireland (EI) as a centre of excellence in the provision of supports to the small and micro enterprise sectors; <\/p><p>- Dissolution of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) and the transfer of their functions, assets and liabilities to Enterprise Ireland (EI);<\/p><p>- Establishment of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) to provide a high quality, innovative, &#8220;one-stop-shop&#8221; support service for small businesses within Local Authorities, and providing early access to the services of national bodies and,<\/p><p>- Integration of key local authority business services into the Local Enterprise Office and promotion of a local environment in which enterprise can thrive.<\/p><p>  Pending the introduction of these proposed new arrangements, micro-enterprises employing less than 10 persons, in Tallaght can, as their first port of call, continue to contact South Dublin County Enterprise Board (SDCEB) on: <font color=\"#3F803F\">.<\/font><\/p><p>  To improve access to credit for entrepreneurs and micro-enterprises, and to facilitate the growth and expansion of viable businesses from all industry sectors which have been refused access to credit by banks, the Government recently established the Microfinance Loan Fund.

The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure.<\/p><p>  My objective is to establish a world-class Workplace Relations Service. The Workplace Relations Bill which I hope to publish in early 2013 will contain provisions in respect of the relevant procedures for appeals along the lines already outlined in the policy document &#8216;<i>Legislating for a Worldclass Workplace Relations Service&#8217;<\/i> and also in my presentation before the joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs Enterprise and Innovation last July.  I intend proposing to the Oireachtas that all first instance complaints requiring adjudication will be heard by the Adjudication Officers of the new Workplace Relations Commission and any subsequent appeals will be heard by the Labour Court as a full fresh appeal.  The Labour Court will act as a court of final appeal for all adjudication decisions of the Workplace Relations Commission, subject to the right of either party to bring a further appeal from a determination of the Labour Court to the High Court on a point of law only.<\/p><p>  The WRC will have statutory jurisdiction for facilitating the resolution of disputes under employment, equality and industrial relations legislation, in accordance with best practice and in compliance with international human rights standards.  To ensure that the WRC delivers its services to the highest standards, the Director will be supported by a Registration Service with a suitably qualified and experienced lawyer as Registrar.  It is envisaged that such a Registration Service would be responsible for the receipt, validation and processing of all employment related complaints and the coordination, management and referral of those cases to Hearing.  For example, the Registration Service will check complaints on receipt and reject or redirect incomplete complaints, complaints which are out of time or which are grounded incorrectly.  The Registration Service will have responsibility for steering each case through the system and ensuring it is dealt with efficiently and effectively.<\/p><p>  In this regard, I am happy to report that substantial progress has been made to date and a number of important priority actions have been successfully delivered within the target timescale which will ensure that all employment related complaints are dealt with effectively, efficiently and in a timely manner, including:-<\/p><p>- the introduction of a new single contact portal called &#8220;Workplace Relations Customer Services&#8221; (for information provisions and complaints receipt and registration) which has replaced the five separate entry points, and<\/p><p>- a Single Complaint Form that deals with 100 first instance complaints has replaced the 30 forms previously in use.<\/p><p>  I fully expect the work that I have initiated with regard to the reform of the Workplace Relations Bodies to significantly improve the quality of service to users and I am confident that all employment related complaints will be dealt with in an effective, efficient and timely manner under the new structures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRM02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services","counter":595,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRM02050"},{"type":"question","counter":596,"qnumday":323,"qnumall":"[51606\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRM02100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he or any of the State's industrial promotion agencies have been able to assist in having production resumed as a processing plant (details supplied) in County Cavan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":597,"content":"<p>I understand that a Receiver was appointed to the company concerned on 22 October 2012.  <\/p><p>  I am informed by Enterprise Ireland that they have been in regular contact with the Receiver and are available to provide any possible assistance that the agency can.

This holds for all sectors of the labour market, including the care sector. <\/p><p>  Incentivising the take-up of employment is essentially being achieved by three means:-<\/p><p>- First, the Government is determined to continue to reform the tax and social welfare system to ensure that a person who takes up employment is significantly better off financially then if they remained on social welfare. Our current Jobseekers Benefit and Jobseekers Allowance payments are already designed in such a way as to ensure that persons are incentivised to take up either full-time or part-time employment.  This is achieved by a gradual tapering of the social welfare payment for people who take up part-time employment.  Currently, a person can work up to three days and still have an entitlement to a reduced social welfare payment, with the reduction in the social welfare payment tapered in line with a person&rsquo;s increase in earnings from work.  A person who wishes to work on a part-time basis over a period in excess of three days per week can avail of the Part Time Job Incentive Scheme or the Family Income Supplement Scheme.  People who are more than 12 months unemployed are also entitled to an increased personal tax credit in certain circumstances further increasing the returns to work.<\/p><p>  In addition, reforms to the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes are being introduced to ensure that people in part-time employment are incentivised to take up full-time employment as such opportunities become available.  This includes rebasing the payment week for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit on a five-day week rather than the previous six-day week basis where a person is working for part of the week.  This measure was introduced in July 2012.  And from February 2013 employment on a Sunday will be taken into account when determining the level of entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s payments.  The recognition of Sunday working from the perspective of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and benefit will reduce the amount of jobseeker&rsquo;s payable to casual workers and thereby encourage workers to take up offers of full-time employment rather than combining part-time employment with social welfare payments.  <\/p><p>  In a further effort to improve the financial incentive to take up employment, the Government has halved the lower rate of PRSI until end-2013 on jobs that pay up to &euro;356 per week and exempted low-paid, part-time and seasonal workers with an annual income of less than &euro;10,036 from the Universal Social Charge (increased from &euro;4,004).<\/p><p>  The Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare is examining issues around the operation and interaction of the tax and social welfare systems and may also recommend further measures to improve incentives to take up employment.<\/p><p>- Second, the Government is incentivising employers to hire the long-term unemployed.  The Government has introduced a range of reforms and incentives to support, protect and create jobs, including through the Jobs Initiative in May 2011 which among other measures reduced VAT rates for labour intensive sectors.  The Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme is available to employers who hire persons who have been in receipt of specified social welfare payments for a period of six months or more and the Revenue Tax Assist Scheme is available to employers who hire a person in receipt of those benefits for in excess of 12 months.

The volume of FIS claims on hands and the delays in processing are a consequence of continued strong claim intake.<\/p><p>  An in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project has recently been completed for the FIS scheme.  This project focused on optimising output and customer service and the elimination of backlogs.

This plan sees the normal weekly new claim and renewal intake processed without delay while the backlog is ring-fenced and a focused team assigned to this work with a clear plan for its elimination.<\/p><p>  The first steps taken to permanently eliminate future backlogs in FIS are to put in place sufficient capacity and suitable structures and processes to deal with the weekly intake of work.  This has been done in the case of the FIS scheme and the first week of operation has been very successful in this regard, achieving its target output.<\/p><p>  This is not to say that the backlog of claims awaiting decision is being ignored or that work has ceased on it.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  <\/p><p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for the State pension (contributory) easier by disregarding time spent out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme was introduced in and took effect from 1994.   Eligibility for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is conditional on firstly meeting the standard qualifying conditions for State pension. <\/p><p>  Backdating the scheme to 1964 would involve considerable costs.  An analysis undertaken in the 2007 Green Paper on Pensions identified that to backdate the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme to 1953, the year when the unified system of social insurance was introduced in Ireland, would cost the Exchequer in the region of &euro;160m and to 1973\/73, an estimated  &euro;150m.  Costs in relation to this scheme under the current rules, are expected to increase in the coming years due to the increase in female employment rates since 1994. <\/p><p>  In relation to income support, Ireland&rsquo;s pensioners have the lowest consistent poverty rate and are least likely to be at risk of poverty compared to other groups - pointing to the adequacy of the State pension.  Between 2004 and 2010, consistent poverty for older people (those over 65) fell from 3.3% to 0.9%.  The &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate for people in that age group fell from 27.1% to 9.6% over the same period.<\/p><p>  The recently published review of the Social Insurance Fund identified that in the medium to long term, pension related expenditure will account for an increasing proportion of the Social Insurance Fund expenditure - rising from 57% in 2011 to 85% in 2066.    The pensioner support ratio is projected to decline from 5.3 workers for every individual over pension age in 2010 to 3.9 workers by 2020 and to 2.1 workers by 2060. <\/p><p>  In terms of value for money for those who take time out of the workforce, the report confirms that social insurance benefits offer excellent value for money for those:<\/p><p>- on the lower part of the income distribution,<\/p><p>- those with shorter contribution histories, mostly women<\/p><p>- and the self-employed.  <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the changes in the contribution rules and associated rates of payment which were introduced in September 2012, those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories, will continue to obtain the best value for money from the Fund.  This can be of particular benefit to women.  <\/p><p>  In relation to the marriage bar, it should be noted that women affected by the marriage bar are public servants who would not be eligible for the homemakers scheme due to the type of PRSI being paid by them at the time of leaving the workforce. It should be noted that women who do not qualify for a full rate pension may, if their spouse is in receipt of a State pension contributory, receive a qualified adult payment at a higher rate where they satisfy a means test.   <\/p><p>  A State pension non-contributory pension, which is a means tested payment, may also be payable.  Time taken out of the workforce for homemaking and caring duties will continue to be protected by the current disregard.  While my Department will keep the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme under review, any improvements which could result in further costs for the Exchequer could only be considered in a budgetary context.  The Government&rsquo;s priority is to secure economic recovery, promote growth and employment.  To this end, the State must pursue a determined deficit reduction strategy.  Accordingly, there will be an on-going requirement to curtail expenditure in 2013 and in later years. <\/p><p>  The Government is considering the appropriate level of expenditure on the wide variety of schemes and services operated by my Department in 2013 in the context of the forthcoming Budget. The outcome will be announced on Budget Day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRN01900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Welfare Services","counter":645,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRN01950"},{"type":"question","counter":646,"qnumday":340,"qnumall":"[50929\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRN02000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reasons for the closing of the community welfare clinic in the Third Age Centre in Summerhill (details supplied) and to detail the way those with restricted mobility or living in poverty can access similar services.","asker":"1080","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":647,"qnumday":341,"qnumall":"[50930\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRN02100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the cost of maintaining the community welfare clinic in the Third Age Centre in Summerhill (details supplied) and to details any savings generated from its proposed closure.","asker":"1080","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":648,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 340 and 341 together.<\/p><p>  My Department is very conscious of the need to provide efficient and effective customer services at a local level for all customers of the Department, having regard to the resources that are available.

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.  The estimated expenditure on child benefit for 2012 is around &euro;2 billion and it is paid to around 600,000 families in respect of some 1.15 million children. <\/p><p>  Parents of multiple birth children receive an additional monthly premia paid at one and a half times the monthly child benefit payment rate for each twin and double the monthly payment rate for each child in other multiple births. While Budget 2012 maintained this additional monthly payment, the multiple births grant of &euro;635 paid at birth, at 4 years of age and at 12 years of age was discontinued. <\/p><p>  As a universal payment child benefit assists parents with the cost of raising children and it contributes towards alleviating child poverty. The Government is also conscious that child benefit is an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment. Bearing this in mind, any plans to change the amount paid in respect of such payments will be a matter to be decided in a budgetary context and announced on Budget day.  I do not therefore propose to speculate on any possible approaches to child benefit payment rates changes.  <\/p><p>  With regard to the application process for child benefit, when a parent registers the birth of their child the Department of Social Protection will initiate a child benefit claim. In cases where the parent is not claiming child benefit for another child, such as their first child, a partially completed form is sent to the parent to sign in order to claim the payment. In cases where the parent is claiming child benefit for another child, the new child is added to the child benefit claim and payment begins automatically from the month after the birth. A letter confirming payment is then sent to the parent by the Department. If a parent does not wish to claim their child benefit payment, they can notify the Department in writing to that effect and their claim will be stopped in accordance with their wishes. <\/p><p>  I am conscious that achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including child benefit, raises complex issues about the effectiveness of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment incentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area.

The disallowance\/disqualification grounds, and reason\/s for same, are outlined clearly and are sufficient to enable the appellant to lodge an appeal.<\/p><p>  Persons are advised, in their decision letters, of their right to seek a departmental review of the initial decision and are advised as to how to lodge an appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).<\/p><p>  Where a review is sought, the deciding officer re-examines the case and, taking account of any new facts or evidence, may revise his\/ her decision.<\/p><p>  In 2011, 42% of favourable decisions made following lodgement of appeal applications, were as a result of deciding officers revising their original decisions, which obviated the need for claimants to go through the full appeals process.  These revised decisions arose as a result, in most cases, of new facts or fresh evidence produced by the claimant after the original decision on his\/her claim.  The figures illustrate that the review process is well understood and utilised.<\/p><p>  Customers may provide new information\/evidence at appeal stage, in particular during oral hearings, which may not have been available to the deciding officer at review stage, and could result in a revised decision by an appeals officer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRO00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Applications","counter":684,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRO00850"},{"type":"question","counter":685,"qnumday":356,"qnumall":"[51012\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRO00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide an update on the proposed transfer of some of the administration of rent supplement to county councils, and if she has given further consideration to the payment of rent supplement directly to the landlord as a default option.","asker":"1011","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":686,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 356 and 406 together. <\/p><p>  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 89,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;436 million in 2012.<\/p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant.  Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.  There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.<\/p><p>  However, rent supplement payments can, at the request of the tenant and with the agreement of the Department, be paid directly to the landlord.  If the Department were to introduce a system whereby all rent supplement payments were to be made directly to landlords the efficiency of the scheme would be significantly affected.  For example, the Department would potentially have to create a formal relationship with some 89,000 additional clients, the landlords.  This would involve greater complexity and significant resources to deal with a new set of third parties.  It would not be an effective use of resources to have departmental staff negotiating rental agreements for those with a short term need.<\/p><p>  The Government has effectively two initiatives to deal with long term reliance on rent supplement.  The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is in operation since 2004 and the new Housing Policy Initiative as announced by my colleagues the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Housing &amp; Planning on 16th June 2011.<\/p><p>  In March 2012, the Government approved in principle to transfer responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from my Department, currently provided through rent supplement, to housing authorities using a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Among the main features of HAP is that landlords will be paid directly by the local authority.<\/p><p>  A multi-agency steering group has been established to develop proposals to give effect to this transfer.  The group is chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and consists of representatives from the Departments of Social Protection; Public Expenditure and Reform; Office of the Revenue Commissioners; the County and City Managers Association, and the Housing Agency.  It is planned that pilot testing of HAP arrangements will commence during the second half of 2013 with general roll out and commencement of transfers from January 2014. <\/p><p>  The new arrangements will achieve a key Government commitment of removing barriers to employment and at the same time returning rent supplement to its original purpose of a short-term income support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRO01000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":687,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRO01050"},{"type":"question","counter":688,"qnumday":357,"qnumall":"[51023\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRO01100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will expedite an application for carer's allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":689,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance from the person in question on the 25th October 2012.

With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.<\/p><p>  The National Broadband Plan, which I published recently, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.<\/p><p>  The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country &ndash; specifically:<\/p><p>- 70Mbps &ndash; 100Mbps will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015;<\/p><p>- At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% (and potentially as much as 35%) of the population during the lifetime of the Government; and <\/p><p>- A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country, also during the lifetime of the Government.<\/p><p>  During the preparation of the Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.<\/p><p>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&rsquo; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this mapping exercise.<\/p><p>  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  Until that process is complete, the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention will not be known.<\/p><p>  I would reiterate however, that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including Loughshinny, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRR02800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":883,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRR02900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Industry","counter":882,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRR02850"},{"type":"question","counter":883,"qnumday":430,"qnumall":"[51101\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRR02900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"with reference to motor trade plates which cost &euro;330, his views on the status of Republic of Ireland trade plates in Northern Ireland and on confiscations in Northern Ireland of cars with legitimate Republic of Ireland trade plates; if in view of the fact that motor trade in this State can involve travel through Northern Ireland; if he will raise this matter at an upcoming meeting of the North South Ministerial Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"997","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":884,"content":"<p>The legislation in relation to trade plates is provided in section 21 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1992 and the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 1992.<\/p><p>  Trade plates can be used by motor dealers in very limited circumstances in respect of vehicles on which a vehicle licence has not been taken out.

The SLAs will identify the levels of performance expected and resources available, along with the relevant responsibilities and expectations necessary to enable the required services.

The two principal sources of revenue for the Local Government Fund are the proceeds of motor tax and the income from the Household Charge. The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides that income from the charge is to be paid into the Local Government Fund. The proceeds from the household charge are being re-distributed on an equalised basis to local authorities within the context of the annual allocations of general purpose g rants. General purpose grants contribute towards meeting the reasonable cost to local authorities of providing services to their customers. Some &euro;651m in general purpose grants had been allocated to local authorities for 2012. It has been necessary for me to reduce general purpose grant funding to local authorities in the third quarter of 2012 in light of the level of compliance with the household charge.<\/p><p>It is estimated that there are some 1.6 million residential properties potentially liable for the household charge. As such, if collected in full, the household charge has the potential to raise &euro;160 million annually. As of 16 of November 2012 some &euro;107.7 m or over 66% had been collected nationally. A total of &euro;15,695,292 was withheld from the Quarter 3 general purpose grant payment. For county and city councils, this represented a reduction of between 1% and 3% of the total general purpose grant allocation for 2012.<\/p><p>Local authorities can maintain the remainder of their general purpose grant allocation for 2012 through improved household charge compliance. Those authorities achieving a collection rate of 65% nationally will not have a further reduction in their final quarter general purpose grant payment. Local authorities achieving a collection rate of 60-65% will incur a further reduction of 0.5%, while those authorities achieving a compliance rate below 60% will incur a further 1% reduction in their annual allocation.<\/p><p>I am confident that the level of general purpose grants together with other Government grants and subsidies, and income raised from local sources, is appropriate to meet the costs of providing a reasonable level of local authority services to communities.<\/p><p>The information requested is set out in the following table.<\/p><p><table><tr><th><div>Local Authority <\/div><\/th><th><div>Allocation 2011 <br \/>&#8364; <\/div><\/th><th><div>Allocation 2012 <br \/>&#8364; <\/div><\/th><th><div>Quarter 3 2012 Reduction <br \/>&#8364; <\/div><\/th><th><div>Revised 2012 Allocation <br \/>&#8364; <\/div><\/th><th><div>% Reduction in 2012 <\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council <\/div><\/td><td><div>31,522,005 <\/div><\/td><td><div>25,780,316 <\/div><\/td><td><div>343,583 <\/div><\/td><td><div>25,436,733 <\/div><\/td><td><div>1.3% <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Fingal County Council <br \/><\/div><\/td><td><div>26,267,018 <\/div><\/td><td><div>20,455,071 <\/div><\/td><td><div>545,285 <\/div><\/td><td><div>19,909,786 <\/div><\/td><td><div>2.7% <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>South Dublin County Council <\/div><\/td><td><div>21,709,971 <\/div><\/td><td><div>16,963,904 <\/div><\/td><td><div>475,210 <\/div><\/td><td><div>16,488,694 <\/div><\/td><td><div>2.8% <\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRS02000","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Government Reform","counter":931,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRS02050"},{"type":"question","counter":932,"qnumday":449,"qnumall":"[51178\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRS02100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he intends to change Section 129 of the Local Government Act 2001 to facilitate the disbanding of the county development board in each local authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":933,"qnumday":450,"qnumall":"[51179\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRS02200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the powers that county managers have to amend or disband the following agencies which are structures or sub-structures of the county development boards, county childcare committees, joint policing committees and volunteer centres; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":934,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 449 and 450 together.<\/p><p>  The reforms set out in <i>Putting People First<\/i> will result in changes to current local governance arrangements and include, <i>inter alia<\/i>, the wind-down of City\/County Development Boards.

This total is unchanged from 2011. Applications from nineteen eligible organisations, that is, charities that operate lotteries that were established before 1997, are currently being processed by the Department of Justice and Equality and payments will be made later this year. The total funding available under the Scheme will begin to reduce in 2013 and will be gradually decreased over a period of three years after which the scheme will be discontinued. Recipient organisations were advised of this in early October, in effect giving them more than 12 months notice of this change. The decision to wind down this Scheme has been taken in the context of the requirement for all Government Departments to meet exacting savings targets in the years ahead.<\/p><p>  Funding disbursed under the Charitable Lotteries Scheme is drawn from both the National Lottery surplus and exchequer funding. The Scheme was set up in 1997 to supplement the incomes of charitable organisations that were operating lotteries in competition with the National Lottery. Approximately &euro;114 million has been disbursed under the Scheme since its inception. The amount each organisation receives is determined in proportion to its gross annual sales of relevant lottery products. The criteria for the Scheme do not take account of either the profitability of the lottery or the proportion of the revenue it generates that reaches the charitable cause in whose name the products are sold.  This means that the scheme has not provided any incentive for charities to operate lotteries with a low cost base or to ensure that a high proportion of the revenue generated goes directly to the cause with which the ticket is identified. Such a Scheme can no longer be justified in the current circumstances.<\/p><p>  The gradual phasing out of the Scheme will yield savings of &euro;11 million over the three year period 2013-2015, with a further saving of &euro;6 million each year after 2015 when no further payments will be made. The level of assistance is being reduced gradually in order to minimise the impact on the organisations affected and to afford them an opportunity to consider appropriate action they could take to generate greater net profit from their fundraising activities and to make such changes as they consider beneficial.<\/p><p>  In this context, I am also considering an increase to the current limits on private lottery prizes under the Gaming and Lotteries Act of 1956.  I have asked organisations in receipt of funding under the Charitable Lotteries Scheme to consider this issue and have invited them to make a submission to my Department.

The basic position is that an &#8216;additional increment&#8217; is paid over and above the 21-year pension for each additional year of service above 21 years to a maximum of 31 years.  However, this additional element ceases to be payable when an individual reaches social welfare State Pension age.   <\/p><p>  The detailed position is as follows:  Under the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces Pension Schemes, the minimum service required for an immediate pension and lump sum in the case of NCOs and Privates is 21 years, regardless of age.  Maximum benefits accrue after 31 years.  The 21-year pension consists of the following elements:<\/p><p>(a)a basic flat-rate pension that varies according to rank (&#8364;12,913.19 p.a. for a Corporal as in the specific case of the person referred to); <i>plus<\/i><\/p><p>(b)an addition in respect of military service allowance (MSA) equal to 40% of the MSA rate where discharged since August 1990 (equal to &#8364;2,536.16 p.a. in this case); and<\/p><p>(c)if applicable, fixed % additions to (a) in respect of certain other qualifying payments (e.g. 3% extra for Technician Pay in his specific case). <\/p><p>  All of the above elements are payable for the person&#8217;s lifetime.  However, an &#8216;additional increment&#8217; is also payable at a flat rate for each year of service in excess of 21 years up to a maximum of 31 years. This increment is increased, where appropriate, by the top-up at (c).  Where maximum pensionable service is 31 or more years, as applies in this instance, the MSA top-up is 50% of the rate of MSA (rather than 40%).  In this specific case, his additional increment (inclusive of the top-up at (c)) amounted to &#8364;4,804.84 p.a.  However, this ceases to be payable when the pensioner reaches the qualifying age of 66 under the Social Welfare code for a State Pension Contributory, or if they become entitled to a State Pension (Transition) at the earlier age of 65.  At the same time, the 50% MSA top-up reverts to the 40% rate.<\/p><p>  I am advised that these arrangements are in accordance with the long established principle of integrating occupational pensions with Social Insurance benefits of employees who are in full PRSI class.  This includes NCOs and Privates, who are fully insured for the range of benefits under the Social Welfare Acts such as the State Pension.  &#8216;Integration' means that a person&#8217;s entitlement to Social Insurance benefits such as the State Pension is taken into account when calculating the rate of occupational pension payable.  In effect, integration results in a reduced rate of occupational pension than would otherwise be the case.  In the public service generally, the practical effect of integration is that the maximum occupational pension is 50% of pensionable pay <i>less<\/i> the maximum personal rate of State Pension (Contributory) applicable at retirement date.  The State Pension etc. is regarded as part of the overall pension package payable to the individual.  The occupational pension integrated (combined) with the State Pension makes up the &#8216;total pension&#8217; for full PRSI contributors in the public service. The integration principle applies right across the public service and, indeed, in many areas of the private sector as well as in other countries.<\/p><p>  When the person in question retired on 1 February 2007 (at age 60) from the Defence Forces he had accrued the maximum pensionable service of 31 years and, on that basis, qualified for a significantly higher pension than if he had left after 21 years service.  From that date up until the eve of his 65<sup>th<\/sup> birthday (31 January 2012), his military pension included the additional increment for 31 years&#8217; service and the corresponding MSA top-up, on that date giving a pension rate of &#8364;20,719.08 a year.  On turning 65 (1 February 2012), he qualified for the State Pension (Transition).  In accordance with the arrangements mentioned, the additional elements in respect of his service for 22 &#8211; 31 years ceased to be payable from that date.  Since then, his revised military pension rate has been &#8364;15,606.55 a year, a reduction of &#8364;5,112.53.  These are the gross rates in his case after application of the &#8216;Public Service Pension Reduction&#8217; introduced under emergency legislation in 2011 (the actual amount of which itself has been reduced in this person&#8217;s case by virtue of his lower military pension rate).<\/p><p>  The maximum personal rate of State Pension is currently &#8364;230.30 a week (if under age 80).  This is considerably greater than the actual reduction of &#8364;97.98 a week in this person&#8217;s case under the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces&#8217; pension arrangements on his qualification for the State Pension at age 65.  Indeed, his current combined weekly pension of &#8364;529.39 (i.e. Defence Forces pension of &#8364;299.09 <i>plus<\/i> State Pension of &#8364;230.30) represents a one-third increase on what he was getting alone from his military pension before turning 65.<\/p><p>  The method of integration for these military pensioners is considerably less severe than in other areas of the public service.  This is because elsewhere generally, the integration mechanism begins from the time an occupational pension comes into payment and, as I have already indicated, it effectively caps at 50% of pensionable pay the combined value of the occupational pension plus State pension.  In contrast, for retired pre-April 2004 enlisted personnel such as the person referred to, integration as outlined above does not actually apply at all until the social welfare State Pension becomes payable at age 65 \/ 66.  This could be some (or many) years after the person concerned had retired on pension from the Defence Forces.  Even then, at age 65\/66, the Defence Forces pension plus State Pension actually exceeds the public service maximum of 50% of pensionable pay.  In effect, these military pensioners have what amounts to a partial, and more favourable, form of integration.<\/p><p>  The general issue of integration of occupational pensions in the public service was examined by the <i>Commission on Public Service Pensions. <\/i>  Its final report, published in November 2000, was considered and broadly accepted by Government.  The Commission accepted that integration is a fundamental component in the public service pension framework and was strongly of the view that it should be continued. It did not make any recommendations that would affect the current integration arrangements applicable to retired NCOs and Privates covered by the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces pensions schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRU03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":1060,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRU03200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"&Iacute;oca&iacute;ochta&iacute; Deontais","counter":1059,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRU03150"},{"type":"question","counter":1060,"qnumday":495,"qnumall":"[50858\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRU03200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"c&eacute;n f&aacute;th a nd&uacute;radh le feilmeoir (sonra&iacute; tugtha) nach n-&iacute;ocfa&iacute; &eacute; go dt&iacute; an bhliain seo chugainn faoin sc&eacute;im disadvantage area agus single farm payment; c&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach ndearnadh cigireacht ar a fheilm n&iacute;os t&uacute;isce i mbliana; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1061,"content":"<p>Is iarratas&oacute;ir &eacute; an duine ainmnithe faoi Sc&eacute;im na hAon&iacute;oca&iacute;ochta agus Sc&eacute;im na Limist&eacute;ar faoi Mh&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste.

That National Programme also funded a range of other schemes not included in the OP.  The modest level of EFF co-funding available to Ireland for the period 2007-2013, &euro;42 million over 7 years, meant that all investment needs for the sector could not be included in the OP. A decision was taken by the previous Government to allocate the available co-funding to certain programmes and to fund others from the Exchequer.<\/p><p>In their Interim Evaluation Report conducted in 2011, Fitzpatrick Associates noted the changed economic circumstances facing Ireland since the OP was originally drafted and the impacts this was likely to have on availability of Exchequer funding for measures included within the National Programme.  Fitzpatrick Associates also noted that the measures included in the OP were not likely to be sufficient to draw down the full &euro;42 million allocation from the EFF.  They recommended the amendment of the OP to include most of the measures previously included in the National Programme, to ensure availability of supports to these important areas of the seafood sector and to ensure full draw down of EFF funds.  The recommendations were accepted and a revised OP was submitted to the European Commission in March 2012.  That revised OP must be adopted by Commission Decision and that is awaited.  The revised OP will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website immediately after its adoption.  However, it is important to note that the measures included in the revised OP took effect immediately following its submission to the Commission.<\/p><p>The Interim Evaluation Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:<\/p><p><i>http:\/\/www.agriculture.gov.ie\/fisheries\/seafoodpolicydevelopment\/seafooddevelopmentinireland2007-2013\/<\/i><\/p><p>I have no information available to me on the timing of submission to, or approval by, the European Commission of other Member State&rsquo;s Operational Programmes.  The process of developing a new OP for the period 2014 to 2020 will commence shortly.  The EU Regulation on the new European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) is still under negotiation as part of the CFP reforms.  That Regulation will specify the areas of the seafood sector that may be supported in the next programming period and will specify the criteria that will determine how much of the EMFF fund will be available to Ireland.  These two issues will be central in shaping the new OP.  Consultation with stakeholders will form an important part of the process for preparing the new OP.<\/p><p>EU rules do not permit the carrying over of allocations from one programming period to the next, so strictly speaking no funds were carried over from the previous FIFG fund.  However, depending on the level of drawdown of funds under the programme, the rules do allow for eligible expenditure after the programming period.  This is referred to as N+2.  This was the case with the transition period between the FIFG and the EFF, where expenditure under the FIFG continued for a certain period after 2006.  This may also be the case with the transition period between the EFF and the EMFF.<\/p><p>The 2011 Annual Implementation Report for the Seafood Development Operational Programme 2007-2013 shows that approximately &euro;28 million of the &euro;42 million EFF allocation had been committed up to the end of 2011.  As processing and aquaculture did not become part of the OP until 2012, this spend can be attributed to the catching sector.  The majority of this spend was accounted for by the 2008 Decommissioning Scheme.  Up to 2011, BIM was the implementing agency for all elements of the OP, so all funds spent were disbursed through BIM.<\/p><p>Approximately &euro;14 million of EFF funds remains to be committed over the period from 2012 onwards.  That period may extend up to 2015, if the N+2 rule is invoked.  The table below indicates the breakdown of allocations by EFF priority axis.  These priority axes are specified in the EFF Regulation (1198\/2006).  It is important to note that the Exchequer must provide matching funding, generally at the same level as the EFF contribution.  Beneficiaries must also provide private funding.  The level of private funding required varies from one scheme to another.  Priority Axis 1 includes decommissioning and fleet safety, axis 2 includes marketing, processing and aquaculture, axis 3 includes marine environmental measures, axis 4 includes coastal area development and axis 5 covers technical assistance (implementation costs).

The water services authorities have regard to the Code of Practice on the Fluoridation of Drinking Water 2007 published by the Expert Body on Fluorides and Health to ensure effective and efficient implementation of the technical aspects of the fluoridation of drinking water. The water services authorities also measure the quantity of hydrofluosilicic acid used plus the quantity of water treated in order to calculate the concentration of hydrofluosilicic acid in the water.  The HSE undertakes monthly sampling of tap water and can access the daily records of the water services authorities if an issue arises regarding fluoridation levels.<\/p><p>  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) collects and analyses the monitoring results carried out by water services authorities on drinking water supplies. The most recent EPA report on 'The Provision and Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland' (2010) includes information on water supplies where fluoride parametric values are exceeded. Of the 3,398 samples from public water supplies which were analysed, 74 were above the Irish statutory requirements of 0.8mg\/litre. All but one of these elevated levels was below the EU standard of 1.5mg\/litre. The EPA is not required to collect data where fluoride parametric values is below the statutory requirement. I have asked the HSE to collate this information and I will forward it to the Deputy when it is available.<\/p><p>  Hydrofluosilicic acid is used to fluoridate public water supplies.

All of these publications are in the public domain.<\/p><p>  The balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and continues to be safe and effective in protecting the oral health of all age groups.

Under UHI, everyone will have equal access to a comprehensive package of curative services.  The key changes required to support the reform programme which will pave the way for the introduction of universal health insurance are outlined in the provisions of \"Future Health:  A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012 - 2015\" which was published by the Minister for Health on 15 November 2012.  Earlier this year I appointed Professor John Higgins to chair a Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups. Work is continuing on finalising a Draft Report on the recommendations for submission to the Strategic Board. The Report will be submitted to me when the Board have signed off on it and in turn, I will then bring it to Cabinet.<\/p><p>  Another key building block for UHI is the development of a 'Money Follows the Patient' funding model to replace the current block grant allocation system.  Under 'Money follows the Patient', providers will be paid for the needs they address, the quantity and quality of the services they provide and the outcomes they deliver. They will be liberated, subject to overall budgetary ceilings, to pursue the most cost-effective means of achieving this standard of performance.  Once the key building blocks have been put in place, it will be possible to proceed with implementation of UHI.  Hospitals will then become independent, not-for-profit trusts with managers accountable to their boards. As a precursor to this, it is intended to integrate hospitals into groups on a collaborative administrative basis.<\/p><p>  The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients. As part of the drive to ensure real accountability, an annual budget and employment ceiling will be developed for each group.  Groups will also have the authority to deploy and re-deploy staff across hospitals within the group; this will help to alleviate problems that have arisen in the past in relation to the equitable distribution of health care staff across all hospital sites.  Before Hospital Trusts are finally established, the make-up and functioning of the Groups will be reviewed and if changes prove necessary then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRZ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Service Executive Savings","counter":1324,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRZ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1325,"qnumday":584,"qnumall":"[50997\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRZ00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Health Service Executive tendering process for payroll services will be offered only to Irish service providers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1014","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1326,"content":"<p>One of the key commitments in the Public Service Reform Plan is to identify and evaluate new business models and opportunities to support the delivery of non-core processes and services.

In 2010 and 2011, the annual TB notification rates in Ireland were 9.2 per 100,000 (420 cases in 2010 and 424 cases in 2011) which is the lowest rate recorded since surveillance of TB began in the 1950s and now categorise Ireland as a low incidence country and represents a drop from 11.3 per 100,000 (480 cases) in 2007.The number of TB notifications for 2012 up to week ending November 9th is 339 cases, which is a decrease of 49 cases compared to the same period in 2011 (388 cases).<\/p><p>  The overall rate of tuberculosis continues to decline and this decrease has prompted a review in the HSE of the continuing requirement for BCG which is currently in progress.<\/p><p>  WHO data indicates that TB notification rates always tend to be higher in inner city locations compared to the general population as is reflected in all major cities worldwide. The rates of TB remain high in parts of inner city Dublin and North Dublin, ranging between 17 per 100,000 to 30 per 100,000 in some areas.However, LHO 7 (comprising mainly Dublin 1 and 7) has shown a decline in rates of TB from 2010 when the rate was 22.9 per 100,000 population (31 cases) to a rate of 14 per 100,000 (19 cases) in 2011. In 2011 a prison outbreak in Dublin increased the TB rate in that local area to 28\/100,000.<\/p><p>  Homeless people are at increased risk of TB, have higher default rates and worse treatment outcomes (including mortality) than the general public. In many industrialised countries, TB rates among the homeless can be up to 20 times higher than the general population.TB has also increased in other marginalised groups such as prisoners and those involved in substance misuse. <\/p><p>  Similar to other low prevalence countries in Europe the disease is more focussed in marginalised groups such as homeless, prisoners, substance misusers, immigrants from countries of high endemicity.

Under this system, most beds are either designated as public beds or private beds: there is a small number of non-designated beds, such as those in Intensive Care Units.  Under the current  framework, private in-patients who occupy public beds in public hospitals are not levied the daily maintenance charge, which ranges from &euro;586 to &euro;1,046 in most public hospitals. <\/p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General reported in 2010 that 45% of in-patients treated privately by their consultants were not charged for their maintenance costs because they were not occupying designated private beds. As part of Budget 2012, I announced that I intended to bring forward legislation to provide for the charging of all private patients in public hospitals, irrespective of whether they occupied a public or a private bed.   In view of  the significant potential cost implications for private health insurers, I subsequently indicated that I would be prepared to postpone implementation of the legislation until 2013 provided that the funds targeted for the current year were raised through a system of improved cashflow from the private insurers.

These operational efficiencies include the removal of on-call arrangements in rosters, where ambulance staff are not actually on duty in ambulance stations or vehicle but may be contacted in the event of a 999 call.  This means that it could take over 20 minutes for an emergency ambulance to leave its station after the crew has been tasked. All parties have accepted that, in accordance with a Labour Court recommendation, providing ambulance services under on-call arrangements should cease. <\/p><p>  The NAS is not a static service. It deploys its resources in a dynamic manner and works on an area and national, rather than a local, basis.  The dynamic deployment of ambulance resources ensures that the nearest appropriate resource is mobilised to the location of any incident, including incidents in the greater Dublin area.  In this context, any removal of overtime inefficiencies will be addressed through more efficient deployment and utilisation of resources.<\/p><p>  As the details of rostering policy for the ambulance service, including details of any regional variation are, operational matters for the HSE, this question has been forwarded to the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRAA04400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":1446,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRBB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1447,"qnumday":626,"qnumall":"[51470\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRBB00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way he intends to ensure that plans by the Health Service Executive to reconfigure therapy resources such as speech therapy, occupational therapy, and physiotherapy into geographic-based teams will not adversely affect children in special schools in view of the fact that it means that therapists in special schools will now have to travel to mainstream schools; if he will address concerns that this will lead to a reduction in the level of service to children in special schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1448,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has recognised the need to increase the level of consistency and standardisation in the way both early intervention services and services for school-aged children with disabilities are delivered and to this end is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of existing therapy resources to geographic based teams for children (0-18 years).<\/p><p>  The National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years) has been established since 2010.  It is supported by a National Coordinating Group which has representatives from the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills in addition to other key stakeholders. The Programme is based on the recommendations of the <i>Report of the National Reference Group on Multidisciplinary Services for Children aged 5-18 Years<\/i>   produced by representatives of the professions and management involved in delivering multi-disciplinary services to children (available on the HSE website www.hse.ie.) <\/p><p>  The Programme aims to address the following issues in relation to children&#8217;s disability services:<\/p><p>- Inequity of access to services due to inconsistent development of services;<\/p><p>- Environmental change arising from the reorientation towards mainstream education leading to increasing demand for health services to support inclusion;<\/p><p>- Increasing demand for services due to population growth and increased identification of children with disability;<\/p><p>- The need to re-align services with emerging primary care and integrated service structures.<\/p><p>  While the Programme supports the principle of providing access to mainstream education where appropriate, it also recognises a continuing role for special schools. <\/p><p>The Programme is rolling out at national, regional and local level and involves representatives from the health and education sectors, statutory and non-statutory service providers and parents working together to see how current services can best be re-organised.  Implementation of the Programme encompasses two elements:<\/p><p>- Ongoing work in co-ordinating and re-organising early intervention services for children aged 0-5 years into integrated, geographically based teams;<\/p><p>- Supporting the re-organisation of services for school-age children aged 5-18 years according to the same model.<\/p><p>  Decisions regarding any local re-organisation of services are the responsibility of the Local Implementation Groups (LIGs). These include stakeholders such as representatives of the service providers involved, parents and the educational sector representatives. Detailed local area action plans are being developed by the LIGs with the following objectives:<\/p><p>- One clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need;<\/p><p>- Resources used to the greatest benefit for all children and families;<\/p><p>- Health and education working together to support children to achieve their potential.<\/p><p>  The HSE is working very closely with the education sector, which is fully involved in the development of the Programme, to ensure that, from the children&#8217;s and parents&#8217; perspective, the services provided by each sector are integrated. An Education and Health Working Group, comprising representatives of both sectors, is developing a framework for closer working relationships.<\/p><p>  The long term goal of this Programme is to bring consistency in service delivery and a clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need. Implementation of this Programme will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services for all children requiring access to health related supports, regardless of where they live or which pre-school or school they attend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRBB00300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1449,"content":"<p>Question No. 627 answered with Question No. 624.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":1450,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRBB00450"},{"type":"question","counter":1451,"qnumday":628,"qnumall":"[51479\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRBB00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will expedite an appeal of a refusal of the renewal of a medical card in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1452,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRBB00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service","counter":1453,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRBB00650"},{"type":"question","counter":1454,"qnumday":629,"qnumall":"[51483\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRBB00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will give an assurance that the 24 hour ambulance service that operates out of Kenmare Community Hospital, County Kerry, will be retained in its present form in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1455,"content":"<p>The provision of ambulances is a matter for the National Ambulance Service, which are part of the Health Service Executive.

In this regard the Action Plan for Jobs (2012), and the Report of the  Research Prioritisation Steering Group, were published this year.  The aim is to target public investment towards research based on potential for economic return, particularly in the form of jobs; and protecting as much current employment while also creating jobs in new areas of opportunity.  <\/p><p>  I continue to stress that while the economic benefit of research is extremely important, it is imperative that the critical importance of research for policy and research for knowledge is recognised and supported.  Knowledge derived from research is  paramount in providing the evidence-base for better health policies and systems; systems that underpin effective and efficient health service provision.  Such evidence will be a key input to the creation of a fairer, more efficient health system.  <\/p><p>  In acknowledging the potential for research to support economic growth and job creation, I consider that the economic and societal agendas are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  The interaction and interdependence between research for health and research for economic purposes are evident in the research and innovation objectives supported by my Department.<\/p><p>  In 2009 the Action Plan for Health Research 2009-2013, prepared by the Health Research Group was launched.  The plan is in the implementation phase and Subgroups\/Work Streams established under the Health Research Group are progressing the actions therein.  The main purpose of the HRG, which is chaired by my Department, is to ensure that health research in Ireland is coordinated, prioritised, and focussed, and that national policies and strategies for health research are framed strategically in the context of the wider science, technology and innovation agenda.  <\/p><p>  The Health Research Board (HRB) is a statutory body under the aegis of the Department of Health.  The HRB is the lead agency in Ireland supporting and funding health research.  It provides funding, maintains health information systems and conducts research linked to national health priorities.  The aim is to improve people's health, build health research capacity and make a significant contribution to Ireland's knowledge economy.<\/p><p>  A robust clinical research infrastructure and established capacity and expertise are essential in developing and delivering health care.  Through strategic investment, the Health Research Board (HRB), funded by my Department, is developing infrastructure, expertise, and capacity to create an integrated framework for clinical research in Ireland.  This will not only improve patient outcomes, peoples health and health service delivery, but will support growth and jobs here in Ireland.  I opened a Clinical Research Facility in Cork earlier this year which is funded by the HRB.  In addition to this investment in Cork, the HRB is funding the establishment of two facilities in Dublin and Galway.  The Wellcome Trust is co-funding the build in Dublin. These three facilitates will network together using standardised practices and procedures in clinical research conduct thereby greatly increasing Ireland&rsquo;s appeal as a country of choice for performing large-scale multinational clinical research studies.<\/p><p>  The Health Information Bill, which my Department is progressing,  will provide for a range of measures including facilitating a uniform approach for ethics approval for multi site health research projects, not already otherwise governed by statutory regulation and EU law.  It is expected that the Health Information Bill will be ready for publication by mid 2013.<\/p><p>  During the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union key legislative proposals on Clinical Trials and Medical Devices will be progressed. <\/p><p>  My Department is also represented on the Prioritisation Action Group (PAG), established by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and chaired by Minister Sherlock to progress the Report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group.  It is evident that while much of the work being progressed in the area of health research may not necessarily lead to direct commercial opportunity, it can complement and support the work of other sectors in the economy.  <\/p><p>  Senior officials in my Department recently had a very positive meeting with representatives of the organisation mentioned by the Deputy at which health research policy was discussed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRCC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":1492,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRCC01475"},{"type":"question","counter":1493,"qnumday":643,"qnumall":"[51529\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRCC01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding an operation in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry;

The directive strongly promotes the principles of the three Rs (replacement of the use of animals to the greatest extent possible with alternative testing methods, refinement of scientific procedures to improve animal welfare and reduction in numbers of animals used).  Significant changes in this regard are requirements to perform ethical evaluations prior to authorisation of projects using animals and higher standards of care and accommodation.  Many of the provisions set out in the directive are mandatory.  The directive will be transposed into Irish law during November, 2012 and will take effect from 1 January, 2013.  <\/p><p>  My Department sought the views of the public and interested parties in July, 2009 on the proposed directive.  These views informed Ireland&rsquo;s position as negotiations on the proposed directive progressed at EU level.  My Department again sought the views of the public and interested parties in October, 2011 after the adoption of the directive.  Officials of my Department have met with stakeholder groups including animal welfare groups in relation to the Directive's provisions.  My Department has recently met with consultants of the Irish Anti Vivisection Society and with Research and Development establishments in this area.  The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) has also had meetings with stakeholders to inform them of the requirements which will apply from 1 January 2013 and has updated its website with relevant information. <\/p><p>  I appreciate the time and effort devoted by individuals and stakeholder groups in this regard.  The submissions received in response to the first public consultation were particularly welcome as the directive was still under discussion at that stage.  The second public consultation, of necessity, had a different focus given that the directive was already finalised at that stage.  The responses to the second public consultation are, consequently, primarily focused on the nuts and bolts of the transposition process itself and are of particular assistance to the Department in this regard.<\/p><p>  On the matter of scrutiny of the Directive, in July 2009, my Department provided an information note to the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny on the then proposed directive and indicated that the transposition of the directive would be done by Statutory Instrument in order to ensure that this transposition would be implemented within the allowed timeframe.  Failure to do so could delay the considerably enhanced protections the new directive provides for animals - a circumstance which animal protection organisations would, quite correctly, take issue with.  It could also result in EU infringement proceedings against the State during the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the European Union.  I am sure the Deputy would agree that it is important to transpose the considerably enhanced protections afforded to animals in the directive without delay. The joint committee, after consideration of the proposed directive, agreed that no further scrutiny was required, given that the aim of the proposal is to improve the existing 1986 directive and in view of the scope allowed in the directive for member states to decide on practical transposition measures. <\/p><p>  In the run up to the implementation of the directive, the Department and the IMB, which is the designated competent authority responsible for the implementation of the directive, will continue to consider the views of stakeholder groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRCC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1505,"content":"<p>Question No. 647 answered with Question No. 566.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Orthodontic Services","counter":1506,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRDD00250"},{"type":"question","counter":1507,"qnumday":648,"qnumall":"[51577\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000054#WRDD00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress made to date to reduce waiting lists for orthodontic treatment in the mid west region (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1508,"content":"<p>An independent review of Orthodontic Services has been commissioned by the HSE.

Any further extension of the fiscal consolidation timeframe would most likely mean a higher peak debt ratio and more of the State&rsquo;s resources going towards debt servicing costs.  Both the debt and debt servicing costs are at a very high level already.  It is important they are stabilised and then reduced as quickly as possible.  The State entered into excessive deficit in 2008.  Based on the current plan, the State will be in excessive deficit for seven years, coming out of it only in 2015.  This is a long period of time to be running deficits in excess of 3% of GDP.  The Government is of the view that a 2015 deadline for correcting the deficit strikes the right balance between allowing the economic recovery to take hold but at the same time restoring sustainability to the public finances in a phased, timely manner.  The current consolidation strategy is delivering on its main aim of reducing the deficit and Government is of the view that it would not be wise to change course at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000057#WRF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Remuneration","counter":1666,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000057#WRF01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1667,"qnumday":200,"qnumall":"[51153\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000057#WRF01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 44 on 7 November 2012, if he will provide the salary paid to the Chief Executive Officer of the National Asset Management Agency, Mr Brendan McDonagh in each of the calendar years 2009, 2010, 2011 and an estimate for the full year 2012; and if he will provide a listing and quantification of any additional benefits paid; and in respect of any expenses allowance, if he will confirm if such allowances are paid only in respect of vouched and receipted expenditure.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":1668,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[51154\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000057#WRF01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 46 on 7 November 2012, if he will confirm if the Chief Executive Officer of the National Asset Management Agency, Mr Brendan McDonagh, is employed on a temporary contract; the date on which this contract was entered into; the termination date of this contract; and if he will quantify any termination payments provided for under the contract.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":1669,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[51155\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000057#WRF01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 46 on 7 November 2012, if the Chief Executive Officer of the National Asset Management Agency Mr Brendan McDonagh is employed on a continuing or permanent contract and if he will quantify any termination payments provided for under the contract.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":1670,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 200 to 202, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>I am informed by NAMA that the remuneration packages of the NAMA chief executive is published in NAMA&rsquo;s Financial Statements and included in its Annual Report which is available at <i>www.nama.ie<\/i>.

My concern in relation to providing a more attractive tax incentive for micro businesses is that it would draw investments away from other small businesses that do not meet the definition of a micro business which includes having less than 10 employees.  It is likely that any incentive scheme that is more attractive than another, in terms of tax relief or reduced risk, would draw investors in the first instance to it.  Only where such investors had access to greater amounts of capital to invest than allowed under the terms of the more attractive scheme, would they consider making other investments.

There have been no material changes to these policies since then.  Bank of Ireland gives significant and comprehensive disclosure on its asset quality including in connection with Retail Ireland residential mortgages in pages 25-29 of its Interim Report for the 6 months to 30 June 2012 and gives further significant and comprehensive disclosure on its Retail Ireland Residential Mortgage portfolio in pages 107-117 of that Interim Report including that it had formally restructured or modified 15,861 mortgages at that date.  The Bank also has a significant number of informal temporary arrangements with customers.<\/p><p>  In its Interim Management Statement issued to the Stock Market on 13 November 2012 Bank of Ireland commented on its Irish Residential Mortgage book as follows:<\/p><p>  &#8220;We continue to actively focus on credit quality and our exposures to the Irish SME sector and our Irish Mortgage book continue to be key priorities.  With regard to our Irish Mortgage book, the pace of arrears formation has continued to reduce and we have continued to formally restructure and modify a significant number of customer mortgages on a sustainable basis.  86% of those customers whose mortgages are currently in formal restructure or modification are fully meeting their revised arrangements&#8221;.<\/p><p>  Bank of Ireland is conscious that this question was also asked at Bank of Ireland&#8217;s appearance at the recent meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Expenditure and Reform on 1 November 2012 and Bank of Ireland came in for some criticism in relation to its response to that question.  Bank of Ireland wishes to put this matter into context.  <\/p><p>  In such public appearances the Bank wishes to be as open as possible with members of the Committee.  It must also, however, be conscious of its responsibilities as a public company to adhere to the disclosure obligations of the various Stock Exchanges where the Bank is listed, including disclosure of matters the Bank considers to be commercially sensitive.  On this occasion, as previously, Mr Boucher stressed this responsibility, for the information of Members, in his opening remarks:<\/p><p><i>&#8220;The Bank is a public company that is subject to the listing rules of the Irish, London and New York stock exchanges.  The presentation is a public document and is presented under the rules of the aforementioned stock exchanges.  All comments I make are governed by the stock exchange disclosure rules.&#8221;  <\/i><\/p><p>  The Bank&#8217;s appearance before the Committee on 1 November 2012 was prior to it giving a Trading Update to the Stock Exchanges which was released to the markets on 13 November 2012 and on 13 November 2012, in conjunction with its Trading Update, the Bank successfully launched the first public non-Government guaranteed bond issued by an Irish Bank since 2010 raising &#8364;1billion in the process.  There would be very strict disclosure obligations prior to, at the time of and post events such as these. <\/p><p>  Spokespersons for the Bank cannot make incremental accounting disclosures for prior accounting periods unless they are described as being such when being made and have been extensively verified before being made.<\/p><p>  Consistent with its accounting policies, the Group only writes off debt once all avenues to recover the loans have been exhausted.  In the case of Residential Mortgages in the Republic of Ireland, this happens after the property has been repossessed \/ sold and all other means of recovering any residual amount owing have been exhausted.  As an additional disclosure to its Interim accounts, the Group now advises that it recorded an accounting write off amounting to &#8364;2.3 million of its impairment provisions in respect of Residential Mortgages in the Republic of Ireland in the six months ended 30 June 2012.<\/p><p>  Bank of Ireland has made several appearances in front of Oireachtas Committees in recent years and has at all times, provided significant information and sought to be helpful and cooperative in such engagements.  On the occasion of the previous appearance with the Committee on Finance, Expenditure and Reform in September 2011, members of the Committee were publicly complimentary on the openness and comprehensive nature of the contributions from the Bank.<\/p><p>  On the most recent occasion the Bank, once again, welcomed the opportunity to update members of the Committee on progress made by Bank of Ireland on its strategic objectives and to provide as much detail as possible on the Group&#8217;s business.  In this respect the Bank submitted, in advance, a detailed 31 slide presentation on its business and also responded to a lengthy questionnaire issued by the Committee.  <\/p><p>  Bank of Ireland is very much conscious of the support provided by the taxpayer, has always acknowledged this, and wished to provide an update on progress to a shareholder representing 15% of the Group&#8217;s stock.  In his opening remarks Mr Boucher stressed this point at some length:  with specific reference to slide 27 in the presentation he said:<\/p><p><i>&#8220;As investors and representatives of the taxpayer, we try to demonstrate [to you] what the taxpayer is getting out of its support for Bank of Ireland.  Our first task is to reduce the risk to the taxpayer from support provided by the taxpayer.  We believe the capital we have raised, the restructuring and deleveraging, the cost-reduction programmes we have undertaken, the agreement of our EU viability and restructuring plans, and the enhancement of our franchises &#8211; including the franchise in the UK, further protected by the extension of the Post Office contract &#8211; have been a very important part of reducing the risk to the taxpayer.  The most significant contingent liability the taxpayer has is in respect of the eligible liabilities guarantee or ELG.  Through a range of initiatives, particularly deleveraging and increasing our deposit franchises, we have reduced the liabilities under the ELG from &#8364;136 billion at their peak in September 2008 to &#8364;36 billion at the end of June.  They will have reduced further since that date.

Bank of Ireland cannot speak for other institutions but stresses that it has always been and must continue to be entirely consistent on its obligations as a public company.  <\/p><p>  The Bank regrets the frustration expressed by members of the Committee in this respect but asks for the Committee&#8217;s understanding of the Bank&#8217;s public company obligations and the Bank again reiterates its willingness to participate in the public engagement process including with Oireachtas Committees.  <\/p><p>  The Bank would also ask that any consideration of this matter include a review of the Bank&#8217;s presentation and submission as well as the full transcript of a lengthy hearing where, the Bank believes, it attempted to put important and relevant information on the public record and to help the Committee&#8217;s deliberations.&#8221; <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000058#WRG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":1696,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000058#WRG01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1697,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[51268\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000058#WRG01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the date on which the 65 year limit for DIRTexemption was introduced; when did the exemption become automatic other than be subject to an application for a refund.","asker":"961","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":1698,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[51407\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000058#WRG01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the date on which the DIRT exemption for those over 65 years of age was introduced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":1699,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 211 and 223 together. <\/p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, from the time Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) was first introduced in the tax year ended 5 April 1987, where an individual or their spouse was aged over 65, they were exempt from DIRT where their total annual income did not exceed the exemption limit.

The Central Bank&#8217;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears is a key protection and provides that each bank must put in place a formal Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process to deal with its mortgage customers who are in arrears or pre-arrears and for the establishment of dedicated arrears support units and appeals processes to handle such cases.  The Code highlights the importance of a borrower contacting their lender when they are in arrears or pre-arrears.  A key protection is a 12 month moratorium on action by lenders.  The Central Bank has published a guide for consumers on mortgage arrears called &#8216;Mortgage Arrears &#8211; A Consumer Guide to Dealing with your Lender&#8217; and this is available on the Central Bank website:  <\/p><p><i>   . <\/i><\/p><p>  The Government is committed to advancing appropriate measures to assist those mortgage holders who are experiencing real and genuine difficulty.  In this regard, the Government is now actively implementing the main recommendations contained in the &#8216;Keane Report&#8217;.<\/p><p>   A number of significant milestones have now been achieved:-<\/p><p>- The Personal Insolvency Bill was published last June and the Bill has been progressed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence and D&aacute;il Report stage on the Bill has recently concluded.  <\/p><p>- The Minister for Housing and Planning has formally launched the &#8220;mortgage to rent&#8221; scheme on a nationwide basis;<\/p><p>- Lenders have now provided details to the Central Bank on their proposed forbearance and loan modification options for appropriate cases.  The roll out of these options commenced in the final quarter of this year with Central Bank oversight; <\/p><p>- Also an extensive independent mortgage advice framework has now been put in place by the Minister of Social Protection comprising (i) an enhanced website www.keepingyourhome.ie (ii) a Mortgage Arrears information helpline, and (iii) the provision of free independent &#8216;one-to-one&#8217; professional financial advice to borrowers when considering a long term forbearance\/resolution offer from their lender.  The list of accountants providing this service is located on the www.keepingyourhome.ie website.<\/p><p>  The general policy issue of mortgage arrears is of the utmost importance to Government and in recognition of this, the Taoiseach is chairing a special Government committee on mortgage arrears to oversee the overall Government response to tackle the problem. In addition to this, a high level Steering Group, chaired by the Department of Finance, is continuing to drive the implementation of the recommendations set out in the Inter-Departmental Group on Mortgage Arrears (the &#8216;Keane Report&#8217;) at official level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRH00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Asset Management Agency","counter":1740,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRH00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1741,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[51486\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will list the non-pay allowances made to the national Assets Management Agency executives and employees including the provision of cars, private health insurance, credit cards for entertaining and moving allowances; if he will list each separate allowance paid in individual detail, including car type, insurance premia, sums allowed on credit cards and types of health policies.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":1742,"content":"<p>The National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) has no employees.

Applied Behavioural Analysis, or ABA, is one of the approaches used in special classes for children with autism. <\/p><p>  The use of ABA as part of the range of interventions is particularly useful for addressing behavioural issues. My Department supports the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use. However, the Department does not accept, based on research, advice and best practice, that ABA should be the only approach used. While ABA helps to improve behaviour, other approaches, such as Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) are just as important in developing children's communication and speech skills. It is important that children have access to a range of approaches so that their broader needs can be met. As children differ significantly from one another and as children's needs vary and change over time, it is not possible to impose a method or approach that will work for all children with autism.  This child centred approach is based on advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS, the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may be interested to note that teachers in special schools have been using ABA principles for more than 25 years. ABA involves the systematic application, at any time during the child's day, of behavioural principles to modify behaviour. The effectiveness of behavioural interventions to improve the performance of children with autism and to ameliorate behavioural difficulties has been recognized for decades.<\/p><p>  To clarify the position regarding psychological assessment reports prepared by health service staff which identify a child's educational needs, the Health Service Executive (HSE) circulated guidance to their staff earlier this year.  The guidance clarified that, if a report prepared by HSE staff identifies a child's educational needs the report should not specify how the education sector should meet those needs. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRH03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Application Numbers","counter":1785,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRH03550"},{"type":"question","counter":1786,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[51147\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRH03600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide the volume and value of third level grants paid by 13 November 2011 in respect of grant applications submitted in 2011.","asker":"959","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":1787,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[51148\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRH03700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide the volume and value of third level grants paid to date in respect of grant applications submitted in 2012.","asker":"959","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":1788,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 244 and 245 together.<\/p><p>  The data in relation to the number and value of student grants paid by the 13 November 2011 is not available in my Department.<\/p><p>  SUSI, the new centralised grant awarding authority as at the 16th November, 2012 paid student maintenance grants to some 4,420 students to the value of &euro;1,385,291.42.

In line with this approach the policy is to promote a child-centred approach to education of all children with special educational needs including those with autism. As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.<\/p><p>  Children with autism present with a wide range of needs. Some children are capable of being fully integrated into mainstream schools without additional teaching or care supports. Others are able to attend mainstream schools but need additional teaching and\/or care assistance. Many are best enrolled in autism-specific classes where more intensive and supportive interventions are required. Some may move from one setting to another as they get older and differing needs\/strengths\/abilities emerge.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be familiar with the standards associated with qualified teachers, the registration of qualified teachers required by the Teaching Council, the probationary process, whereby teachers are supported and advised by the inspectorate during their first year of teaching. Furthermore the Department recognises that specialised training and continued professional development (CPD) is important for staff working with children with special educational needs and supports the provision of CPD through the Special Education Support Service (SESS) which was specifically established for this purpose. The SESS co-ordinates and delivers a range of professional development initiatives and support structures for school personnel working with students with special educational needs.<\/p><p>  Autism classes are established with a staffing ratio of 1 teacher and a minimum of 2 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for every 6 children. Other SNAs may be allocated if required to meet the care needs of the children. Start-up grants are provided to the schools to enable special equipment to be purchased. Enhanced capitation is paid in respect of each child and assistive technology is funded where this is recommended.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years. In excess of 540 classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools. Thirteen new special schools for children with autism were granted official recognition in 2010 having been funded by my Department as centres in a pilot project for a number of years.  The number of pupils enrolled in these classes are not readily available but I have arranged for them to be compiled and forwarded directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRH04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teacher Training","counter":1793,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRJ00075"},{"type":"question","counter":1794,"qnumday":247,"qnumall":"[51159\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRJ00100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to remove home economics initial teacher education from a school (details supplied) in County Sligo, as recommended in the recent report from the Higher Education Authority.","asker":"1034","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":1795,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[51187\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRJ00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide an update on a report from the Higher Education Authority on initial teacher education, specifically the recommendation to remove home economics from a campus (details supplied) in County Sligo; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1062","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":1796,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[51188\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide an update on a report from the Higher Education Authority on initial teacher education, specifically the recommendation to remove home economics from a campus (details supplied) in County Sligo; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1062","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":1797,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[51189\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRJ00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide an update on a report from the Higher Education Authority on initial teacher education, specifically the recommendation to remove home economics from a campus (details supplied) in County Sligo; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1062","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":1798,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[51198\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRJ00500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on a report from the Higher Education Authority on initial teacher training (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":1799,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 247, 250, 251 and 252 together.<\/p><p>  I have accepted the recommendations set out in a report commissioned by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) on the structures of initial teacher education. The purpose of the report, which I requested, was to identify new possible structures to improve initial teacher education in Ireland so that it is comparable with the best in the world. <\/p><p>  The international panel of education experts recommended that teacher education be provided in six &quot;centres for teacher education&quot;. Currently there are 19 state funded providers of ITE (and three non-state funded) offering more than 40 college programmes in primary and post-primary teaching. The new collaborations recommended by the international panel will mean that a smaller number of centres for ITE exist, but that they offer education across multiple sectors from early childhood to primary, to post primary to adult education. These centres for teacher education will also possess a critical mass in terms of research capacity which is not always possible in smaller institutions. The new configurations will mean strong research bases can be created in each centre.<\/p><p>  The HEA has been requested to consult with the relevant parties and to prepare a detailed plan on how to implement the recommendations of the Panel.

Two other major school building projects have been terminated due to a contractor's default for reasons other than insolvency. Five of these projects were subsequently completed and handed over to the school authorities, four are currently being completed by completion contractors and the remaining two projects are in the process of procuring a completion contractor to complete the works. Please see the attached document for details of the eleven projects.<\/p><p>The original value of the eleven projects was circa &euro;44m. There is a bond in place for each of the eleven projects. The bond is used to cover costs that would otherwise accrue to the Employer (i.e. the Department, School, VEC etc.) on foot of a contractor's failure to complete the works. As such the Employer's financial exposure is generally minimal. Negotiations are ongoing with regard to a number of these projects and in some cases the full cost of re-tendering and completion of the works is not yet known. The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to release commercially sensitive cost information which is currently the subject of negotiations or tender competitions. To do so would undermine the Employer's position with regard to such negotiations.<\/p><p>The contract used for the construction of major school projects is the Public Works Contract. This contract was developed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and is used across the State Sector for all capital works. With regard to the project in Kilkenny, the Deputy will be aware that the contractor's obligation to complete the works was recently terminated.  Therefore it is not legally possible to complete the project under the existing contract.<\/p><p>My Department does not hold details of sub-contractors engaged on major school building projects.

my Department, plays a key role in advising on future skills needs. Its research provides a valuable input to the development of training course curricula for national training providers and has also informed the development of new competitive funding models of provision to address emerging skills needs.<\/p><p>  The Government's activation policy, 'Pathways to Work', provides for engagement by the Department of Social Protection's INTREO Employment and Support Service with unemployed people, particularly the long-term unemployed, with a view to assisting them in finding jobs or referrals to appropriate education and training.<\/p><p>  To complement this policy, and despite reducing resources, my Department will fund over 450,000 education and training places across the range of provision in the higher education, further education and training sectors in 2012. My Department and its agencies are prioritising places, including in the further education and training sector, specifically for those on the Live Register for 12 months or more.<\/p><p>  In 2012 F&Aacute;S aim to facilitate over 81,000 unemployed individuals through a range of training programmes, that provide industry\/occupational specific skills as well as preparatory type training, to enable a diverse range of unemployed individuals referred to F&Aacute;S by the Department of Social Protection, to gain a recognised qualification, access job opportunities or progression opportunities to further\/higher education\/training. The Department of Social Protection provides appropriate guidance and advice, as required, to unemployed individuals relating to F&Aacute;S courses. The re-alignment of F&Aacute;S training programmes with evolving labour market needs is evidence-based. This is facilitated by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) and other relevant international and national sources including employers.<\/p><p>  More than 10,000 higher education places are being provided in areas of identified skills need under the Springboard programme and 6,500 places are being rolled out under the new Labour Market Education and Training Fund which will be managed by FAS.<\/p><p>  In addition, the joint Government-Industry ICT Action Plan, which has been developed as a direct response to identified ICT skills shortages, contains a comprehensive range of measures to build the domestic supply of ICT graduates, including through the roll out of over 800 places on graduate skills conversion courses from March 2012. A roll-out of a second phase of the conversion courses is scheduled for early 2013.<\/p><p>  The Irish Further Education and Training sector is undergoing major structural reform.  The creation of a new further education and training authority, SOLAS, will facilitate a coherent integrated strategic national response across the further education and training sectors and will ensure a greater focus on the evolving requirements of the unemployed and of industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRJ03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1042"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1851,"content":"<p>Question No. 268 answered with Question No. 117.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":1852,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRK00250"},{"type":"question","counter":1853,"qnumday":269,"qnumall":"[51582\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRK00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the total number of primary schools throughout the country currently dependant on prefabricated accommodation; his plans to address this issue in the next three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":1854,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[51583\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRK00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the total number of post- primary schools throughout the country currently dependant on prefabricated accommodation; his plans to address this issue in the next three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":1855,"content":"<p>I propose to take questions 269 and 270 together.<\/p><p>  Currently, there are 496 primary schools renting 1,283 prefab units and 47 post-primary schools renting 131 prefab units throughout the country.

The provision for the current year is in line with expenditure last year and shows that despite the current economic difficulties, the overall level of funding for special education has been retained.<\/p><p>  In line with this Government's commitment to frontline services for pupils with special educational needs:<\/p><p>- 10,575 whole time equivalent (wte) Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts are being provided for primary, post-primary and special schools for the current school year in order to support the care needs of pupils with disabilities.<\/p><p>- Approximately 9,950 learning support\/resource teacher posts, including those provided under the General Allocation Model, are also being provided in primary &amp; post primary schools in order to provide additional teaching support to pupils with special educational needs.<\/p><p>- Over 1,100 teachers are also being provided for in special schools providing teaching to pupils with various disabilities at much reduced pupil: teacher ratios, for example the autism PTR is 6:1 and the moderate general learning disability PTR is 8:1.<\/p><p>- Enhanced levels of school capitation are payable to most special schools and special classes and special School Transport arrangements for pupils with disabilities are provided at a cost of over &euro;60m per year. <\/p><p>- Approximately &euro;1.3m is also provided annually to schools for assistive technology support. <\/p><p>- An extended school year is also currently available for pupils who have either a severe\/profound general learning disability or who have autism.<\/p><p>  The continued commitment of this Government to special education provision, at a time when savings are being required across a range of expenditure areas has ensured that children with special educational needs can continue to have access to educational facilities in line with their requirements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRK01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staffing","counter":1869,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRK01450"},{"type":"question","counter":1870,"qnumday":275,"qnumall":"[51588\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRK01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the total number of schools, on a county basis, at primary and or second level that have been affected by a reduction in the number of teachers over the past two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":1871,"content":"<p>The Statistics Section of my Department's website contains extensive data at individual school level in county order.

The Action Plan for Jobs contains a number of measures which are aimed specifically at the facilitation and incentivisation of national enterprise development from start-ups to growth companies.  The Enterprise Development agencies, under the aegis of my Department, are at the forefront of implementing the Action Plan for Jobs across all regions and will ensure that enterprises can maximise their contribution to economic and jobs growth.<\/p><p>  In 2011, Enterprise Ireland paid over &#8364;5.4m in financial support to its client companies to assist them to develop their business and create employment in South County Dublin including Tallaght.  The New Frontiers Programme, which focuses on developing a person&#8217;s entrepreneurial abilities is co-ordinated by Enterprise Ireland and is providing &#8364;4.25m in funding to enable the Institutes of Technology, including Tallaght IT, to deliver the Programme at a local level.  Participants receive financial support of &#8364;15,000.  So far this year, 23 people participated in Phase 1 of the Programme at Tallaght IT and 15 applicants are currently completing Phase 2.A new Community Enterprise Centre Development Programme was launched this year for the maintenance or establishment of a strong business development function in the Community Enterprise Centres, funded by Enterprise Ireland.  Three Community Enterprise Centres in the Tallaght Area were successful in securing this funding in 2012, including Partas Centres in Killinarden and Brookfield.<\/p><p>  The South Dublin County Enterprise Board provides support for small businesses with 10 employees or fewer in the start-up and expansion phases, to develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level. In 2011 the Board paid out &#8364;357,682 in grant assistance to 38 microenterprise projects in the county.  This year, the Board will continue to be actively involved in economic development in the area and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development.<\/p><p>  From IDA Ireland&#8217;s perspective, Tallaght continues to be well-equipped to compete for potential Foreign Direct Investment, with superb infrastructure facilities at City West and Grange Castle.  IDA announcements in 2012 include Xilinx &#8211; a &#8364;50m expansion in its operations; SAP &#8211; creation of 150 jobs; Microsoft &#8211; US$130m expansion in its operations.  As recently as September 2012, Aspen, announced the creation of 44 jobs at its facility in City West.  <\/p><p>  Ensuring that more micro and small businesses can start up, expand and export is a key pillar of the Government&#8217;s plans for jobs and growth.  That is why the Government has decided to implement an ambitious reform in the delivery of service to small and micro business.  This will include the:-<\/p><p>- Development of a new Small and Micro Business Division within Enterprise Ireland (EI) as a centre of excellence in the provision of supports to the small and micro enterprise sectors; <\/p><p>- Dissolution of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) and the transfer of their functions, assets and liabilities to Enterprise Ireland (EI);<\/p><p>- Establishment of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) to provide a high quality, innovative, &#8220;one-stop-shop&#8221; support service for small businesses within Local Authorities, and providing early access to the services of national bodies and,<\/p><p>- Integration of key local authority business services into the Local Enterprise Office and promotion of a local environment in which enterprise can thrive.<\/p><p>  Pending the introduction of these proposed new arrangements, micro-enterprises employing less than 10 persons, in Tallaght can, as their first port of call, continue to contact South Dublin County Enterprise Board (SDCEB) on: <font color=\"#3F803F\">.<\/font><\/p><p>  To improve access to credit for entrepreneurs and micro-enterprises, and to facilitate the growth and expansion of viable businesses from all industry sectors which have been refused access to credit by banks, the Government recently established the Microfinance Loan Fund.

As independent quasi-judicial bodies, I have no role in the day-to-day exercise of their functions. <\/p><p>  If an employee considers that s\/he has been unfairly dismissed, s\/he may submit a claim for redress under the Unfair Dismissals Acts to a Rights Commissioner or a claim may be submitted directly to the EAT.  <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Where a claim is heard by a Rights Commissioner under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, the Rights Commissioner will issue a recommendation and either party may appeal that recommendation to the EAT.  The appeal must be made within 6 weeks of the date on which the Rights Commissioner communicated the recommendation to the parties.  This is done by giving written notice of appeal within that period to the EAT on the prescribed form.<\/font>  In communicating Rights Commissioners&#8217; recommendations, it is standard practice to include with the recommendations, information on how an appeal of recommendation can be made.<\/p><p>  Where a claim or appeal is heard by the EAT under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, the Tribunal will issue a determination.  There is a right of appeal by either party to the Circuit Court from a determination of the Tribunal.  <\/p><p>  The statutory time limits for appealing the recommendation of a Rights Commissioner to the EAT are provided for in the Unfair Dismissal Acts and the EAT does not have any discretion to extend these time limits in any circumstances. <\/p><p>  I am fully aware of the specific issues and circumstances surrounding your constituent&#8217;s complaint.  Having made enquiries into this matter, I understand that Officials within my Department have conducted a thorough scrutiny of the facts in relation to this case and letters have issued, in both November 2011 and February 2012, in respect of earlier complaints made by your constituent in relation to this matter.  I am informed that there has been no change in facts of this case since then.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, I have addressed the specific issues concerning your constituent&#8217;s present complaint in my reply which will issue to you in response to the representations you have made on his behalf in relation to the matter (Ref: 121035\/MIN refers). <\/p><p>  As you may be aware, I am currently undertaking a root and branch reform of the existing Workplace Relations Bodies.  The Reform Programme I have commenced will deliver a two tier Workplace Relations structure by merging the activities of the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the EAT and the Labour Court into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).  The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure.<\/p><p>  My objective is to establish a world-class Workplace Relations Service. The Workplace Relations Bill which I hope to publish in early 2013 will contain provisions in respect of the relevant procedures for appeals along the lines already outlined in the policy document &#8216;<i>Legislating for a Worldclass Workplace Relations Service&#8217;<\/i> and also in my presentation before the joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs Enterprise and Innovation last July.  I intend proposing to the Oireachtas that all first instance complaints requiring adjudication will be heard by the Adjudication Officers of the new Workplace Relations Commission and any subsequent appeals will be heard by the Labour Court as a full fresh appeal.  The Labour Court will act as a court of final appeal for all adjudication decisions of the Workplace Relations Commission, subject to the right of either party to bring a further appeal from a determination of the Labour Court to the High Court on a point of law only.<\/p><p>  The WRC will have statutory jurisdiction for facilitating the resolution of disputes under employment, equality and industrial relations legislation, in accordance with best practice and in compliance with international human rights standards.  To ensure that the WRC delivers its services to the highest standards, the Director will be supported by a Registration Service with a suitably qualified and experienced lawyer as Registrar.  It is envisaged that such a Registration Service would be responsible for the receipt, validation and processing of all employment related complaints and the coordination, management and referral of those cases to Hearing.  For example, the Registration Service will check complaints on receipt and reject or redirect incomplete complaints, complaints which are out of time or which are grounded incorrectly.  The Registration Service will have responsibility for steering each case through the system and ensuring it is dealt with efficiently and effectively.<\/p><p>  In this regard, I am happy to report that substantial progress has been made to date and a number of important priority actions have been successfully delivered within the target timescale which will ensure that all employment related complaints are dealt with effectively, efficiently and in a timely manner, including:-<\/p><p>- the introduction of a new single contact portal called &#8220;Workplace Relations Customer Services&#8221; (for information provisions and complaints receipt and registration) which has replaced the five separate entry points, and<\/p><p>- a Single Complaint Form that deals with 100 first instance complaints has replaced the 30 forms previously in use.<\/p><p>  I fully expect the work that I have initiated with regard to the reform of the Workplace Relations Bodies to significantly improve the quality of service to users and I am confident that all employment related complaints will be dealt with in an effective, efficient and timely manner under the new structures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRM02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services","counter":1998,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRM02050"},{"type":"question","counter":1999,"qnumday":323,"qnumall":"[51606\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRM02100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he or any of the State's industrial promotion agencies have been able to assist in having production resumed as a processing plant (details supplied) in County Cavan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":2000,"content":"<p>I understand that a Receiver was appointed to the company concerned on 22 October 2012.  <\/p><p>  I am informed by Enterprise Ireland that they have been in regular contact with the Receiver and are available to provide any possible assistance that the agency can.

This holds for all sectors of the labour market, including the care sector. <\/p><p>  Incentivising the take-up of employment is essentially being achieved by three means:-<\/p><p>- First, the Government is determined to continue to reform the tax and social welfare system to ensure that a person who takes up employment is significantly better off financially then if they remained on social welfare. Our current Jobseekers Benefit and Jobseekers Allowance payments are already designed in such a way as to ensure that persons are incentivised to take up either full-time or part-time employment.  This is achieved by a gradual tapering of the social welfare payment for people who take up part-time employment.  Currently, a person can work up to three days and still have an entitlement to a reduced social welfare payment, with the reduction in the social welfare payment tapered in line with a person&rsquo;s increase in earnings from work.  A person who wishes to work on a part-time basis over a period in excess of three days per week can avail of the Part Time Job Incentive Scheme or the Family Income Supplement Scheme.  People who are more than 12 months unemployed are also entitled to an increased personal tax credit in certain circumstances further increasing the returns to work.<\/p><p>  In addition, reforms to the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes are being introduced to ensure that people in part-time employment are incentivised to take up full-time employment as such opportunities become available.  This includes rebasing the payment week for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit on a five-day week rather than the previous six-day week basis where a person is working for part of the week.  This measure was introduced in July 2012.  And from February 2013 employment on a Sunday will be taken into account when determining the level of entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s payments.  The recognition of Sunday working from the perspective of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and benefit will reduce the amount of jobseeker&rsquo;s payable to casual workers and thereby encourage workers to take up offers of full-time employment rather than combining part-time employment with social welfare payments.  <\/p><p>  In a further effort to improve the financial incentive to take up employment, the Government has halved the lower rate of PRSI until end-2013 on jobs that pay up to &euro;356 per week and exempted low-paid, part-time and seasonal workers with an annual income of less than &euro;10,036 from the Universal Social Charge (increased from &euro;4,004).<\/p><p>  The Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare is examining issues around the operation and interaction of the tax and social welfare systems and may also recommend further measures to improve incentives to take up employment.<\/p><p>- Second, the Government is incentivising employers to hire the long-term unemployed.  The Government has introduced a range of reforms and incentives to support, protect and create jobs, including through the Jobs Initiative in May 2011 which among other measures reduced VAT rates for labour intensive sectors.  The Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme is available to employers who hire persons who have been in receipt of specified social welfare payments for a period of six months or more and the Revenue Tax Assist Scheme is available to employers who hire a person in receipt of those benefits for in excess of 12 months.  This scheme, which provides a double tax relief for employers, also provides increased tax credits for the employee.<\/p><p>- Third, with the unemployed via the roll-out of the new one-stop-shop Intreo offices which were launched in October.  Interventions will include referral to group engagement, one-to-one interviews, education and\/or training and placement\/work experience opportunities at appropriate intervals.  In addition, the Department of Social Protection will continue to implement its powers to sanction individuals in the form of reduced social welfare rates, if they fail to make a meaningful effort to engage in efforts to progress towards employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRM02400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":2004,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRM02450"},{"type":"question","counter":2005,"qnumday":325,"qnumall":"[50833\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRM02500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an application for carer's allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Mayo; if it will be expedited; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":2006,"content":"<p>I confirm that the Department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance from the person in question on the 18th June 2012.

The volume of FIS claims on hands and the delays in processing are a consequence of continued strong claim intake.<\/p><p>  An in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project has recently been completed for the FIS scheme.  This project focused on optimising output and customer service and the elimination of backlogs.

This plan sees the normal weekly new claim and renewal intake processed without delay while the backlog is ring-fenced and a focused team assigned to this work with a clear plan for its elimination.<\/p><p>  The first steps taken to permanently eliminate future backlogs in FIS are to put in place sufficient capacity and suitable structures and processes to deal with the weekly intake of work.  This has been done in the case of the FIS scheme and the first week of operation has been very successful in this regard, achieving its target output.<\/p><p>  This is not to say that the backlog of claims awaiting decision is being ignored or that work has ceased on it.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  <\/p><p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for the State pension (contributory) easier by disregarding time spent out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme was introduced in and took effect from 1994.   Eligibility for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is conditional on firstly meeting the standard qualifying conditions for State pension. <\/p><p>  Backdating the scheme to 1964 would involve considerable costs.  An analysis undertaken in the 2007 Green Paper on Pensions identified that to backdate the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme to 1953, the year when the unified system of social insurance was introduced in Ireland, would cost the Exchequer in the region of &euro;160m and to 1973\/73, an estimated  &euro;150m.  Costs in relation to this scheme under the current rules, are expected to increase in the coming years due to the increase in female employment rates since 1994. <\/p><p>  In relation to income support, Ireland&rsquo;s pensioners have the lowest consistent poverty rate and are least likely to be at risk of poverty compared to other groups - pointing to the adequacy of the State pension.  Between 2004 and 2010, consistent poverty for older people (those over 65) fell from 3.3% to 0.9%.  The &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate for people in that age group fell from 27.1% to 9.6% over the same period.<\/p><p>  The recently published review of the Social Insurance Fund identified that in the medium to long term, pension related expenditure will account for an increasing proportion of the Social Insurance Fund expenditure - rising from 57% in 2011 to 85% in 2066.    The pensioner support ratio is projected to decline from 5.3 workers for every individual over pension age in 2010 to 3.9 workers by 2020 and to 2.1 workers by 2060. <\/p><p>  In terms of value for money for those who take time out of the workforce, the report confirms that social insurance benefits offer excellent value for money for those:<\/p><p>- on the lower part of the income distribution,<\/p><p>- those with shorter contribution histories, mostly women<\/p><p>- and the self-employed.  <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the changes in the contribution rules and associated rates of payment which were introduced in September 2012, those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories, will continue to obtain the best value for money from the Fund.  This can be of particular benefit to women.  <\/p><p>  In relation to the marriage bar, it should be noted that women affected by the marriage bar are public servants who would not be eligible for the homemakers scheme due to the type of PRSI being paid by them at the time of leaving the workforce. It should be noted that women who do not qualify for a full rate pension may, if their spouse is in receipt of a State pension contributory, receive a qualified adult payment at a higher rate where they satisfy a means test.   <\/p><p>  A State pension non-contributory pension, which is a means tested payment, may also be payable.  Time taken out of the workforce for homemaking and caring duties will continue to be protected by the current disregard.  While my Department will keep the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme under review, any improvements which could result in further costs for the Exchequer could only be considered in a budgetary context.

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.  The estimated expenditure on child benefit for 2012 is around &euro;2 billion and it is paid to around 600,000 families in respect of some 1.15 million children. <\/p><p>  Parents of multiple birth children receive an additional monthly premia paid at one and a half times the monthly child benefit payment rate for each twin and double the monthly payment rate for each child in other multiple births. While Budget 2012 maintained this additional monthly payment, the multiple births grant of &euro;635 paid at birth, at 4 years of age and at 12 years of age was discontinued. <\/p><p>  As a universal payment child benefit assists parents with the cost of raising children and it contributes towards alleviating child poverty. The Government is also conscious that child benefit is an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment. Bearing this in mind, any plans to change the amount paid in respect of such payments will be a matter to be decided in a budgetary context and announced on Budget day.  I do not therefore propose to speculate on any possible approaches to child benefit payment rates changes.  <\/p><p>  With regard to the application process for child benefit, when a parent registers the birth of their child the Department of Social Protection will initiate a child benefit claim. In cases where the parent is not claiming child benefit for another child, such as their first child, a partially completed form is sent to the parent to sign in order to claim the payment. In cases where the parent is claiming child benefit for another child, the new child is added to the child benefit claim and payment begins automatically from the month after the birth. A letter confirming payment is then sent to the parent by the Department. If a parent does not wish to claim their child benefit payment, they can notify the Department in writing to that effect and their claim will be stopped in accordance with their wishes. <\/p><p>  I am conscious that achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including child benefit, raises complex issues about the effectiveness of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment incentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area. Their report is currently receiving my consideration and will assist the Government in setting out a pathway towards a more appropriate system of child income supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRN03900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2075,"content":"<p>Question No. 351 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Applications","counter":2077,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRO00150"},{"type":"question","counter":2078,"qnumday":352,"qnumall":"[50963\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRO00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the current waiting time for the assessment of invalidity pension applications; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":2079,"qnumday":353,"qnumall":"[50964\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if her atention has been drawn to the fact that approximate waiting times for the processing of invalidity pensions are not available to applicants on request; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":2080,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 352 and 353 together. <\/p><p>  The processing times of individual invalidity pension claims may vary in accordance with their relative complexity in terms of the qualifying criteria.

The figures illustrate that the review process is well understood and utilised.<\/p><p>  Customers may provide new information\/evidence at appeal stage, in particular during oral hearings, which may not have been available to the deciding officer at review stage, and could result in a revised decision by an appeals officer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRO00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Applications","counter":2087,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRO00850"},{"type":"question","counter":2088,"qnumday":356,"qnumall":"[51012\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRO00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide an update on the proposed transfer of some of the administration of rent supplement to county councils, and if she has given further consideration to the payment of rent supplement directly to the landlord as a default option.","asker":"1011","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":2089,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 356 and 406 together. <\/p><p>  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 89,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;436 million in 2012.<\/p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant.  Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.  There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.<\/p><p>  However, rent supplement payments can, at the request of the tenant and with the agreement of the Department, be paid directly to the landlord.  If the Department were to introduce a system whereby all rent supplement payments were to be made directly to landlords the efficiency of the scheme would be significantly affected.  For example, the Department would potentially have to create a formal relationship with some 89,000 additional clients, the landlords.  This would involve greater complexity and significant resources to deal with a new set of third parties.  It would not be an effective use of resources to have departmental staff negotiating rental agreements for those with a short term need.<\/p><p>  The Government has effectively two initiatives to deal with long term reliance on rent supplement.  The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is in operation since 2004 and the new Housing Policy Initiative as announced by my colleagues the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Housing &amp; Planning on 16th June 2011.<\/p><p>  In March 2012, the Government approved in principle to transfer responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from my Department, currently provided through rent supplement, to housing authorities using a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Among the main features of HAP is that landlords will be paid directly by the local authority.<\/p><p>  A multi-agency steering group has been established to develop proposals to give effect to this transfer.  The group is chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and consists of representatives from the Departments of Social Protection; Public Expenditure and Reform; Office of the Revenue Commissioners; the County and City Managers Association, and the Housing Agency.  It is planned that pilot testing of HAP arrangements will commence during the second half of 2013 with general roll out and commencement of transfers from January 2014. <\/p><p>  The new arrangements will achieve a key Government commitment of removing barriers to employment and at the same time returning rent supplement to its original purpose of a short-term income support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRO01000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":2090,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRO01050"},{"type":"question","counter":2091,"qnumday":357,"qnumall":"[51023\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRO01100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will expedite an application for carer's allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":2092,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance from the person in question on the 25th October 2012.

With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.<\/p><p>  The National Broadband Plan, which I published recently, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.<\/p><p>  The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country &ndash; specifically:<\/p><p>- 70Mbps &ndash; 100Mbps will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015;<\/p><p>- At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% (and potentially as much as 35%) of the population during the lifetime of the Government; and <\/p><p>- A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country, also during the lifetime of the Government.<\/p><p>  During the preparation of the Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.<\/p><p>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&rsquo; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this mapping exercise.<\/p><p>  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  Until that process is complete, the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention will not be known.<\/p><p>  I would reiterate however, that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including Loughshinny, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRR02800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":2286,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRR02900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Industry","counter":2285,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRR02850"},{"type":"question","counter":2286,"qnumday":430,"qnumall":"[51101\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRR02900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"with reference to motor trade plates which cost &euro;330, his views on the status of Republic of Ireland trade plates in Northern Ireland and on confiscations in Northern Ireland of cars with legitimate Republic of Ireland trade plates; if in view of the fact that motor trade in this State can involve travel through Northern Ireland; if he will raise this matter at an upcoming meeting of the North South Ministerial Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"997","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":2287,"content":"<p>The legislation in relation to trade plates is provided in section 21 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1992 and the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 1992.<\/p><p>  Trade plates can be used by motor dealers in very limited circumstances in respect of vehicles on which a vehicle licence has not been taken out.

The SLAs will identify the levels of performance expected and resources available, along with the relevant responsibilities and expectations necessary to enable the required services.

The two principal sources of revenue for the Local Government Fund are the proceeds of motor tax and the income from the Household Charge. The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides that income from the charge is to be paid into the Local Government Fund. The proceeds from the household charge are being re-distributed on an equalised basis to local authorities within the context of the annual allocations of general purpose g rants. General purpose grants contribute towards meeting the reasonable cost to local authorities of providing services to their customers. Some &euro;651m in general purpose grants had been allocated to local authorities for 2012. It has been necessary for me to reduce general purpose grant funding to local authorities in the third quarter of 2012 in light of the level of compliance with the household charge.<\/p><p>It is estimated that there are some 1.6 million residential properties potentially liable for the household charge. As such, if collected in full, the household charge has the potential to raise &euro;160 million annually. As of 16 of November 2012 some &euro;107.7 m or over 66% had been collected nationally. A total of &euro;15,695,292 was withheld from the Quarter 3 general purpose grant payment. For county and city councils, this represented a reduction of between 1% and 3% of the total general purpose grant allocation for 2012.<\/p><p>Local authorities can maintain the remainder of their general purpose grant allocation for 2012 through improved household charge compliance. Those authorities achieving a collection rate of 65% nationally will not have a further reduction in their final quarter general purpose grant payment. Local authorities achieving a collection rate of 60-65% will incur a further reduction of 0.5%, while those authorities achieving a compliance rate below 60% will incur a further 1% reduction in their annual allocation.<\/p><p>I am confident that the level of general purpose grants together with other Government grants and subsidies, and income raised from local sources, is appropriate to meet the costs of providing a reasonable level of local authority services to communities.<\/p><p>The information requested is set out in the following table.<\/p><p><table><tr><th><div>Local Authority <\/div><\/th><th><div>Allocation 2011 <br \/>&#8364; <\/div><\/th><th><div>Allocation 2012 <br \/>&#8364; <\/div><\/th><th><div>Quarter 3 2012 Reduction <br \/>&#8364; <\/div><\/th><th><div>Revised 2012 Allocation <br \/>&#8364; <\/div><\/th><th><div>% Reduction in 2012 <\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council <\/div><\/td><td><div>31,522,005 <\/div><\/td><td><div>25,780,316 <\/div><\/td><td><div>343,583 <\/div><\/td><td><div>25,436,733 <\/div><\/td><td><div>1.3% <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Fingal County Council <br \/><\/div><\/td><td><div>26,267,018 <\/div><\/td><td><div>20,455,071 <\/div><\/td><td><div>545,285 <\/div><\/td><td><div>19,909,786 <\/div><\/td><td><div>2.7% <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>South Dublin County Council <\/div><\/td><td><div>21,709,971 <\/div><\/td><td><div>16,963,904 <\/div><\/td><td><div>475,210 <\/div><\/td><td><div>16,488,694 <\/div><\/td><td><div>2.8% <\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRS02000","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Government Reform","counter":2334,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRS02050"},{"type":"question","counter":2335,"qnumday":449,"qnumall":"[51178\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRS02100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he intends to change Section 129 of the Local Government Act 2001 to facilitate the disbanding of the county development board in each local authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":2336,"qnumday":450,"qnumall":"[51179\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRS02200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the powers that county managers have to amend or disband the following agencies which are structures or sub-structures of the county development boards, county childcare committees, joint policing committees and volunteer centres; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":2337,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 449 and 450 together.<\/p><p>  The reforms set out in <i>Putting People First<\/i> will result in changes to current local governance arrangements and include, <i>inter alia<\/i>, the wind-down of City\/County Development Boards.

It will provide extensive provisions for the regulation by the insolvency service of the new personal insolvency practitioners. There will be regulatory provisions, oversight and provisions to ensure there are indemnities to guarantee that where funds are being dealt with, those using personal insolvency practitioners are protected.  As I said in the course of this debate, many of the regulatory mechanisms already exist in other contexts. It is a question of adapting them to the insolvency legislation. A substantial amount of work has been done on that. <br \/><br \/>  There was an issue at one stage as to whether it would be the Central Bank or the insolvency agency that would deal with the regulatory side but in the context of providing a unified focus on the insolvency area it was decided that it would be the insolvency agency.

This total is unchanged from 2011. Applications from nineteen eligible organisations, that is, charities that operate lotteries that were established before 1997, are currently being processed by the Department of Justice and Equality and payments will be made later this year. The total funding available under the Scheme will begin to reduce in 2013 and will be gradually decreased over a period of three years after which the scheme will be discontinued. Recipient organisations were advised of this in early October, in effect giving them more than 12 months notice of this change. The decision to wind down this Scheme has been taken in the context of the requirement for all Government Departments to meet exacting savings targets in the years ahead.<\/p><p>  Funding disbursed under the Charitable Lotteries Scheme is drawn from both the National Lottery surplus and exchequer funding. The Scheme was set up in 1997 to supplement the incomes of charitable organisations that were operating lotteries in competition with the National Lottery. Approximately &euro;114 million has been disbursed under the Scheme since its inception. The amount each organisation receives is determined in proportion to its gross annual sales of relevant lottery products. The criteria for the Scheme do not take account of either the profitability of the lottery or the proportion of the revenue it generates that reaches the charitable cause in whose name the products are sold.  This means that the scheme has not provided any incentive for charities to operate lotteries with a low cost base or to ensure that a high proportion of the revenue generated goes directly to the cause with which the ticket is identified. Such a Scheme can no longer be justified in the current circumstances.<\/p><p>  The gradual phasing out of the Scheme will yield savings of &euro;11 million over the three year period 2013-2015, with a further saving of &euro;6 million each year after 2015 when no further payments will be made. The level of assistance is being reduced gradually in order to minimise the impact on the organisations affected and to afford them an opportunity to consider appropriate action they could take to generate greater net profit from their fundraising activities and to make such changes as they consider beneficial.<\/p><p>  In this context, I am also considering an increase to the current limits on private lottery prizes under the Gaming and Lotteries Act of 1956.  I have asked organisations in receipt of funding under the Charitable Lotteries Scheme to consider this issue and have invited them to make a submission to my Department.

The basic position is that an &#8216;additional increment&#8217; is paid over and above the 21-year pension for each additional year of service above 21 years to a maximum of 31 years.  However, this additional element ceases to be payable when an individual reaches social welfare State Pension age.   <\/p><p>  The detailed position is as follows:  Under the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces Pension Schemes, the minimum service required for an immediate pension and lump sum in the case of NCOs and Privates is 21 years, regardless of age.  Maximum benefits accrue after 31 years.  The 21-year pension consists of the following elements:<\/p><p>(a)a basic flat-rate pension that varies according to rank (&#8364;12,913.19 p.a. for a Corporal as in the specific case of the person referred to); <i>plus<\/i><\/p><p>(b)an addition in respect of military service allowance (MSA) equal to 40% of the MSA rate where discharged since August 1990 (equal to &#8364;2,536.16 p.a. in this case); and<\/p><p>(c)if applicable, fixed % additions to (a) in respect of certain other qualifying payments (e.g. 3% extra for Technician Pay in his specific case). <\/p><p>  All of the above elements are payable for the person&#8217;s lifetime.  However, an &#8216;additional increment&#8217; is also payable at a flat rate for each year of service in excess of 21 years up to a maximum of 31 years. This increment is increased, where appropriate, by the top-up at (c).  Where maximum pensionable service is 31 or more years, as applies in this instance, the MSA top-up is 50% of the rate of MSA (rather than 40%).  In this specific case, his additional increment (inclusive of the top-up at (c)) amounted to &#8364;4,804.84 p.a.  However, this ceases to be payable when the pensioner reaches the qualifying age of 66 under the Social Welfare code for a State Pension Contributory, or if they become entitled to a State Pension (Transition) at the earlier age of 65.  At the same time, the 50% MSA top-up reverts to the 40% rate.<\/p><p>  I am advised that these arrangements are in accordance with the long established principle of integrating occupational pensions with Social Insurance benefits of employees who are in full PRSI class.  This includes NCOs and Privates, who are fully insured for the range of benefits under the Social Welfare Acts such as the State Pension.  &#8216;Integration' means that a person&#8217;s entitlement to Social Insurance benefits such as the State Pension is taken into account when calculating the rate of occupational pension payable.  In effect, integration results in a reduced rate of occupational pension than would otherwise be the case.  In the public service generally, the practical effect of integration is that the maximum occupational pension is 50% of pensionable pay <i>less<\/i> the maximum personal rate of State Pension (Contributory) applicable at retirement date.  The State Pension etc. is regarded as part of the overall pension package payable to the individual.  The occupational pension integrated (combined) with the State Pension makes up the &#8216;total pension&#8217; for full PRSI contributors in the public service. The integration principle applies right across the public service and, indeed, in many areas of the private sector as well as in other countries.<\/p><p>  When the person in question retired on 1 February 2007 (at age 60) from the Defence Forces he had accrued the maximum pensionable service of 31 years and, on that basis, qualified for a significantly higher pension than if he had left after 21 years service.  From that date up until the eve of his 65<sup>th<\/sup> birthday (31 January 2012), his military pension included the additional increment for 31 years&#8217; service and the corresponding MSA top-up, on that date giving a pension rate of &#8364;20,719.08 a year.  On turning 65 (1 February 2012), he qualified for the State Pension (Transition).  In accordance with the arrangements mentioned, the additional elements in respect of his service for 22 &#8211; 31 years ceased to be payable from that date.  Since then, his revised military pension rate has been &#8364;15,606.55 a year, a reduction of &#8364;5,112.53.  These are the gross rates in his case after application of the &#8216;Public Service Pension Reduction&#8217; introduced under emergency legislation in 2011 (the actual amount of which itself has been reduced in this person&#8217;s case by virtue of his lower military pension rate).<\/p><p>  The maximum personal rate of State Pension is currently &#8364;230.30 a week (if under age 80).  This is considerably greater than the actual reduction of &#8364;97.98 a week in this person&#8217;s case under the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces&#8217; pension arrangements on his qualification for the State Pension at age 65.  Indeed, his current combined weekly pension of &#8364;529.39 (i.e. Defence Forces pension of &#8364;299.09 <i>plus<\/i> State Pension of &#8364;230.30) represents a one-third increase on what he was getting alone from his military pension before turning 65.<\/p><p>  The method of integration for these military pensioners is considerably less severe than in other areas of the public service.  This is because elsewhere generally, the integration mechanism begins from the time an occupational pension comes into payment and, as I have already indicated, it effectively caps at 50% of pensionable pay the combined value of the occupational pension plus State pension.  In contrast, for retired pre-April 2004 enlisted personnel such as the person referred to, integration as outlined above does not actually apply at all until the social welfare State Pension becomes payable at age 65 \/ 66.  This could be some (or many) years after the person concerned had retired on pension from the Defence Forces.  Even then, at age 65\/66, the Defence Forces pension plus State Pension actually exceeds the public service maximum of 50% of pensionable pay.  In effect, these military pensioners have what amounts to a partial, and more favourable, form of integration.<\/p><p>  The general issue of integration of occupational pensions in the public service was examined by the <i>Commission on Public Service Pensions. <\/i>  Its final report, published in November 2000, was considered and broadly accepted by Government.  The Commission accepted that integration is a fundamental component in the public service pension framework and was strongly of the view that it should be continued. It did not make any recommendations that would affect the current integration arrangements applicable to retired NCOs and Privates covered by the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces pensions schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRU03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":2463,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRU03200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"&Iacute;oca&iacute;ochta&iacute; Deontais","counter":2462,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRU03150"},{"type":"question","counter":2463,"qnumday":495,"qnumall":"[50858\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRU03200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"c&eacute;n f&aacute;th a nd&uacute;radh le feilmeoir (sonra&iacute; tugtha) nach n-&iacute;ocfa&iacute; &eacute; go dt&iacute; an bhliain seo chugainn faoin sc&eacute;im disadvantage area agus single farm payment; c&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach ndearnadh cigireacht ar a fheilm n&iacute;os t&uacute;isce i mbliana; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2464,"content":"<p>Is iarratas&oacute;ir &eacute; an duine ainmnithe faoi Sc&eacute;im na hAon&iacute;oca&iacute;ochta agus Sc&eacute;im na Limist&eacute;ar faoi Mh&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste.

That National Programme also funded a range of other schemes not included in the OP.  The modest level of EFF co-funding available to Ireland for the period 2007-2013, &euro;42 million over 7 years, meant that all investment needs for the sector could not be included in the OP. A decision was taken by the previous Government to allocate the available co-funding to certain programmes and to fund others from the Exchequer.<\/p><p>In their Interim Evaluation Report conducted in 2011, Fitzpatrick Associates noted the changed economic circumstances facing Ireland since the OP was originally drafted and the impacts this was likely to have on availability of Exchequer funding for measures included within the National Programme.  Fitzpatrick Associates also noted that the measures included in the OP were not likely to be sufficient to draw down the full &euro;42 million allocation from the EFF.  They recommended the amendment of the OP to include most of the measures previously included in the National Programme, to ensure availability of supports to these important areas of the seafood sector and to ensure full draw down of EFF funds.  The recommendations were accepted and a revised OP was submitted to the European Commission in March 2012.  That revised OP must be adopted by Commission Decision and that is awaited.  The revised OP will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website immediately after its adoption.  However, it is important to note that the measures included in the revised OP took effect immediately following its submission to the Commission.<\/p><p>The Interim Evaluation Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:<\/p><p><i>http:\/\/www.agriculture.gov.ie\/fisheries\/seafoodpolicydevelopment\/seafooddevelopmentinireland2007-2013\/<\/i><\/p><p>I have no information available to me on the timing of submission to, or approval by, the European Commission of other Member State&rsquo;s Operational Programmes.  The process of developing a new OP for the period 2014 to 2020 will commence shortly.  The EU Regulation on the new European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) is still under negotiation as part of the CFP reforms.  That Regulation will specify the areas of the seafood sector that may be supported in the next programming period and will specify the criteria that will determine how much of the EMFF fund will be available to Ireland.  These two issues will be central in shaping the new OP.  Consultation with stakeholders will form an important part of the process for preparing the new OP.<\/p><p>EU rules do not permit the carrying over of allocations from one programming period to the next, so strictly speaking no funds were carried over from the previous FIFG fund.  However, depending on the level of drawdown of funds under the programme, the rules do allow for eligible expenditure after the programming period.  This is referred to as N+2.  This was the case with the transition period between the FIFG and the EFF, where expenditure under the FIFG continued for a certain period after 2006.  This may also be the case with the transition period between the EFF and the EMFF.<\/p><p>The 2011 Annual Implementation Report for the Seafood Development Operational Programme 2007-2013 shows that approximately &euro;28 million of the &euro;42 million EFF allocation had been committed up to the end of 2011.  As processing and aquaculture did not become part of the OP until 2012, this spend can be attributed to the catching sector.  The majority of this spend was accounted for by the 2008 Decommissioning Scheme.  Up to 2011, BIM was the implementing agency for all elements of the OP, so all funds spent were disbursed through BIM.<\/p><p>Approximately &euro;14 million of EFF funds remains to be committed over the period from 2012 onwards.  That period may extend up to 2015, if the N+2 rule is invoked.  The table below indicates the breakdown of allocations by EFF priority axis.  These priority axes are specified in the EFF Regulation (1198\/2006).  It is important to note that the Exchequer must provide matching funding, generally at the same level as the EFF contribution.  Beneficiaries must also provide private funding.  The level of private funding required varies from one scheme to another.  Priority Axis 1 includes decommissioning and fleet safety, axis 2 includes marketing, processing and aquaculture, axis 3 includes marine environmental measures, axis 4 includes coastal area development and axis 5 covers technical assistance (implementation costs).

The water services authorities have regard to the Code of Practice on the Fluoridation of Drinking Water 2007 published by the Expert Body on Fluorides and Health to ensure effective and efficient implementation of the technical aspects of the fluoridation of drinking water. The water services authorities also measure the quantity of hydrofluosilicic acid used plus the quantity of water treated in order to calculate the concentration of hydrofluosilicic acid in the water.  The HSE undertakes monthly sampling of tap water and can access the daily records of the water services authorities if an issue arises regarding fluoridation levels.<\/p><p>  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) collects and analyses the monitoring results carried out by water services authorities on drinking water supplies. The most recent EPA report on 'The Provision and Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland' (2010) includes information on water supplies where fluoride parametric values are exceeded. Of the 3,398 samples from public water supplies which were analysed, 74 were above the Irish statutory requirements of 0.8mg\/litre. All but one of these elevated levels was below the EU standard of 1.5mg\/litre. The EPA is not required to collect data where fluoride parametric values is below the statutory requirement. I have asked the HSE to collate this information and I will forward it to the Deputy when it is available.<\/p><p>  Hydrofluosilicic acid is used to fluoridate public water supplies.

All of these publications are in the public domain.<\/p><p>  The balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and continues to be safe and effective in protecting the oral health of all age groups.

Under UHI, everyone will have equal access to a comprehensive package of curative services.  The key changes required to support the reform programme which will pave the way for the introduction of universal health insurance are outlined in the provisions of \"Future Health:  A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012 - 2015\" which was published by the Minister for Health on 15 November 2012.  Earlier this year I appointed Professor John Higgins to chair a Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups. Work is continuing on finalising a Draft Report on the recommendations for submission to the Strategic Board. The Report will be submitted to me when the Board have signed off on it and in turn, I will then bring it to Cabinet.<\/p><p>  Another key building block for UHI is the development of a 'Money Follows the Patient' funding model to replace the current block grant allocation system.  Under 'Money follows the Patient', providers will be paid for the needs they address, the quantity and quality of the services they provide and the outcomes they deliver. They will be liberated, subject to overall budgetary ceilings, to pursue the most cost-effective means of achieving this standard of performance.  Once the key building blocks have been put in place, it will be possible to proceed with implementation of UHI.  Hospitals will then become independent, not-for-profit trusts with managers accountable to their boards. As a precursor to this, it is intended to integrate hospitals into groups on a collaborative administrative basis.<\/p><p>  The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients. As part of the drive to ensure real accountability, an annual budget and employment ceiling will be developed for each group.  Groups will also have the authority to deploy and re-deploy staff across hospitals within the group; this will help to alleviate problems that have arisen in the past in relation to the equitable distribution of health care staff across all hospital sites.  Before Hospital Trusts are finally established, the make-up and functioning of the Groups will be reviewed and if changes prove necessary then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRZ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Service Executive Savings","counter":2727,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRZ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":2728,"qnumday":584,"qnumall":"[50997\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRZ00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Health Service Executive tendering process for payroll services will be offered only to Irish service providers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1014","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2729,"content":"<p>One of the key commitments in the Public Service Reform Plan is to identify and evaluate new business models and opportunities to support the delivery of non-core processes and services.

In 2010 and 2011, the annual TB notification rates in Ireland were 9.2 per 100,000 (420 cases in 2010 and 424 cases in 2011) which is the lowest rate recorded since surveillance of TB began in the 1950s and now categorise Ireland as a low incidence country and represents a drop from 11.3 per 100,000 (480 cases) in 2007.The number of TB notifications for 2012 up to week ending November 9th is 339 cases, which is a decrease of 49 cases compared to the same period in 2011 (388 cases).<\/p><p>  The overall rate of tuberculosis continues to decline and this decrease has prompted a review in the HSE of the continuing requirement for BCG which is currently in progress.<\/p><p>  WHO data indicates that TB notification rates always tend to be higher in inner city locations compared to the general population as is reflected in all major cities worldwide. The rates of TB remain high in parts of inner city Dublin and North Dublin, ranging between 17 per 100,000 to 30 per 100,000 in some areas.However, LHO 7 (comprising mainly Dublin 1 and 7) has shown a decline in rates of TB from 2010 when the rate was 22.9 per 100,000 population (31 cases) to a rate of 14 per 100,000 (19 cases) in 2011. In 2011 a prison outbreak in Dublin increased the TB rate in that local area to 28\/100,000.<\/p><p>  Homeless people are at increased risk of TB, have higher default rates and worse treatment outcomes (including mortality) than the general public. In many industrialised countries, TB rates among the homeless can be up to 20 times higher than the general population.TB has also increased in other marginalised groups such as prisoners and those involved in substance misuse. <\/p><p>  Similar to other low prevalence countries in Europe the disease is more focussed in marginalised groups such as homeless, prisoners, substance misusers, immigrants from countries of high endemicity.

Under this system, most beds are either designated as public beds or private beds: there is a small number of non-designated beds, such as those in Intensive Care Units.  Under the current  framework, private in-patients who occupy public beds in public hospitals are not levied the daily maintenance charge, which ranges from &euro;586 to &euro;1,046 in most public hospitals. <\/p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General reported in 2010 that 45% of in-patients treated privately by their consultants were not charged for their maintenance costs because they were not occupying designated private beds. As part of Budget 2012, I announced that I intended to bring forward legislation to provide for the charging of all private patients in public hospitals, irrespective of whether they occupied a public or a private bed.   In view of  the significant potential cost implications for private health insurers, I subsequently indicated that I would be prepared to postpone implementation of the legislation until 2013 provided that the funds targeted for the current year were raised through a system of improved cashflow from the private insurers.

These operational efficiencies include the removal of on-call arrangements in rosters, where ambulance staff are not actually on duty in ambulance stations or vehicle but may be contacted in the event of a 999 call.  This means that it could take over 20 minutes for an emergency ambulance to leave its station after the crew has been tasked. All parties have accepted that, in accordance with a Labour Court recommendation, providing ambulance services under on-call arrangements should cease. <\/p><p>  The NAS is not a static service. It deploys its resources in a dynamic manner and works on an area and national, rather than a local, basis.  The dynamic deployment of ambulance resources ensures that the nearest appropriate resource is mobilised to the location of any incident, including incidents in the greater Dublin area.  In this context, any removal of overtime inefficiencies will be addressed through more efficient deployment and utilisation of resources.<\/p><p>  As the details of rostering policy for the ambulance service, including details of any regional variation are, operational matters for the HSE, this question has been forwarded to the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRAA04400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":2849,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRBB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":2850,"qnumday":626,"qnumall":"[51470\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRBB00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way he intends to ensure that plans by the Health Service Executive to reconfigure therapy resources such as speech therapy, occupational therapy, and physiotherapy into geographic-based teams will not adversely affect children in special schools in view of the fact that it means that therapists in special schools will now have to travel to mainstream schools; if he will address concerns that this will lead to a reduction in the level of service to children in special schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2851,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has recognised the need to increase the level of consistency and standardisation in the way both early intervention services and services for school-aged children with disabilities are delivered and to this end is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of existing therapy resources to geographic based teams for children (0-18 years).<\/p><p>  The National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years) has been established since 2010.  It is supported by a National Coordinating Group which has representatives from the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills in addition to other key stakeholders. The Programme is based on the recommendations of the <i>Report of the National Reference Group on Multidisciplinary Services for Children aged 5-18 Years<\/i>   produced by representatives of the professions and management involved in delivering multi-disciplinary services to children (available on the HSE website www.hse.ie.) <\/p><p>  The Programme aims to address the following issues in relation to children&#8217;s disability services:<\/p><p>- Inequity of access to services due to inconsistent development of services;<\/p><p>- Environmental change arising from the reorientation towards mainstream education leading to increasing demand for health services to support inclusion;<\/p><p>- Increasing demand for services due to population growth and increased identification of children with disability;<\/p><p>- The need to re-align services with emerging primary care and integrated service structures.<\/p><p>  While the Programme supports the principle of providing access to mainstream education where appropriate, it also recognises a continuing role for special schools. <\/p><p>The Programme is rolling out at national, regional and local level and involves representatives from the health and education sectors, statutory and non-statutory service providers and parents working together to see how current services can best be re-organised.  Implementation of the Programme encompasses two elements:<\/p><p>- Ongoing work in co-ordinating and re-organising early intervention services for children aged 0-5 years into integrated, geographically based teams;<\/p><p>- Supporting the re-organisation of services for school-age children aged 5-18 years according to the same model.<\/p><p>  Decisions regarding any local re-organisation of services are the responsibility of the Local Implementation Groups (LIGs). These include stakeholders such as representatives of the service providers involved, parents and the educational sector representatives. Detailed local area action plans are being developed by the LIGs with the following objectives:<\/p><p>- One clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need;<\/p><p>- Resources used to the greatest benefit for all children and families;<\/p><p>- Health and education working together to support children to achieve their potential.<\/p><p>  The HSE is working very closely with the education sector, which is fully involved in the development of the Programme, to ensure that, from the children&#8217;s and parents&#8217; perspective, the services provided by each sector are integrated. An Education and Health Working Group, comprising representatives of both sectors, is developing a framework for closer working relationships.<\/p><p>  The long term goal of this Programme is to bring consistency in service delivery and a clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need. Implementation of this Programme will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services for all children requiring access to health related supports, regardless of where they live or which pre-school or school they attend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRBB00300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2852,"content":"<p>Question No. 627 answered with Question No. 624.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":2853,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRBB00450"},{"type":"question","counter":2854,"qnumday":628,"qnumall":"[51479\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRBB00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will expedite an appeal of a refusal of the renewal of a medical card in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2855,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRBB00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service","counter":2856,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRBB00650"},{"type":"question","counter":2857,"qnumday":629,"qnumall":"[51483\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRBB00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will give an assurance that the 24 hour ambulance service that operates out of Kenmare Community Hospital, County Kerry, will be retained in its present form in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2858,"content":"<p>The provision of ambulances is a matter for the National Ambulance Service, which are part of the Health Service Executive.

In this regard the Action Plan for Jobs (2012), and the Report of the  Research Prioritisation Steering Group, were published this year.  The aim is to target public investment towards research based on potential for economic return, particularly in the form of jobs; and protecting as much current employment while also creating jobs in new areas of opportunity.  <\/p><p>  I continue to stress that while the economic benefit of research is extremely important, it is imperative that the critical importance of research for policy and research for knowledge is recognised and supported.  Knowledge derived from research is  paramount in providing the evidence-base for better health policies and systems; systems that underpin effective and efficient health service provision.  Such evidence will be a key input to the creation of a fairer, more efficient health system.  <\/p><p>  In acknowledging the potential for research to support economic growth and job creation, I consider that the economic and societal agendas are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  The interaction and interdependence between research for health and research for economic purposes are evident in the research and innovation objectives supported by my Department.<\/p><p>  In 2009 the Action Plan for Health Research 2009-2013, prepared by the Health Research Group was launched.  The plan is in the implementation phase and Subgroups\/Work Streams established under the Health Research Group are progressing the actions therein.  The main purpose of the HRG, which is chaired by my Department, is to ensure that health research in Ireland is coordinated, prioritised, and focussed, and that national policies and strategies for health research are framed strategically in the context of the wider science, technology and innovation agenda.  <\/p><p>  The Health Research Board (HRB) is a statutory body under the aegis of the Department of Health.  The HRB is the lead agency in Ireland supporting and funding health research.  It provides funding, maintains health information systems and conducts research linked to national health priorities.  The aim is to improve people's health, build health research capacity and make a significant contribution to Ireland's knowledge economy.<\/p><p>  A robust clinical research infrastructure and established capacity and expertise are essential in developing and delivering health care.  Through strategic investment, the Health Research Board (HRB), funded by my Department, is developing infrastructure, expertise, and capacity to create an integrated framework for clinical research in Ireland.  This will not only improve patient outcomes, peoples health and health service delivery, but will support growth and jobs here in Ireland.  I opened a Clinical Research Facility in Cork earlier this year which is funded by the HRB.  In addition to this investment in Cork, the HRB is funding the establishment of two facilities in Dublin and Galway.  The Wellcome Trust is co-funding the build in Dublin. These three facilitates will network together using standardised practices and procedures in clinical research conduct thereby greatly increasing Ireland&rsquo;s appeal as a country of choice for performing large-scale multinational clinical research studies.<\/p><p>  The Health Information Bill, which my Department is progressing,  will provide for a range of measures including facilitating a uniform approach for ethics approval for multi site health research projects, not already otherwise governed by statutory regulation and EU law.  It is expected that the Health Information Bill will be ready for publication by mid 2013.<\/p><p>  During the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union key legislative proposals on Clinical Trials and Medical Devices will be progressed. <\/p><p>  My Department is also represented on the Prioritisation Action Group (PAG), established by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and chaired by Minister Sherlock to progress the Report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group.  It is evident that while much of the work being progressed in the area of health research may not necessarily lead to direct commercial opportunity, it can complement and support the work of other sectors in the economy.  <\/p><p>  Senior officials in my Department recently had a very positive meeting with representatives of the organisation mentioned by the Deputy at which health research policy was discussed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRCC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":2895,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRCC01475"},{"type":"question","counter":2896,"qnumday":643,"qnumall":"[51529\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRCC01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding an operation in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry;

The directive strongly promotes the principles of the three Rs (replacement of the use of animals to the greatest extent possible with alternative testing methods, refinement of scientific procedures to improve animal welfare and reduction in numbers of animals used).  Significant changes in this regard are requirements to perform ethical evaluations prior to authorisation of projects using animals and higher standards of care and accommodation.  Many of the provisions set out in the directive are mandatory.  The directive will be transposed into Irish law during November, 2012 and will take effect from 1 January, 2013.  <\/p><p>  My Department sought the views of the public and interested parties in July, 2009 on the proposed directive.  These views informed Ireland&rsquo;s position as negotiations on the proposed directive progressed at EU level.  My Department again sought the views of the public and interested parties in October, 2011 after the adoption of the directive.  Officials of my Department have met with stakeholder groups including animal welfare groups in relation to the Directive's provisions.  My Department has recently met with consultants of the Irish Anti Vivisection Society and with Research and Development establishments in this area.  The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) has also had meetings with stakeholders to inform them of the requirements which will apply from 1 January 2013 and has updated its website with relevant information. <\/p><p>  I appreciate the time and effort devoted by individuals and stakeholder groups in this regard.  The submissions received in response to the first public consultation were particularly welcome as the directive was still under discussion at that stage.  The second public consultation, of necessity, had a different focus given that the directive was already finalised at that stage.  The responses to the second public consultation are, consequently, primarily focused on the nuts and bolts of the transposition process itself and are of particular assistance to the Department in this regard.<\/p><p>  On the matter of scrutiny of the Directive, in July 2009, my Department provided an information note to the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny on the then proposed directive and indicated that the transposition of the directive would be done by Statutory Instrument in order to ensure that this transposition would be implemented within the allowed timeframe.  Failure to do so could delay the considerably enhanced protections the new directive provides for animals - a circumstance which animal protection organisations would, quite correctly, take issue with.  It could also result in EU infringement proceedings against the State during the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the European Union.  I am sure the Deputy would agree that it is important to transpose the considerably enhanced protections afforded to animals in the directive without delay. The joint committee, after consideration of the proposed directive, agreed that no further scrutiny was required, given that the aim of the proposal is to improve the existing 1986 directive and in view of the scope allowed in the directive for member states to decide on practical transposition measures. <\/p><p>  In the run up to the implementation of the directive, the Department and the IMB, which is the designated competent authority responsible for the implementation of the directive, will continue to consider the views of stakeholder groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRCC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2908,"content":"<p>Question No. 647 answered with Question No. 566.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Orthodontic Services","counter":2909,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRDD00250"},{"type":"question","counter":2910,"qnumday":648,"qnumall":"[51577\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000059#WRDD00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress made to date to reduce waiting lists for orthodontic treatment in the mid west region (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2911,"content":"<p>An independent review of Orthodontic Services has been commissioned by the HSE.

The purpose of the report, which I requested, was to identify new possible structures to improve initial teacher education in Ireland so that it is comparable with the best in the world. <\/p><p>  The international panel of education experts recommended that teacher education be provided in six &quot;centres for teacher education&quot;. Currently there are 19 state funded providers of ITE (and three non-state funded) offering more than 40 college programmes in primary and post-primary teaching. The new collaborations recommended by the international panel will mean that a smaller number of centres for ITE exist, but that they offer education across multiple sectors from early childhood to primary, to post primary to adult education. These centres for teacher education will also possess a critical mass in terms of research capacity which is not always possible in smaller institutions. The new configurations will mean strong research bases can be created in each centre.<\/p><p>  The HEA has been requested to consult with the relevant parties and to prepare a detailed plan on how to implement the recommendations of the Panel. I understand that this process has started and a plan is expected by the end of the year.  I will fully consider the implementation plan from the HEA when received.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000060#WRJ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":2970,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000060#WRJ00650"},{"type":"question","counter":2971,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[51170\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000060#WRJ00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if consideration for children with special needs should be incorporated in the enrolment policy of primary schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1106","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":2972,"content":"<p>In accordance with the requirements of  Section 15(d) of the Education Act, 1998 a board of management must publish the admission policy of the school, including the policy of the school relating to admission to or participation by students who have special educational needs.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that last year, I launched a discussion paper on school enrolment.

A school building project is a complex arrangement of contractual relationships between the client, the main contractor, specialist sub-contractors, domestic sub-contractors, suppliers of materials, suppliers of plant etc. In general all sub-contractors employed on school building projects are employed directly by the Main Contractor or indirectly by the Main Contractor through other sub-contractors.<\/p><p><b>Details of Major School Building Projects where the Contractor&rsquo;s obligation to complete the works was terminated (2008 to 2012)<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th><div>County<\/div><\/th><th><div>Roll Number<\/div><\/th><th><div>School Name<\/div><\/th><th><div>Reason for Re-tender<\/div><\/th><th><div>Current Status<\/div><\/th><th><div>Year of Termination<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>Dublin City<\/div><\/td><td><div>20139T<\/div><\/td><td><div>Inchicore NS, Sarsfield Road, Dublin 10<\/div><\/td><td><div>Insolvency Event<\/div><\/td><td><div>Under Construction<\/div><\/td><td><div>2011<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Dun Laoghaire  Rathdown<\/div><\/td><td><div>70030E<\/div><\/td><td><div>Senior College, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Eblana Avenue, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Co Dublin<\/div><\/td><td><div>Insolvency Event<\/div><\/td><td><div>Under Construction<\/div><\/td><td><div>2011<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Galway City<\/div><\/td><td><div>62970K<\/div><\/td><td><div>Col&aacute;iste Iogn&aacute;id SJ Bothar na Mara<\/div><\/td><td><div>Insolvency Event<\/div><\/td><td><div>Under Construction<\/div><\/td><td><div>2011<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Kildare<\/div><\/td><td><div>17662R<\/div><\/td><td><div>Scoil Bhride NS, Kill<\/div><\/td><td><div>Insolvency Event<\/div><\/td><td><div>Project Completed<\/div><\/td><td><div>2009<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Kildare<\/div><\/td><td><div>17674B<\/div><\/td><td><div>SN Aine Naofa, Ard Cloc, Straffan<\/div><\/td><td><div>Termination due to Contractor Default<\/div><\/td><td><div>At tender stage<\/div><\/td><td><div>2012<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Kilkenny<\/div><\/td><td><div>61580P<\/div><\/td><td><div>Loreto Secondary School, Granges Road<\/div><\/td><td><div>Termination due to Contractor Default<\/div><\/td><td><div>At tender stage<\/div><\/td><td><div>2012<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Limerick<\/div><\/td><td><div>13026P<\/div><\/td><td><div>Kilfinane National School<\/div><\/td><td><div>Insolvency Event<\/div><\/td><td><div>Project Completed<\/div><\/td><td><div>2011<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Limerick City<\/div><\/td><td><div>64201T<\/div><\/td><td><div>Ardscoil Ris, North Circular Rd, Limerick<\/div><\/td><td><div>Insolvency Event<\/div><\/td><td><div>Under Construction<\/div><\/td><td><div>2011<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Meath<\/div><\/td><td><div>18016O<\/div><\/td><td><div>S N Columbain, Ballivor<\/div><\/td><td><div>Insolvency Event<\/div><\/td><td><div>Project Completed<\/div><\/td><td><div>2008<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Offaly<\/div><\/td><td><div>17523D<\/div><\/td><td><div>SN Cronain Naofa, Dromakeenan<\/div><\/td><td><div>Insolvency Event<\/div><\/td><td><div>Project Completed<\/div><\/td><td><div>2010<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Roscommon<\/div><\/td><td><div>65100S<\/div><\/td><td><div>Scoil Mhuire, Strokestown, Co Roscommon<\/div><\/td><td><div>Insolvency Event<\/div><\/td><td><div>Project Completed<\/div><\/td><td><div>2011<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000060#WRJ03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Applications","counter":3010,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000060#WRJ03250"},{"type":"question","counter":3011,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[51541\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000060#WRJ03300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when a decision will be made on a Student Universal Support Ireland application in respect of a person (details supplied); when first payment will issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":3012,"content":"<p>Officials in my Department have confirmed with SUSI, the new centralised grant awarding authority, that further supporting documentation was received from the student referred to by the Deputy on 17th November 2012 and his application is currently awaiting review.

Its research provides a valuable input to the development of training course curricula for national training providers and has also informed the development of new competitive funding models of provision to address emerging skills needs.<\/p><p>  The Government's activation policy, 'Pathways to Work', provides for engagement by the Department of Social Protection's INTREO Employment and Support Service with unemployed people, particularly the long-term unemployed, with a view to assisting them in finding jobs or referrals to appropriate education and training.<\/p><p>  To complement this policy, and despite reducing resources, my Department will fund over 450,000 education and training places across the range of provision in the higher education, further education and training sectors in 2012. My Department and its agencies are prioritising places, including in the further education and training sector, specifically for those on the Live Register for 12 months or more.<\/p><p>  In 2012 F&Aacute;S aim to facilitate over 81,000 unemployed individuals through a range of training programmes, that provide industry\/occupational specific skills as well as preparatory type training, to enable a diverse range of unemployed individuals referred to F&Aacute;S by the Department of Social Protection, to gain a recognised qualification, access job opportunities or progression opportunities to further\/higher education\/training. The Department of Social Protection provides appropriate guidance and advice, as required, to unemployed individuals relating to F&Aacute;S courses. The re-alignment of F&Aacute;S training programmes with evolving labour market needs is evidence-based. This is facilitated by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) and other relevant international and national sources including employers.<\/p><p>  More than 10,000 higher education places are being provided in areas of identified skills need under the Springboard programme and 6,500 places are being rolled out under the new Labour Market Education and Training Fund which will be managed by FAS.<\/p><p>  In addition, the joint Government-Industry ICT Action Plan, which has been developed as a direct response to identified ICT skills shortages, contains a comprehensive range of measures to build the domestic supply of ICT graduates, including through the roll out of over 800 places on graduate skills conversion courses from March 2012. A roll-out of a second phase of the conversion courses is scheduled for early 2013.<\/p><p>  The Irish Further Education and Training sector is undergoing major structural reform.  The creation of a new further education and training authority, SOLAS, will facilitate a coherent integrated strategic national response across the further education and training sectors and will ensure a greater focus on the evolving requirements of the unemployed and of industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000060#WRJ03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1042"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3021,"content":"<p>Question No. 268 answered with Question No. 117.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":3022,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000061#WRK00250"},{"type":"question","counter":3023,"qnumday":269,"qnumall":"[51582\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000061#WRK00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the total number of primary schools throughout the country currently dependant on prefabricated accommodation; his plans to address this issue in the next three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":3024,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[51583\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000061#WRK00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the total number of post- primary schools throughout the country currently dependant on prefabricated accommodation; his plans to address this issue in the next three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":3025,"content":"<p>I propose to take questions 269 and 270 together.<\/p><p>  Currently, there are 496 primary schools renting 1,283 prefab units and 47 post-primary schools renting 131 prefab units throughout the country.

The Action Plan for Jobs contains a number of measures which are aimed specifically at the facilitation and incentivisation of national enterprise development from start-ups to growth companies.  The Enterprise Development agencies, under the aegis of my Department, are at the forefront of implementing the Action Plan for Jobs across all regions and will ensure that enterprises can maximise their contribution to economic and jobs growth.<\/p><p>  In 2011, Enterprise Ireland paid over &#8364;5.4m in financial support to its client companies to assist them to develop their business and create employment in South County Dublin including Tallaght.  The New Frontiers Programme, which focuses on developing a person&#8217;s entrepreneurial abilities is co-ordinated by Enterprise Ireland and is providing &#8364;4.25m in funding to enable the Institutes of Technology, including Tallaght IT, to deliver the Programme at a local level.  Participants receive financial support of &#8364;15,000.  So far this year, 23 people participated in Phase 1 of the Programme at Tallaght IT and 15 applicants are currently completing Phase 2.A new Community Enterprise Centre Development Programme was launched this year for the maintenance or establishment of a strong business development function in the Community Enterprise Centres, funded by Enterprise Ireland.  Three Community Enterprise Centres in the Tallaght Area were successful in securing this funding in 2012, including Partas Centres in Killinarden and Brookfield.<\/p><p>  The South Dublin County Enterprise Board provides support for small businesses with 10 employees or fewer in the start-up and expansion phases, to develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level. In 2011 the Board paid out &#8364;357,682 in grant assistance to 38 microenterprise projects in the county.  This year, the Board will continue to be actively involved in economic development in the area and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development.<\/p><p>  From IDA Ireland&#8217;s perspective, Tallaght continues to be well-equipped to compete for potential Foreign Direct Investment, with superb infrastructure facilities at City West and Grange Castle.  IDA announcements in 2012 include Xilinx &#8211; a &#8364;50m expansion in its operations; SAP &#8211; creation of 150 jobs; Microsoft &#8211; US$130m expansion in its operations.  As recently as September 2012, Aspen, announced the creation of 44 jobs at its facility in City West.  <\/p><p>  Ensuring that more micro and small businesses can start up, expand and export is a key pillar of the Government&#8217;s plans for jobs and growth.  That is why the Government has decided to implement an ambitious reform in the delivery of service to small and micro business.  This will include the:-<\/p><p>- Development of a new Small and Micro Business Division within Enterprise Ireland (EI) as a centre of excellence in the provision of supports to the small and micro enterprise sectors; <\/p><p>- Dissolution of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) and the transfer of their functions, assets and liabilities to Enterprise Ireland (EI);<\/p><p>- Establishment of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) to provide a high quality, innovative, &#8220;one-stop-shop&#8221; support service for small businesses within Local Authorities, and providing early access to the services of national bodies and,<\/p><p>- Integration of key local authority business services into the Local Enterprise Office and promotion of a local environment in which enterprise can thrive.<\/p><p>  Pending the introduction of these proposed new arrangements, micro-enterprises employing less than 10 persons, in Tallaght can, as their first port of call, continue to contact South Dublin County Enterprise Board (SDCEB) on: <font color=\"#3F803F\">.<\/font><\/p><p>  To improve access to credit for entrepreneurs and micro-enterprises, and to facilitate the growth and expansion of viable businesses from all industry sectors which have been refused access to credit by banks, the Government recently established the Microfinance Loan Fund.

The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure.<\/p><p>  My objective is to establish a world-class Workplace Relations Service. The Workplace Relations Bill which I hope to publish in early 2013 will contain provisions in respect of the relevant procedures for appeals along the lines already outlined in the policy document &#8216;<i>Legislating for a Worldclass Workplace Relations Service&#8217;<\/i> and also in my presentation before the joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs Enterprise and Innovation last July.  I intend proposing to the Oireachtas that all first instance complaints requiring adjudication will be heard by the Adjudication Officers of the new Workplace Relations Commission and any subsequent appeals will be heard by the Labour Court as a full fresh appeal.  The Labour Court will act as a court of final appeal for all adjudication decisions of the Workplace Relations Commission, subject to the right of either party to bring a further appeal from a determination of the Labour Court to the High Court on a point of law only.<\/p><p>  The WRC will have statutory jurisdiction for facilitating the resolution of disputes under employment, equality and industrial relations legislation, in accordance with best practice and in compliance with international human rights standards.  To ensure that the WRC delivers its services to the highest standards, the Director will be supported by a Registration Service with a suitably qualified and experienced lawyer as Registrar.  It is envisaged that such a Registration Service would be responsible for the receipt, validation and processing of all employment related complaints and the coordination, management and referral of those cases to Hearing.  For example, the Registration Service will check complaints on receipt and reject or redirect incomplete complaints, complaints which are out of time or which are grounded incorrectly.  The Registration Service will have responsibility for steering each case through the system and ensuring it is dealt with efficiently and effectively.<\/p><p>  In this regard, I am happy to report that substantial progress has been made to date and a number of important priority actions have been successfully delivered within the target timescale which will ensure that all employment related complaints are dealt with effectively, efficiently and in a timely manner, including:-<\/p><p>- the introduction of a new single contact portal called &#8220;Workplace Relations Customer Services&#8221; (for information provisions and complaints receipt and registration) which has replaced the five separate entry points, and<\/p><p>- a Single Complaint Form that deals with 100 first instance complaints has replaced the 30 forms previously in use.<\/p><p>  I fully expect the work that I have initiated with regard to the reform of the Workplace Relations Bodies to significantly improve the quality of service to users and I am confident that all employment related complaints will be dealt with in an effective, efficient and timely manner under the new structures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRM02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services","counter":3168,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRM02050"},{"type":"question","counter":3169,"qnumday":323,"qnumall":"[51606\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRM02100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he or any of the State's industrial promotion agencies have been able to assist in having production resumed as a processing plant (details supplied) in County Cavan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":3170,"content":"<p>I understand that a Receiver was appointed to the company concerned on 22 October 2012.  <\/p><p>  I am informed by Enterprise Ireland that they have been in regular contact with the Receiver and are available to provide any possible assistance that the agency can.

This holds for all sectors of the labour market, including the care sector. <\/p><p>  Incentivising the take-up of employment is essentially being achieved by three means:-<\/p><p>- First, the Government is determined to continue to reform the tax and social welfare system to ensure that a person who takes up employment is significantly better off financially then if they remained on social welfare. Our current Jobseekers Benefit and Jobseekers Allowance payments are already designed in such a way as to ensure that persons are incentivised to take up either full-time or part-time employment.  This is achieved by a gradual tapering of the social welfare payment for people who take up part-time employment.  Currently, a person can work up to three days and still have an entitlement to a reduced social welfare payment, with the reduction in the social welfare payment tapered in line with a person&rsquo;s increase in earnings from work.  A person who wishes to work on a part-time basis over a period in excess of three days per week can avail of the Part Time Job Incentive Scheme or the Family Income Supplement Scheme.  People who are more than 12 months unemployed are also entitled to an increased personal tax credit in certain circumstances further increasing the returns to work.<\/p><p>  In addition, reforms to the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes are being introduced to ensure that people in part-time employment are incentivised to take up full-time employment as such opportunities become available.  This includes rebasing the payment week for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit on a five-day week rather than the previous six-day week basis where a person is working for part of the week.  This measure was introduced in July 2012.  And from February 2013 employment on a Sunday will be taken into account when determining the level of entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s payments.  The recognition of Sunday working from the perspective of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and benefit will reduce the amount of jobseeker&rsquo;s payable to casual workers and thereby encourage workers to take up offers of full-time employment rather than combining part-time employment with social welfare payments.  <\/p><p>  In a further effort to improve the financial incentive to take up employment, the Government has halved the lower rate of PRSI until end-2013 on jobs that pay up to &euro;356 per week and exempted low-paid, part-time and seasonal workers with an annual income of less than &euro;10,036 from the Universal Social Charge (increased from &euro;4,004).<\/p><p>  The Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare is examining issues around the operation and interaction of the tax and social welfare systems and may also recommend further measures to improve incentives to take up employment.<\/p><p>- Second, the Government is incentivising employers to hire the long-term unemployed.  The Government has introduced a range of reforms and incentives to support, protect and create jobs, including through the Jobs Initiative in May 2011 which among other measures reduced VAT rates for labour intensive sectors.  The Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme is available to employers who hire persons who have been in receipt of specified social welfare payments for a period of six months or more and the Revenue Tax Assist Scheme is available to employers who hire a person in receipt of those benefits for in excess of 12 months.

This plan sees the normal weekly new claim and renewal intake processed without delay while the backlog is ring-fenced and a focused team assigned to this work with a clear plan for its elimination.<\/p><p>  The first steps taken to permanently eliminate future backlogs in FIS are to put in place sufficient capacity and suitable structures and processes to deal with the weekly intake of work.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  <\/p><p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for the State pension (contributory) easier by disregarding time spent out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme was introduced in and took effect from 1994.   Eligibility for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is conditional on firstly meeting the standard qualifying conditions for State pension. <\/p><p>  Backdating the scheme to 1964 would involve considerable costs.  An analysis undertaken in the 2007 Green Paper on Pensions identified that to backdate the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme to 1953, the year when the unified system of social insurance was introduced in Ireland, would cost the Exchequer in the region of &euro;160m and to 1973\/73, an estimated  &euro;150m.  Costs in relation to this scheme under the current rules, are expected to increase in the coming years due to the increase in female employment rates since 1994. <\/p><p>  In relation to income support, Ireland&rsquo;s pensioners have the lowest consistent poverty rate and are least likely to be at risk of poverty compared to other groups - pointing to the adequacy of the State pension.  Between 2004 and 2010, consistent poverty for older people (those over 65) fell from 3.3% to 0.9%.  The &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate for people in that age group fell from 27.1% to 9.6% over the same period.<\/p><p>  The recently published review of the Social Insurance Fund identified that in the medium to long term, pension related expenditure will account for an increasing proportion of the Social Insurance Fund expenditure - rising from 57% in 2011 to 85% in 2066.    The pensioner support ratio is projected to decline from 5.3 workers for every individual over pension age in 2010 to 3.9 workers by 2020 and to 2.1 workers by 2060. <\/p><p>  In terms of value for money for those who take time out of the workforce, the report confirms that social insurance benefits offer excellent value for money for those:<\/p><p>- on the lower part of the income distribution,<\/p><p>- those with shorter contribution histories, mostly women<\/p><p>- and the self-employed.  <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the changes in the contribution rules and associated rates of payment which were introduced in September 2012, those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories, will continue to obtain the best value for money from the Fund.  This can be of particular benefit to women.  <\/p><p>  In relation to the marriage bar, it should be noted that women affected by the marriage bar are public servants who would not be eligible for the homemakers scheme due to the type of PRSI being paid by them at the time of leaving the workforce. It should be noted that women who do not qualify for a full rate pension may, if their spouse is in receipt of a State pension contributory, receive a qualified adult payment at a higher rate where they satisfy a means test.   <\/p><p>  A State pension non-contributory pension, which is a means tested payment, may also be payable.  Time taken out of the workforce for homemaking and caring duties will continue to be protected by the current disregard.  While my Department will keep the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme under review, any improvements which could result in further costs for the Exchequer could only be considered in a budgetary context.  The Government&rsquo;s priority is to secure economic recovery, promote growth and employment.  To this end, the State must pursue a determined deficit reduction strategy.  Accordingly, there will be an on-going requirement to curtail expenditure in 2013 and in later years. <\/p><p>  The Government is considering the appropriate level of expenditure on the wide variety of schemes and services operated by my Department in 2013 in the context of the forthcoming Budget. The outcome will be announced on Budget Day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRN01900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Welfare Services","counter":3218,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRN01950"},{"type":"question","counter":3219,"qnumday":340,"qnumall":"[50929\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRN02000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reasons for the closing of the community welfare clinic in the Third Age Centre in Summerhill (details supplied) and to detail the way those with restricted mobility or living in poverty can access similar services.","asker":"1080","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":3220,"qnumday":341,"qnumall":"[50930\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRN02100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the cost of maintaining the community welfare clinic in the Third Age Centre in Summerhill (details supplied) and to details any savings generated from its proposed closure.","asker":"1080","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":3221,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 340 and 341 together.<\/p><p>  My Department is very conscious of the need to provide efficient and effective customer services at a local level for all customers of the Department, having regard to the resources that are available.

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.  The estimated expenditure on child benefit for 2012 is around &euro;2 billion and it is paid to around 600,000 families in respect of some 1.15 million children. <\/p><p>  Parents of multiple birth children receive an additional monthly premia paid at one and a half times the monthly child benefit payment rate for each twin and double the monthly payment rate for each child in other multiple births. While Budget 2012 maintained this additional monthly payment, the multiple births grant of &euro;635 paid at birth, at 4 years of age and at 12 years of age was discontinued. <\/p><p>  As a universal payment child benefit assists parents with the cost of raising children and it contributes towards alleviating child poverty. The Government is also conscious that child benefit is an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment. Bearing this in mind, any plans to change the amount paid in respect of such payments will be a matter to be decided in a budgetary context and announced on Budget day.  I do not therefore propose to speculate on any possible approaches to child benefit payment rates changes.  <\/p><p>  With regard to the application process for child benefit, when a parent registers the birth of their child the Department of Social Protection will initiate a child benefit claim. In cases where the parent is not claiming child benefit for another child, such as their first child, a partially completed form is sent to the parent to sign in order to claim the payment. In cases where the parent is claiming child benefit for another child, the new child is added to the child benefit claim and payment begins automatically from the month after the birth. A letter confirming payment is then sent to the parent by the Department. If a parent does not wish to claim their child benefit payment, they can notify the Department in writing to that effect and their claim will be stopped in accordance with their wishes. <\/p><p>  I am conscious that achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including child benefit, raises complex issues about the effectiveness of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment incentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area.

The disallowance\/disqualification grounds, and reason\/s for same, are outlined clearly and are sufficient to enable the appellant to lodge an appeal.<\/p><p>  Persons are advised, in their decision letters, of their right to seek a departmental review of the initial decision and are advised as to how to lodge an appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).<\/p><p>  Where a review is sought, the deciding officer re-examines the case and, taking account of any new facts or evidence, may revise his\/ her decision.<\/p><p>  In 2011, 42% of favourable decisions made following lodgement of appeal applications, were as a result of deciding officers revising their original decisions, which obviated the need for claimants to go through the full appeals process.  These revised decisions arose as a result, in most cases, of new facts or fresh evidence produced by the claimant after the original decision on his\/her claim.  The figures illustrate that the review process is well understood and utilised.<\/p><p>  Customers may provide new information\/evidence at appeal stage, in particular during oral hearings, which may not have been available to the deciding officer at review stage, and could result in a revised decision by an appeals officer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRO00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Applications","counter":3257,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRO00850"},{"type":"question","counter":3258,"qnumday":356,"qnumall":"[51012\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRO00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide an update on the proposed transfer of some of the administration of rent supplement to county councils, and if she has given further consideration to the payment of rent supplement directly to the landlord as a default option.","asker":"1011","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":3259,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 356 and 406 together. <\/p><p>  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 89,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;436 million in 2012.<\/p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant.  Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.  There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.<\/p><p>  However, rent supplement payments can, at the request of the tenant and with the agreement of the Department, be paid directly to the landlord.  If the Department were to introduce a system whereby all rent supplement payments were to be made directly to landlords the efficiency of the scheme would be significantly affected.  For example, the Department would potentially have to create a formal relationship with some 89,000 additional clients, the landlords.  This would involve greater complexity and significant resources to deal with a new set of third parties.  It would not be an effective use of resources to have departmental staff negotiating rental agreements for those with a short term need.<\/p><p>  The Government has effectively two initiatives to deal with long term reliance on rent supplement.  The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is in operation since 2004 and the new Housing Policy Initiative as announced by my colleagues the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Housing &amp; Planning on 16th June 2011.<\/p><p>  In March 2012, the Government approved in principle to transfer responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from my Department, currently provided through rent supplement, to housing authorities using a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Among the main features of HAP is that landlords will be paid directly by the local authority.<\/p><p>  A multi-agency steering group has been established to develop proposals to give effect to this transfer.  The group is chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and consists of representatives from the Departments of Social Protection; Public Expenditure and Reform; Office of the Revenue Commissioners; the County and City Managers Association, and the Housing Agency.  It is planned that pilot testing of HAP arrangements will commence during the second half of 2013 with general roll out and commencement of transfers from January 2014. <\/p><p>  The new arrangements will achieve a key Government commitment of removing barriers to employment and at the same time returning rent supplement to its original purpose of a short-term income support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRO01000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":3260,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRO01050"},{"type":"question","counter":3261,"qnumday":357,"qnumall":"[51023\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRO01100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will expedite an application for carer's allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":3262,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance from the person in question on the 25th October 2012.

With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.<\/p><p>  The National Broadband Plan, which I published recently, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.<\/p><p>  The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country &ndash; specifically:<\/p><p>- 70Mbps &ndash; 100Mbps will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015;<\/p><p>- At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% (and potentially as much as 35%) of the population during the lifetime of the Government; and <\/p><p>- A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country, also during the lifetime of the Government.<\/p><p>  During the preparation of the Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.<\/p><p>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&rsquo; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this mapping exercise.<\/p><p>  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  Until that process is complete, the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention will not be known.<\/p><p>  I would reiterate however, that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including Loughshinny, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRR02800","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":3456,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRR02900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Industry","counter":3455,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRR02850"},{"type":"question","counter":3456,"qnumday":430,"qnumall":"[51101\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRR02900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"with reference to motor trade plates which cost &euro;330, his views on the status of Republic of Ireland trade plates in Northern Ireland and on confiscations in Northern Ireland of cars with legitimate Republic of Ireland trade plates; if in view of the fact that motor trade in this State can involve travel through Northern Ireland; if he will raise this matter at an upcoming meeting of the North South Ministerial Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"997","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":3457,"content":"<p>The legislation in relation to trade plates is provided in section 21 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1992 and the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 1992.<\/p><p>  Trade plates can be used by motor dealers in very limited circumstances in respect of vehicles on which a vehicle licence has not been taken out.

The SLAs will identify the levels of performance expected and resources available, along with the relevant responsibilities and expectations necessary to enable the required services.

The two principal sources of revenue for the Local Government Fund are the proceeds of motor tax and the income from the Household Charge. The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides that income from the charge is to be paid into the Local Government Fund. The proceeds from the household charge are being re-distributed on an equalised basis to local authorities within the context of the annual allocations of general purpose g rants. General purpose grants contribute towards meeting the reasonable cost to local authorities of providing services to their customers. Some &euro;651m in general purpose grants had been allocated to local authorities for 2012. It has been necessary for me to reduce general purpose grant funding to local authorities in the third quarter of 2012 in light of the level of compliance with the household charge.<\/p><p>It is estimated that there are some 1.6 million residential properties potentially liable for the household charge. As such, if collected in full, the household charge has the potential to raise &euro;160 million annually. As of 16 of November 2012 some &euro;107.7 m or over 66% had been collected nationally. A total of &euro;15,695,292 was withheld from the Quarter 3 general purpose grant payment. For county and city councils, this represented a reduction of between 1% and 3% of the total general purpose grant allocation for 2012.<\/p><p>Local authorities can maintain the remainder of their general purpose grant allocation for 2012 through improved household charge compliance. Those authorities achieving a collection rate of 65% nationally will not have a further reduction in their final quarter general purpose grant payment. Local authorities achieving a collection rate of 60-65% will incur a further reduction of 0.5%, while those authorities achieving a compliance rate below 60% will incur a further 1% reduction in their annual allocation.<\/p><p>I am confident that the level of general purpose grants together with other Government grants and subsidies, and income raised from local sources, is appropriate to meet the costs of providing a reasonable level of local authority services to communities.<\/p><p>The information requested is set out in the following table.<\/p><p><table><tr><th><div>Local Authority <\/div><\/th><th><div>Allocation 2011 <br \/>&#8364; <\/div><\/th><th><div>Allocation 2012 <br \/>&#8364; <\/div><\/th><th><div>Quarter 3 2012 Reduction <br \/>&#8364; <\/div><\/th><th><div>Revised 2012 Allocation <br \/>&#8364; <\/div><\/th><th><div>% Reduction in 2012 <\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council <\/div><\/td><td><div>31,522,005 <\/div><\/td><td><div>25,780,316 <\/div><\/td><td><div>343,583 <\/div><\/td><td><div>25,436,733 <\/div><\/td><td><div>1.3% <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Fingal County Council <br \/><\/div><\/td><td><div>26,267,018 <\/div><\/td><td><div>20,455,071 <\/div><\/td><td><div>545,285 <\/div><\/td><td><div>19,909,786 <\/div><\/td><td><div>2.7% <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>South Dublin County Council <\/div><\/td><td><div>21,709,971 <\/div><\/td><td><div>16,963,904 <\/div><\/td><td><div>475,210 <\/div><\/td><td><div>16,488,694 <\/div><\/td><td><div>2.8% <\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRS02000","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Government Reform","counter":3504,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRS02050"},{"type":"question","counter":3505,"qnumday":449,"qnumall":"[51178\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRS02100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he intends to change Section 129 of the Local Government Act 2001 to facilitate the disbanding of the county development board in each local authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":3506,"qnumday":450,"qnumall":"[51179\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRS02200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the powers that county managers have to amend or disband the following agencies which are structures or sub-structures of the county development boards, county childcare committees, joint policing committees and volunteer centres; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":3507,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 449 and 450 together.<\/p><p>  The reforms set out in <i>Putting People First<\/i> will result in changes to current local governance arrangements and include, <i>inter alia<\/i>, the wind-down of City\/County Development Boards.

It will provide extensive provisions for the regulation by the insolvency service of the new personal insolvency practitioners. There will be regulatory provisions, oversight and provisions to ensure there are indemnities to guarantee that where funds are being dealt with, those using personal insolvency practitioners are protected.  As I said in the course of this debate, many of the regulatory mechanisms already exist in other contexts. It is a question of adapting them to the insolvency legislation. A substantial amount of work has been done on that. <br \/><br \/>  There was an issue at one stage as to whether it would be the Central Bank or the insolvency agency that would deal with the regulatory side but in the context of providing a unified focus on the insolvency area it was decided that it would be the insolvency agency. I was optimistic that we would be in a position to bring the amendments before this House on Report Stage but we will have them for the Seanad proceedings.

This total is unchanged from 2011. Applications from nineteen eligible organisations, that is, charities that operate lotteries that were established before 1997, are currently being processed by the Department of Justice and Equality and payments will be made later this year. The total funding available under the Scheme will begin to reduce in 2013 and will be gradually decreased over a period of three years after which the scheme will be discontinued. Recipient organisations were advised of this in early October, in effect giving them more than 12 months notice of this change. The decision to wind down this Scheme has been taken in the context of the requirement for all Government Departments to meet exacting savings targets in the years ahead.<\/p><p>  Funding disbursed under the Charitable Lotteries Scheme is drawn from both the National Lottery surplus and exchequer funding. The Scheme was set up in 1997 to supplement the incomes of charitable organisations that were operating lotteries in competition with the National Lottery. Approximately &euro;114 million has been disbursed under the Scheme since its inception. The amount each organisation receives is determined in proportion to its gross annual sales of relevant lottery products. The criteria for the Scheme do not take account of either the profitability of the lottery or the proportion of the revenue it generates that reaches the charitable cause in whose name the products are sold.  This means that the scheme has not provided any incentive for charities to operate lotteries with a low cost base or to ensure that a high proportion of the revenue generated goes directly to the cause with which the ticket is identified. Such a Scheme can no longer be justified in the current circumstances.<\/p><p>  The gradual phasing out of the Scheme will yield savings of &euro;11 million over the three year period 2013-2015, with a further saving of &euro;6 million each year after 2015 when no further payments will be made. The level of assistance is being reduced gradually in order to minimise the impact on the organisations affected and to afford them an opportunity to consider appropriate action they could take to generate greater net profit from their fundraising activities and to make such changes as they consider beneficial.<\/p><p>  In this context, I am also considering an increase to the current limits on private lottery prizes under the Gaming and Lotteries Act of 1956.  I have asked organisations in receipt of funding under the Charitable Lotteries Scheme to consider this issue and have invited them to make a submission to my Department.

The basic position is that an &#8216;additional increment&#8217; is paid over and above the 21-year pension for each additional year of service above 21 years to a maximum of 31 years.  However, this additional element ceases to be payable when an individual reaches social welfare State Pension age.   <\/p><p>  The detailed position is as follows:  Under the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces Pension Schemes, the minimum service required for an immediate pension and lump sum in the case of NCOs and Privates is 21 years, regardless of age.  Maximum benefits accrue after 31 years.  The 21-year pension consists of the following elements:<\/p><p>(a)a basic flat-rate pension that varies according to rank (&#8364;12,913.19 p.a. for a Corporal as in the specific case of the person referred to); <i>plus<\/i><\/p><p>(b)an addition in respect of military service allowance (MSA) equal to 40% of the MSA rate where discharged since August 1990 (equal to &#8364;2,536.16 p.a. in this case); and<\/p><p>(c)if applicable, fixed % additions to (a) in respect of certain other qualifying payments (e.g. 3% extra for Technician Pay in his specific case). <\/p><p>  All of the above elements are payable for the person&#8217;s lifetime.  However, an &#8216;additional increment&#8217; is also payable at a flat rate for each year of service in excess of 21 years up to a maximum of 31 years. This increment is increased, where appropriate, by the top-up at (c).  Where maximum pensionable service is 31 or more years, as applies in this instance, the MSA top-up is 50% of the rate of MSA (rather than 40%).  In this specific case, his additional increment (inclusive of the top-up at (c)) amounted to &#8364;4,804.84 p.a.  However, this ceases to be payable when the pensioner reaches the qualifying age of 66 under the Social Welfare code for a State Pension Contributory, or if they become entitled to a State Pension (Transition) at the earlier age of 65.  At the same time, the 50% MSA top-up reverts to the 40% rate.<\/p><p>  I am advised that these arrangements are in accordance with the long established principle of integrating occupational pensions with Social Insurance benefits of employees who are in full PRSI class.  This includes NCOs and Privates, who are fully insured for the range of benefits under the Social Welfare Acts such as the State Pension.  &#8216;Integration' means that a person&#8217;s entitlement to Social Insurance benefits such as the State Pension is taken into account when calculating the rate of occupational pension payable.  In effect, integration results in a reduced rate of occupational pension than would otherwise be the case.  In the public service generally, the practical effect of integration is that the maximum occupational pension is 50% of pensionable pay <i>less<\/i> the maximum personal rate of State Pension (Contributory) applicable at retirement date.  The State Pension etc. is regarded as part of the overall pension package payable to the individual.  The occupational pension integrated (combined) with the State Pension makes up the &#8216;total pension&#8217; for full PRSI contributors in the public service. The integration principle applies right across the public service and, indeed, in many areas of the private sector as well as in other countries.<\/p><p>  When the person in question retired on 1 February 2007 (at age 60) from the Defence Forces he had accrued the maximum pensionable service of 31 years and, on that basis, qualified for a significantly higher pension than if he had left after 21 years service.  From that date up until the eve of his 65<sup>th<\/sup> birthday (31 January 2012), his military pension included the additional increment for 31 years&#8217; service and the corresponding MSA top-up, on that date giving a pension rate of &#8364;20,719.08 a year.  On turning 65 (1 February 2012), he qualified for the State Pension (Transition).  In accordance with the arrangements mentioned, the additional elements in respect of his service for 22 &#8211; 31 years ceased to be payable from that date.  Since then, his revised military pension rate has been &#8364;15,606.55 a year, a reduction of &#8364;5,112.53.  These are the gross rates in his case after application of the &#8216;Public Service Pension Reduction&#8217; introduced under emergency legislation in 2011 (the actual amount of which itself has been reduced in this person&#8217;s case by virtue of his lower military pension rate).<\/p><p>  The maximum personal rate of State Pension is currently &#8364;230.30 a week (if under age 80).  This is considerably greater than the actual reduction of &#8364;97.98 a week in this person&#8217;s case under the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces&#8217; pension arrangements on his qualification for the State Pension at age 65.  Indeed, his current combined weekly pension of &#8364;529.39 (i.e. Defence Forces pension of &#8364;299.09 <i>plus<\/i> State Pension of &#8364;230.30) represents a one-third increase on what he was getting alone from his military pension before turning 65.<\/p><p>  The method of integration for these military pensioners is considerably less severe than in other areas of the public service.  This is because elsewhere generally, the integration mechanism begins from the time an occupational pension comes into payment and, as I have already indicated, it effectively caps at 50% of pensionable pay the combined value of the occupational pension plus State pension.  In contrast, for retired pre-April 2004 enlisted personnel such as the person referred to, integration as outlined above does not actually apply at all until the social welfare State Pension becomes payable at age 65 \/ 66.  This could be some (or many) years after the person concerned had retired on pension from the Defence Forces.  Even then, at age 65\/66, the Defence Forces pension plus State Pension actually exceeds the public service maximum of 50% of pensionable pay.  In effect, these military pensioners have what amounts to a partial, and more favourable, form of integration.<\/p><p>  The general issue of integration of occupational pensions in the public service was examined by the <i>Commission on Public Service Pensions. <\/i>  Its final report, published in November 2000, was considered and broadly accepted by Government.  The Commission accepted that integration is a fundamental component in the public service pension framework and was strongly of the view that it should be continued. It did not make any recommendations that would affect the current integration arrangements applicable to retired NCOs and Privates covered by the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces pensions schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRU03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":3633,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRU03200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"&Iacute;oca&iacute;ochta&iacute; Deontais","counter":3632,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRU03150"},{"type":"question","counter":3633,"qnumday":495,"qnumall":"[50858\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRU03200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"c&eacute;n f&aacute;th a nd&uacute;radh le feilmeoir (sonra&iacute; tugtha) nach n-&iacute;ocfa&iacute; &eacute; go dt&iacute; an bhliain seo chugainn faoin sc&eacute;im disadvantage area agus single farm payment; c&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach ndearnadh cigireacht ar a fheilm n&iacute;os t&uacute;isce i mbliana; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":3634,"content":"<p>Is iarratas&oacute;ir &eacute; an duine ainmnithe faoi Sc&eacute;im na hAon&iacute;oca&iacute;ochta agus Sc&eacute;im na Limist&eacute;ar faoi Mh&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste.

That National Programme also funded a range of other schemes not included in the OP.  The modest level of EFF co-funding available to Ireland for the period 2007-2013, &euro;42 million over 7 years, meant that all investment needs for the sector could not be included in the OP. A decision was taken by the previous Government to allocate the available co-funding to certain programmes and to fund others from the Exchequer.<\/p><p>In their Interim Evaluation Report conducted in 2011, Fitzpatrick Associates noted the changed economic circumstances facing Ireland since the OP was originally drafted and the impacts this was likely to have on availability of Exchequer funding for measures included within the National Programme.  Fitzpatrick Associates also noted that the measures included in the OP were not likely to be sufficient to draw down the full &euro;42 million allocation from the EFF.  They recommended the amendment of the OP to include most of the measures previously included in the National Programme, to ensure availability of supports to these important areas of the seafood sector and to ensure full draw down of EFF funds.  The recommendations were accepted and a revised OP was submitted to the European Commission in March 2012.  That revised OP must be adopted by Commission Decision and that is awaited.  The revised OP will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website immediately after its adoption.  However, it is important to note that the measures included in the revised OP took effect immediately following its submission to the Commission.<\/p><p>The Interim Evaluation Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:<\/p><p><i>http:\/\/www.agriculture.gov.ie\/fisheries\/seafoodpolicydevelopment\/seafooddevelopmentinireland2007-2013\/<\/i><\/p><p>I have no information available to me on the timing of submission to, or approval by, the European Commission of other Member State&rsquo;s Operational Programmes.  The process of developing a new OP for the period 2014 to 2020 will commence shortly.  The EU Regulation on the new European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) is still under negotiation as part of the CFP reforms.  That Regulation will specify the areas of the seafood sector that may be supported in the next programming period and will specify the criteria that will determine how much of the EMFF fund will be available to Ireland.  These two issues will be central in shaping the new OP.  Consultation with stakeholders will form an important part of the process for preparing the new OP.<\/p><p>EU rules do not permit the carrying over of allocations from one programming period to the next, so strictly speaking no funds were carried over from the previous FIFG fund.  However, depending on the level of drawdown of funds under the programme, the rules do allow for eligible expenditure after the programming period.  This is referred to as N+2.  This was the case with the transition period between the FIFG and the EFF, where expenditure under the FIFG continued for a certain period after 2006.  This may also be the case with the transition period between the EFF and the EMFF.<\/p><p>The 2011 Annual Implementation Report for the Seafood Development Operational Programme 2007-2013 shows that approximately &euro;28 million of the &euro;42 million EFF allocation had been committed up to the end of 2011.  As processing and aquaculture did not become part of the OP until 2012, this spend can be attributed to the catching sector.  The majority of this spend was accounted for by the 2008 Decommissioning Scheme.  Up to 2011, BIM was the implementing agency for all elements of the OP, so all funds spent were disbursed through BIM.<\/p><p>Approximately &euro;14 million of EFF funds remains to be committed over the period from 2012 onwards.  That period may extend up to 2015, if the N+2 rule is invoked.  The table below indicates the breakdown of allocations by EFF priority axis.  These priority axes are specified in the EFF Regulation (1198\/2006).  It is important to note that the Exchequer must provide matching funding, generally at the same level as the EFF contribution.  Beneficiaries must also provide private funding.  The level of private funding required varies from one scheme to another.  Priority Axis 1 includes decommissioning and fleet safety, axis 2 includes marketing, processing and aquaculture, axis 3 includes marine environmental measures, axis 4 includes coastal area development and axis 5 covers technical assistance (implementation costs).

The water services authorities have regard to the Code of Practice on the Fluoridation of Drinking Water 2007 published by the Expert Body on Fluorides and Health to ensure effective and efficient implementation of the technical aspects of the fluoridation of drinking water. The water services authorities also measure the quantity of hydrofluosilicic acid used plus the quantity of water treated in order to calculate the concentration of hydrofluosilicic acid in the water.  The HSE undertakes monthly sampling of tap water and can access the daily records of the water services authorities if an issue arises regarding fluoridation levels.<\/p><p>  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) collects and analyses the monitoring results carried out by water services authorities on drinking water supplies. The most recent EPA report on 'The Provision and Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland' (2010) includes information on water supplies where fluoride parametric values are exceeded. Of the 3,398 samples from public water supplies which were analysed, 74 were above the Irish statutory requirements of 0.8mg\/litre. All but one of these elevated levels was below the EU standard of 1.5mg\/litre. The EPA is not required to collect data where fluoride parametric values is below the statutory requirement. I have asked the HSE to collate this information and I will forward it to the Deputy when it is available.<\/p><p>  Hydrofluosilicic acid is used to fluoridate public water supplies.

All of these publications are in the public domain.<\/p><p>  The balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and continues to be safe and effective in protecting the oral health of all age groups.

Under UHI, everyone will have equal access to a comprehensive package of curative services.  The key changes required to support the reform programme which will pave the way for the introduction of universal health insurance are outlined in the provisions of \"Future Health:  A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012 - 2015\" which was published by the Minister for Health on 15 November 2012.  Earlier this year I appointed Professor John Higgins to chair a Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups. Work is continuing on finalising a Draft Report on the recommendations for submission to the Strategic Board. The Report will be submitted to me when the Board have signed off on it and in turn, I will then bring it to Cabinet.<\/p><p>  Another key building block for UHI is the development of a 'Money Follows the Patient' funding model to replace the current block grant allocation system.  Under 'Money follows the Patient', providers will be paid for the needs they address, the quantity and quality of the services they provide and the outcomes they deliver. They will be liberated, subject to overall budgetary ceilings, to pursue the most cost-effective means of achieving this standard of performance.  Once the key building blocks have been put in place, it will be possible to proceed with implementation of UHI.  Hospitals will then become independent, not-for-profit trusts with managers accountable to their boards. As a precursor to this, it is intended to integrate hospitals into groups on a collaborative administrative basis.<\/p><p>  The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients. As part of the drive to ensure real accountability, an annual budget and employment ceiling will be developed for each group.  Groups will also have the authority to deploy and re-deploy staff across hospitals within the group; this will help to alleviate problems that have arisen in the past in relation to the equitable distribution of health care staff across all hospital sites.  Before Hospital Trusts are finally established, the make-up and functioning of the Groups will be reviewed and if changes prove necessary then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRZ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Service Executive Savings","counter":3897,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRZ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":3898,"qnumday":584,"qnumall":"[50997\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRZ00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Health Service Executive tendering process for payroll services will be offered only to Irish service providers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1014","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3899,"content":"<p>One of the key commitments in the Public Service Reform Plan is to identify and evaluate new business models and opportunities to support the delivery of non-core processes and services.

In 2010 and 2011, the annual TB notification rates in Ireland were 9.2 per 100,000 (420 cases in 2010 and 424 cases in 2011) which is the lowest rate recorded since surveillance of TB began in the 1950s and now categorise Ireland as a low incidence country and represents a drop from 11.3 per 100,000 (480 cases) in 2007.The number of TB notifications for 2012 up to week ending November 9th is 339 cases, which is a decrease of 49 cases compared to the same period in 2011 (388 cases).<\/p><p>  The overall rate of tuberculosis continues to decline and this decrease has prompted a review in the HSE of the continuing requirement for BCG which is currently in progress.<\/p><p>  WHO data indicates that TB notification rates always tend to be higher in inner city locations compared to the general population as is reflected in all major cities worldwide. The rates of TB remain high in parts of inner city Dublin and North Dublin, ranging between 17 per 100,000 to 30 per 100,000 in some areas.However, LHO 7 (comprising mainly Dublin 1 and 7) has shown a decline in rates of TB from 2010 when the rate was 22.9 per 100,000 population (31 cases) to a rate of 14 per 100,000 (19 cases) in 2011. In 2011 a prison outbreak in Dublin increased the TB rate in that local area to 28\/100,000.<\/p><p>  Homeless people are at increased risk of TB, have higher default rates and worse treatment outcomes (including mortality) than the general public. In many industrialised countries, TB rates among the homeless can be up to 20 times higher than the general population.TB has also increased in other marginalised groups such as prisoners and those involved in substance misuse. <\/p><p>  Similar to other low prevalence countries in Europe the disease is more focussed in marginalised groups such as homeless, prisoners, substance misusers, immigrants from countries of high endemicity.

Under this system, most beds are either designated as public beds or private beds: there is a small number of non-designated beds, such as those in Intensive Care Units.  Under the current  framework, private in-patients who occupy public beds in public hospitals are not levied the daily maintenance charge, which ranges from &euro;586 to &euro;1,046 in most public hospitals. <\/p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General reported in 2010 that 45% of in-patients treated privately by their consultants were not charged for their maintenance costs because they were not occupying designated private beds. As part of Budget 2012, I announced that I intended to bring forward legislation to provide for the charging of all private patients in public hospitals, irrespective of whether they occupied a public or a private bed.   In view of  the significant potential cost implications for private health insurers, I subsequently indicated that I would be prepared to postpone implementation of the legislation until 2013 provided that the funds targeted for the current year were raised through a system of improved cashflow from the private insurers.

These operational efficiencies include the removal of on-call arrangements in rosters, where ambulance staff are not actually on duty in ambulance stations or vehicle but may be contacted in the event of a 999 call.  This means that it could take over 20 minutes for an emergency ambulance to leave its station after the crew has been tasked. All parties have accepted that, in accordance with a Labour Court recommendation, providing ambulance services under on-call arrangements should cease. <\/p><p>  The NAS is not a static service. It deploys its resources in a dynamic manner and works on an area and national, rather than a local, basis.  The dynamic deployment of ambulance resources ensures that the nearest appropriate resource is mobilised to the location of any incident, including incidents in the greater Dublin area.  In this context, any removal of overtime inefficiencies will be addressed through more efficient deployment and utilisation of resources.<\/p><p>  As the details of rostering policy for the ambulance service, including details of any regional variation are, operational matters for the HSE, this question has been forwarded to the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRAA04400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":4019,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRBB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":4020,"qnumday":626,"qnumall":"[51470\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRBB00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way he intends to ensure that plans by the Health Service Executive to reconfigure therapy resources such as speech therapy, occupational therapy, and physiotherapy into geographic-based teams will not adversely affect children in special schools in view of the fact that it means that therapists in special schools will now have to travel to mainstream schools; if he will address concerns that this will lead to a reduction in the level of service to children in special schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":4021,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has recognised the need to increase the level of consistency and standardisation in the way both early intervention services and services for school-aged children with disabilities are delivered and to this end is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of existing therapy resources to geographic based teams for children (0-18 years).<\/p><p>  The National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years) has been established since 2010.  It is supported by a National Coordinating Group which has representatives from the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills in addition to other key stakeholders. The Programme is based on the recommendations of the <i>Report of the National Reference Group on Multidisciplinary Services for Children aged 5-18 Years<\/i>   produced by representatives of the professions and management involved in delivering multi-disciplinary services to children (available on the HSE website www.hse.ie.) <\/p><p>  The Programme aims to address the following issues in relation to children&#8217;s disability services:<\/p><p>- Inequity of access to services due to inconsistent development of services;<\/p><p>- Environmental change arising from the reorientation towards mainstream education leading to increasing demand for health services to support inclusion;<\/p><p>- Increasing demand for services due to population growth and increased identification of children with disability;<\/p><p>- The need to re-align services with emerging primary care and integrated service structures.<\/p><p>  While the Programme supports the principle of providing access to mainstream education where appropriate, it also recognises a continuing role for special schools. <\/p><p>The Programme is rolling out at national, regional and local level and involves representatives from the health and education sectors, statutory and non-statutory service providers and parents working together to see how current services can best be re-organised.  Implementation of the Programme encompasses two elements:<\/p><p>- Ongoing work in co-ordinating and re-organising early intervention services for children aged 0-5 years into integrated, geographically based teams;<\/p><p>- Supporting the re-organisation of services for school-age children aged 5-18 years according to the same model.<\/p><p>  Decisions regarding any local re-organisation of services are the responsibility of the Local Implementation Groups (LIGs). These include stakeholders such as representatives of the service providers involved, parents and the educational sector representatives. Detailed local area action plans are being developed by the LIGs with the following objectives:<\/p><p>- One clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need;<\/p><p>- Resources used to the greatest benefit for all children and families;<\/p><p>- Health and education working together to support children to achieve their potential.<\/p><p>  The HSE is working very closely with the education sector, which is fully involved in the development of the Programme, to ensure that, from the children&#8217;s and parents&#8217; perspective, the services provided by each sector are integrated. An Education and Health Working Group, comprising representatives of both sectors, is developing a framework for closer working relationships.<\/p><p>  The long term goal of this Programme is to bring consistency in service delivery and a clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need. Implementation of this Programme will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services for all children requiring access to health related supports, regardless of where they live or which pre-school or school they attend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRBB00300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":4022,"content":"<p>Question No. 627 answered with Question No. 624.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":4023,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRBB00450"},{"type":"question","counter":4024,"qnumday":628,"qnumall":"[51479\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRBB00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will expedite an appeal of a refusal of the renewal of a medical card in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":4025,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRBB00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service","counter":4026,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRBB00650"},{"type":"question","counter":4027,"qnumday":629,"qnumall":"[51483\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRBB00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will give an assurance that the 24 hour ambulance service that operates out of Kenmare Community Hospital, County Kerry, will be retained in its present form in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":4028,"content":"<p>The provision of ambulances is a matter for the National Ambulance Service, which are part of the Health Service Executive.

In this regard the Action Plan for Jobs (2012), and the Report of the  Research Prioritisation Steering Group, were published this year.  The aim is to target public investment towards research based on potential for economic return, particularly in the form of jobs; and protecting as much current employment while also creating jobs in new areas of opportunity.  <\/p><p>  I continue to stress that while the economic benefit of research is extremely important, it is imperative that the critical importance of research for policy and research for knowledge is recognised and supported.  Knowledge derived from research is  paramount in providing the evidence-base for better health policies and systems; systems that underpin effective and efficient health service provision.  Such evidence will be a key input to the creation of a fairer, more efficient health system.  <\/p><p>  In acknowledging the potential for research to support economic growth and job creation, I consider that the economic and societal agendas are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  The interaction and interdependence between research for health and research for economic purposes are evident in the research and innovation objectives supported by my Department.<\/p><p>  In 2009 the Action Plan for Health Research 2009-2013, prepared by the Health Research Group was launched.  The plan is in the implementation phase and Subgroups\/Work Streams established under the Health Research Group are progressing the actions therein.  The main purpose of the HRG, which is chaired by my Department, is to ensure that health research in Ireland is coordinated, prioritised, and focussed, and that national policies and strategies for health research are framed strategically in the context of the wider science, technology and innovation agenda.  <\/p><p>  The Health Research Board (HRB) is a statutory body under the aegis of the Department of Health.  The HRB is the lead agency in Ireland supporting and funding health research.  It provides funding, maintains health information systems and conducts research linked to national health priorities.  The aim is to improve people's health, build health research capacity and make a significant contribution to Ireland's knowledge economy.<\/p><p>  A robust clinical research infrastructure and established capacity and expertise are essential in developing and delivering health care.  Through strategic investment, the Health Research Board (HRB), funded by my Department, is developing infrastructure, expertise, and capacity to create an integrated framework for clinical research in Ireland.  This will not only improve patient outcomes, peoples health and health service delivery, but will support growth and jobs here in Ireland.  I opened a Clinical Research Facility in Cork earlier this year which is funded by the HRB.  In addition to this investment in Cork, the HRB is funding the establishment of two facilities in Dublin and Galway.  The Wellcome Trust is co-funding the build in Dublin. These three facilitates will network together using standardised practices and procedures in clinical research conduct thereby greatly increasing Ireland&rsquo;s appeal as a country of choice for performing large-scale multinational clinical research studies.<\/p><p>  The Health Information Bill, which my Department is progressing,  will provide for a range of measures including facilitating a uniform approach for ethics approval for multi site health research projects, not already otherwise governed by statutory regulation and EU law.  It is expected that the Health Information Bill will be ready for publication by mid 2013.<\/p><p>  During the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union key legislative proposals on Clinical Trials and Medical Devices will be progressed. <\/p><p>  My Department is also represented on the Prioritisation Action Group (PAG), established by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and chaired by Minister Sherlock to progress the Report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group.  It is evident that while much of the work being progressed in the area of health research may not necessarily lead to direct commercial opportunity, it can complement and support the work of other sectors in the economy.  <\/p><p>  Senior officials in my Department recently had a very positive meeting with representatives of the organisation mentioned by the Deputy at which health research policy was discussed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRCC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":4065,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRCC01475"},{"type":"question","counter":4066,"qnumday":643,"qnumall":"[51529\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRCC01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding an operation in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry;

The directive strongly promotes the principles of the three Rs (replacement of the use of animals to the greatest extent possible with alternative testing methods, refinement of scientific procedures to improve animal welfare and reduction in numbers of animals used).  Significant changes in this regard are requirements to perform ethical evaluations prior to authorisation of projects using animals and higher standards of care and accommodation.  Many of the provisions set out in the directive are mandatory.  The directive will be transposed into Irish law during November, 2012 and will take effect from 1 January, 2013.  <\/p><p>  My Department sought the views of the public and interested parties in July, 2009 on the proposed directive.  These views informed Ireland&rsquo;s position as negotiations on the proposed directive progressed at EU level.  My Department again sought the views of the public and interested parties in October, 2011 after the adoption of the directive.  Officials of my Department have met with stakeholder groups including animal welfare groups in relation to the Directive's provisions.  My Department has recently met with consultants of the Irish Anti Vivisection Society and with Research and Development establishments in this area.  The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) has also had meetings with stakeholders to inform them of the requirements which will apply from 1 January 2013 and has updated its website with relevant information. <\/p><p>  I appreciate the time and effort devoted by individuals and stakeholder groups in this regard.  The submissions received in response to the first public consultation were particularly welcome as the directive was still under discussion at that stage.  The second public consultation, of necessity, had a different focus given that the directive was already finalised at that stage.  The responses to the second public consultation are, consequently, primarily focused on the nuts and bolts of the transposition process itself and are of particular assistance to the Department in this regard.<\/p><p>  On the matter of scrutiny of the Directive, in July 2009, my Department provided an information note to the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny on the then proposed directive and indicated that the transposition of the directive would be done by Statutory Instrument in order to ensure that this transposition would be implemented within the allowed timeframe.  Failure to do so could delay the considerably enhanced protections the new directive provides for animals - a circumstance which animal protection organisations would, quite correctly, take issue with.  It could also result in EU infringement proceedings against the State during the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the European Union.  I am sure the Deputy would agree that it is important to transpose the considerably enhanced protections afforded to animals in the directive without delay. The joint committee, after consideration of the proposed directive, agreed that no further scrutiny was required, given that the aim of the proposal is to improve the existing 1986 directive and in view of the scope allowed in the directive for member states to decide on practical transposition measures. <\/p><p>  In the run up to the implementation of the directive, the Department and the IMB, which is the designated competent authority responsible for the implementation of the directive, will continue to consider the views of stakeholder groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRCC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":4078,"content":"<p>Question No. 647 answered with Question No. 566.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Orthodontic Services","counter":4079,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRDD00250"},{"type":"question","counter":4080,"qnumday":648,"qnumall":"[51577\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000062#WRDD00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress made to date to reduce waiting lists for orthodontic treatment in the mid west region (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":4081,"content":"<p>An independent review of Orthodontic Services has been commissioned by the HSE.

The Action Plan for Jobs contains a number of measures which are aimed specifically at the facilitation and incentivisation of national enterprise development from start-ups to growth companies.  The Enterprise Development agencies, under the aegis of my Department, are at the forefront of implementing the Action Plan for Jobs across all regions and will ensure that enterprises can maximise their contribution to economic and jobs growth.<\/p><p>  In 2011, Enterprise Ireland paid over &#8364;5.4m in financial support to its client companies to assist them to develop their business and create employment in South County Dublin including Tallaght.  The New Frontiers Programme, which focuses on developing a person&#8217;s entrepreneurial abilities is co-ordinated by Enterprise Ireland and is providing &#8364;4.25m in funding to enable the Institutes of Technology, including Tallaght IT, to deliver the Programme at a local level.  Participants receive financial support of &#8364;15,000.  So far this year, 23 people participated in Phase 1 of the Programme at Tallaght IT and 15 applicants are currently completing Phase 2.A new Community Enterprise Centre Development Programme was launched this year for the maintenance or establishment of a strong business development function in the Community Enterprise Centres, funded by Enterprise Ireland.  Three Community Enterprise Centres in the Tallaght Area were successful in securing this funding in 2012, including Partas Centres in Killinarden and Brookfield.<\/p><p>  The South Dublin County Enterprise Board provides support for small businesses with 10 employees or fewer in the start-up and expansion phases, to develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level. In 2011 the Board paid out &#8364;357,682 in grant assistance to 38 microenterprise projects in the county.  This year, the Board will continue to be actively involved in economic development in the area and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development.<\/p><p>  From IDA Ireland&#8217;s perspective, Tallaght continues to be well-equipped to compete for potential Foreign Direct Investment, with superb infrastructure facilities at City West and Grange Castle.  IDA announcements in 2012 include Xilinx &#8211; a &#8364;50m expansion in its operations; SAP &#8211; creation of 150 jobs; Microsoft &#8211; US$130m expansion in its operations.  As recently as September 2012, Aspen, announced the creation of 44 jobs at its facility in City West.  <\/p><p>  Ensuring that more micro and small businesses can start up, expand and export is a key pillar of the Government&#8217;s plans for jobs and growth.  That is why the Government has decided to implement an ambitious reform in the delivery of service to small and micro business.  This will include the:-<\/p><p>- Development of a new Small and Micro Business Division within Enterprise Ireland (EI) as a centre of excellence in the provision of supports to the small and micro enterprise sectors; <\/p><p>- Dissolution of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) and the transfer of their functions, assets and liabilities to Enterprise Ireland (EI);<\/p><p>- Establishment of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) to provide a high quality, innovative, &#8220;one-stop-shop&#8221; support service for small businesses within Local Authorities, and providing early access to the services of national bodies and,<\/p><p>- Integration of key local authority business services into the Local Enterprise Office and promotion of a local environment in which enterprise can thrive.<\/p><p>  Pending the introduction of these proposed new arrangements, micro-enterprises employing less than 10 persons, in Tallaght can, as their first port of call, continue to contact South Dublin County Enterprise Board (SDCEB) on: <font color=\"#3F803F\">.<\/font><\/p><p>  To improve access to credit for entrepreneurs and micro-enterprises, and to facilitate the growth and expansion of viable businesses from all industry sectors which have been refused access to credit by banks, the Government recently established the Microfinance Loan Fund.  The Fund is open to entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs of all ages, across the country. <\/p><p>  Microfinance Ireland, (MFI), the company set up to operate the Fund, is working closely with the CEBs and Enterprise Ireland and are very conscious of the particular difficulties entrepreneurs face with regard to credit history, previous business experience etc. and where they can assist entrepreneurs, they will do so.  However, the potential viability of the business proposal is the dominant factor in any credit decision made by Microfinance Ireland.<\/p><p>  I am confident that the measures outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs, together with the initiatives being pursued by the State Agencies will ensure the creation of enterprise development and employment opportunities for Tallaght and the surrounding area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000063#WRM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":4139,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000063#WRM00750"},{"type":"question","counter":4140,"qnumday":316,"qnumall":"[51201\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000063#WRM00800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the number of jobs announced by the Industrial Development Agency; the number of jobs created in IDA supported companies and the value of grants awarded and the value of grants refunded to the IDA for each of the past five years.","asker":"1080","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":4141,"content":"<p>Details of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s investment announcements, including potential job numbers since 2007, are available on the IDA website - <i>www.idaireland.com<\/i><\/p><p>The Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey reports on job gains and losses in companies that are supported by the industrial development agencies.

As independent quasi-judicial bodies, I have no role in the day-to-day exercise of their functions. <\/p><p>  If an employee considers that s\/he has been unfairly dismissed, s\/he may submit a claim for redress under the Unfair Dismissals Acts to a Rights Commissioner or a claim may be submitted directly to the EAT.  <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Where a claim is heard by a Rights Commissioner under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, the Rights Commissioner will issue a recommendation and either party may appeal that recommendation to the EAT.  The appeal must be made within 6 weeks of the date on which the Rights Commissioner communicated the recommendation to the parties.  This is done by giving written notice of appeal within that period to the EAT on the prescribed form.<\/font>  In communicating Rights Commissioners&#8217; recommendations, it is standard practice to include with the recommendations, information on how an appeal of recommendation can be made.<\/p><p>  Where a claim or appeal is heard by the EAT under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, the Tribunal will issue a determination.  There is a right of appeal by either party to the Circuit Court from a determination of the Tribunal.  <\/p><p>  The statutory time limits for appealing the recommendation of a Rights Commissioner to the EAT are provided for in the Unfair Dismissal Acts and the EAT does not have any discretion to extend these time limits in any circumstances. <\/p><p>  I am fully aware of the specific issues and circumstances surrounding your constituent&#8217;s complaint.  Having made enquiries into this matter, I understand that Officials within my Department have conducted a thorough scrutiny of the facts in relation to this case and letters have issued, in both November 2011 and February 2012, in respect of earlier complaints made by your constituent in relation to this matter.  I am informed that there has been no change in facts of this case since then.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, I have addressed the specific issues concerning your constituent&#8217;s present complaint in my reply which will issue to you in response to the representations you have made on his behalf in relation to the matter (Ref: 121035\/MIN refers). <\/p><p>  As you may be aware, I am currently undertaking a root and branch reform of the existing Workplace Relations Bodies.  The Reform Programme I have commenced will deliver a two tier Workplace Relations structure by merging the activities of the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the EAT and the Labour Court into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).  The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure.<\/p><p>  My objective is to establish a world-class Workplace Relations Service. The Workplace Relations Bill which I hope to publish in early 2013 will contain provisions in respect of the relevant procedures for appeals along the lines already outlined in the policy document &#8216;<i>Legislating for a Worldclass Workplace Relations Service&#8217;<\/i> and also in my presentation before the joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs Enterprise and Innovation last July.  I intend proposing to the Oireachtas that all first instance complaints requiring adjudication will be heard by the Adjudication Officers of the new Workplace Relations Commission and any subsequent appeals will be heard by the Labour Court as a full fresh appeal.  The Labour Court will act as a court of final appeal for all adjudication decisions of the Workplace Relations Commission, subject to the right of either party to bring a further appeal from a determination of the Labour Court to the High Court on a point of law only.<\/p><p>  The WRC will have statutory jurisdiction for facilitating the resolution of disputes under employment, equality and industrial relations legislation, in accordance with best practice and in compliance with international human rights standards.  To ensure that the WRC delivers its services to the highest standards, the Director will be supported by a Registration Service with a suitably qualified and experienced lawyer as Registrar.  It is envisaged that such a Registration Service would be responsible for the receipt, validation and processing of all employment related complaints and the coordination, management and referral of those cases to Hearing.  For example, the Registration Service will check complaints on receipt and reject or redirect incomplete complaints, complaints which are out of time or which are grounded incorrectly.  The Registration Service will have responsibility for steering each case through the system and ensuring it is dealt with efficiently and effectively.<\/p><p>  In this regard, I am happy to report that substantial progress has been made to date and a number of important priority actions have been successfully delivered within the target timescale which will ensure that all employment related complaints are dealt with effectively, efficiently and in a timely manner, including:-<\/p><p>- the introduction of a new single contact portal called &#8220;Workplace Relations Customer Services&#8221; (for information provisions and complaints receipt and registration) which has replaced the five separate entry points, and<\/p><p>- a Single Complaint Form that deals with 100 first instance complaints has replaced the 30 forms previously in use.<\/p><p>  I fully expect the work that I have initiated with regard to the reform of the Workplace Relations Bodies to significantly improve the quality of service to users and I am confident that all employment related complaints will be dealt with in an effective, efficient and timely manner under the new structures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000063#WRM02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services","counter":4158,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000063#WRM02050"},{"type":"question","counter":4159,"qnumday":323,"qnumall":"[51606\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000063#WRM02100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he or any of the State's industrial promotion agencies have been able to assist in having production resumed as a processing plant (details supplied) in County Cavan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":4160,"content":"<p>I understand that a Receiver was appointed to the company concerned on 22 October 2012.  <\/p><p>  I am informed by Enterprise Ireland that they have been in regular contact with the Receiver and are available to provide any possible assistance that the agency can.

This holds for all sectors of the labour market, including the care sector. <\/p><p>  Incentivising the take-up of employment is essentially being achieved by three means:-<\/p><p>- First, the Government is determined to continue to reform the tax and social welfare system to ensure that a person who takes up employment is significantly better off financially then if they remained on social welfare. Our current Jobseekers Benefit and Jobseekers Allowance payments are already designed in such a way as to ensure that persons are incentivised to take up either full-time or part-time employment.  This is achieved by a gradual tapering of the social welfare payment for people who take up part-time employment.  Currently, a person can work up to three days and still have an entitlement to a reduced social welfare payment, with the reduction in the social welfare payment tapered in line with a person&rsquo;s increase in earnings from work.  A person who wishes to work on a part-time basis over a period in excess of three days per week can avail of the Part Time Job Incentive Scheme or the Family Income Supplement Scheme.  People who are more than 12 months unemployed are also entitled to an increased personal tax credit in certain circumstances further increasing the returns to work.<\/p><p>  In addition, reforms to the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes are being introduced to ensure that people in part-time employment are incentivised to take up full-time employment as such opportunities become available.  This includes rebasing the payment week for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit on a five-day week rather than the previous six-day week basis where a person is working for part of the week.  This measure was introduced in July 2012.  And from February 2013 employment on a Sunday will be taken into account when determining the level of entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s payments.  The recognition of Sunday working from the perspective of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and benefit will reduce the amount of jobseeker&rsquo;s payable to casual workers and thereby encourage workers to take up offers of full-time employment rather than combining part-time employment with social welfare payments.  <\/p><p>  In a further effort to improve the financial incentive to take up employment, the Government has halved the lower rate of PRSI until end-2013 on jobs that pay up to &euro;356 per week and exempted low-paid, part-time and seasonal workers with an annual income of less than &euro;10,036 from the Universal Social Charge (increased from &euro;4,004).<\/p><p>  The Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare is examining issues around the operation and interaction of the tax and social welfare systems and may also recommend further measures to improve incentives to take up employment.<\/p><p>- Second, the Government is incentivising employers to hire the long-term unemployed.  The Government has introduced a range of reforms and incentives to support, protect and create jobs, including through the Jobs Initiative in May 2011 which among other measures reduced VAT rates for labour intensive sectors.  The Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme is available to employers who hire persons who have been in receipt of specified social welfare payments for a period of six months or more and the Revenue Tax Assist Scheme is available to employers who hire a person in receipt of those benefits for in excess of 12 months.  This scheme, which provides a double tax relief for employers, also provides increased tax credits for the employee.<\/p><p>- Third, with the unemployed via the roll-out of the new one-stop-shop Intreo offices which were launched in October.  Interventions will include referral to group engagement, one-to-one interviews, education and\/or training and placement\/work experience opportunities at appropriate intervals.  In addition, the Department of Social Protection will continue to implement its powers to sanction individuals in the form of reduced social welfare rates, if they fail to make a meaningful effort to engage in efforts to progress towards employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000063#WRM02400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":4164,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000063#WRM02450"},{"type":"question","counter":4165,"qnumday":325,"qnumall":"[50833\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000063#WRM02500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an application for carer's allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Mayo; if it will be expedited; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":4166,"content":"<p>I confirm that the Department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance from the person in question on the 18th June 2012.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  <\/p><p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for the State pension (contributory) easier by disregarding time spent out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme was introduced in and took effect from 1994.   Eligibility for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is conditional on firstly meeting the standard qualifying conditions for State pension. <\/p><p>  Backdating the scheme to 1964 would involve considerable costs.  An analysis undertaken in the 2007 Green Paper on Pensions identified that to backdate the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme to 1953, the year when the unified system of social insurance was introduced in Ireland, would cost the Exchequer in the region of &euro;160m and to 1973\/73, an estimated  &euro;150m.  Costs in relation to this scheme under the current rules, are expected to increase in the coming years due to the increase in female employment rates since 1994. <\/p><p>  In relation to income support, Ireland&rsquo;s pensioners have the lowest consistent poverty rate and are least likely to be at risk of poverty compared to other groups - pointing to the adequacy of the State pension.  Between 2004 and 2010, consistent poverty for older people (those over 65) fell from 3.3% to 0.9%.  The &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate for people in that age group fell from 27.1% to 9.6% over the same period.<\/p><p>  The recently published review of the Social Insurance Fund identified that in the medium to long term, pension related expenditure will account for an increasing proportion of the Social Insurance Fund expenditure - rising from 57% in 2011 to 85% in 2066.    The pensioner support ratio is projected to decline from 5.3 workers for every individual over pension age in 2010 to 3.9 workers by 2020 and to 2.1 workers by 2060. <\/p><p>  In terms of value for money for those who take time out of the workforce, the report confirms that social insurance benefits offer excellent value for money for those:<\/p><p>- on the lower part of the income distribution,<\/p><p>- those with shorter contribution histories, mostly women<\/p><p>- and the self-employed.  <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the changes in the contribution rules and associated rates of payment which were introduced in September 2012, those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories, will continue to obtain the best value for money from the Fund.  This can be of particular benefit to women.  <\/p><p>  In relation to the marriage bar, it should be noted that women affected by the marriage bar are public servants who would not be eligible for the homemakers scheme due to the type of PRSI being paid by them at the time of leaving the workforce. It should be noted that women who do not qualify for a full rate pension may, if their spouse is in receipt of a State pension contributory, receive a qualified adult payment at a higher rate where they satisfy a means test.   <\/p><p>  A State pension non-contributory pension, which is a means tested payment, may also be payable.  Time taken out of the workforce for homemaking and caring duties will continue to be protected by the current disregard.  While my Department will keep the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme under review, any improvements which could result in further costs for the Exchequer could only be considered in a budgetary context.  The Government&rsquo;s priority is to secure economic recovery, promote growth and employment.  To this end, the State must pursue a determined deficit reduction strategy.  Accordingly, there will be an on-going requirement to curtail expenditure in 2013 and in later years. <\/p><p>  The Government is considering the appropriate level of expenditure on the wide variety of schemes and services operated by my Department in 2013 in the context of the forthcoming Budget. The outcome will be announced on Budget Day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000064#WRN01900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Welfare Services","counter":4208,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000064#WRN01950"},{"type":"question","counter":4209,"qnumday":340,"qnumall":"[50929\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000064#WRN02000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reasons for the closing of the community welfare clinic in the Third Age Centre in Summerhill (details supplied) and to detail the way those with restricted mobility or living in poverty can access similar services.","asker":"1080","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":4210,"qnumday":341,"qnumall":"[50930\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000064#WRN02100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the cost of maintaining the community welfare clinic in the Third Age Centre in Summerhill (details supplied) and to details any savings generated from its proposed closure.","asker":"1080","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":4211,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 340 and 341 together.<\/p><p>  My Department is very conscious of the need to provide efficient and effective customer services at a local level for all customers of the Department, having regard to the resources that are available. In this context, the staffing needs of all areas within the Department are continuously reviewed. <\/p><p>  In recent months, the Department has restructured a number of Community Welfare Service (CWS) clinics across the country, including in the County Meath area, with the aim of providing an efficient service to all customers. Some smaller clinics have been closed where the level of demand for a service was low and a number of other clinics have also been identified for closure. Where a closure has occurred or is planned, an increased level of service has been made available to the customers from these areas at alternative locations in the general vicinity.<\/p><p>  In the case of Summerhill, the clinic was open to the public for 1&frac12; hours per week (2pm-3.30pm, every Wednesday).

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.  The estimated expenditure on child benefit for 2012 is around &euro;2 billion and it is paid to around 600,000 families in respect of some 1.15 million children. <\/p><p>  Parents of multiple birth children receive an additional monthly premia paid at one and a half times the monthly child benefit payment rate for each twin and double the monthly payment rate for each child in other multiple births. While Budget 2012 maintained this additional monthly payment, the multiple births grant of &euro;635 paid at birth, at 4 years of age and at 12 years of age was discontinued. <\/p><p>  As a universal payment child benefit assists parents with the cost of raising children and it contributes towards alleviating child poverty. The Government is also conscious that child benefit is an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment. Bearing this in mind, any plans to change the amount paid in respect of such payments will be a matter to be decided in a budgetary context and announced on Budget day.  I do not therefore propose to speculate on any possible approaches to child benefit payment rates changes.  <\/p><p>  With regard to the application process for child benefit, when a parent registers the birth of their child the Department of Social Protection will initiate a child benefit claim. In cases where the parent is not claiming child benefit for another child, such as their first child, a partially completed form is sent to the parent to sign in order to claim the payment. In cases where the parent is claiming child benefit for another child, the new child is added to the child benefit claim and payment begins automatically from the month after the birth. A letter confirming payment is then sent to the parent by the Department. If a parent does not wish to claim their child benefit payment, they can notify the Department in writing to that effect and their claim will be stopped in accordance with their wishes. <\/p><p>  I am conscious that achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including child benefit, raises complex issues about the effectiveness of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment incentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area. Their report is currently receiving my consideration and will assist the Government in setting out a pathway towards a more appropriate system of child income supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000064#WRN03900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":4235,"content":"<p>Question No. 351 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Applications","counter":4237,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000065#WRO00150"},{"type":"question","counter":4238,"qnumday":352,"qnumall":"[50963\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000065#WRO00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the current waiting time for the assessment of invalidity pension applications; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":4239,"qnumday":353,"qnumall":"[50964\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000065#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if her atention has been drawn to the fact that approximate waiting times for the processing of invalidity pensions are not available to applicants on request; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":4240,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 352 and 353 together. <\/p><p>  The processing times of individual invalidity pension claims may vary in accordance with their relative complexity in terms of the qualifying criteria.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 89,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;436 million in 2012.<\/p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant.  Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.  There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.<\/p><p>  However, rent supplement payments can, at the request of the tenant and with the agreement of the Department, be paid directly to the landlord.  If the Department were to introduce a system whereby all rent supplement payments were to be made directly to landlords the efficiency of the scheme would be significantly affected.  For example, the Department would potentially have to create a formal relationship with some 89,000 additional clients, the landlords.  This would involve greater complexity and significant resources to deal with a new set of third parties.  It would not be an effective use of resources to have departmental staff negotiating rental agreements for those with a short term need.<\/p><p>  The Government has effectively two initiatives to deal with long term reliance on rent supplement.  The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is in operation since 2004 and the new Housing Policy Initiative as announced by my colleagues the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Housing &amp; Planning on 16th June 2011.<\/p><p>  In March 2012, the Government approved in principle to transfer responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from my Department, currently provided through rent supplement, to housing authorities using a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Among the main features of HAP is that landlords will be paid directly by the local authority.<\/p><p>  A multi-agency steering group has been established to develop proposals to give effect to this transfer.  The group is chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and consists of representatives from the Departments of Social Protection; Public Expenditure and Reform; Office of the Revenue Commissioners; the County and City Managers Association, and the Housing Agency.  It is planned that pilot testing of HAP arrangements will commence during the second half of 2013 with general roll out and commencement of transfers from January 2014. <\/p><p>  The new arrangements will achieve a key Government commitment of removing barriers to employment and at the same time returning rent supplement to its original purpose of a short-term income support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000065#WRO01000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":4250,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000065#WRO01050"},{"type":"question","counter":4251,"qnumday":357,"qnumall":"[51023\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000065#WRO01100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will expedite an application for carer's allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":4252,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance from the person in question on the 25th October 2012.

With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.<\/p><p>  The National Broadband Plan, which I published recently, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.<\/p><p>  The Plan commits to high speed broadband availability across the country &ndash; specifically:<\/p><p>- 70Mbps &ndash; 100Mbps will be available from the commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015;<\/p><p>- At least 40Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, to at least a further 20% (and potentially as much as 35%) of the population during the lifetime of the Government; and <\/p><p>- A minimum of 30Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country, also during the lifetime of the Government.<\/p><p>  During the preparation of the Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.<\/p><p>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&rsquo; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this mapping exercise.<\/p><p>  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.

The two principal sources of revenue for the Local Government Fund are the proceeds of motor tax and the income from the Household Charge. The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides that income from the charge is to be paid into the Local Government Fund. The proceeds from the household charge are being re-distributed on an equalised basis to local authorities within the context of the annual allocations of general purpose g rants. General purpose grants contribute towards meeting the reasonable cost to local authorities of providing services to their customers. Some &euro;651m in general purpose grants had been allocated to local authorities for 2012. It has been necessary for me to reduce general purpose grant funding to local authorities in the third quarter of 2012 in light of the level of compliance with the household charge.<\/p><p>It is estimated that there are some 1.6 million residential properties potentially liable for the household charge. As such, if collected in full, the household charge has the potential to raise &euro;160 million annually. As of 16 of November 2012 some &euro;107.7 m or over 66% had been collected nationally. A total of &euro;15,695,292 was withheld from the Quarter 3 general purpose grant payment. For county and city councils, this represented a reduction of between 1% and 3% of the total general purpose grant allocation for 2012.<\/p><p>Local authorities can maintain the remainder of their general purpose grant allocation for 2012 through improved household charge compliance. Those authorities achieving a collection rate of 65% nationally will not have a further reduction in their final quarter general purpose grant payment. Local authorities achieving a collection rate of 60-65% will incur a further reduction of 0.5%, while those authorities achieving a compliance rate below 60% will incur a further 1% reduction in their annual allocation.<\/p><p>I am confident that the level of general purpose grants together with other Government grants and subsidies, and income raised from local sources, is appropriate to meet the costs of providing a reasonable level of local authority services to communities.<\/p><p>The information requested is set out in the following table.<\/p><p><table><tr><th><div>Local Authority <\/div><\/th><th><div>Allocation 2011 <br \/>&#8364; <\/div><\/th><th><div>Allocation 2012 <br \/>&#8364; <\/div><\/th><th><div>Quarter 3 2012 Reduction <br \/>&#8364; <\/div><\/th><th><div>Revised 2012 Allocation <br \/>&#8364; <\/div><\/th><th><div>% Reduction in 2012 <\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council <\/div><\/td><td><div>31,522,005 <\/div><\/td><td><div>25,780,316 <\/div><\/td><td><div>343,583 <\/div><\/td><td><div>25,436,733 <\/div><\/td><td><div>1.3% <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Fingal County Council <br \/><\/div><\/td><td><div>26,267,018 <\/div><\/td><td><div>20,455,071 <\/div><\/td><td><div>545,285 <\/div><\/td><td><div>19,909,786 <\/div><\/td><td><div>2.7% <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>South Dublin County Council <\/div><\/td><td><div>21,709,971 <\/div><\/td><td><div>16,963,904 <\/div><\/td><td><div>475,210 <\/div><\/td><td><div>16,488,694 <\/div><\/td><td><div>2.8% <\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000069#WRS02000","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Government Reform","counter":4494,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000069#WRS02050"},{"type":"question","counter":4495,"qnumday":449,"qnumall":"[51178\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000069#WRS02100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he intends to change Section 129 of the Local Government Act 2001 to facilitate the disbanding of the county development board in each local authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":4496,"qnumday":450,"qnumall":"[51179\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000069#WRS02200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the powers that county managers have to amend or disband the following agencies which are structures or sub-structures of the county development boards, county childcare committees, joint policing committees and volunteer centres; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":4497,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 449 and 450 together.<\/p><p>  The reforms set out in <i>Putting People First<\/i> will result in changes to current local governance arrangements and include, <i>inter alia<\/i>, the wind-down of City\/County Development Boards.

It is also important to bear in mind that the transition from being a homeowner to a social housing tenant is a major one for families. Mortgage to rent or other such interventions cannot be rushed for any party. For example, the process provides a 60 day decision period and a 28 day cooling off period within the time frame of the scheme. My Department estimates that the overall time frame per case from start to completed transaction will be up to eight months . This compares favourably to the time frames in other jurisdictions operating similar schemes.<\/p><p>  The level of ambition for next year under mortgage to rent and the prospective associated mortgage to lease arrangements will be determined largely in the context of the Estimates process for 2013. It will be essential to deal with any potential displacement effect for other categories of social housing need arising as a result of the wider roll-out of mortgage to rent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000069#WRS03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Staff","counter":4518,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000070#WRT00100"},{"type":"question","counter":4519,"qnumday":457,"qnumall":"[51471\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000070#WRT00200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide clarification for local authority staff across Ireland who may one way or other transfer from their current employer to the Irish Water Company, many of these staff currently employed will play a pivotal role in the successful transfer of assets and infrastructure from the local authorities to Irish Water;

This total is unchanged from 2011. Applications from nineteen eligible organisations, that is, charities that operate lotteries that were established before 1997, are currently being processed by the Department of Justice and Equality and payments will be made later this year. The total funding available under the Scheme will begin to reduce in 2013 and will be gradually decreased over a period of three years after which the scheme will be discontinued. Recipient organisations were advised of this in early October, in effect giving them more than 12 months notice of this change. The decision to wind down this Scheme has been taken in the context of the requirement for all Government Departments to meet exacting savings targets in the years ahead.<\/p><p>  Funding disbursed under the Charitable Lotteries Scheme is drawn from both the National Lottery surplus and exchequer funding. The Scheme was set up in 1997 to supplement the incomes of charitable organisations that were operating lotteries in competition with the National Lottery. Approximately &euro;114 million has been disbursed under the Scheme since its inception. The amount each organisation receives is determined in proportion to its gross annual sales of relevant lottery products. The criteria for the Scheme do not take account of either the profitability of the lottery or the proportion of the revenue it generates that reaches the charitable cause in whose name the products are sold.  This means that the scheme has not provided any incentive for charities to operate lotteries with a low cost base or to ensure that a high proportion of the revenue generated goes directly to the cause with which the ticket is identified. Such a Scheme can no longer be justified in the current circumstances.<\/p><p>  The gradual phasing out of the Scheme will yield savings of &euro;11 million over the three year period 2013-2015, with a further saving of &euro;6 million each year after 2015 when no further payments will be made. The level of assistance is being reduced gradually in order to minimise the impact on the organisations affected and to afford them an opportunity to consider appropriate action they could take to generate greater net profit from their fundraising activities and to make such changes as they consider beneficial.<\/p><p>  In this context, I am also considering an increase to the current limits on private lottery prizes under the Gaming and Lotteries Act of 1956.

The basic position is that an &#8216;additional increment&#8217; is paid over and above the 21-year pension for each additional year of service above 21 years to a maximum of 31 years.  However, this additional element ceases to be payable when an individual reaches social welfare State Pension age.   <\/p><p>  The detailed position is as follows:  Under the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces Pension Schemes, the minimum service required for an immediate pension and lump sum in the case of NCOs and Privates is 21 years, regardless of age.  Maximum benefits accrue after 31 years.  The 21-year pension consists of the following elements:<\/p><p>(a)a basic flat-rate pension that varies according to rank (&#8364;12,913.19 p.a. for a Corporal as in the specific case of the person referred to); <i>plus<\/i><\/p><p>(b)an addition in respect of military service allowance (MSA) equal to 40% of the MSA rate where discharged since August 1990 (equal to &#8364;2,536.16 p.a. in this case); and<\/p><p>(c)if applicable, fixed % additions to (a) in respect of certain other qualifying payments (e.g. 3% extra for Technician Pay in his specific case). <\/p><p>  All of the above elements are payable for the person&#8217;s lifetime.  However, an &#8216;additional increment&#8217; is also payable at a flat rate for each year of service in excess of 21 years up to a maximum of 31 years. This increment is increased, where appropriate, by the top-up at (c).  Where maximum pensionable service is 31 or more years, as applies in this instance, the MSA top-up is 50% of the rate of MSA (rather than 40%).  In this specific case, his additional increment (inclusive of the top-up at (c)) amounted to &#8364;4,804.84 p.a.  However, this ceases to be payable when the pensioner reaches the qualifying age of 66 under the Social Welfare code for a State Pension Contributory, or if they become entitled to a State Pension (Transition) at the earlier age of 65.  At the same time, the 50% MSA top-up reverts to the 40% rate.<\/p><p>  I am advised that these arrangements are in accordance with the long established principle of integrating occupational pensions with Social Insurance benefits of employees who are in full PRSI class.  This includes NCOs and Privates, who are fully insured for the range of benefits under the Social Welfare Acts such as the State Pension.  &#8216;Integration' means that a person&#8217;s entitlement to Social Insurance benefits such as the State Pension is taken into account when calculating the rate of occupational pension payable.  In effect, integration results in a reduced rate of occupational pension than would otherwise be the case.  In the public service generally, the practical effect of integration is that the maximum occupational pension is 50% of pensionable pay <i>less<\/i> the maximum personal rate of State Pension (Contributory) applicable at retirement date.  The State Pension etc. is regarded as part of the overall pension package payable to the individual.  The occupational pension integrated (combined) with the State Pension makes up the &#8216;total pension&#8217; for full PRSI contributors in the public service. The integration principle applies right across the public service and, indeed, in many areas of the private sector as well as in other countries.<\/p><p>  When the person in question retired on 1 February 2007 (at age 60) from the Defence Forces he had accrued the maximum pensionable service of 31 years and, on that basis, qualified for a significantly higher pension than if he had left after 21 years service.  From that date up until the eve of his 65<sup>th<\/sup> birthday (31 January 2012), his military pension included the additional increment for 31 years&#8217; service and the corresponding MSA top-up, on that date giving a pension rate of &#8364;20,719.08 a year.  On turning 65 (1 February 2012), he qualified for the State Pension (Transition).  In accordance with the arrangements mentioned, the additional elements in respect of his service for 22 &#8211; 31 years ceased to be payable from that date.  Since then, his revised military pension rate has been &#8364;15,606.55 a year, a reduction of &#8364;5,112.53.  These are the gross rates in his case after application of the &#8216;Public Service Pension Reduction&#8217; introduced under emergency legislation in 2011 (the actual amount of which itself has been reduced in this person&#8217;s case by virtue of his lower military pension rate).<\/p><p>  The maximum personal rate of State Pension is currently &#8364;230.30 a week (if under age 80).  This is considerably greater than the actual reduction of &#8364;97.98 a week in this person&#8217;s case under the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces&#8217; pension arrangements on his qualification for the State Pension at age 65.  Indeed, his current combined weekly pension of &#8364;529.39 (i.e. Defence Forces pension of &#8364;299.09 <i>plus<\/i> State Pension of &#8364;230.30) represents a one-third increase on what he was getting alone from his military pension before turning 65.<\/p><p>  The method of integration for these military pensioners is considerably less severe than in other areas of the public service.  This is because elsewhere generally, the integration mechanism begins from the time an occupational pension comes into payment and, as I have already indicated, it effectively caps at 50% of pensionable pay the combined value of the occupational pension plus State pension.  In contrast, for retired pre-April 2004 enlisted personnel such as the person referred to, integration as outlined above does not actually apply at all until the social welfare State Pension becomes payable at age 65 \/ 66.  This could be some (or many) years after the person concerned had retired on pension from the Defence Forces.  Even then, at age 65\/66, the Defence Forces pension plus State Pension actually exceeds the public service maximum of 50% of pensionable pay.  In effect, these military pensioners have what amounts to a partial, and more favourable, form of integration.<\/p><p>  The general issue of integration of occupational pensions in the public service was examined by the <i>Commission on Public Service Pensions. <\/i>  Its final report, published in November 2000, was considered and broadly accepted by Government.  The Commission accepted that integration is a fundamental component in the public service pension framework and was strongly of the view that it should be continued. It did not make any recommendations that would affect the current integration arrangements applicable to retired NCOs and Privates covered by the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces pensions schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000071#WRU03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":4623,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000071#WRU03200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"&Iacute;oca&iacute;ochta&iacute; Deontais","counter":4622,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000071#WRU03150"},{"type":"question","counter":4623,"qnumday":495,"qnumall":"[50858\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000071#WRU03200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"c&eacute;n f&aacute;th a nd&uacute;radh le feilmeoir (sonra&iacute; tugtha) nach n-&iacute;ocfa&iacute; &eacute; go dt&iacute; an bhliain seo chugainn faoin sc&eacute;im disadvantage area agus single farm payment; c&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach ndearnadh cigireacht ar a fheilm n&iacute;os t&uacute;isce i mbliana; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":4624,"content":"<p>Is iarratas&oacute;ir &eacute; an duine ainmnithe faoi Sc&eacute;im na hAon&iacute;oca&iacute;ochta agus Sc&eacute;im na Limist&eacute;ar faoi Mh&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste.

Fitzpatrick Associates also noted that the measures included in the OP were not likely to be sufficient to draw down the full &euro;42 million allocation from the EFF.  They recommended the amendment of the OP to include most of the measures previously included in the National Programme, to ensure availability of supports to these important areas of the seafood sector and to ensure full draw down of EFF funds.  The recommendations were accepted and a revised OP was submitted to the European Commission in March 2012.  That revised OP must be adopted by Commission Decision and that is awaited.  The revised OP will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website immediately after its adoption.  However, it is important to note that the measures included in the revised OP took effect immediately following its submission to the Commission.<\/p><p>The Interim Evaluation Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:<\/p><p><i>http:\/\/www.agriculture.gov.ie\/fisheries\/seafoodpolicydevelopment\/seafooddevelopmentinireland2007-2013\/<\/i><\/p><p>I have no information available to me on the timing of submission to, or approval by, the European Commission of other Member State&rsquo;s Operational Programmes.  The process of developing a new OP for the period 2014 to 2020 will commence shortly.  The EU Regulation on the new European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) is still under negotiation as part of the CFP reforms.  That Regulation will specify the areas of the seafood sector that may be supported in the next programming period and will specify the criteria that will determine how much of the EMFF fund will be available to Ireland.  These two issues will be central in shaping the new OP.  Consultation with stakeholders will form an important part of the process for preparing the new OP.<\/p><p>EU rules do not permit the carrying over of allocations from one programming period to the next, so strictly speaking no funds were carried over from the previous FIFG fund.  However, depending on the level of drawdown of funds under the programme, the rules do allow for eligible expenditure after the programming period.  This is referred to as N+2.  This was the case with the transition period between the FIFG and the EFF, where expenditure under the FIFG continued for a certain period after 2006.  This may also be the case with the transition period between the EFF and the EMFF.<\/p><p>The 2011 Annual Implementation Report for the Seafood Development Operational Programme 2007-2013 shows that approximately &euro;28 million of the &euro;42 million EFF allocation had been committed up to the end of 2011.  As processing and aquaculture did not become part of the OP until 2012, this spend can be attributed to the catching sector.  The majority of this spend was accounted for by the 2008 Decommissioning Scheme.  Up to 2011, BIM was the implementing agency for all elements of the OP, so all funds spent were disbursed through BIM.<\/p><p>Approximately &euro;14 million of EFF funds remains to be committed over the period from 2012 onwards.  That period may extend up to 2015, if the N+2 rule is invoked.  The table below indicates the breakdown of allocations by EFF priority axis.  These priority axes are specified in the EFF Regulation (1198\/2006).  It is important to note that the Exchequer must provide matching funding, generally at the same level as the EFF contribution.  Beneficiaries must also provide private funding.  The level of private funding required varies from one scheme to another.  Priority Axis 1 includes decommissioning and fleet safety, axis 2 includes marketing, processing and aquaculture, axis 3 includes marine environmental measures, axis 4 includes coastal area development and axis 5 covers technical assistance (implementation costs).  The precise allocations by scheme will depend on a number of factors, including demand.<\/p><p><table><tr><th><div>EFFPriority <\/div><\/th><th><div>EFF<br \/><br \/>Committed <br \/><br \/>To 2011<\/div><\/th><th><div>EFF <br \/><br \/>Revised<br \/><br \/>Allocation<br \/><br \/>2007-2013<\/div><\/th><th><div>EFF <br \/><br \/>Allocation <br \/><br \/>Remaining<br \/><br \/>2012 &#8594;<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><div>&#8364;m<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;m<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;m<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Priority axis 1<\/div><\/td><td><div>27.3<\/div><\/td><td><div>29.9<\/div><\/td><td><div>2.6<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Priority axis 2<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><td><div>6.2<\/div><\/td><td><div>6.2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Priority axis 3<\/div><\/td><td><div>0.5<\/div><\/td><td><div>5.0<\/div><\/td><td><div>4.5<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Priority axis 4<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><td><div>0.8<\/div><\/td><td><div>0.8<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Priority axis 5<\/div><\/td><td><\/td><td><div>0.3<\/div><\/td><td><div>0.3<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>Total<\/div><\/td><td><div>27.8<\/div><\/td><td><div>42.2<\/div><\/td><td><div>14.4<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000072#WRV03500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Industry Development","counter":4683,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000072#WRV03550"},{"type":"question","counter":4684,"qnumday":518,"qnumall":"[51117\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000072#WRV03600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will provide a breakdown by industry sector fishing, processing and aquaculture by year of funding allocated to BIM or their sub organisation Aquaculture Initiative for the period 2007-2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":4685,"content":"<p>Monies received by BIM that are intended for specific sectors of the Irish seafood industry are paid out by that body as grants.

For example, a service which is an appropriate setting for the pre-school year and has an enrolment of at least 8 children of whom at least 3 qualify for the programme and the remainder will qualify in the following year, can apply for entry to the programme.  Smaller services which have an enrolment of not fewer than 5 children in their pre-school year can also apply for entry.  In addition, in order to ensure that no child is denied the opportunity of availing of the free pre-school year, certain rural services not meeting the minimum requirement may participate where parents in the area would have no other convenient option.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000074#WRX05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services","counter":4809,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000074#WRX05900"},{"type":"question","counter":4810,"qnumday":560,"qnumall":"[51122\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000074#WRX06000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if it is her intention to introduce an age ceiling of 15 years for existing disabled children receiving subvention for all day childcare services; if so, the reason for same, in view of the fact that children are ineligible to apply for the disability allowance until 16 years of age; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":4811,"content":"<p>The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme is implemented by my Department and provides support to community childcare services to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to low income families and to families where one or both parents is in receipt of a social welfare payment.<\/p><p>  The CCS programme provides support to all qualifying parents including those parents whose children have special needs.

The water services authorities also measure the quantity of hydrofluosilicic acid used plus the quantity of water treated in order to calculate the concentration of hydrofluosilicic acid in the water.  The HSE undertakes monthly sampling of tap water and can access the daily records of the water services authorities if an issue arises regarding fluoridation levels.<\/p><p>  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) collects and analyses the monitoring results carried out by water services authorities on drinking water supplies. The most recent EPA report on 'The Provision and Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland' (2010) includes information on water supplies where fluoride parametric values are exceeded. Of the 3,398 samples from public water supplies which were analysed, 74 were above the Irish statutory requirements of 0.8mg\/litre. All but one of these elevated levels was below the EU standard of 1.5mg\/litre. The EPA is not required to collect data where fluoride parametric values is below the statutory requirement. I have asked the HSE to collate this information and I will forward it to the Deputy when it is available.<\/p><p>  Hydrofluosilicic acid is used to fluoridate public water supplies.

Under UHI, everyone will have equal access to a comprehensive package of curative services.  The key changes required to support the reform programme which will pave the way for the introduction of universal health insurance are outlined in the provisions of \"Future Health:  A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012 - 2015\" which was published by the Minister for Health on 15 November 2012.  Earlier this year I appointed Professor John Higgins to chair a Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups. Work is continuing on finalising a Draft Report on the recommendations for submission to the Strategic Board. The Report will be submitted to me when the Board have signed off on it and in turn, I will then bring it to Cabinet.<\/p><p>  Another key building block for UHI is the development of a 'Money Follows the Patient' funding model to replace the current block grant allocation system.  Under 'Money follows the Patient', providers will be paid for the needs they address, the quantity and quality of the services they provide and the outcomes they deliver. They will be liberated, subject to overall budgetary ceilings, to pursue the most cost-effective means of achieving this standard of performance.  Once the key building blocks have been put in place, it will be possible to proceed with implementation of UHI.  Hospitals will then become independent, not-for-profit trusts with managers accountable to their boards. As a precursor to this, it is intended to integrate hospitals into groups on a collaborative administrative basis.<\/p><p>  The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients. As part of the drive to ensure real accountability, an annual budget and employment ceiling will be developed for each group.  Groups will also have the authority to deploy and re-deploy staff across hospitals within the group; this will help to alleviate problems that have arisen in the past in relation to the equitable distribution of health care staff across all hospital sites.  Before Hospital Trusts are finally established, the make-up and functioning of the Groups will be reviewed and if changes prove necessary then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000076#WRZ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Service Executive Savings","counter":4887,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000076#WRZ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":4888,"qnumday":584,"qnumall":"[50997\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000076#WRZ00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Health Service Executive tendering process for payroll services will be offered only to Irish service providers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1014","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":4889,"content":"<p>One of the key commitments in the Public Service Reform Plan is to identify and evaluate new business models and opportunities to support the delivery of non-core processes and services.

In many industrialised countries, TB rates among the homeless can be up to 20 times higher than the general population.TB has also increased in other marginalised groups such as prisoners and those involved in substance misuse. <\/p><p>  Similar to other low prevalence countries in Europe the disease is more focussed in marginalised groups such as homeless, prisoners, substance misusers, immigrants from countries of high endemicity. The recommendations of recent expert advice on the Control and prevention of TB are being reviewed and implemented. The focus on TB is being prioritised to the key high risk groups, homeless, immigrants from high endemic countries, and prisoners; and this will guide future funding and developments in services for people with TB.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000077#WRAA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Appointments","counter":4957,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000077#WRAA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":4958,"qnumday":608,"qnumall":"[51260\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000077#WRAA01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number and list of health agencies\/boards that are awaiting Ministerial appointments; the timeframe they have been waiting for same; the number that do not currently have a quorum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":4959,"content":"<p>The following tables set out the information requested by the Deputy.

In view of  the significant potential cost implications for private health insurers, I subsequently indicated that I would be prepared to postpone implementation of the legislation until 2013 provided that the funds targeted for the current year were raised through a system of improved cashflow from the private insurers.  Arrangements for this improved cashflow have been agreed in principle with the insurers, and the legal details are being finalised at present. <\/p><p>  In relation to charging all private patients in public beds, the issue will be dealt with as part of the budgetary process for 2013 and I will bring legislative proposals to Government on the matter in due course.  I am committed to keeping the cost of health insurance premia as low as possible and, to this end, my Department is working closely with the four health insurers, through the Health Insurance Consultative Forum.  The objective of the forum is to explore ways to minimise costs, while always respecting competition law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000077#WRAA04000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service","counter":5003,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000077#WRAA04050"},{"type":"question","counter":5004,"qnumday":624,"qnumall":"[51467\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000077#WRAA04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the roster policy for the ambulance service throughout the country; if he will provide details of any regional variation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":5005,"qnumday":625,"qnumall":"[51469\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000077#WRAA04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the action being taken to ensure that ambulance service staff are no longer exceeding the maximum 16 hours; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":5006,"qnumday":627,"qnumall":"[51472\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000077#WRAA04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a detailed report on the status of the implementation of the Labour Court recommendations facilitating the removal of on-call from the Cork Kerry Region Ambulance Service which was issued in February 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":5007,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 624, 625 and 627 together.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that, following a referral to the Labour Court under the Public Service Agreement, the HSE National Ambulance Service (NAS) is currently progressing a number of efficiencies arising from a decision of that court. These operational efficiencies include the removal of on-call arrangements in rosters, where ambulance staff are not actually on duty in ambulance stations or vehicle but may be contacted in the event of a 999 call.  This means that it could take over 20 minutes for an emergency ambulance to leave its station after the crew has been tasked. All parties have accepted that, in accordance with a Labour Court recommendation, providing ambulance services under on-call arrangements should cease. <\/p><p>  The NAS is not a static service. It deploys its resources in a dynamic manner and works on an area and national, rather than a local, basis.  The dynamic deployment of ambulance resources ensures that the nearest appropriate resource is mobilised to the location of any incident, including incidents in the greater Dublin area.  In this context, any removal of overtime inefficiencies will be addressed through more efficient deployment and utilisation of resources.<\/p><p>  As the details of rostering policy for the ambulance service, including details of any regional variation are, operational matters for the HSE, this question has been forwarded to the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000077#WRAA04400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":5009,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000078#WRBB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":5010,"qnumday":626,"qnumall":"[51470\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000078#WRBB00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way he intends to ensure that plans by the Health Service Executive to reconfigure therapy resources such as speech therapy, occupational therapy, and physiotherapy into geographic-based teams will not adversely affect children in special schools in view of the fact that it means that therapists in special schools will now have to travel to mainstream schools; if he will address concerns that this will lead to a reduction in the level of service to children in special schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":5011,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has recognised the need to increase the level of consistency and standardisation in the way both early intervention services and services for school-aged children with disabilities are delivered and to this end is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of existing therapy resources to geographic based teams for children (0-18 years).<\/p><p>  The National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years) has been established since 2010.  It is supported by a National Coordinating Group which has representatives from the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills in addition to other key stakeholders. The Programme is based on the recommendations of the <i>Report of the National Reference Group on Multidisciplinary Services for Children aged 5-18 Years<\/i>   produced by representatives of the professions and management involved in delivering multi-disciplinary services to children (available on the HSE website www.hse.ie.) <\/p><p>  The Programme aims to address the following issues in relation to children&#8217;s disability services:<\/p><p>- Inequity of access to services due to inconsistent development of services;<\/p><p>- Environmental change arising from the reorientation towards mainstream education leading to increasing demand for health services to support inclusion;<\/p><p>- Increasing demand for services due to population growth and increased identification of children with disability;<\/p><p>- The need to re-align services with emerging primary care and integrated service structures.<\/p><p>  While the Programme supports the principle of providing access to mainstream education where appropriate, it also recognises a continuing role for special schools. <\/p><p>The Programme is rolling out at national, regional and local level and involves representatives from the health and education sectors, statutory and non-statutory service providers and parents working together to see how current services can best be re-organised.  Implementation of the Programme encompasses two elements:<\/p><p>- Ongoing work in co-ordinating and re-organising early intervention services for children aged 0-5 years into integrated, geographically based teams;<\/p><p>- Supporting the re-organisation of services for school-age children aged 5-18 years according to the same model.<\/p><p>  Decisions regarding any local re-organisation of services are the responsibility of the Local Implementation Groups (LIGs). These include stakeholders such as representatives of the service providers involved, parents and the educational sector representatives. Detailed local area action plans are being developed by the LIGs with the following objectives:<\/p><p>- One clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need;<\/p><p>- Resources used to the greatest benefit for all children and families;<\/p><p>- Health and education working together to support children to achieve their potential.<\/p><p>  The HSE is working very closely with the education sector, which is fully involved in the development of the Programme, to ensure that, from the children&#8217;s and parents&#8217; perspective, the services provided by each sector are integrated. An Education and Health Working Group, comprising representatives of both sectors, is developing a framework for closer working relationships.<\/p><p>  The long term goal of this Programme is to bring consistency in service delivery and a clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need. Implementation of this Programme will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services for all children requiring access to health related supports, regardless of where they live or which pre-school or school they attend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000078#WRBB00300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":5012,"content":"<p>Question No. 627 answered with Question No. 624.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":5013,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000078#WRBB00450"},{"type":"question","counter":5014,"qnumday":628,"qnumall":"[51479\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000078#WRBB00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will expedite an appeal of a refusal of the renewal of a medical card in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":5015,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000078#WRBB00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service","counter":5016,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000078#WRBB00650"},{"type":"question","counter":5017,"qnumday":629,"qnumall":"[51483\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000078#WRBB00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will give an assurance that the 24 hour ambulance service that operates out of Kenmare Community Hospital, County Kerry, will be retained in its present form in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":5018,"content":"<p>The provision of ambulances is a matter for the National Ambulance Service, which are part of the Health Service Executive.

In this regard the Action Plan for Jobs (2012), and the Report of the  Research Prioritisation Steering Group, were published this year.  The aim is to target public investment towards research based on potential for economic return, particularly in the form of jobs; and protecting as much current employment while also creating jobs in new areas of opportunity.  <\/p><p>  I continue to stress that while the economic benefit of research is extremely important, it is imperative that the critical importance of research for policy and research for knowledge is recognised and supported.  Knowledge derived from research is  paramount in providing the evidence-base for better health policies and systems; systems that underpin effective and efficient health service provision.  Such evidence will be a key input to the creation of a fairer, more efficient health system.  <\/p><p>  In acknowledging the potential for research to support economic growth and job creation, I consider that the economic and societal agendas are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  The interaction and interdependence between research for health and research for economic purposes are evident in the research and innovation objectives supported by my Department.<\/p><p>  In 2009 the Action Plan for Health Research 2009-2013, prepared by the Health Research Group was launched.  The plan is in the implementation phase and Subgroups\/Work Streams established under the Health Research Group are progressing the actions therein.  The main purpose of the HRG, which is chaired by my Department, is to ensure that health research in Ireland is coordinated, prioritised, and focussed, and that national policies and strategies for health research are framed strategically in the context of the wider science, technology and innovation agenda.  <\/p><p>  The Health Research Board (HRB) is a statutory body under the aegis of the Department of Health.  The HRB is the lead agency in Ireland supporting and funding health research.  It provides funding, maintains health information systems and conducts research linked to national health priorities.  The aim is to improve people's health, build health research capacity and make a significant contribution to Ireland's knowledge economy.<\/p><p>  A robust clinical research infrastructure and established capacity and expertise are essential in developing and delivering health care.  Through strategic investment, the Health Research Board (HRB), funded by my Department, is developing infrastructure, expertise, and capacity to create an integrated framework for clinical research in Ireland.  This will not only improve patient outcomes, peoples health and health service delivery, but will support growth and jobs here in Ireland.  I opened a Clinical Research Facility in Cork earlier this year which is funded by the HRB.  In addition to this investment in Cork, the HRB is funding the establishment of two facilities in Dublin and Galway.  The Wellcome Trust is co-funding the build in Dublin. These three facilitates will network together using standardised practices and procedures in clinical research conduct thereby greatly increasing Ireland&rsquo;s appeal as a country of choice for performing large-scale multinational clinical research studies.<\/p><p>  The Health Information Bill, which my Department is progressing,  will provide for a range of measures including facilitating a uniform approach for ethics approval for multi site health research projects, not already otherwise governed by statutory regulation and EU law.  It is expected that the Health Information Bill will be ready for publication by mid 2013.<\/p><p>  During the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union key legislative proposals on Clinical Trials and Medical Devices will be progressed. <\/p><p>  My Department is also represented on the Prioritisation Action Group (PAG), established by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and chaired by Minister Sherlock to progress the Report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group.  It is evident that while much of the work being progressed in the area of health research may not necessarily lead to direct commercial opportunity, it can complement and support the work of other sectors in the economy.  <\/p><p>  Senior officials in my Department recently had a very positive meeting with representatives of the organisation mentioned by the Deputy at which health research policy was discussed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000079#WRCC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":5055,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000079#WRCC01475"},{"type":"question","counter":5056,"qnumday":643,"qnumall":"[51529\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000079#WRCC01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding an operation in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry;

The directive strongly promotes the principles of the three Rs (replacement of the use of animals to the greatest extent possible with alternative testing methods, refinement of scientific procedures to improve animal welfare and reduction in numbers of animals used).  Significant changes in this regard are requirements to perform ethical evaluations prior to authorisation of projects using animals and higher standards of care and accommodation.  Many of the provisions set out in the directive are mandatory.  The directive will be transposed into Irish law during November, 2012 and will take effect from 1 January, 2013.  <\/p><p>  My Department sought the views of the public and interested parties in July, 2009 on the proposed directive.  These views informed Ireland&rsquo;s position as negotiations on the proposed directive progressed at EU level.  My Department again sought the views of the public and interested parties in October, 2011 after the adoption of the directive.  Officials of my Department have met with stakeholder groups including animal welfare groups in relation to the Directive's provisions.  My Department has recently met with consultants of the Irish Anti Vivisection Society and with Research and Development establishments in this area.  The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) has also had meetings with stakeholders to inform them of the requirements which will apply from 1 January 2013 and has updated its website with relevant information. <\/p><p>  I appreciate the time and effort devoted by individuals and stakeholder groups in this regard.  The submissions received in response to the first public consultation were particularly welcome as the directive was still under discussion at that stage.  The second public consultation, of necessity, had a different focus given that the directive was already finalised at that stage.  The responses to the second public consultation are, consequently, primarily focused on the nuts and bolts of the transposition process itself and are of particular assistance to the Department in this regard.<\/p><p>  On the matter of scrutiny of the Directive, in July 2009, my Department provided an information note to the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny on the then proposed directive and indicated that the transposition of the directive would be done by Statutory Instrument in order to ensure that this transposition would be implemented within the allowed timeframe.  Failure to do so could delay the considerably enhanced protections the new directive provides for animals - a circumstance which animal protection organisations would, quite correctly, take issue with.  It could also result in EU infringement proceedings against the State during the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the European Union.  I am sure the Deputy would agree that it is important to transpose the considerably enhanced protections afforded to animals in the directive without delay. The joint committee, after consideration of the proposed directive, agreed that no further scrutiny was required, given that the aim of the proposal is to improve the existing 1986 directive and in view of the scope allowed in the directive for member states to decide on practical transposition measures. <\/p><p>  In the run up to the implementation of the directive, the Department and the IMB, which is the designated competent authority responsible for the implementation of the directive, will continue to consider the views of stakeholder groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000079#WRCC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":5068,"content":"<p>Question No. 647 answered with Question No. 566.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Orthodontic Services","counter":5069,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000080#WRDD00250"},{"type":"question","counter":5070,"qnumday":648,"qnumall":"[51577\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112000080#WRDD00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress made to date to reduce waiting lists for orthodontic treatment in the mid west region (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":5071,"content":"<p>An independent review of Orthodontic Services has been commissioned by the HSE.
