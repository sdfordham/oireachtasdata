The four of us are volunteers.  We have a single purpose which is to try to get young people into farming and improve the output and efficiency of farming.  We pre-submitted the slides to the committee and I will begin by dealing with the last one.<\/p><p>  Our summary point is that the association believes strongly that agriculture can lead economic recovery.  Food Harvest 2020 has set the target for what we deem to be an historic new era.  The training and education of young people going into farming, at whatever level, are key.  In other words, human capacity will be vital to succeed in achieving the Food Harvest 2020 targets.  A number of barriers must be removed, mainly to access land and encourage its use.  This can be done through flexible arrangements and joint ventures.  We need a proactive taxation policy approach and must support young trained farmers.  In summary, we suggest that if we do a few things that we will outline, it is possible to create jobs in farming, stimulate rural development and communities and promote economic recovery.<\/p><p>  The first slide points to the importance of agriculture in the economy.  It is the primary indigenous sector, with 150,000 people employed in it, and an annual output of &euro;24 billion, as stated in the Food Harvest 2020 document.  Agriculture will continue to play a crucial role and Food Harvest 2020 sets out the growth plan for a new era in agriculture.  Achieving the Food Harvest 2020 targets will require highly trained and specialised young farmers, greater land use through access and flexibility arrangements and support for young people who start farming.  It will be dependent on the capacity of farmers, managers and labour working on farms to deliver to the standards required.  The key issue is access to land and facilities as it is a barrier.  The regulatory environment in farming must favour young, skilled and progressive farmers.  Our taxation policy must be pro-farm development, pro-productivity, pro-efficiency and promote the use of land.<\/p><p>  On the education front, the association strongly believes that we must attract and retain talented, skilled individuals.  Education will also be important in trying to get the industry and farmers to adapt and change in order that we can gain a competitive advantage.  Obviously, a range of skills will be required to manage multiple farm operations with large complex structures.  Undoubtedly, to succeed and stay in farming, one needs a range of key attributes such as agility, flexibility and decisiveness.  The human capacity is vital in education and training.  We all learned in our younger days that management was about land, labour and capital, but they must be pulled together by the human capacity.  This is a key issue that we must get across to the committee.  If education and training do not take place and we do not have the required technical and managerial skills, the association believes we will not meet the 2020 targets.  Many of us are under the illusion that 2020 is far off into the future, but it is only seven years away.<\/p><p>  The association also believes we must urgently train and educate young farm entrants to meet the challenges of this new era.  The old farm apprenticeship programme was about learning by doing.  We are talking about hands-on practical training and doers, not talkers.  In that context, we strongly advise that there is a need to support the new Teagasc and UCD diploma in dairy management programme which is a first step and a good development.<\/p><p>  The next slide deals with the age profile in farming.  Most people are aware of it, but it must be reiterated that we need new blood in the industry.  That is obvious.  The age profile of farmers has disimproved dramatically in the last decade.  According to a Central Statistics Office, CSO, survey in 2010, 6.2% of farmers were under the age of 35 years; the corresponding figure was 13% ten years ago, which is a dramatic turnaround.  There is a <i>pro rata<\/i> disimprovement in the age profile over 55 years of age.  As it is not a good starting point, this issue is urgent.<\/p><p>  With regard to access to land, the association is of the view that there are a number of things that can be done.  Individually, they are not big items and they could be easily sorted out.  They could contribute a great deal to opening opportunities to young farmers to start farming.  The starting point is that, as everybody knows, the capital required to get into farming is very large.  It is an expensive business.  Land use is the key and the first barrier is the reference year for the single farm payment.  The lack of confirmation of the reference year is resulting in less land being available in the marketplace.  This is leading to an increase in the price of land which is driven by the fear of landowners that they might lose entitlements or benefits as they arise.  The solution is to secure agreement to declare 2011 or 2012 as the reference year.  There would be no cost to the State and it would remove the uncertainty and speculation.  It would certainly reduce rental price and inflation pressure.<\/p><p>  The second point on land access is that as an association, we are tremendously pleased to see milk production partnerships in dairying.  The milk production partnerships are in place, but there is a major drawback - the joint and several liability in the arrangements for partners.  Some of my colleagues will comment on this issue if they wish, but there is no doubt that it is a barrier to the uptake of partnerships.  There is also the difficulty for the manager or other non-partner in joining the partnership arrangement once it is up and running.  If we could sort out these problems for partnerships, there would be no cost to the State and it would result in better uptake.  If we can get more partnerships up and running, we will have growth and development and the farming economy moving faster to meet the 2020 targets.<\/p><p>  The third point on barriers to land access concerns the restrictive regulatory environment and the single farm payment rules.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012120400004#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Moyles","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354630500,"counter":14,"content":"<p>That is an interesting submission.  Perhaps Mr. Moyles can give me more information on the Irish Farm Managers' Association and whom it represents.  Mr. Moyles emphasises access to land.  The transfer of land must be examined.  There is the fear factor among older farmers and the tax and legal factors mean it is a multifaceted challenge.  I am interested in the recipe proposed to overcome difficulties.  There are a number of specific goals in Mr. Moyles' presentation.  Training is important but it is more useful if one is doing the job.  For example, if someone gives me a new phone, I will mess with it for half an hour before I look at the instruction manual.  If I look at the instruction manual first, I will never figure it out.  Training really pays off when one is working on the job because one understands in practical terms where the difficulties lie.<\/p><p>  On partnership, Mr. Moyles said there should not be joint and several liability for partnership debts.  In other partnerships, such as accountancy firms or solicitors' firms, there is liability for the totality of the partnership.  That is how it works.  Perhaps Mr. Moyles can outline why it should be different in this case.  He also referred to the difficulty with a manager or other non-partner joining the partnership arrangement.  Are these difficulties legal or practical?  Changes that do not cost the State money are very attractive.  If there are regulatory barriers, it is important that we examine them.  There is a major debate about the single farm payment at the moment.  The more one looks at it, the more we see it has effects that have nothing to do with farming but have a huge effect on farming.  People have entitlements they are not using or they are not using land to its capacity.  As part of the debate on the single farm payment, we need to look at the changes that need to take place within the single farm payment to encourage the use of all land in a productive way.  We must also make sure the user of the land, as opposed to the owner, gets a fair return for effort.  Perhaps the witnesses can expand on that point because we need to ensure the land of the country is properly used.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012120400005#F00200","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354631100,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the delegation for coming today.  I agree with many of the points made, particularly on this new partnership.  We must encourage young farmers to get involved in the business of farming and we must ensure the installation aid scheme comes back.  We are in difficult financial times but perhaps in a year or two it might be back.  We must encourage older farmers to hand over land or farm in partnership with younger farmers.  The delegation mentioned running two herds together in the presentation.  I do not know how that would work from the point of view of disease control, but we all started off, when we were not so restricted, by running a few animals on our parents' farms, or on a neighbour's farm if one was helping out a neighbour.  That is more difficult now with disease control in place.  It is a good idea and we should consider it.<\/p><p>  The reference year creates a problem.  The damage is done because many people made the decision having assumed 2014 would be the reference year and have possibly decided not to give the land to the farmer who used to get it.  Could we move forward without using any reference year, based on whoever is farming when the application date comes?<\/p><p>  Much the same would apply to farmers milking cows.  I presume the land would be leased and that another farmer would not be milking in the same dairy.  Two farmers working in partnership could use the same dairy, although again disease might be a problem.  How would that be overcome?  Perhaps the two herds could be isolated.<\/p><p>  I thank the delegation for the presentation.  We are happy to engage with the witnesses to see how we can make progress on these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012120400006#G00200","speaker":"1124"},{"type":"speech","time":1354631100,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation.  The presentation was concise and to the point.  It could be summed up by saying that there are two main issues: education and the availability of land.<\/p><p>  I am interested in the figures for the age profile of farmers, a major issue at  present.  Are those figures slightly out of date, considering the agricultural colleges have been bursting at the seams in recent times?  There are many more farmers' sons who five or six years ago were content to mix cement and build walls but who are happy now to return home and work on the family farm.  The agricultural colleges are overstretched, so are the figures up to date?  The figures for 2010 might already be out of touch.<\/p><p>  Education is essential if we are to achieve the objectives in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.  That is only a few short years away at this stage so we must be ready for it.  To be ready, however, education is crucial.  How does the Minister think we could encourage more farmers to go to college?  Where would there be other prospects apart from college?  Colleges are stretched so is there any way, through Teagasc or a similar body, that we could see other educational elements being added to the system to help young farmers coming into the system?<\/p><p>  There is no doubt we all agree about the barriers to land access.  It is essential that more and more tax incentives are put in place to allow for land mobility, particularly from a dairying point of view.  There are ambitious targets for dairying in Food Harvest 2020, and to increase dairy production we must have all the land together.  Measures must be put in place to ensure that happens.  Other farms involved in the production of beef or sheep meat could work far from each other, but in dairying it is essential that all the land is around the milking parlour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012120400006#G00300","speaker":"968"},{"type":"speech","time":1354631100,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the members of the Irish Farm Managers' Association for coming in.  It was a very interesting presentation that was concise and precise.<\/p><p>  The next few years will define farming in this country.  We have seen changes through various CAP negotiations but hopefully when there is a new CAP in place in 2014, and in 2015 when quotas are abolished in dairying, we will see major changes in the way farming is practised.  It is important, therefore, that younger people enter farming.  Any Government that is in power must have proactive policies, and the last budget was proactive about land transfer.  We must go further because we must have more young people if we are to achieve the production targets in Food Harvest 2020.  Land is a finite resource that means more to an Irish person than to any other nationality in the world.  We only need to look at John B. Keane's play to see that.<\/p><p>  The witnesses stated, referring to taxation policy, that a person could lose his status as a farmer under a long-term leasing arrangement.  How long must someone lease land before losing his status as a farmer?  We should pursue this as a committee with the Department of Finance, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Revenue Commissioners.  If that is a barrier holding people back from leasing land, it must be changed because it could have implications later on if a person has a young family and must lease the land as a result of illness.  His family might want to re-enter farming but would be unwilling to do so because of transfer of land tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax and acquisition tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012120400006#G00400","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1354631100,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the delegation for the presentation, which was very interesting.

My background is that I worked for 27 years in charge of the farm apprenticeship scheme.  The scheme was a hands-on programme of on-farm learning.  I empathise with the point Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is making and he has four converts here.  Learning farming under that scheme was what one learned hands-on in the field and not in the classroom.  The scheme faded in early 2000s because agricultural college places dried up and the whole scene changed, but now that is changing back.  This delegation is in favour of the hands-on approach.  We have a slide on training doers, not talkers.  Farming is a tough game, physically, mentally, and financially.<\/p><p>  I will respond to Deputy Heydon's question about what constitutes a manager.  One can define a manager in every way and in one way.  When we talk about managers, it could be herdsmen, a farm labourer, there could be arrangements for joint equities, there could be a salary and it could be half and half.  It is about trying to follow the New Zealand path and creating steps of entry for young people.  We do not have all the answers, but there are some ideas to think about.<\/p><p>  I will answer the question on education before I hand over to my colleagues, the practitioners. who will answer questions on the other areas.  Since the board was absorbed into Teagasc, ten years ago, I have worked in education.  My next point is not a criticism, but a fact of life.  With the downturn in numbers and issues with the budget, one serious negative development is the failure to provide the same level of training at local level as existed historically.  I am a strong believer in the provision of training at local level.  Adults who have worked as plumbers and on building are now returning to farming.  They need the expertise, knowledge and skills, which in the past the local Teagasc office was in a position to provide in competition, so to speak, with agricultural colleges.  The demise of that system - it now only exists in an odd county - is a shame.  Teagasc needs resources to provide that type of training.  I know from my last two years in Teagasc that we worked very hard with some counties to try to get those courses up and running.  The colleges are chock-a-block.  There are pockets in the country where students do not want to go agricultural college.  In my view the solution to the problem is known, but the question is how to put it in place.  I do not have an answer for the lack of money.  The part-time option at county level with the local advisers and education staff on the ground providing the training has been tried and tested.<\/p><p>  The motto of the farm apprenticeship scheme and the new dairy programme as developed by Teagasc is \"learning by doing\".  Students who have done two years in college, some of whom will have a minimum of six months done on farms and some who will have done work experience in New Zealand or elsewhere, will do a further two years on farms as part of this new diploma.  In addition to the first six months of on-farm experience, they have the choice to go to New Zealand for six more months.  We have some information on that programme which we will provide to the joint committee.<\/p><p>  It is valid to say that the numbers we provided are out of date because the data from the CSO are two years old.  While numbers have bulged in the colleges in the previous year and this year, it will be a while before those enrolled will be deemed holders, so the statistics will not change for a while.  Our purpose today is to make them change and speed up the rate of change.  In my view those who are in college now will have not much choice but to make a go of farming.  We need to open the gates to give them that chance.  That is what my colleagues and I are trying to do here today.<\/p><p>  The delegation as a whole and the Irish Farm Managers Association are dairy-oriented, but we see this as wider than dairy.  As my colleagues are all in dairy farming, that is what they know.  I am not farming, but much of what we say will apply to the cattle sector, where we can make a great many improvements.  My colleagues will deal with the other points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012120400007#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Moyles"},{"type":"speech","time":1354631700,"counter":22,"content":"<p>It is important that they would.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012120400007#H00400","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354631700,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked about the milk production partnerships and the issue of joint and several liability.  The issue is that the partnership is set up with unlimited liability.  A typical scenario could be a young farmer starting off with little or no assets joining up with a farmer who would be at the other end of his career, owning quite a lot of assets.  The ratio is wrong in terms of assets and in terms of responsibility.  The Deputy pointed out, quite rightly, that the legal profession is in the same position.  As we understand it, the lawyers and solicitors have got together and are in the process of trying to do some work on changing the legislation to correct this anomaly.

I started farming in 1990 on a small farm.  I have built up the farm by leasing a number of other farms and through milk production partnerships.  I am aware of the issues.  The issue of joint and several liability is a big one.  When one approaches someone who might be interested in working with one, it is an immediate turn-off for them to learn they could be suddenly be responsible for one's liability.  It is definitely something that needs to be examined.<\/p><p>  I will return to the herd number issue.  I have a farm manager.  Many of those who qualified through the farm apprenticeship scheme in the 1980s left the agriculture industry because it is a hard life.  Such people should have been allowed to build a certain amount of equity, but they did not have the opportunity to do so.  I believe the same thing will happen in the future.  It has been mentioned that the agricultural colleges are full.  The expansion needed for Food Harvest 2020 will mainly come through existing farmers.  They will take on employees to grow their operations.  They will take on second farms and grow them with employees as well.  Those employees must have an opportunity to build equity and get into farming in their own right.<\/p><p>  The first step is to get a herd number.  When my farm manager applied for a herd number, he was told that if he wanted to qualify, he would have to take out a lease of at least five years on land with facilities such as a yard and a crush.  He did not need the land.  All he needed was the herd number.  He was carrying the stock with me.  He wanted to build equity for himself so he could move on to the next level.  Perhaps I would be able to offer him a partnership arrangement at a future stage.  One will not take on somebody and offer them a partnership arrangement in the initial stages.  One has to grow with them.  It is like getting involved in a marriage.  One has to know who one is getting involved with.  That is the first step.  It is important to allow young people to get herd numbers without tying them up in regulations.<\/p><p>  I would also like to comment on lease arrangements.  Four or five older farmers in my local area have said publicly that they want to retire.  They are in limbo because of the single farm payment situation.  They do not want to do anything that would put their single farm payments at a disadvantage.  The families of a number of those who would like to retire do not want them to do so.  If they retire and leave farming, the younger generation will have to pay the capital taxes associated with taking over and will not qualify for agricultural relief in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012120400008#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;amus Quigley"},{"type":"speech","time":1354632300,"counter":29,"content":"<p>For how many years does one have to wait?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012120400008#J00400","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354632300,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I am not sure.

While I accept that the numbers have increased enormously over recent years, I often wonder whether many people are going to agricultural colleges just to do a third level course.  The greater the numbers in our agricultural colleges, the more diluted the courses become and the more difficult it is to get a proper education.  There is definitely a need for an effective farm management training programme.  We all accept that farm managers need to have multiple skills.  They have to be capable of managing staff.  They must have a certain level of veterinarian, agronomist and economist skills.  If we are to achieve the 2020 targets and avail of and exploit the opportunities that will present themselves after 2015, many of which we have not experienced for 30 years, we will need to put in place a better education system for farm managers.<\/p><p>  We will have to focus on technological options, for example.  Just 4% of those involved in the farming sector are engaged in grass budgeting, which is probably the most critical factor in dairy farming and beef farming in our climate.  Perhaps it is not as important in other European countries.  If we want to exploit this country's recognised grass growing potential, we will have to ensure more than 4% of our grass farming community know how much grass they are growing and how they are utilising it.  Similarly, just 6% of the farming population are engaged in flows so that they know their costs.  Nobody can run a business without knowing their costs.  That is why it is imperative for us to put training systems in place.  We need to train people to do that.  It is obvious the new UCD diploma in farm management must be promoted.  We feel that a designated unit should be established within Teagasc to drive this programme, which will deliver in 2015.

Students had three years of hands-on work, with block release and project work.  We also tried to ensure they could do farm accounts, although grass budgeting did not exist at that time.  Mr. Quigley is a graduate of the second scheme.  Despite being farm managers, approximately 20% of the graduates of the farm apprenticeship scheme returned to farming.  They were fortunate to be inheritors as it allowed them to return to family farms.  The second scheme was the trainee farmer scheme, which was aimed at farmers who could not afford to do the full three-year scheme.  Under this scheme, students did one year working on a master farm and two years supervised at home on their fathers' farms.<\/p><p>  Until last January, the Irish Farm Managers Association represented graduates of the two apprenticeship schemes.

I am accompanied by Mr. Philip Kelly, assistant secretary, and Mr. Aidan Hodson, who deals primarily with the Irish Research Council.<\/p><p>  The first day of the Council will deal with industry and Internal Market items while the second day will deal with research.  The first item on the first day concerns the recognition of professional qualifications, a Single Market Act which is going through various Councils.  It will allow people with professional qualifications to move freely between different member states.  It is aimed at reducing red tape, increasing transparency about the regulated professions in Europe along with the level of regulation in member states, and will introduce a European professional card to facilitate speedier recognition of qualifications.  The directive will also introduce an alert mechanism, particularly in the health professions, to protect patient and public safety.  It is expected that, following trialogues between the Commission, Council and the European Parliament early next year, agreement will be secured under our EU Presidency next year.<\/p><p>  The second item on the agenda is the public procurement package.  There are altogether three directives in this package: the classic public procurement directive; a directive on the procurement by entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors; and a directive on the award of concession contracts dealing with procedures involving public private partnerships.  The measures proposed will ensure better value for money by giving more flexibility, making the public procurement function more accessible for all parties, as well as increasing the opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises through the wider use of e-procurement, simplified procedures, breaking down contracts into lots and limited turnover requirements.  This is another priority file of the Single Market Act for our Presidency next year and I am committed to making good progress with the European Parliament to bring this to a successful first reading.<\/p><p>  The next item will deal with the Union customs code.  The Council will have an orientation debate on the modernised custom code which will align it to the Lisbon treaty, adjust it to the practical aspects and developments in customs legislation.  Ireland has engaged actively in all discussions and continues to contribute constructively to the debate.  The second item in this area will be the amended proposal for a regulation establishing an action programme for customs in the EU, Customs 2020.  The general objective of the programme is to strengthen the Internal Market through co-operation between participating customs authorities.  It has a proposed budget of &euro;548 million over seven years.  Ireland welcomes and fully supports the proposal for a new customs programme.  As with previous programmes, Ireland will benefit from its tools including joint actions and training of customs personnel.<\/p><p>  The next item consists of a presentation of the review into the action plan combating infringements of intellectual property rights.  Ireland agrees with the broad thrust of the Commission's report and with the conclusion that a successor plan which draws on lessons learned during the period of the current action plan is required.<\/p><p>  Following this, the Council will examine an action plan to combat intellectual property rights infringements between 2013 and 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012120400003#E00300","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354628400,"counter":75,"content":"<p>It may sound like a strange thing to say and I mean no disrespect to anyone here, but this is similar to the last meeting we held with the Minister in that there are 14 public servants here and seven elected representatives.

It is important that we get answers to all the questions we ask at these meetings but I wonder whether it is the best use of people's time.<\/p><p>  Public procurement is an important issue for us and we have discussed it in the committee before.  The Government is seeking to ensure that value for money is inherent in the agreements in Europe.  Will the Minister examine other elements of value for money?  Value for money does not necessarily mean the lowest cost of a particular contract.  Ireland has a negative record because a good deal of procurement goes outside the State <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> a comparison with other European countries.  There are others costs, including the cost of unemployment, costs relating to secondary procurement that would result from procurement and costs associated with taxes, social welfare, rates and wages.  All of these costs are lost when public procurement goes elsewhere.  Could these be included in the understanding of value for money?  For example, in my hometown, Navan, a school is being build in Johnstown.  Most of the staffing for the building project are not local.  Can we build local needs into public procurement to ensure it has a better effect on the locality?  Yesterday, we heard the story of the HSE auctioning contracts, etc.  The bunching of procurement into large contracts in the State prohibits smaller, typically local indigenous businesses from securing these, with the added costs to the State.<\/p><p>  I recollect the Minister stating that the position of the Government on the customs union group is to engage actively and contribute constructively to the debate.  Will the Minister provide more feedback on what exactly the Government's attitude will be in this area?<\/p><p>  The Minister referred to unitary patents and agreements.  Obviously if the changes create an efficiency with regard to businesses not having to take out patents in different jurisdictions, then we would be in favour of it.<\/p><p>  One of the secondary outputs of patents, royalties and licences is the transfer pricing policy carried out by large multinational companies.  An important debate is under way in Britain at the moment over the moral situation, whereby large multinationals shirk their responsibilities and ensure they do not pay their fair share of taxes.

I do not think it is possible to refer to the local wages being paid.  In other words, one cannot give an explicit preference to one country over another or one region over another but one can recognise unemployment as a feature and the taking on of people who are unemployed.  Public procurement rules are not solely based on lowest cost and other issues are taken into account.

However, I do not think that patent law can get into the much wider issue of transfer pricing.  Patent law is essentially about protecting intellectual property rights while transfer pricing belongs in the realm of revenue law.  There are international codes that set out what are legitimate rules on transfer pricing.  I am aware that there is a very lively debate ongoing on transfer pricing but it is a much wider debate than is contemplated here.<\/p><p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n raised the issue of regional aid guidelines in the context of state aid rules, which are up for review next year, as he pointed out.  The discussion we will be having next week is not specifically concerned with the regional aid guidelines.  The issue raised by the Deputy is very actively debated around the country.  Ireland has a certain percentage coverage, which is 50% at present, and the regional spread that we have chosen includes the BMW region, Limerick and the South East and so forth.  That predates my coming into office but is based on various statistical indicators of disadvantage in the regions.  The issue will come up for full debate next year but the general thrust of the Commission's plan is to reduce the areas that are covered by regional aid.  I would imagine it will be very difficult to get the figures heading in the other direction.  For the benefit of committee members, the aforementioned indicators of disadvantage include GDP <i>per capita<\/i> in purchasing power standard, PPS and unemployment.  The objective of the Commission and a number of member states is to reduce regional aid rather than to increase its geographic coverage.  That will be a very lively debate and we will be making the case that Ireland has suffered increased and particularly adverse dislocation which must be taken into account.  <\/p><p>  I agree with Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n that an industrial development ambition is all very fine but we need to have effect instruments to implement it.  From the Commission's point of view, Horizon 2020 would be a very significant instrument in that it covers research, its commercialisation and application.  The Deputy is correct that a lot of countries, including Ireland, are struggling to reach their targets.  The 3% target is for the EU as a whole and each member state has to try to contribute as best it can to that.  Ireland has set a target of 2.5% of GNP for 2020, taking into account our public finance position.  Two thirds of that is to come from the private sector, with the remaining one third from the public sector.  Even in the midst of this difficult recession we are, by and large, maintaining our research budgets because we believe it is vital.  As the Deputy will know, we have carried out a prioritisation exercise to make sure we are expending our research funding in areas where commercialisation is likely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012120400005#G00600","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","time":1354629000,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I call Senator Quinn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012120400005#G00700","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1354629000,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister who seems to be getting very fond of us and is coming before the committee on a regular basis.<\/p><p>  I am concerned about subsidiarity.  It seems to me that more and more power is going to the centre of Europe rather than being delegated outwards.  I wonder to what extent we are very good Europeans compared to others.  A lot of the regulations that are made - not just European regulations - apply to small companies as well as large ones.  There is a suggestion that far fewer regulations should apply to start-up companies that have fewer than ten employees.  In the case of France, for example, a number of regulations do not apply to companies until they have 50 employees.  It could be argued that this discourages companies from taking on their 51st employee and therefore growing but it appears that many of the European regulations could also be limited to larger companies.  I would like to see that issue advanced but I do not know to what extent it is possible to achieve it, with a form of subsidiarity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012120400005#G00800","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354629600,"counter":85,"content":"<p>This is an issue that is of concern to many member states.  The Commission will produce a document in March on the issue of better regulation and exemptions for small businesses.  I am aware of the French system.  The issue for each member state will be to try and see whether it can adapt its regulations to this.  We will publish a companies Bill shortly through which we will reduce the audit requirements for companies with fewer than 50 employees.  We need to look at each area to see what can be done.  In some areas, such as health and safety, it would be very hard to exempt companies with fewer than 50 employees for fear of a genuine risk to life and limb.  The principle is well accepted and we await the Commission's document to see how it will seek to implement this.<\/p><p>  There are implications for us also.  We have just completed an audit of regulations for retail business, which will be of interest to the Senator.  This was an audit of licences generally and we are now looking to see what scope there is to simplify those codes here and to get collective application rather than having different enforcements with different requirements.  Regulation is a huge issue.  The Commission is to try to bring forward a successor to the 25% administration burden cut, which is due to be completed this year.  Therefore, there will be debate on what should replace that and there are different views from the different member states.  <\/p><p>  One of the views being strongly advocated by the United Kingdom is the one-for-one notion.  The United Kingdom has a very elaborate system.  A cabinet committee there does a detailed evaluation of the regulatory burden from each regulation and every time a new regulation is introduced, it must replace one of an equivalent compliance burden.  That system has had mixed success, but it is the Rolls Royce of systems in terms of putting a requirement on the system to respond.  However, it is quite intensive in terms of resources.  We considered doing the same, but the sheer intensity of creating an evaluation of how much regulation exists and achieving a one-for-one exchange would be a substantial task.  From where we stand today, it would be a substantial task to get to a place where we could implement a one-for-one regime.  While it is a very attractive approach, the practicality of doing it is challenging in the current environment.<\/p><p>  I have just been reminded that the enforcement of the services directive will see a levelling of the playing pitch.  Countries transpose obligations in different ways and if they act the maggot to some degree in terms of transposition, the enforcement of the directive will help catch up on protective measure requirements that are currently applied evenly in some sectors.

It is interesting that one of the core parts of this is the public procurement package.  The OPW is coming before the committee next week to discuss public procurement, particularly in view of the fact someone has been appointed to take overall responsibility for procurement at Government level.<\/p><p>  My main concern with regard to public procurement is the decision that will be made in Europe on this and how that will be implemented here.  We have a history of taking every word literally and of dotting all the i's and crossing all the t's, but we need more flexibility.  The IPA published a paper recently on Kilkenny County Council, which took more into consideration than the price in procurement.  It considered the social aspect, the local aspect and the service provided by the people who would get the contract.  The Minister must be conscious when making points in regard to public procurement, that we should take into consideration the route we need to take in that regard.  The Minister mentioned earlier that we are very good at acquiring funding for SMEs, but they seem to be excluded when it comes to public procurement.  Another key issue concerns the definition of an SME.  When we listen to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, he seems to talk about an SME as a company with 50 or more employees.  However, the majority of us would see an SME as a company with approximately ten employees.<\/p><p>  I have a question with regard to Horizon 2020 and how the budget for that impacts on other budgets.  I refer specifically to a meeting held last week with a number of MEPs on the issue of the budget available for innovation and research and the agricultural budget and of how these could be better linked so that we do not get a serious deterioration in the agricultural budget in the multiannual framework.  Someone mentioned earlier that agriculture has gone from being mainly concentrated on agriculture to being a food industry.  This should be borne in mind in the negotiations on the multiannual framework budget.  Horizon 2020 should link into the agriculture sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012120400006#H00300","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speech","time":1354629600,"counter":87,"content":"<p>To be fair, these public procurement packages are to do with what Deputy Lawlor has spoken about.

Flexibility is being provided to take into account lifecycle costs, the requirement that works, supplies or services bear specific labels or environmental, social or other characteristics, provided they also accept equivalent labels.<\/p><p>  The EU requirement is that there will be a level playing pitch for whoever is pitching for the business.  At the same time, it recognises that SMEs need to be given access, so it also includes provisions to encourage authorities to divide larger contracts into lots and the removal of unjustified barriers to SME participation and the removal of turnover requirements that are set too high.  Like us and member states, the Commission is anxious that smaller companies get a better chance to make their pitch.

That approach involves trying to find a company to solve a problem.  That company submits a bid to design a solution to the problem and it is the solution that goes out to tender.  That innovative procurement route gives the company in question a great chance to shape the solution and secure the business.  It also allows innovative companies to attract reference sales into an Irish system that can then use them to open doors elsewhere.  To be fair, the European Commission is pushing this.  The European Union is not holding us back as we try to open better access routes to small and medium-sized enterprises.  Obviously, a balance must be struck.  Some would like every little bundle to be divided out.  If that leads to inefficient or costly procurement, taxpayers will have to sacrifice the opportunity to improve the health service in order to support scattered tendering.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform constantly has to strike a balance in bundling to the extent that good value is achieved and bundling to the degree that many small and medium-sized enterprises are removed from the process.  To be fair, the National Procurement Service and Enterprise Ireland are working together to help businesses to form consortiums to access tenders designed to give good value for money, or to do so on their own.

I do not propose to read the written statement we submitted which sets out our presentation in detail.  Instead, I will highlight the points we would like to make and we will be happy to discuss other aspects in more detail.<\/p><p>  We represent the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and today our focus is on energy efficiency in buildings, in particular, an area of activity that has grown strongly in recent years, with many home owners, businesses and public bodies acting to reduce their energy costs through energy efficiency measures and in the process reducing their environmental impact.  To provide a sense of the scale of the sector, driven by Government grants we administer on behalf of the Government, more than &euro;250 million was spent in Ireland last year on energy efficiency measures.  This activity supported more than 5,000 jobs.  By our reckoning, energy efficiency actions in the past few years have, in total, reduced Ireland's annual energy bill by more than &euro;500 million.<\/p><p>  I propose to make a few points on energy use in homes and the trends in that regard, talk a little about building energy ratings and provide an update on some of the work being done on energy retrofitting in buildings.  Buildings in Ireland account for over 40% of national energy use and are, obviously, a large user of energy.  Homes, probably, account for the largest proportion of this, accounting for 27% of all the energy we use.  Within a home, approximately 80% of the energy is used in heating the space and the water, while the other 20% is used in providing electricity for appliances and lighting, etc.  Energy use in homes has been steadily declining for many years, driven in the main by the building regulations.  A new home built today will use only approximately 25% of the energy used in a home built in the 1970s, which gives some idea of how much has changed.  We are at a point where we can envisage quite soon what we might call \"near zero energy\" buildings which virtually use no energy.  The improvements in the energy performance of new buildings put an additional focus on the retrofitting of homes built in previous eras in order to improve their energy performance.  I will return to that issue.<\/p><p>  On building energy ratings, members of the committee will be familiar with the building energy rating, BER, certificate which is obligatory when a home is offered for sale or rent.  This certificate has been in use since 2006 when the European Union's energy performance in buildings directive was transposed.  Oversight of this certification is shared between the SEAI and the Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The SEAI has been designated as the issuing authority for BERs.  This means our responsibilities cover developing the methods by which BERs are calculated, registering and ensuring the quality and competence of assessors, holding the national register and database of all building energy ratings carried out and published and performance and awareness.<\/p><p> To date, approximately 330,000 building energy ratings have been carried out and formally published, most of them for homes but some for non-residential buildings.  Approximately, 1,000 building energy rating assessors are registered with us to carry out assessments.  In 2010 the overarching directive for this area, the energy of homes and buildings directive, was recast and a number of changes are on the way, one of which will commence in January.  From that date, the BER will not just be mandatory as part of the sale transaction but must also be displayed in all advertisements relating to the sale and letting of property.  This will bring a new profile and awareness to the rating and help people to make decisions.<\/p><p>  Ireland's approach to the building energy rating certificate has always been to use this instrument in a positive way, not just to see it as a compliance tool.  It understands its usefulness in bringing the energy performance of homes and other buildings to people's attention, perhaps allowing them to factor it into their decision making when buying or renting a home.  The rating also lets them know what is possible in terms of improving a building's performance and lowering costs.  We provide a building energy rating as part of our retrofitting grants scheme, Better Energy Homes, which provides home owners with a formal measure of the improvements they secure when they upgrade their homes with the support of Government grants.<\/p><p>  I now turn to the issue of retrofitting existing buildings.  I have mentioned that with standards for new buildings having improved so much in recent years, much of the policy focus is now on how to improve the energy performance of the large number of buildings built in previous times which could benefit from significant improvements in their energy efficiency performance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012120400003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Motherway","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354631100,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Motherway.

We are also pleased to be here to discuss the related subject of the prospective substantial amendments to the building control regime.  These measures were announced by the Minister in July 2011 and essentially they involve the commencement of a section of the Building Control Act 1990 requiring the submission to building control authorities of certificates of compliance with the building regulations before, during and after construction and the amendment of the building regulations setting out the form of the proposed certificates of compliance and the administrative procedures governing their use.  They also involve engagement with the City and County Managers' Association to make arrangements for a move to a regionalised and shared services model for the administration of building control functions; for the agreement of standardised approaches and common protocols to ensure nationwide consistency in the administration of building control functions and the meaningful oversight of building activity; and for agreement on common measures for the support and further development of the building control function nationwide.<\/p><p>  In order to put the above measures in context, it is first helpful to appreciate the provisions of the Building Control Act of 1990 and how they may apply in practice.  The Act of 1990 sets out a clear statutory framework for construction activity based on clear legal standards, as set out in the building regulations.  They provide detailed guidance on how these standards can be achieved in practice, with the burden and responsibility for compliance resting first and foremost with developers and builders, designers and building owners.  They include a statutory responsibility for professionals to design in accordance with the building regulations, with responsibility for enforcing compliance with the building regulations resting with the 37 local building control authorities.  The Act sets out clear roles and responsibilities for a number of parties, namely the Minister, the owners and developer, designers and local building control authorities.  The role of the Minister is to ensure that appropriate regulations and technical standards are in place in order to give practical effect to the Act.  Contrary to common perception, the Minister has no role with regard to enforcement activity, which is delegated exclusively to local building control authorities who are independent in the exercise of their statutory powers.<\/p><p>  The Act places responsibility for compliance with the building regulations first and foremost on the shoulders of owners and developers.  Where concerns regarding non-compliance arise, the Act enables the local building control authority to serve enforcement notices on the owner and the builder.  Remediation of defects is a matter between the parties concerned - that is, the owner and the builder or developer and their insurers.  If satisfactory resolution cannot be achieved through dialogue and negotiation, the option of seeking civil legal remedy may be considered.  In such situations, the statutory requirements provide a yardstick by which the owners or builders, their technical consultants and the courts can determine whether a building is fit for purpose.<\/p><p>  The role of local authorities is to administer the building control process and to enforce statutory obligations.  Local building control authorities have strong powers under the Act to scrutinise proposals and inspect works in progress, serve enforcement notices for non-compliance, institute proceedings for breaches of regulatory requirements and seek High Court injunctions if non-compliance poses considerable and serious danger to the public.  Failure to comply with the building regulations may result in a fine of up to &euro;5,000 or imprisonment for a period of up to six months, or both, following a successful summary prosecution.  A successful conviction on indictment may result in a fine of up to &euro;50,000 or imprisonment for a period of up to two years, or both.<\/p><p>  The Department has set a target inspection rate of 12 to 15% of all buildings covered by valid commencement notices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012120400004#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Layde","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354631700,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I address my first questions to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  Much of what has been discussed amounts to a no-brainer.  It is good for the environment and the retrofits are good too.  We may end up with a trade surplus if we are not obliged to import all our energy and we produce energy savings and so on.  Utility bills are a major issue for people at the moment.  I am interested in two particular aspects, one of which is the pay-as-you-save scheme.  I do not understand why it has taken so long.  Is the blockage related to the legislation?  I understood it was almost ready to roll at the end of the lifetime of the previous Government, but it is likely to be at least a further year to 18 months before it is rolled out.  Given that it has the potential to offer gainful employment as well as everything else, I am curious about such a delay.<\/p><p>  Which Department is the authority dealing with?  I received an answer to a question last week from the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources but some weeks beforehand the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation rolled out a scheme in this area.  I am curious about what is going on.<\/p><p>  I was involved with someone who was trying to put together a better energy communities pilot scheme.  We were considering partners who might be compatible.  The timeframe on the pilot scheme was remarkably tight and I am surprised there were 18 schemes.  Will the authority outline the findings and whether 18 schemes is sufficient to give the authority a robust overview of what could be gained from the scheme?  I see the merits in it.<\/p><p>  The building control regime sounds great in principle and it is the right thing to do in policy terms.  Will it work in practice?  I have serious concerns about it.  I have seen the inner workings of local authorities.  In my experience developers do not take much notice of enforcement notices.  They do not take them as seriously as they sound because there is no follow through and no ability to follow through, although there should be.  The Department stated that the Minister has no role in enforcement but he has a role with regard to the embargo on staffing.  If there is insufficient staffing to provide the enforcement required, then there is a doubt about whether it is workable.<\/p><p>  My experience has been that because there are 37 different local authorities, they do not share the relevant information.  If someone is a serial offender, she could run out of offences in one area and then move to the next.  We saw a good example of this with the developer of Priory Hall, who previously developed in Laois or Offaly and left a trail of destruction after him.  The lack of a co-ordinating function to watch particular individuals means that often these people have done the damage before they are caught.  Is the Department satisfied that sufficient sanction is in place?  Is the sanction available if one does not get it through the courts with a judgment and if it takes so long?  I know that some enforcement notices relating to planning infringements take two or three years to get to the courts.  If someone decides not to pay any attention, some notices will not even get that far because there are insufficient staff available to deal with them.  Unless we examine the practical delivery in addition to the improvements in the legal framework, it will not be possible to provide the cover that people require.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012120400005#F00200","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1354631700,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Will the relevant person reply to those issues, please?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012120400005#F00300","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354631700,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I will answer the questions that pertain to us.

We must consider the regulations themselves and also the issues of enforcement and the capacity of the local government system.  The Minister is on the point of introducing the new regulatory framework.  This is a recognition that there are inadequacies in the current framework and a need for a more robust system.  I note the Deputy welcomed the proposals to make explicit the requirement for compliance by those involved in the delivery of buildings at various stages where there is an absolute and clear legal accountability.  For that reason, the regulations will represent a step change in the approach to building standards and building control.<\/p><p>  It is valid to query how one turns the new legislative framework into practice and the capacity and legal recourse of local authorities.  The Department's engagement with local authorities in their role as building control authorities is about ramping up the capacity of the local authorities as the enforcement authorities.  They will be working on a regional basis which is in line with the overall approach to reform of the local government system.<\/p><p>  Of course, there are staffing difficulties, as the Deputy mentioned, given the prevailing public expenditure circumstances.  It is a question of organising and deploying the resources available to the Department and to the local authorities to best effect.  We are, and will be, working closely with the County and City Managers' Association to ensure the enforcement system is as fit for purpose as we believe the regulatory system will be.<\/p><p>  It will be an ICT-based electronic system.  It will be possible to monitor and track the progress of individual developments in a way it has not been in the past.  There will, potentially, be the capacity to share information more quickly and more widely between the various regions, for enforcement and to identify people who are, as the Deputy put it, recurrent offenders.<\/p><p>  The sanctions are considerable, including periods of imprisonment when cases are taken on indictment.  The courts are independent in the exercise of their functions but it is important that the local authorities, as enforcement authorities, are proactive in taking cases forward and, where possible, because it is a complex process, taking appropriate cases forward on indictment, with the consequent higher penalties that arise in that case.  The Department will continue to work with local authorities to ensure the new system is properly and completely enforced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012120400006#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Layde"},{"type":"speech","time":1354632300,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late.  I was in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  For some strange reason, questions to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government were scheduled for the same time as this meeting.  The committee can do nothing about that.<\/p><p>  Two energy saving schemes are in place at present.  There is a problem in how they are being policed.  A grant of &euro;200 is available to insulate an attic and of &euro;250 to insulate the walls of a terraced house.  These grants are not adequate and are not having the desired effect.  Could Mr. Tom Halpin or someone from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland reply to this query?  When I speak of policing I am referring to work being checked when finished.  Constituents of mine have had work done under the scheme where pipes have been run up the outside wall of a house to a tank in the attic inside a metal frame with no insulation.  The first time the temperature falls below zero the pipes burst in the attic.  A question hangs over the type of work being done and the contractors on the approved list.  Overall, however, the schemes have brought benefits.  Many houses are much warmer because of them.<\/p><p>  What level of engagement has there been with financial institutions to persuade them to free up money for retrofits?  Credit unions could be useful in this respect because a relatively small amount of money is required.  Many of the houses that are in need of energy upgrades are old terraced houses, council houses or privately built bungalows which are occupied by people on low and middle incomes.  Has any work been done with credit unions?  Credit unions tell public representatives they are anxious to help initiatives such as this.<\/p><p>  The party I represent put forward proposals for a ten-year scheme that utility companies could buy into.  Has work been done with utility companies on such a scheme?  Let us suppose it costs &euro;150 a month to heat my house but it would cost only &euro;100 if it were insulated properly.  If I have my house retrofitted, I could continue, for ten years, to pay a utility bill of &euro;150 and &euro;50 of that could be repayment of the cost of retrofitting.  Some pension funds are interested in schemes like that.  Has any such work been done with pension funds on such schemes?  Figures released recently indicate that &euro;89 billion are held in savings and &euro;80 billion in pension funds.  Could some of that be tapped into to get housing stock up to an acceptable standard?<\/p><p>  Why is the Department allowing apartments to be built that are separated by plaster slabs?  I have heard all the technical jargon and I have even seen diagrams sent from the Department that claim to show this is safe.  I have heard regulations on the Continent being quoted.  I have not travelled much but when I do I look at these things and I have seen how apartments are built.  In other countries, apartments are separated by concrete under, over, beside, in front and behind.  Floors, ceilings and walls are made of concrete.  This means they are soundproof and fireproof and residents have a level of privacy.  In the town I live in, two neighbours had a row and one neighbour put his boot through the wall separating the other neighbour's apartment from the staircase.

Timber frame guidelines indicate that they must be timber frame with a reinforcing strand board or plywood with the plaster board on either side.  This is the guideline agreed by the committee set up to investigate and make recommendations about the construction of timber frame housing.  A consortium issued a report in 2002 or 2003.  Proper construction rests primarily with the timber frame supplier who is responsible for providing to the site timber frame in accordance with those guidelines.  In other words, stick timber construction, as it may be referred to in the United States, is not permitted under the timber frame approval system.  The Deputy seems to be implying that one could literally put a boot through walls of plaster board between adjoining premises.  There would have to be a strand board or plywood timber built into that composite panel, plus plaster board, fire rating and fire stopping material.  If, as the Deputy says, the apartment building is in that condition, it seems, from his description, not to be in compliance.<\/p><p>  On the other point as to whether concrete can be used, of course this is the case.  A planning application may specify masonry or concrete construction but subsequently timber frame construction is used.  This is in the case where the contractor has substituted a timber frame.  This might notionally be compliant but unless all the component parts are in place - the guidance documents are clear on that - then it is not in compliance.  It is the responsibility of the timber frame manufacturer and the skills of the people on site.  There are also right-on-site guidelines and a timber frame guidelines book.  The information is available.  What we have found in the examples to which the Deputy referred earlier is that the construction was not carried out in accordance with the very clear recommendations - in other words, vertical and horizontal fire-stopping within the cavities, the famous example of which is Priory Hall.  We found there was fixing of the wall tiles to an ordinary piece of timber rather than to a structural piece of timber.  These are issues that arise in those forms of construction and there should be supervision so this does not happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012120400007#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1354632900,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I have seen the guidance documents.

I hope I am proved wrong but we are running the risk of a tragedy happening in an apartment block.  Why are we continuing to allow developers to build these matchboxes with timber and plaster board?  There should be proper standards.  These apartments do not even have proper balconies; rooms are shaped more like a banana than a regular room.  I was in an apartment where anyone of normal height sitting on the couch at one wall could stretch over to the far wall.<\/p><p>  The officials and the legislators have a responsibility to do something to address this situation.  Why is timber frame and plaster board construction allowed?  The guidance documents state that fire will not travel through this construction; the fact of the matter is that timber burns and plaster slabs are not sound-proof.  People have neither security nor privacy.  Why do we continue to punish people by forcing them to live in such places?  How many people in this room want to live in a place like that?

I commend the SEAI for the work it does through the various retrofit programmes.  I also commend it for the important information and education programmes with which it is involved.  I read recently about a dual initiative in which it was involved with the Department of Education and Skills, whereby information was provided for schools in raising awareness of energy issues.  This is a welcome initiative which must be properly promoted.  I am aware of a better energy communities project, whereby a day centre for the elderly and another community building in my constituency came together and put forward a viable proposal which proved successful.  That is to be welcomed.  There is major potential in the scheme to which I refer, particularly if we can expand it and give it the time and attention it deserves.  Schemes such as this would create great awareness in towns and villages.<\/p><p>  I have three questions for the SEAI.  I am aware that it is not directly responsible for the smart metering initiative, but are there plans to drive this initiative forward?  Information on energy usage is extremely important to households.  The idea behind smart metering is that information is meant to be fed back to householders on where they are using most energy and what they might do to reduce their energy consumption.  Are there other technologies available which might be used to inform householders about their energy consumption?<\/p><p>  Home heating systems for which grants are provided - geothermal, solar and wood pellet boiler systems - are those which relate to renewable initiatives.  These are all very good systems, but ordinary householders cannot access them for two reasons, namely, they cannot afford them and they are difficult to understand.  Given that fuel poverty is prevalent, does the SEAI consider advising people to install solid fuel stoves or dual systems that would heat water rather than their having open fireplaces only?  I understand the former are 80% efficient, whereas the latter are only 20% efficient.  The beauty of such stoves or dual systems is that they are affordable and much cheaper than the more complicated renewable technologies.  In addition, they are also very easy to use.  They go further in addressing fuel poverty and reducing the amount of material people burn in their households.  We should consider the installation of simple systems of this nature.  Irish society is predominantly rural in nature and many people would take advantage of an initiative in this regard if one were put in place.  Such an initiative would help to reduce carbon emissions and improve energy efficiency in people's homes.  Is the SEAI considering initiatives involving cheaper, easier to operate systems such as those to which I refer?<\/p><p>  I agree with a great deal of what Deputy Brian Stanley said about the pay-as-you-save system.  Energy suppliers and credit unions must be brought on board in this regard.  Such a move would be very welcome in order that people might be in a position to access some of these schemes.<\/p><p>  My final question to the SEAI relates to the public sector.  I understand all public sector agencies and organisations will be obliged to either rent or own high energy saving buildings.  Is the SEAI involved with the various agencies and organisations involved in achieving the very challenging target in this regard?  After all, what is proposed must be achieved within six years.  I stand open to correction, but I understand there is an EU directive which stipulates we must achieve this target.<\/p><p>  I welcome the new regime for building regulations.  There is a legacy issue in this regard by virtue of the fact that much of the construction work done in recent years was of a poor standard.  This was evident the winter before last when many water mains froze because they had not been properly installed.  Will the new regime address problems of this nature?  Will utility companies be obliged to ensure the relevant infrastructure will be installed to the proper standard in new housing estates, etc.?<\/p><p>  The committee previously discussed high radon levels in certain parts of the country.  Radon is a dangerous gas and I am wondering whether there might be a proposal to introduce certificates similar to the BER certificates in respect of radon levels.  Such certificates would indicate whether the levels of radon in a house were low, whether radon barriers had been installed or whether work had been carried out in order to address high levels of radon.  There is a need for certificates of this nature.  Will Dr. Motherway indicate whether there are proposals in this regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012120400008#J00200","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354633500,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his kind words about some of our programmes.  The smart metering initiative is led by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  We work with it in that regard, particularly in encouraging people to change their behaviour and act on the information provided for them.  It has announced a national roll-out of smart meters to all homes.  I do not have the details in that regard with me, but the Deputy is correct in stating smart meters and the other technologies that are becoming available are empowering for consumers in understanding how they use energy in their homes.  There are apps available for smartphones and other mobile devices, whereby people can interact with their heating systems, etc.  This is exciting and will give rise to many benefits in the coming years.<\/p><p>  I take the Deputy's point on the types of technologies consumers choose in order to upgrade their homes.  The bread and butter of our grants scheme relates to attic insulation, cavity wall insulation, upgrading boilers and so on.  There is no grant available for stoves.  Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the Minister to decide what is grant-aided.  We do, however, encourage their use under our utility obligations.  As stated, the utility companies all have energy saving targets to meet and we assign credits towards those targets to technologies the companies may wish to promote.  Some utility companies are promoting the use of stoves and we encourage them to do so as part of meeting their targets.<\/p><p>  We work actively and intensively with all of the various public sector agencies and organisations.  The target is that the sector should become 33% more energy efficient by 2020.  Some bodies are moving very quickly in this regard and a great deal of work is being done, with some very positive projects in train.  A new EU energy efficiency directive was recently finalised and this will drive matters forward even further.

We had a debate at a meeting of this committee on who is responsible in that context.  An architect is responsible for drawing up the plans and giving them to the builders to ensure the work is carried out, but it is the responsibility of the inspector who carries out the inspection of the development to sign off on it, not that of the architect.  That is my view, having regard to the person doing the work and the contractor.<\/p><p>  Deputy Murphy suggested there should be liaison between the authorities.  The Planning and Development Act 2001 provides that builders, or rogue developers as we would term some of them, who do not perform in one county should not be allowed to perform in another country but a local authority has to take a High Court action to ensure that.  It should be made mandatory that one local authority would report to the other in this respect and there should be a striking-off mechanism for such developers or a second strike against them in this respect and they would be out of the equation.

The equivalent figure not too long ago was well over 10 tonnes and at one stage it was 12 tonnes.  Therefore, there has been a very dramatic reduction in that respect.  The principal reasons for that are related to improved energy performance standards, insulation, better heating and more efficient systems and a switch in fuel to less carbon intensive fuels, most notably from solid fuel to gas, to put it crudely.  The third area in this context is that we have had a decarbonisation of our electricity system to a considerable degree.<\/p><p>  When it comes to comparison with the UK, the two key determinants are the average age of the housing stock here and the average floor area.

Second, the average floor area of an Irish house is estimated to be about 119 sq. m. compared with 87 sq. m. in the UK, but hot water, lighting and other utilities are used in every house.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012120400009#K01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin O'Rourke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354634700,"counter":172,"content":"<p>Have we optimised the job creation potential in terms of retrofitting housing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012120400010#L00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354634700,"counter":173,"content":"<p>The great advantage of retrofitting housing, compared to many other areas, is that it is very labour-intensive.

The more homes that are retrofitted, the more jobs are supported.  From speaking to people in their homes, they often value that component strongly.

I accept that it is a rules-based scheme.  I contacted the SEAI and then got in touch with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, about a case in which someone had hired a contractor to carry out specific work involving solar panels and a high-efficiency gas boiler.  When the declaration of works was submitted, a different contractor carried out the works.  That can happen for a variety of reasons such as the unavailability of the original contractor but, as it transpired, the contractor who carried out the work, based on the declaration of works that was sent back to the SEAI, was not registered for some of the work and therefore the grant was null and void.  A low-income household was involved and the cost was approximately &euro;5,000.  I accept that rules govern the scheme but I am concerned about the rigidity of the scheme in such a case where someone conscientiously decides to engage someone to carry out the works for their own benefit in terms of heating their home and to make an environmental contribution.  A genuine mistake was made.  The applicant applied in good faith with a reasonable expectation of carrying out the work.  The case has not yet been resolved.  I inquired of the Minister about how to pursue the case further.  There will be such cases in which genuine people will find they do not qualify for the scheme for reasons beyond their control.

It relates to energy and it is also aimed at the departmental officials.  I have observed planned maintenance in my county in recent years.  Houses that undergo planned maintenance and upgrades have had ranges removed and oil-fired central heating systems installed.  From an energy efficiency point of view it seems that once one commits people to oil, one is restricting their choice in terms of fuel.  Gas is not being installed and solid-fuel ranges are being removed.  The best that can be done is that the range is left there until it falls into disrepair, or an open fire is sometimes left intact.  The situation arises for people in local authority houses that they cannot afford a fill of oil.  They either have a range that is still functioning or they have an open fire in a room but they cannot buy oil.  One cannot buy it in small quantities in the same way that one can buy a bag of coal.  There does not appear to be any prospect that the price of oil will decrease.  From an energy policy point of view such expenditure by local authorities does not seem the right direction to take.<\/p><p>  In terms of fuel poverty, it is shocking to realise that what is being presented is a supposedly better system.  New windows and doors are also supplied.  If people cannot afford to put oil in a tank they must survive in the cold.  That is how it will be in the future.

If, as the Deputy outlined, new windows and doors are installed, that could dramatically reduce the heating requirement of the home, which will hopefully then lower the bills.  However, I accept that cost could still be an issue for some people.  As well as looking at the supply side it is important that the upgrades look at the demand side - whether the insulation and windows are as good as they could be.

I accept what Mr. Layde said in his opening remarks and in some of his responses that we need more robust regulation and monitoring of regulations regarding our building control system.  It is frustrating from everyone's point of view that we are examining this matter after the horse has bolted.  It is critical that we do not allow circumstances such as these to arise again, not only in regard to the areas that are now being regulated but also in respect of those areas where we are leaving vacancies in the system.  I want to focus on this specifically.<\/p><p>  In January of this year, the water services legislation was before the committee.  At that stage, the Minister and his officials committed to including provisions in the regulations we are discussing today to regulate contractors who are providing services to the public regarding the upgrading of the septic tanks.  In my submission on the draft regulations under the water services legislation, I highlighted that specific issue again.<\/p><p>  I was extremely disappointed, when I raised this issue through a parliamentary question in October, to be told there are no plans for regulation in this area.  I was told it is the responsibility of the homeowner to ensure the contractor who carries out the work does so to the proper standard.  There has been a litany of cases involving fly-by-night contractors putting down tarmacadam and roofing houses.  During the building boom, the problem was exacerbated.  Fly-by-night contractors were even building apartment blocks, and we now see the consequences.<\/p><p>  The last thing we want is rogue contractors telling people, especially the elderly, that on foot of the upcoming inspection regime, their septic tanks will have to be upgraded, perhaps at a cost of &euro;2,500.  The contractors may dig a hole with a mini digger, fill it in again and leave with the cash in their back pockets.  Six or 12 months later, a local authority inspector may say the tank is not up to standard and must be upgraded.  There will be no comeback for an older person in such circumstances.  It is crucial that the regulations before us be amended to take account, from February 2013, of contractors who will offer to carry out inspections of septic tanks in addition to the official inspections, or to carry out upgrading works.

Unfortunately, ten years on some of the most important accession commitments have not been met.  I refer to the obligations of Bosnia-Herzegovina on becoming a member state and will highlight three of them.  The first was to ensure the compatibility of all laws with the European Convention on Human Rights, notably the constitution; the second was to ensure the independence and efficiency of the justice system; and the third was to continue education reform and end segregation and discrimination on the basis of ethnic origin within the education system.  I stress these three issues because they are essential stumbling blocks to Bosnia-Herzegovina's continued European integration.  Taken together, they illustrate a lack of integration of European values in public affairs, administration, civic and political life.<\/p><p>  European integration, notably integration with the European Union, is, in large part, a technical exercise.  There are many laws to be harmonised and agencies to be set up.  However, all European institutions, in particular the Council of Europe since 1949, acknowledge that Europe is, first and foremost, a community of values.  Democracy, human rights and the rule of law are our common values that underpin all additional structures, be they economic, monetary, community, military or security co-operation.  I emphasise values primarily because I wish to emphasise the role Ireland could play in this regard during its Presidency.<\/p><p>  On recent developments, I will go back only as far as 2010.  In October 2010 most of us believed there were very hopeful signs of modernisation and Europeanisation among the Bosnian electorate when, for the first time since the war, non-ethnic nationalist parties won significantly at the polls and seemed poised to push forward an agenda of democratisation and European integration.  However, the old ghosts of nationalism, collectivism, cronyism, corruption and propaganda fought back hard.   When a coalition political agreement was finally reached at the end of 2011, 2012 was heralded as the year of Europe for Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Instead, it was the year of the Sestorka - the Bosnian word for the &quot;Six&quot;, or the six party leaders.  The Six made, broke and made new deals, and all the while the business of the people was left aside for the most part.  The international community, in which I include the Council of Europe and all international community organisations, acquiesced in this performance by touting political agreements made by the Six and not challenging the extra-institutional nature of this manner of proceeding.  In October 2012, just one month ago, at the local elections we witnessed a resurgence of success for the same post-war nationalist-type parties.  This was based on the electorate's broad disappointment at the lack of change brought about by those who had won at the 2010 elections.  At the end of 2012, we are seeing the third state-level government which was inaugurated only a few days ago.  A new configuration of the Six has less than two years, or until the next general election, to make significant progress, not only on European integration but, before that, in fulfilling its Council of Europe obligations.  I refer specificially to the <font color=\"#222222\">Sejdi&amp;#263;<\/font><font color=\"#222222\"> <\/font>and Finci judgment of the European Court of Human Rights which requires amendments to be made to the constitution.  This must be done before the next elections, in the first place to avoid having membership of the Council of Europe questioned and, second, to allow the SAA to enter into force to move on the issues of EU integration and the application for membership.  Many other urgent issues also await attention.<\/p><p>  I do not wish to paint only a negative picture.  In theory, the new Six coalition has potential because its members have the parliamentary majority required to move the European integration agenda forward, if they prioritise it, take heed of European standards and take advice from the EU delegation and the Council of Europe on the legislation they should propose and the standards they should fulfil.  I have a great deal of optimism for Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially its future, judging by the young people and civil society activists with whom I have been able to work.  For that potential to be realised in full, however, Bosnia-Herzegovina must first integrate European values.  Education and constitutional reform will be essential for this to happen.  In addition, the international community must provide a constant and forceful reminder of these values and the centrality of citizens to democracy.  Democracy, human rights and the rule of law are the main values of the Council of Europe but, not coincidentally, they also form the heart of the Copenhagen criteria for accession to the European Union.  In other words, they are the ABC of European integration.  It goes without saying there seems little point in sitting the leaving certificate examination, to which one might liken the process of EU integration, if one has not first mastered the ABC.<\/p><p>  The international community can play a more constructive role in getting Bosnia-Herzegovina to this point and Ireland, in particular, can be a leader.  It has a strong moral voice, not only because of its experience in overcoming conflict through political compromise and with major economic and social reforms.  This strong moral voice can be leveraged at the highest political level in Bosnia-Herzegovina during the Irish Presidency.  Bosnian politicians and citizens will be sensitive to the lessons of Ireland's successes, as well to the possibility of avoiding its less successful experiences.  A few days from now Ireland will complete its OSCE chairmanship in office and be able to turn to its EU Presidency duties.  During this period the Irish leadership, in emphasising the need for political compromise and the integration of European values, could give a real chance to reform while there is still time ahead of the next general election.  If 2013 can be the year of reform in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, encompassing constitutional and institutional reform, strengthening the independence of the justice system, the competence of local self-government, parliamentary responsibility and the enforcement of accountability mechanisms, 2014 could be the year of European integration for Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The country could be put on the path to sustainable reforms, the integration of European values and EU and euro-Atlantic integration.  This is the time to work jointly to ensure Bosnia-Herzegovina will not be a failed state and that its talented young people will have the opportunity to lead their country into the European Union.  Artificially pushing forward the process of EU integration, rather than pushing for the integration of European values, standards and practices, would be totally insufficient.  I make a plea to the international community to focus on the ABC of values and standards, beginning with those of the Council of Europe - democracy, human rights and the rule of law.  Propelled by strong conditionality on the part of the European Union, this approach offers the best hope to achieve concrete results.  This is the joint challenge for all of the European institutions: the Council of Europe, the OSCE and the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012120400003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Anne Hennessey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354630200,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hennessey.

It is always a pleasure and an honour to return to Dublin and appear before the joint committee.<\/p><p>  This committee and the Irish Houses of Parliament have given greater attention to Bosnia-Herzegovina than has been the case in many other member states of the EU.  I applaud them for that because it has delivered important dividends.  It is my firm conviction that the principled scrutiny given to Serbia's candidacy for the EU, in the context of the war crimes accountability issue, was one of the reasons Ratko Mladi\u0107 was discovered and handed over to the International Criminal Court in The Hague for trial.  It was not just Ireland that was involved in this regard.  The Dutch Parliament took a strong position and the prosecutor compiled a strong report, which affected the political calculus in Belgrade.<\/p><p>  This example illustrates the role Ireland can play in the EU during its Presidency.  In our discussions with various people, we are aware that the role of the Presidency has been diminished since the implementation of the Lisbon treaty.  Leaving aside the Presidency, Ireland, as a member of the 27 member states, can exercise quite an amount of leverage which could be useful in the context of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  When I previously addressed the committee, Deputy Creighton, who is now Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, was a member.  She recently stated that she recognises the fact that \"We cannot force change and reform ... but that we can incentivise it.\"  I would like to concentrate my remarks on that.<\/p><p>  Since I last came before the committee, things in Bosnia-Herzegovina have become worse rather than better.  It is on the same trajectory and for the same reasons.  The pull of Brussels has not been sufficient to compensate for the retreat of the international community from maintaining the Dayton guardrails that were established in order to maintain peace and security in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  In essence, the sense one gets from the European Union delegation on the ground, from Brussels and from most member states is that they are trying to prove the EU's transformative power to themselves rather than trying to get traction on the ground in respect of any particular goals of having Bosnia-Herzegovina propel itself into membership of the EU and NATO.<\/p><p>  The Dayton accords were built around the interests of the signatories.  No surprises there.  What they effectively cemented into power was a political-business-organised-crime nexus.  It is the same people who run the show across the board, not just in politics but also in the media, academia, business, you name it.  There is very little upward mobility in any of those sectors.  The democratic machinery does not work.  Effectively, it is an oligarchy that we pretend is a democracy.  Ms Hennessey just highlighted the point when she referred to the Sestorka, the six party leaders.  The European Union and others effectively recognise that fact by meeting with the political deal-makers rather than the constitutionally empowered actors who answer to the six party leaders.  That is part of the problem.  We are not fooling anybody but ourselves in this masquerade.  The citizens get it and the politicians get it.  Everybody is a rational actor in that system.  We in the international community are the ones with the learning disability in respect of this matter.  This is because we do not want to understand why things are the way they are.<\/p><p>  This is an unprecedented challenge for the European Union because in almost every other instance of enlargement that to which I refer has been enough.  Even in the case of Romania and Bulgaria, at least the political elites were obliged to fake meeting EU standards in order to get through the door.  They knew that once they were on the other side of that door they would become animals of a different kind and would be less susceptible to pressure.  The EU and its member states must ask why politicians in Bosnia-Herzegovina are not impelled by the same incentives.  The answer, as far as I am concerned, is that they have already obtained a better deal than any the EU can offer.  They can retain what they stole, continue to steal and remain unaccountable both politically and legally.  Nothing can trump that.<\/p><p>  We do not need new tools to deal with this matter.  Instead, the incentive structure within the system must be changed.  The biggest difference between when I first arrived in 2005 and now is the sense that the bottom could drop out.  While all the unfulfilled agendas from the war were still dominant in 2005 - or were at least still there politically - there was a sense that they could not be met within the lifetime of anyone who was acting politically at that point.  Now there is a sense that, because we have retreated and ceased to enforce the rules we are obligated to enforce under the Dayton accords, there could perhaps be an independent Republika Srpska and that we could get away with it.  There is also a sense that perhaps there could be a third entity or a Bosniak national state.  There are more than these three unfulfilled agendas but those involved are acting without restraint because we are not restraining them.  The idea that the European carrot is going to be enough to change this dynamic has proven false for more than six years.<\/p><p>  The most recent instalment in this process is a political deal between the ruling party in Republika Srpska and the ruling party in the federation, which is nominally social democratic in ethos.  Directly at issue in the context of this deal are the independence of the judiciary, the fiscal sustainability of the state and electoral engineering to stack the deck prior to the next elections.  All of this is happening in plain sight and the international community has been very remiss in confronting it.  This is because a political deal was done and it was stated that the two parties involved were talking to each other and that at least there might be progress.  We want to believe the latter rather than actually believing our eyes.  That is the fundamental problem.<\/p><p>  How can we turn matters around?  Quite simply, by closing the exits and making clear that it is a constitutional problem.  The constitutional order is the fundamental basis of all the issues involved.  As Ms Hennessey stated - I am sure Ms Memi&scaron;evi\u0107 will also comment on this - the incentives in the system are such that politicians are not democratically accountable even though they go through electoral cycles.  There is no transmission mechanism by which citizens can make their views known.  The EU should close the exits and ensure that unless standards are met for real, then those to whom I refer will not get EU taxpayers' money.  They have been in receipt of the latter and using it as a way to buy stability up to now.  The EU should extricate itself from the partnership dynamic which contemplates an assumption that the political leaders in Bosnia-Herzegovina are its partners.<\/p><p>  The potential constituency for European values - and the actual constituency thus far in respect of them - is at the civic rather than the political level.  The EU should put the squeeze on politicians by dealing with citizens and accepting their leadership in respect of a number of the issues involved - one of which is the census - on which politicians are not delivering.  Doing so will place the latter in a bad position in the context of Croatia's proposed membership and what this will mean for farmers in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  I will comment in more detail on this matter during our discussion with members.<\/p><p>  When he appeared before the committee in March, the EU's special representative, Ambassador Peter Sorensen, made a comment with which I could not agree more.  Ambassador Sorensen stated that the executive mandate of the international high representative and the Chapter 7 mandate of EUFOR should be maintained until a system which can function without them is put in place.  The ambassador got some stick for saying this from within the EU but he was right.  The so-called restrictive measures - these include freezing assets, introducing visa bans and halting EU funding - were agreed upon by the European Council.  At present, all the EU's special representative can do is to recommend to the Council that these measures be applied.  All that is needed is for one Greek-Cypriot communist to object and nothing will happen.  If the Council states that it is going to take the advice of the special representative and says \"Don't talk to us - talk to him\", that would be a real stick to use.  At present, however, it is completely useless as a tool.<\/p><p>  Irish politicians across the political spectrum have already demonstrated both an interest in and a principled engagement on these issues.  I encourage them to keep it up.  Ireland has already spoken up at COREPER in respect of the attacks on the judicial system, which has proved helpful.  I encourage Ireland to continue what it is doing and to use its vote - even beyond its Presidency - to drive the EU towards a principled, intellectually honest and creative approach whereby it can use its leverage in a way that will actually impel forward movement.  I think Ireland has the power to do this.  I thank members and look forward to the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012120400004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kurt Bassuener"},{"type":"speech","time":1354630800,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Bassuener.

This may sound counter-intuitive, especially judging from the experiences in central and eastern Europe in the 1990s but there is nothing typical regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina, so the dynamic of such relationships is not typical as well.  The dynamic relationship between the EU and the Bosnian political structures excludes the citizens and undermines the civic society development and efforts, as they are both perceived as unpredictable elements which can disturb the said relationship.  The dominant premise is, even in 2012 which I think is critical, to give priority to stabilisation over democratisation.  Needless to say, there will never be stability in Bosnia-Herzegovina nor in any other place for that matter, without the substantial democratisation of society.<\/p><p>  Over the years, and especially in the past seven years, the representatives of the European Union and many of its members states have developed a pathological relationship with Bosnian politicians.  Bosnian politicians have no interest in EU integration whatsoever, as my colleagues also pointed out in their presentations, and threaten and generate political crises.  In response the European Union enters into prolonged negotiations which end in meeting their demands, which I call basically handing out the candies.  The resulting deals fall far short of EU standards and norms.  <\/p><p>  To give but one brief example, in 2011, Milorad Dodik, President of Republika Srpska, threatened to call a referendum on the entire state judicial structure on the territory of that entity.  The prime objective was to undermine the authority of the state court, the state prosecutor and the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council.  At the time, it is very import to note, there was an ongoing investigation on Mr. Dodik, so there was a realistic possibility that he could be prosecuted in that court.  On 13 May 2011, the High Commissioner Catherine Ashton travelled to Banja Luka with the offer of a so-called 'structured dialogue' on justice reform between the European Union and Bosnia-Herzegovina in exchange for Dodik's calling off the referendum.  Such a referendum would probably never happen, which is important to keep in mind, since once that card was played, it would cease to be a useful tool of blackmail.  Ever since, the 'dialogue' has served as a mechanism for politicians in Bosnia-Herzegovina to exert political pressure on the judiciary and dismantle the results already achieved in justice reform, but with the European Union as an accomplice, unfortunately.<\/p><p>  The European Union is conditioned to respond in this way.  It concedes before politicians even threaten and blackmail.  The European Union is in the business of reading their minds and self-censoring.  However, EU representatives do not understand one crucial point, namely there is no bottom line to demands and threats by Bosnian politicians since they do not seek reasonable compromise under the given rules of the game; they really want to postpone integration into the European Union indefinitely.  Their actions are perfectly rational since the existing system provides them with unprecedented privileges and control.  I do not have to point out how detrimental such a relationship is to the mechanism of conditionality, which has proved over time to be the most significant tool in democratic and economic transformation of the society and its readiness to join the European Union.<\/p><p>  This dynamic is visible in many other processes and activities besides the 'structure dialogue'.  The notion that Bosnia-Herzegovina must have a &quot;co-ordination mechanism&quot; in order to reach state level consensus so that it can speak with one voice with the European Union is yet another political mechanism with the purpose of stalling the reform.  Not only does the European Union accept this canard, it has adopted it as its own.  The major question is what is there to talk, negotiate and reach consensus about while talking about adopting the <i>acquis communautaire<\/i>?  By choosing benchmarks such as police reform, implementing the outcome of the Sejdi&amp;#263;-Finci case, and so on, the European Union also adds to the tension of citizens who wait in suspense for yet another critical political agreement while all other necessary reforms are placed on hold.  Such benchmarks, are without exception, served yet again with calls for compromise - a signal that the game is on, a whistle marking the beginning of long holidays for politicians who will pretend for the next five years to negotiate.  The result will, as usual, fall significantly short of EU standards and norms, but the European Union will nevertheless greet the agreement with relief.<\/p><p>  In its obsession with stability, the EU representatives will extend inappropriate political support to politicians whose power is fading as citizens' disappointment grows.  This is why European Union Enlargement Commissioner &amp;#352;tefan F&uuml;le, while on an official visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina, made sure to visit Milorad Dodik, President of Republika Srpska first before any other state official in a restaurant in Lukavica near Sarajevo, despite the fact that his party lost the recent local elections.<\/p><p>  This example brings me to another important point.  &amp;#352;tefan<font color=\"#6A7C31\"> <\/font>F&uuml;le was on an official visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Would it not be appropriate if he publicly addressed citizens and their representatives in the Parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina instead of having talks in a restaurant behind closed doors?  Many political deals in Bosnia have been made in bars and restaurants with and among the heads of the parties.  This practice of circumventing the institutions and accepting political deals reached without going on record must stop.  I need not elaborate on the reasons.<\/p><p>  The recent political agreement between the social democratic SDP and SNSD, Alliance of Independent Social Democrats, which negatively affects numerous areas of reform, including the judiciary, elections, economy and finance, have also been reached behind closed doors.  What is known about the content of the agreement, that is what parties deem sufficient to publish, indicates that their intention is to undermine the existing reform achievements, assume more institutional and social control, put the state in debt and prepare the ground for influencing the results of the next election.  The fact that they want to push the agreement through the Parliament through urgent procedure just increases the suspicion among citizens that they are up to no good.  Nevertheless the response by international bodies and individual EU member states, with few notable exceptions, have been neutral to positive.<\/p><p>  At the same time, between 75% and 90% of citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina support EU membership.  One may rightly ask why this massive support never translated into change of political and social narrative towards the EU integration.  The answer is, unfortunately, simple.  Half of the citizens who support EU membership of Bosnia-Herzegovina make it a condition of their support with demands and ideas incompatible with membership.  The reason that citizens do not understand the process and therefore cannot rationally recognise their interest in the process is because politicians control the narrative of European Union integration.  They have no interest in having informed citizens and consequently having to take over responsibility for the reforms and be judged by citizens according to achieved results.  The EU institutions present in Bosnia-Herzegovina have not done much to develop communication directly with its citizens.<\/p><p>  Under the existing relationship between the EU and local politicians, authentic civic society organisations have been perceived as undesired disturbance in otherwise harmonious and stable relationship.  When the Initiative for Freedom of Declaration, founded by large group of organisations and individuals initiated the campaign for census questionnaire to change so to allow for freedom of expression in so-called identity questions, nationality, ethnicity, religion and language it met with resistance from both politicians and the EU representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Once the politicians reached agreement to hold a census, both the European Union and the local elites were bent on avoiding public scrutiny.  Anybody raising concerns could have potentially caused the postponement of the process.  Never mind that census undertaken &quot;under any circumstances&quot; would have far reaching consequences and created insurmountable obstacles to future reforms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012120400005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Tija Memi&scaron;evi\u0107","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354631400,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Memisevic and all our guests.  The messages we have heard strike a chord with us because they are ones we heard on our visit to the region in September.  We visited Slovenia and Croatia before arriving in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  We had the opportunity to talk to politicians in these two countries about their views on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  It was useful to speak to them beforehand because we were able to form a picture of the political situation in the region.  When we were in Bosnia-Herzegovina, we met many organisations and groups.  We met politicians from all sides and quizzed them in detail about their intentions with regard to European integration.  We had a number of useful meetings with other non-governmental organisations.  We met Ms Mary Anne Hennessy who kindly made time to meet us.  We also met the European Union High Representative, Valentin Inzco, and Fletcher Burton, the OSCE ambassador.  We were extremely impressed by all of them.  We have been in touch with Mr. Inzco subsequently.  We visited EUFOR forces in Camp Butmir where members of the Defence Forces are stationed and talked to them about the situation in the region.  The OSCE showed us the town of Mostar.  We went to Stari Most which featured during the terrible war.  It was a very useful trip which gave us a much greater understanding of the issues facing the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the difficulties associated with their potential membership of the European Union.<\/p><p>  The Irish Presidency will commence on 1 January 2013.  The role of the committee will be to head up COSAC, the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs, which comprises the 27 members states, as well as the accession and candidate countries.  A two-day plenary session will be held in June.  It will be attended by the 27 member states, Croatia, Iceland and some Balkan states.  I do not think Bosnia-Herzegovina will be represented at the meeting.  The committee is putting together proposals for the agenda for the meeting.  One session will be devoted to the issue of enlargement of the European Union and Mr. Inzco has agreed to speak at it.  He will speak from his perspective in Sarajevo to the 300 parliamentarians in attendance.  We have also invited Stefan Fule, the European Commissioner for enlargement.  The meeting will be held in public session and streamed live.  Assuming he agrees to attend, he will be subject to answering questions from the floor.  Our intention is to ensure the issue of enlargement is placed at the heart of the Irish Presidency.  Ireland has benefited tremendously from membership of the European Union and we want to see these benefits extended to other countries as it is essential for peace and stability in the Balkan region.  We hope the attendance of persons of the calibre of Mr. Inzco and Mr. Fule at the meeting will help to deepen the understanding of the issues surrounding the potential accession of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  I now invite members to ask questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012120400006#E00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1354631400,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates and thank them for their presentations which are among the most interesting I have heard this year.  They were provocative and challenging.  I was delighted to hear Mr. Bassuener acknowledge the role of this committee with regard to developments in Serbia.  I recall the half dozen meetings of the committee on the topic.  We were addressed by people who are now welcome and established members of Irish society.  They spoke about why they had fled the region.  I recall representatives from Serbia who visited Ireland, including the Deputy Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister.  I recall with great pride the principled stance taken by all members of the committee which I am pleased to hear was a contributory factor in what happened.  It showed what could be achieved by parliamentary committees when they pursued an interest in a matter.<\/p><p>  I did not have an opportunity to visit the region in September because I was returning from another engagement.  However, I hope to visit it in the future as I have had a great interest in this topic in my five years as a member of the committee.<\/p><p>  I refer to the challenging notion in the presentations that we should deal with the people of the region instead of with the elected representatives.  I want to hear how this would work.  The engagement of western Europe with eastern and central Europe in the late 1980s and into the 1990s was an attempt to force-fit models of a market economy and democracy into certain countries without considering the value of stability.  It could be argued that this was a mistake.  Cultural convergence and a commitment to the institutions should have been in place first.  The presentations have flipped this critique on its head by arguing that the European Union is placing too much value on stability and not enough on challenging it in order to achieve a result.  That result would be a sustainable society in which the rule of law would be respected and everyone would be protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012120400006#E00300","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354632000,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates.  I am struck by some of the statements.  Like Deputy Donohoe I thought they were talking about the previous Government at one stage.  There was a reference to inappropriate political support to politicians whose power is fading as citizens' disappointment grows.  There was a reference to deals being made in pubs and restaurants.  God forbid, if that were to happen in our country.  I agree with what Deputy Donohoe has said.  The delegates say there is no support but the difficulty is that whether the EU or civic society like the politicians, unfortunately those are the people who are elected.  It was stated that the six leaders made deals, broke deals and made new deals, and all the while the people's business was left mostly aside.  I do not know what can be done in this area.  By its nature, perhaps the European Union should meet representatives of civic society and mirror what the committee did when it was over where it met politicians, civic society and others.  I raised the issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, last week when we discussed enlargement in terms of Croatia.  If Croatia's application for EU membership goes ahead I am aware of the impact for Bosnia.  Mr. Kurt Bassuener gave figures for agriculture and said he would expand on them.  Perhaps he will do so.

We met politicians from Serbia and people from civic society who said that if Croatia's membership of the EU goes ahead, as appears to be the case - Serbia is down the line and Bosnia is further down the line, if it is even in the line - it will cause instability in the region through the loss of half its income because of various barriers.  At the same time there are difficulties in regard to bilateral disputes between Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia which revolve around borders, transit through Neum, access to Plo\u010de harbour and the number and location of veterinary crossings and the impact of EU accession.  That will have a huge impact on Bosnian society if Croatia's membership goes ahead.  I had a number of questions but they are not relevant given the statement the delegates have made today.  I can understand their frustration which could be mirrored in other countries, particularly at this time of austerity.  Civic society is losing faith in politicians.  The delegates also mention corruption within Bosnian society.  I did not realise the extent of it.  There is corruption in all society but the picture painted for us in respect of Bosnia is not of a viable state and certainly not a state one would want within the European Union.  Are the delegates saying there is a need for change in society?  Politicians from abroad cannot initiate that change as it has to come from within Bosnian society.  If people continue to vote for those who have created the problems in the past and will create them in the future, I feel helpless on the basis of their presentations today.  When replying perhaps they will expand on that area and if there is anything specific that we can do, particularly in regard to standards in agriculture, including not only dairy products but honey.  Maybe some flexibility can be shown in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012120400007#F00400","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speech","time":1354632000,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Crowe.

Bosnia-Herzegovina is not like any other state, certainly not like any state in the region.  It is living with a constitution that was imposed from the outside.  It is living with external institutions such as the High Representative that have inordinate power that calls into question the legal sovereignty of the state.  For me, the risk of a failed state is real and that raises the stakes.  The approach that works in other countries, which is rather superficial, is that one deals with elected representatives, parliamentarians, governments and tells them what clause they have to adopt and what institutions to set up.  They do that and then one can wait for the time it takes for this to filter down into the whole society.  In Bosnia that does not work and it will not work because the system does not foster it.  What I have been trying to say is that for Bosnia-Herzegovnia there is a need for a much deeper approach.  The six leaders at the top are not far enough below the surface to make something really change.  The constitution needs to change but there is also a need to deal with the institutions.  The six leaders are not the parliament or the government, they are party leaders.  They do not represent any kind of institution but they are the people making the decisions.  This is what I wanted to get across.  I want to deal with institutions and standards and with citizens.  The conditionality should address that type of deep change.  The risk of destabilisation by that approach is less than the risk of a failed state because of the system in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012120400007#F00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Ann Hennessey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354632600,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I would like to give Deputy Halligan an opportunity to contribute.

I tend to agree with Deputy Crowe that, at the end of the day, it will be left to the people to decide whether Bosnia pushes forward, stays where it is or goes backwards.  The education system is dramatically failing because of segregation on ethnic grounds.  The country does not have a hope if that continues.  Perhaps that could be a starting point.  If the children in school now, who will inevitably vote and have a say in the political system, continue to be discriminated against on ethnic grounds, there will not be a hope for the state, as there would not be for any state.  None of us is competent to give opinions on Bosnia's political and electoral systems, although I am well up on them because I have visited, but it will go nowhere with an education system that segregates on education grounds in this day and age.  Somehow, that has to be dealt with.  I have visited schools and all this will do is build up hatred for the entire political system.  Groups are being galvanised and they do not now how others think politically and otherwise.  Somebody has got to get a grip on the education system.

The Dayton Accords created a ruling elite that is the most stable political class in Europe and the most impervious to change because they have no interest in change.  They want to generate the next generation of voters.  This is an interest-based system and everybody is a rational actor in it, citizens and politicians included.  People know how bad it is and their level of distaste with the political elite is not the problem.  They know they are being lied to, robbed, divided against each other and intentionally scared but they are still scared.  One is fighting Maslow's pyramid.  The one thing external actors can do is take fear out of the equation, which they are legally obligated to do, by maintaining a safe and secure environment.  It should be made clear to everybody, politicians and citizens alike, that as long as the Dayton constitution is there, it will be enforced and Bosnia cannot join the club unless it changes because it is too screwed up and the EU has enough screwed up members as it is.  That is the reality but there is a false dichotomy between having hard power instruments and the EU.  Hard power instruments are a force multiplier and enabler for the EU's soft power; they are not antithetical to it.  It is a false theological debate that is often had in Brussels, which is unproductive.<\/p><p>  Corruption is usually referred to as if it is an opportunistic infection and if a state has the right laws and institutions, it can deal with it.  It is in the institutional DNA of the Dayton system.  It was designed to facilitate corruption.  That was the point.  It was not incidental; it was the reason.  It is the main course, not a side order.  Corruption cannot be dealt with until the constitutional order is dealt with.<\/p><p>  Deputy Crowe referred to agriculture.  This is a concrete example of the way the EU could operate.  I agree with Deputy Donohoe that the EU must deal with the elected politicians but it does not need to deal with them on their terms.  EU representatives should deal with them on their terms.  The Bosnian leaders at least profess to want to join the club even though they do not mean it and that gives EU representatives leverage over them rather than the other way round.  They should not dance to their tune.  Croatia became a candidate in 2005.  The Bosnians have seen this coming for seven years and they are this far behind because they were able to play the shell game and avoid responsibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012120400008#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kurt Bassuener","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354633200,"counter":258,"content":"<p>All of the European Union affairs committees will discuss the issue in Dublin in June.
