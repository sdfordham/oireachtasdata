For the 2015 survey, additional questions are being asked on the location of e-commerce sales and purchases; the location categories are Ireland, rest of EU, and rest of world. These questions will enable a location breakdown of e-commerce sales and purchases by businesses located in Ireland.

The employment supports consist of a range of measures such as the disability awareness training support scheme and the reasonable accommodation fund, which includes the workplace equipment\/adaptation grant, the personal reader grant, the job interview interpreter grant, and the employee retention grant.

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.

The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.<\/p>  <p>  In determining that social insurance for the self-employed should cover contingencies relating to ill health or incapacity, the Advisory Group was cognisant of the fact that some self-employed people could continue to obtain an income while suffering an illness whereas an employee, while experiencing a similar illness, might not.  Furthermore, given the control difficulties that might arise with a self-employed person self-certifying their non-participation in their business, the Group considered that it would not be appropriate to extend social insurance to the self-employed for  short-term illness income supports, such as Illness Benefit or Occupational Injuries Benefit.<\/p>  <p>  The Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long-term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.<\/p>  <p>  This recommendation will require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which indicated that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.<\/p>  <p>  My colleagues in Government and I will continue to reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue and will further consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300060#WRE01700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Applications","counter":154,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300060#WRE01750"},{"type":"question","counter":155,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[9237\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300060#WRE01800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a decision on an application for a disability allowance will be made, in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Roscommon; the reason for the delay in same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":156,"content":"<p>I confirm that an application from the person concerned for disability allowance (DA) was received by the Department on 10 October 2014.

As rental markets differ from county to county, this explains the variation in rent limits across the country and the maximum payments made to rent supplement recipients. Details of the maximum rent limits on a county basis from June 2013 to date are provided in the attached tabular statement.<\/p><p>The Department has recently undertaken a review of the maximum rent limits. The overarching concern is that raising rent limits may not be the solution as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and could impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers, their families and students alike. The raising of rent limits in Donegal has the potential to establish, in particular for families on low wage incomes, inappropriate pricing floors, with the possibility that these families are priced out of affordable accommodation in their area of choice. Analysis shows that there are properties available in the Donegal area within the current maximum rent limits.<\/p><p>In recognition of the current supply constraints in areas of high demand throughout the country, measures have been put in place to ensure that the housing needs of rent supplement customers who are at risk of homelessness are addressed by providing increased flexibility within the administration of the rent supplement scheme. Notices circulated to all Community Welfare Service staff reminding them of their discretionary power to award, on a case by case basis, a supplement for rental purposes in such circumstances in July and December 2014. A National Framework has also been developed to ensure that appropriate supports continue to be provided throughout the country in a consistent manner.<\/p><p>I would advise the Deputy that he should

The Committee has concluded its deliberations and has given me and the Governor of the Central Bank a copy of the report.  As noted in the report, the full implications of a mortgage insurance scheme can only be examined once the new Central Bank Macro Prudential regulations for residential mortgage lending are in place and the effects they have on mortgage lending can be examined.  As the Deputy is aware, the Central Bank also considered the issue of mortgage insurance in the context of the new macro prudential framework and it concluded that an exception for suitably insured mortgages was not an effective practical amendment at this time.<\/p>  <p>  An overriding primary public policy concern is to deliver an affordable and sustainable housing and credit market over the course of the economic cycle and the avoidance of boom and bust cycles which we have experienced in the recent past.  The new Central Bank macro prudential measures are intended to help achieve that objective.  Mortgage insurance could have a contributory role to play in the achievement of that objective at a future point.  However, as suggested by the Central Bank, it is likely to have such a role only if it effectively transfers risk away from the banking system and from the State in a cost effective way.  This is a matter, therefore, that will need to be kept under review by my Department and by the Central Bank.  However, due to the need to transfer risk I would not see the State playing a role in underwriting or guaranteeing the provision of mortgage indemnity insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300061#WRF01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":186,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300061#WRF01150"},{"type":"question","counter":187,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[8730\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300061#WRF01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Revenue Commissioners, as administrators of the pay related social insurance system on behalf of the Department of Social Protection, will provide the information requested, in Parliamentary Question Nos. 173 and 174, of 17 February 2015;

Revenue wrote to the French authorities enquiring as to whether the data obtained by them contained information relating to Irish residents, and whether the French authorities would consider disclosing any such information to Revenue. The French authorities responded positively to that request and made a disclosure to Revenue on 23 June 2010.<\/p>  <p>  The information received was evaluated carefully by Revenue and it was found, for a variety of reasons, that there was no basis for pursuing an investigation in many of the cases. These reasons included non-Irish addresses on certain of the accounts, persons associated with accounts not being resident or domiciled in the State, Revenue establishing that, by reason of prior disclosure, there was no liability, and, in the case of the corporate entities, that they were Irish-registered but non-resident for taxation purposes. The vast majority of the funds linked to Ireland in the HSBC data are related to the Funds industry. More than 98% of the total related to the Global Funds sector.<\/p>  <p>  Following the evaluation of the information, Revenue initiated thirty three investigations. In eight of the investigations it was determined that there were no additional tax liabilities. Nineteen investigations resulted in settlement payments of &euro;4,559,371. In addition, a further amount of &euro;172,442 has been received, as payment on account, in relation to two appeals against tax assessments entered following investigations into the account holders. Six investigations are ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to pursuing taxes owed, the Revenue Commissioners have also sought to have criminal proceedings brought in any cases where the information provided by the French authorities, and their own subsequent investigations, suggested that there was sufficient evidence to prosecute in respect of identified tax offences. Three convictions have been secured, resulting in the imposition of fines ranging from &euro;4,000 to &euro;25,000, and a further case remains under investigation. On the question of possible further prosecutions, it is not open to the Revenue Commissioners to comment on whether any individual or corporate entity is under investigation with a view to prosecution.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware, however, that it is a long-standing convention that the Minister for Finance does not intervene in matters involving Revenue and individual taxpayers.

My initial view is that the provision of a\u00a0tax reduction to such\u00a0individuals could have the potential to distort the labour market.

However, the Deputy will be aware of the\u00a0tax package included in Budget 2015,which reduced the marginal rate of income tax for those on low and middle incomes, who are subject to the top rate of income tax.

The application was approved on the basis that it met the criteria for the minor works scheme and was cost beneficial. The purpose of this administrative Scheme is to provide funding to local authorities to enable them to carry out small scale works to address localised flooding problems in their areas. Funding of up to 90% of the estimated cost of the works is available subject to specific eligibility criteria including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial. The scheme's criteria are published on the OPW website, <i>www.opw.ie<\/i>.  The scheme is not available for repair of damaged infrastructure or for maintenance of existing flood defence or coastal protection assets. A local authority may apply to the OPW for support under the scheme having regard to those eligibility criteria.

A complementary report on the skills needs for the sector, which I had commissioned at the same time, was published by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs and Forf&aacute;s, and it identified a series of actions to enhance skills in the sector.<\/p><p>Arising from the Manufacturing Strategy and the Skills Report, there are now a range of initiatives in hand by relevant Agencies to drive the 2016 target, with key actions from both reports having been incorporated into the <i>Action Plans for Jobs <\/i>(APJ)<i><\/i>for 2013,  2014 and 2015. <i><\/i>Developing manufacturing was adopted as a Disruptive Reform  in the APJ and one of the key actions is the delivery of a National Step Change initiative to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s manufacturing base across all firms engaged in manufacturing i.e. small and medium-sized firms and larger multi-nationals, particularly in higher-value sub sectors such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and food.  In addition, a wide range of training and educational initiatives are underway by the relevant providers, such as <i>Skillnets.<\/i>Other actions include encouraging entrepreneurship, supporting start\u2010up activity, further improving our skills base, assisting our businesses to grow, improving access to finance by SMEs and developing and deepening opportunities from global investment. <\/p><p>The Strategy does not identify specific locations around the country for the expansion of the sector.  However, a particularly attractive feature of manufacturing in Ireland is the fact that many of the present jobs are not in the main urban areas, but dispersed into regional locations, thereby providing a valuable employment focus in areas where alternative jobs are scarce. The further development of the sector will, of course, build on this key feature.  However it would be a mistake to concentrate on a specific sector to drive job creation in a particular county.  IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Office (LEO) work with companies in all sectors and Longford can benefit from the supports offered by those bodies.  <\/p><p>I am very conscious of the difficulty in attracting new industry to the regional centres. For this reason I have initiated the development of new Regional Strategies, to be rolled out this year, starting with the Midlands region.  I am hopeful that this new approach will help to reinvigorate the industrial base of areas which are away from the main urban centres. <\/p><p>The Government is committed to strong job creation in all regions of the country. This policy is already working &ndash; for example the Midlands Region, which includes County Longford, has seen its unemployment rate reduced from 19.5%  in Quarter 3 2011, shortly after this Government took office, to 13.1% at the end of last year, with 12,000 additional jobs in place there. Employment in Enterprise Ireland supported companies in Longford is up 17% since this Government has come in to office and I anticipate that the Regional Strategy will seek to build on that progress. While the current unemployment rate is still unacceptably high, the numbers on the Live Register have fallen by 18% since this Government came into office. It illustrates the significant progress which the Government has achieved and I am confident that the trend will continue downwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300065#WRK00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IDA Site Visits","counter":362,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300065#WRK00750"},{"type":"question","counter":363,"qnumday":246,"qnumall":"[8862\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300065#WRK00800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of Industrial Development Agency sponsored visits that took place in Ballinasloe, County Galway, between 2011 and 2014; the number of agency supported companies in Ballinasloe between 2011 and 2014; the agency&rsquo;s plans to encourage job creation in Ballinasloe; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This programme will build on the recent investment by the Agency in a number of advance manufacturing facilities in regional locations.

The CLRG concluded that no change should be made to the level of late filing penalties but it did make a recommendation that where a company seeks a waiver from the payment of late filing fees, the grant of that should not be within the powers of the Companies Registration Office (CRO), but rather should be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, preferably the District Court.

In particular, Enterprise Ireland (EI) and InterTradeIreland, which come under the remit of my Department, are delivering a number of APJ actions, which will build on their work to date in increasing SME awareness of public procurement opportunities. EI will provide support to Irish companies seeking to participate in procurement overseas through engagements for SMEs with International Financial Institutions. IntertradeIreland will continue to grow the capacity and capability of Irish enterprises to successfully tender for public procurement contracts, through the continued delivery of &ldquo;Go-2-Tender&rdquo;, &ldquo;Advanced Go-2-Tender&rdquo; and consortia building initiatives and &ldquo;Meet the Buyer&rdquo; events, run in conjunction with the OGP, as outlined below.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, EI and IntertradeIreland will also examine ways of improving the supply of innovative products and services, where appropriate, in public procurement including assessing innovation practices in public procurement in other countries with a view to establishing potential learnings for Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Under the APJ process, the OGP has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service. This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'Meet the Buyer' events hosted nationwide. These 'Meet the Buyer' events are run in conjunction with EI and InterTrade-Ireland. To date the OGP has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 4,500 SMEs nationwide.  These events afforded suppliers an opportunity to meet and discuss the issues with public service buyers and provide networking opportunities for suppliers and encourage consortia-building.<\/p>  <p>  The OGP also reviewed and updated its guidelines and procedures aimed at promoting SME participation in public procurement.  Circular 10\/14, launched on 17 April 2014, sets out new initiatives aimed at opening up opportunities for small businesses to bid for State business.  These new guidelines are aimed at reducing the administrative burden on businesses that want to tender for public contracts.  The SME Working Group, established under the Government's Action Plan for Jobs, was consulted on the new Guidelines and the Circular and it has been broadly welcomed by industry representative associations.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to remember that open tendering is a two way street and that it provides Irish companies with opportunities to compete abroad. The public procurement market in the EU is estimated to be valued in excess of &euro;2.4 trillion.  The open market regime offers opportunities for Irish companies to win business abroad and reliable EU studies indicate that many Irish businesses are successful in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The reform of public procurement across the public service is on-going and will continue to provide opportunities to the SME sector to win business.

In these instances, the PRA is an independent impartial adjudicator with no vested interest in the outcome. The PRA is neither a party nor a witness to the proceedings before it and it ought not, therefore, be a party or a witness in the hearing of any appeal from its decision. It is the function of the appellate court to review or re-examine the evidence presented at first instance and then to annul or confirm, with or without modification, decision or ruling of the PRA.

It commenced D&aacute;il Report Stage on 11 July 2014 which is to resume on 21 April.  It is my intention that the Bill be enacted so that the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority come into operation during the first half of 2015.  Legal Partnerships are one of those reforms which have been a key part of the Bill since its publication.<\/p>  <p>  As I have previously announced in my Press Statement of 9 December 2014, Legal Partnerships are among those matters in relation to which I will be bringing forward amendments for the resumption of D&aacute;il Report Stage.  As part of those amendments, the provisions of the Bill dealing with Legal Partnerships, that is to say partnerships between solicitors and\/or barristers in any combination, will now be set out separately.  It will be provided that public consultations on the operation and management of Legal Partnerships will be conducted within six months of the establishment of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority.  Legal Partnerships will then be introduced within six months of the completion of those public consultations.  Once introduced, operation of the new Legal Partnerships will be subject to five-yearly review. <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of Legal Partnerships will provide early alternatives in the way solicitors and\/or barristers can work together in responding to the needs of a modern legal services market. Both are regulated professions and have established status and rights of appearance before the Courts and both are eligible to apply for judicial appointment.  There is already an established, recognised and regulated system for switching between the professions of barrister and solicitor and this is something which now takes place on a regular basis.  Indeed, there is a now growing number of practitioners who have worked under the two professions.  The two legal professions already work closely with each other in the conduct of legal business and litigation.  They have common legal expertise and competence in areas such as arbitration and mediation. Some barristers already share premises and facilities, as solicitors do, and Legal Partnerships will enable both professions to avail of the economies that can so be achieved to the benefit of both lawyers and the consumers of their services. <\/p>  <p>  Both of the legal professions will be regulated by the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority and by the new conduct and disciplinary regime under which they will both be answerable ultimately to the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal.  Without going outside the two existing legal professions who already have established, regulated and in some cases, overlapping functions, there is a very substantial platform upon which, augmented by the public consultation process, we can modernise the legal services market through the early introduction of Legal Partnerships.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300070#WRP00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Investigations","counter":607,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300070#WRP00950"},{"type":"question","counter":608,"qnumday":327,"qnumall":"[9086\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300070#WRP01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 328 of 17 February 2015, if she has received a report on the matter from the Garda Commissioner; and if not, if she will provide a timeframe for receipt of same.

Tackling organised crime in all its guises is a key priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is clearly reflected in the Policing Plan for 2015  which sets policing commitments for the year ahead.<\/p>  <p>  There is a priority operational and strategic focus from the Garda authorities on organised crime in this jurisdiction, including in the Border area, with a particular focus on fuel and tobacco fraud.  The Garda&iacute; work very closely on an ongoing basis with their counterparts in Northern Ireland and Great Britain in combating the activities of organised crime gangs who seek to exploit the Border.<\/p>  <p>  The Revenue Authorities in both jurisdictions lead considerable, ongoing cross-border co-operation in tackling these illicit activities.  A key feature of efforts in this regard is the interagency nature of the operational co-operation which involves the two customs services and the two police services on the island, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the UK National Crime Agency.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad to inform the Deputy that there is already in place a Cross-Border Task Force on Fuel Laundering and Smuggling, which comprises representatives from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, HM Revenue and Customs, the UK&rsquo;s National Crime Agency and the Criminal Assets Bureau.  It has been instrumental in targeting groups involved in the laundering and distribution of illegal fuels, operating in both jurisdictions.  There is also a similar interagency group, the Cross-Border Tobacco Enforcement Group, which is in place to target the activities of gangs engaged in tobacco smuggling.<\/p>  <p>  Arising from the work of these joint Task Forces, a number of groups involved in the laundering and distribution of illegal fuels and\/or in the illegal trade in tobacco operating in both jurisdictions, have been identified and are specifically targeted for investigation by all law enforcement agencies concerned.  Successful actions continue to be taken against such groups involved in these activities. <\/p>  <p>  A measure of the close North-South co-operation in combating organised crime is the annual Cross Border Organised Crime Conference which is organised jointly by the Garda&iacute; and the PSNI and the two Justice Departments.

This high level of support has been maintained despite the difficult budgetary situation that prevailed in recent years. <\/p>  <p>  I wish to point out to the Deputy that, while the annual spend by my Department on childcare related programmes has been in the region of 0.2 per cent of GDP in recent years, there is expenditure by other Departments that relate to childcare provision.  The largest element of this would be expenditure by the Department of Education and Skills on Junior and Senior Infants within primary schools and on the Early Start programmes in disadvantaged schools.  When the full expenditure on preschool provision is taken into account, Ireland spends about 0.4% of GDP on childcare provision.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that accessibility, affordability and high quality childcare can play a critical role in achieving a number of Government priorities, including improving educational outcomes for children, reducing poverty and increasing parents' participation in the labour market.  <\/p>  <p>  I would like to be in a position to increase our investment in childcare-related programmes to be in line with the OECD average as resources allow. This will take time, as the benefits of growth generate the required resources.  However, I am determined that all such spending, whether existing or additional, will be based on good evidence and co-ordinated strategically, so that we achieve the best possible benefits for children. <\/p>  <p>  To this end, I have established an Inter-Departmental Group which will look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group as well as to consider the after-school needs of older school-going children.

In accordance with the Act, the assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants. There is no entitlement to a medical card for a person with a particular illness or medical condition and, therefore, in accordance with the legislation, it is not possible for the HSE to award a medical card. The HSE does not collate medical card data on this basis. <\/p>  <p>  However, the Government recognises that the health service needs to be responsive to the circumstances of people with significant medical needs.  In November 2014, the Minister for Health and I announced a series of measures to enhance the operation of the medical card scheme and make it more sensitive to people&rsquo;s needs, especially where serious illness is involved.  Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold. Where a person does not qualify for a medical card, they may be provided with a GP Visit Card, appropriate therapy or other community supports or drugs and appliances under the Long Term Illness scheme, where the qualification criteria are met.   <\/p>  <p>  Down&rsquo;s Syndrome is covered under the Long Term Illness Scheme for which entitlement applies, irrespective of means.

They must investigate all complaints promptly, and following investigation put in place any measures required for improvement.  Records of complaints made are required to be kept. These are available for inspection, thus enabling the HIQA inspector to determine whether the complaints system is sufficiently robust.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the investigation of individual complaints, HIQA's position is that it considers that, in line with principles of good governance, the investigation of such complaints should remain primarily a role for the service provider.  However, HIQA takes into account and uses all information received to inform and plan its regulatory activity, and information on individual cases can provide useful pointers in this context. HIQA&rsquo;s programme of both scheduled and unannounced inspections is intended to ensure that standards are maintained and where issues of non-compliance arise, that these are addressed and rectified.  If a nursing home is found not to be in compliance with the Regulations it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status.

It is not a decision of a school.<\/p>  <p>  Parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.  However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.<\/p>  <p>  Schools are not permitted to discriminate against an applicant for admission on any of the nine grounds set out in the Equal Status Act.<\/p>  <p>  The Equal Status Act provides that any primary or post primary school whose objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values may admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students.  The legislation also provides that such a school can also refuse to admit a student who is not of that religion but only where the school proves that this refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.<\/p>  <p>  Schools that comply with the requirements of the equality legislation do not therefore discriminate on religious grounds.  I do not accept the Deputy's references to illegal discrimination and therefore I consider that the issue of redress does not arise.<\/p>  <p>  The draft Education (Admission to Schools) Bill does not propose changes to the existing equality legislation.  However, the draft Bill will provide for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion.<\/p>  <p>  The draft Bill will also provide for schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of choice of school is separately being considered by my Department with a focus on providing for diversity when recognising new schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300078#WRX05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations Exemptions","counter":992,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300079#WRY00150"},{"type":"question","counter":993,"qnumday":467,"qnumall":"[8769\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300079#WRY00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the process for removing the waivers for those with dyslexia from the junior certificate to leaving certificate; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":994,"content":"<p>The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations. <\/p><p>The State Examinations Commission operates a scheme of Reasonable Accommodations in the Certificate examinations.

It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and guidance and counselling services, and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally. Schools also engage in a wide range of sport and cultural co-curricular activities which provide an important opportunity for students to experience success and personal growth.<\/p>  <p>  Wellbeing Guidelines for Post-Primary and more recently for Primary Schools have been produced by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive.  The guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of current research.  They provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people with mental health difficulties or who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour.  The guidelines have and are being provided to schools and are being promoted and supported by the staff of NEPS, TES and the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE, Health Promoting Schools Process.

These procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils.  All Boards of Management are required to adopt and implement an anti-bullying policy that fully complies with the requirements of the procedures.  A template anti-bullying policy which must be used by all schools for this purpose is included in the procedures.<\/p><p>  The procedures outline key principles of best practice for both preventing and tackling bullying and require all schools to commit to these principles in their anti-bullying policy.  In particular, they emphasise that a cornerstone in the prevention of bullying is a positive school culture.  In that regard, the procedures set out the need for schools to encourage and strengthen open dialogue between all school staff and pupils and to ensure that they provide appropriate opportunities for pupils to raise their concerns in an environment that is comfortable for the pupil.<\/p><p>  The procedures also recognise the importance of good supervision and monitoring systems to prevent bullying and facilitate early intervention.  The school's anti-bullying policy must explicitly confirm that appropriate supervision and monitoring policies and practices are in place to both prevent and deal with bullying behaviour.<\/p><p>  In relation to reporting bullying behaviour, the procedures make clear that a pupil or parent may bring a bullying concern to any teacher in the school and individual teachers must take appropriate measures regarding reports of bullying behaviour in accordance with the school's anti-bullying policy.  The procedures require that all reports, including anonymous reports of bullying must be investigated and dealt with and that it should be made clear to all pupils that when they report incidents of bullying they are not considered to be telling tales but are behaving responsibly.<\/p><p>  The procedures include specific requirements in relation to the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour amongst pupils.  There is a requirement in the procedures for the school Principal to report regularly to the Board of Management in relation to the overall number of bullying cases and provide confirmation that they are being dealt with in accordance with the anti-bullying procedures.<\/p><p>  The Board is also required, under the procedures, to undertake an annual review of the school's anti-bullying policy and its implementation by the school.  Written confirmation that the review has been completed must be made available to the Parents' Association and published on the school website.<\/p><p>  Arising from commitments made in the Action Plan on Bullying, my Department's Inspectorate is placing a stronger focus on the actions schools take to create a positive school culture and to prevent and tackle bullying.  For example, parent and student questionnaires issued as part of whole school evaluations, include, since January 2014, additional questions to get a clearer picture of how the school deals with bullying.  Furthermore, the Inspectorate's plan for 2015 provides for collaborative research to be conducted in a sample of primary and post-primary on how schools provide for pupils' wellbeing.  This will culminate in a research report which will highlight best practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300082#WRBB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Educational Psychological Service Remit","counter":1150,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300082#WRBB01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1151,"qnumday":520,"qnumall":"[9302\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300082#WRBB01900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the degree to which child psychiatric services have been called upon at primary and secondary level schools, annually, over the past six years; the extent to which the services are adequate to meet demand; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1152,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that my department has provided guidelines to post-primary, and more recently to primary schools, offering practical assistance and advice on the development of structures to promote positive mental health in schools and in assisting pupils with mental health difficulties.<\/p><p>  The guidelines advise that in the event of pupils presenting with mental health difficulties which are above and beyond the school's capacity and ability to support, school authorities should identify and access the referral pathways for the various primary and secondary healthcare services in their particular area.

Its role is to refer any allegations it receives to the appropriate authorities and to do so without making judgement on same.<\/p>  <p>  If the Deputy, or any other person, has a child protection concern regarding a school it should be reported to the Child and Family Agency. If any allegation is referred to my Department, it will be reported to the Child and Family Agency in accordance with the requirements of Children First. At the same time, my Department makes the allegation known to the school authority concerned as employer of the subject of an allegation.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to set out below the current arrangements for dealing with child protection concerns and also outline some improvements that are being made to the State's national child protection architecture. <\/p>  <p>  Procedures for schools on the implementation of Children First in the school setting were updated and published in September 2011. This was done following the revisions in July 2011 to the national Children First guidelines. The forthcoming Children First legislation will put aspects of this national guidance on a statutory footing. Under the updated procedures all schools must have a child protection policy that adheres to certain key principles of best practise in child protection and welfare.  The updated procedures also incorporate significant improvements to the previous school guidelines and are intended to better ensure consistent and uniform implementation of Children First across all schools. The improvements include a new template child protection policy, a requirement that all primary schools fully implement the Stay Safe programme and also put in place improved oversight arrangements at Board of Management level. <\/p>  <p>  The additional oversight arrangements involve the following:<\/p>  <p>  - Specific reporting requirements by the School Principal to the Board of Management.<\/p>  <p>  - Standardised format for an annual review by the Board of Management of the implementation of its child protection policy.<\/p>  <p>  - Standard method for schools to report annually to parents associations (or parents generally) in relation to their implementation of child protection procedures.<\/p>  <p>  - Confirmation of compliance with child protection procedures to be provided, if requested, to the School Patron and\/or the Department.<\/p>  <p>  Where child protection concerns relate to a school employee, the procedures provide, inter alia, that:<\/p>  <p>  - the employer shall maintain regular and close liaison with the HSE (now TUSLA) or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a decision on the position of the school employee shall be taken having due regard to the advice given to the employer by these authorities,<\/p>  <p>  - legal advice should always be sought  and,<\/p>  <p>  - the Board should also be aware of and comply with employment legislation and any other relevant employee relations policies such as agreed grievance and disciplinary procedures.<\/p>  <p>    In addition, any allegation of a child protection nature received by staff in my Department is dealt with in accordance with the Department's Procedures for responding to Child Protection Concerns brought to the attention of staff employed by the Department of Education and Skills. Under these procedures the Department does not make any judgment on the concerns brought to its attention and ensures that the details of the concern reported to the Department are passed on to the relevant investigatory authorities (the Child and Family Agency and\/or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na) and the relevant school authority is notified of same.<\/p>  <p>  Further improvements to the State's national child protection architecture are being put in place with the forthcoming statutory vetting arrangements.  The forthcoming statutory vetting arrangements will set out the requirements for vetting of new employees and for the retrospective vetting of existing employees. The statutory vetting arrangements include a check for relevant \"soft information\" which is an important new aspect of the vetting arrangements. \"Soft information\" is referred to as \"specified information\" in the National Vetting Bureau Act 2012 and is information other than criminal convictions held by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where such information leads to a bona-fide belief that a person poses a threat to children or vulnerable persons.<\/p>  <p>  The Teaching Council (Amendment) Bill 2015 will dovetail with the forthcoming statutory vetting arrangements by:<\/p>  <p> (a) Linking compliance with the statutory vetting arrangements with renewal of registration;<\/p>  <p> (b) Strengthening the Fitness to Teach provisions so as to provide an appropriate mechanism for assessing a teacher's fitness to remain on the register if a vetting disclosure received in respect of a teacher indicates any potential risk of harm to a child.<\/p>  <p>  This approach is based on the fact that removal of a teacher from the Teaching Council register is the best way of achieving child protection across all schools.<\/p>  <p>  It is intended that all registered teachers will be vetted under the statutory vetting arrangements as soon as possible after the legislation is commenced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300083#WRCC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":1181,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300083#WRCC00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1182,"qnumday":533,"qnumall":"[9384\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300083#WRCC00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 801 of 14 January 2015, when she will publish the report on the configuration and development of post-primary schools in Limerick city, Croom and Pallaskenry, County Limerick, for the period 2014 to 2024; the reason for the delay in the report's publication; when action will be taken on this report; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1183,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that the Report concerned, which I will make available on receipt, is currently being finalised.

The objective of the Regulations is to protect ground and surface waters, including drinking water sources, primarily through the management of livestock manures and other fertilisers.  Specified closed periods for the spreading of fertilisers, including slurry, are a key aspect of the Nitrates Regulations.  They are a requirement of the Nitrates Directive and are mandatory in every Member State.  The closed periods in Ireland were decided following extensive consultation and were discussed with farming bodies and the European Commission at the time.<\/p>  <p>  Good agricultural practice involves the application of fertilisers at a time when grass and other plants are growing actively in order to maximise the uptake of nutrients by crops and to minimise pollution to water.  The provisions of the Regulations are underpinned by scientific research and good agricultural practice. The most recent scientific studies carried out on a diverse range of farm and soil types as part of Teagasc&rsquo;s on-going Agricultural Catchments Programme has provided further evidence in support of the efficacy of the prohibited spreading periods in reducing nutrient losses to waters. In addition, the National Farm Survey has shown that prior to the introduction of the Nitrates Regulations less than 5% of slurry was applied during what is now termed the prohibited spreading period. This was due to farmers understanding the benefits of applying slurry during the growing season when it will be most efficiently used by grass and crops.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Nitrates Action Programme was extensively reviewed in 2013\u00a0by an expert group, jointly chaired by my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. This group discounted suggestions of flexibility with regard to the commencement of closed periods as the weight of scientific evidence identified Autumn\/early Winter spreading as most sensitive to nutrient loss.  The group also noted that the application of organic fertiliser at this time of the year represents an unacceptable risk to the environment as well as a loss of valuable fertiliser product as there is little or no take-up of nutrient during the dormant season.<\/p>  <p>  Arrangements for the next review of the Nitrates Action Programme will be outlined in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300085#WREE00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Private Residential Tenancies Board","counter":1271,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300085#WREE00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1272,"qnumday":567,"qnumall":"[9112\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300085#WREE00400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of individual landlords registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board; the number that own one property only, two to five properties and more than five properties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1273,"content":"<p>The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 regulates the tenant-landlord relationship in the private rented residential sector and the Act provides that landlords in the sector must apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) to register the tenancy of a dwelling within one month of the commencement of the tenancy.

Section 21 of the Act provides that Irish Water shall charge each customer for the provision of services provided by it in accordance with a water charges plan to be approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  Section 22(5) of the Act provides that a water charges plan may make provision for a charge in respect of the provision of a service connection (within the meaning of the Water Services Act 2007) to or in respect of a premises.  In its decision on Irish Water&rsquo;s Water Charges Plan, published in October 2014, the CER stated that, until it made a decision on Irish Water&rsquo;s new connection charges, Irish Water should continue to apply rates equivalent to those which were applied by the local authorities at 31 December 2013.<\/p>  <p>  The Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (otherwise known as the Aarhus Convention) lays down a set of basic rules to promote citizens&rsquo; involvement in environmental matters and improve enforcement of environmental law.  The CER is currently working with Irish Water to develop a high level work plan for the year ahead and this will include the new approach to connection charges.  This plan will be published in the coming weeks.  A more detailed work plan outlining the consultation schedule for connection charges will be published later this year.  The CER has informed my Department that it will consult widely with stakeholders when considering any submission from Irish Water, and that there will be many opportunities for interested parties to participate in the consultations on the new connection charging policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300085#WREE00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Building Regulations Amendments","counter":1278,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300085#WREE00850"},{"type":"question","counter":1279,"qnumday":570,"qnumall":"[8866\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300085#WREE00900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to amend the construction regulations for one-off houses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1280,"content":"<p>I refer to the reply given in the Topical Issues Debate on this matter on 25 February 2015 which sets out the up-to-date position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300085#WREE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1092"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Legal Costs","counter":1281,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300085#WREE01050"},{"type":"question","counter":1282,"qnumday":571,"qnumall":"[9193\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030300085#WREE01100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if his Department, or State bodies or agencies under the aegis of his Department, use solicitors' firms (details supplied); the amount paid to these solicitors, each year, from 2011 to 2014, by his Department or State bodies or agencies under the aegis of his Department; the date until which his Department or State bodies or agencies under the aegis of his Department are contracted to use these solicitors' firms; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1283,"content":"<p>Information sought in relation to amounts paid by my Department to the firms of solicitors in question is set out in the table.

Applications for residential development should delineate the area that would, in accordance with this document, potentially fall to be taken in charge on the site layout map. It is envisaged that, generally, certain core services will always be taken in charge (see section 2.1) and planning authorities must ensure that the design of the approved development will facilitate this by separating the areas\/facilities that will be taken in charge from those that will not. Sewers and water mains should not be located under landscaping or allocated parking area that will not be taken in charge.&rdquo;<\/i><\/p><p>Paragraph 3.5 of the Annex sets out appropriate planning conditions that should be attached to permissions for residential developments including conditions for -<\/p><p>- the giving of adequate financial security (section 34(4)(g)) and the length of time the security must remain in place;<\/p><p>- the facilitation of inspections by the planning authority;<\/p><p>- the phasing of the development, if appropriate (S.34(4)(h));<\/p><p>- the completion of the development in accordance with specified standards;<\/p><p>- the evidence to be produced by the developer to demonstrate that the residential development has been completed to the appropriate standards (see section 4.2) and the time period for the production of such evidence. <\/p><p>Paragraph 3.6 deals with inspection of construction and states - <\/p><p><i>&ldquo;Ensuring that residential developments are completed in accordance with the planning permission is an essential part of a comprehensive taking in charge policy. It is important that the construction of the development be regularly inspected by the planning authority to ensure satisfactory completion in accordance with the permission. It is also necessary for the planning authority to satisfy itself, when the developer has ceased construction or notified the planning authority that construction is complete, or after the planning permission has expired, that the development is properly completed in line with the planning permission and, where is not properly completed, to take early and effective enforcement action.&rdquo;<\/i><\/p><p>Circular Letter PD 1\/08 was incorporated into my Department&rsquo;s<i><\/i>Planning Guidelines on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas which were issued to planning authorities in February 2008.

Where a planning authority receives a written complaint regarding an unauthorised development, or otherwise becomes aware of unauthorised development (except in the case of trivial or minor development), it is required to issue a warning letter in relation to the unauthorised development concerned.  <\/p><p>In addition, planning authorities are statutorily obliged to carry out an investigation and expeditiously decide whether an enforcement notice should be issued or a court order should be sought, under section 160 of the 2000 Act.  Where a planning authority establishes, following an investigation, that unauthorised development (other than development that is of a trivial or minor nature) has been or is being carried out, and the person who has carried out the development has not proceeded to remedy the position, then the planning authority must issue an enforcement notice or seek a court order, unless there are compelling reasons for not doing so.  Furthermore, the planning authority&rsquo;s decision on whether to issue an enforcement notice must be entered on the planning register and, in cases where it is decided not to issue an enforcement notice, any complainant must be so informed.<\/p><p>Section 180 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 provides, in relation to estates which have been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority in accordance with the permission, that the planning authority must if requested to do so by the developer or by the majority of the owners of the houses involved, initiate the procedures for taking the estate in charge.<\/p><p>In relation to estates which have not been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority and enforcement proceedings have not been commenced within seven years of the expiration of the relevant permission, section 180 also provides that the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the majority of the owners, initiate the taking in charge procedures.<\/p><p>My Department is currently reviewing, in the context of the forthcoming Planning and Development (No. 2) Bill, the section 180 provisions relating to the taking in charge of housing estates with a view to<i><\/i>improving and streamlining the relevant procedures.
