He is sought by the ICC in relation to a number of charges, including charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.  These charges arise out of an investigation conducted by the ICC Prosecutor in relation to a protracted conflict that existed in Darfur since 1 July 2002.  The situation in Darfur, since 1 July 2002, was referred to the ICC by the UN Security Council in Resolution 1593 on 31 March 2005, using its authority under the Rome Statute establishing the International Criminal Court.<\/p>  <p>  Full co-operation with the ICC is a pre-requisite for its effective functioning.

Trade, tourism and investment in Ireland were promoted at 148 dedicated business events, attended by almost 18,000 Irish and international company representatives.  As part of the Tourism Ireland &ldquo;Global Greening&rdquo; campaign, 170 iconic buildings and landmarks around the world turned green for St. Patrick's Day &ndash; in many instances these greenings were achieved due to direct support from the Embassy network.<\/p><p><b>- Maximise Ireland's access to international markets: <\/b>My Department works through its Embassy network, and in cooperation with State agencies and the relevant Departments, to facilitate access to markets for Irish companies, including through organising introductions for business leaders, resolving market access barriers or advocating for better access to international markets for Irish products and services.  For example, my Department worked closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine towards the reopening of the US and Chinese markets to Irish beef. <\/p><p><b>- Maximise the impact of integrated trade missions: <\/b>My Department's Embassy network continues to support Enterprise Ireland's programme of Ministerial-led international trade missions and works closely with Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Bord Bia and other State agencies to promote Ireland, Irish companies and Irish products overseas.  Ministers attached to my Department have led nine trade missions or trade events in the last 18 months.  In the past two months, for example, I led a major trade mission to South Africa and Minister of State Sherlock made trade-focused visits to the UK, France and Estonia. <\/p><p><b>- Maximise opportunities presented by Joint Economic Commissions: <\/b>My Department<b><\/b>manages Joint Economic Commissions (JECs) with four countries, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and China.  JECs offer significant opportunities to discuss greater access to international markets for Irish products and services and provide a forum for the resolution of existing market-access barriers.  JECs were held with Russia and the Republic of Korea in 2014, and it is intended to hold a JEC with China before the end of the year.<\/p><p><b>- Support overseas networks and maximise engagement with the Diaspora: <\/b>My Department<b><\/b>regularly engages with Irish people overseas in order to ensure that we are leveraging the potential of our diverse and influential Diaspora.  An important element of that engagement is the Global Irish Network, a network of 300 of the most influential Irish and Irish-connected people abroad who provide Ireland with valuable international expertise.

Through our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the U.S., we continue to work closely with high level Government contacts and with many other individuals and groups across Irish America and beyond.  The aim of these contacts is to achieve relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the US and to improve channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.<\/p>  <p>  While measures announced last November by President Obama, which could benefit thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants based in the US, were welcome I am conscious that they remain under legal challenge in US Federal Courts and that in any case legislation in Congress is still needed to build on what has been achieved in President Obama's announcement.  We continue to express our desire to see a political way forward on this issue which would encourage progress on a comprehensive legislative package by Congress.  For that reason the government and our Embassy have been working, and will continue to work, with the Administration and with Republican and Democratic political leaders in the area of immigration reform. <\/p>  <p>  The objective of achieving an E3 visa agreement between Ireland and the United States  remains a key element of Ireland's overall position on U.S. immigration reform and one which we regularly emphasise both in contacts with US interlocutors at Ministerial level and through the  immigration reform activities of our Embassy in Washington, DC.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this month I had the opportunity to meet with John Boehner, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and a number of his Congressional colleagues, when they visited Dublin.  The Taoiseach also met with him and we both took the opportunity to re-emphasise our wish to see comprehensive legislative reform so as to provide relief for the undocumented Irish and a legal pathway to allow for future Irish immigration to the US.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has also repeatedly raised the issue of immigration reform during other high level visits with US officials. During the Taoiseach's visit to Washington for St. Patrick's Day, he met with President Obama, Vice President Biden as well as other senior US Administration figures and key Congressional contacts from both sides of the aisle.  These meetings provided an important opportunity to reiterate our concerns and aspirations in regard to immigration reform.  I also raised these issues, including the possibility of immigration reform legislation, when I met with Vice President Biden in Boston on 30 March.  I have also discussed these matters on a number of occasions recently with US Ambassador O'Malley.<\/p>  <p>  The Government as a whole, including my Department in Dublin and our Embassy in Washington, will continue to actively follow up on all of the issues raised in recent contacts with the US Administration, with Congress, in particular with the Republican leadership, and with the US Embassy in Ireland.

Of course, work has been underway for some time to ensure we best understand the various issues at stake and to examine the potential implications for Ireland of a possible British exit from the Union.  However the focus of our work remains helping to keep the UK in the EU, rather than mitigating the effects of UK withdrawal.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Greece, the Taoiseach has made it clear that we understand and sympathise with the difficult situation in which the Greek people find themselves.  We want to find a way forward that takes account of the realities of the situation and the political priorities of the Greek Government, while also respecting existing commitments.  Our focus remains very much on finding a broadly acceptable and sustainable solution that is in the interests of Greece, the Euro area and the European Union as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  These issues and the financial and economic crisis from which Europe is emerging have naturally impacted on the confidence of citizens across the EU.

It will address the challenges, and the suffering, posed by the unprecedented number of humanitarian crises across the world.  The Irish Summit involved the public and private sectors, civil society and diaspora and academic communities in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  At the Summit, I underlined the Government's strong commitment to providing humanitarian aid that is neutral, independent, impartial and based on need.  The outcomes of the Summit and the emerging recommendations from the ten-month consultations which preceded it will inform Ireland's engagement in the UN World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key challenges is how to meet the needs of those living in and displaced by conflict.  Nearly 60 million people are now displaced around the world, the highest number since World War II.  Displacement caused by protracted conflict has a devastating impact on families who have had to flee their homes and communities.  The Irish Naval Service, through the work of the L.&Eacute;. Eithne has already made a huge contribution in rescuing thousands of migrants in the Mediterranean.  We must also, of course, address the root causes of displacement.  Ireland has strongly engaged in the EU to promote a political resolution to ongoing conflicts across the world.  Through the Irish Aid programme, we are making a significant contribution to addressing the root causes of displacement in countries of origin, notably through our humanitarian and development assistance in the Middle East, the Horn of Africa and other regions of Africa.  <\/p>  <p>  The demands on humanitarian funding have grown steeply in the past three years.  While donor funding has increased, there are substantial gaps in the funding required.  I am proud to say that in 2014 Ireland was in the top ten of donors per capita, in our provision of humanitarian assistance.  A total of &euro;85 million in Irish Aid funding was allocated for humanitarian crises in 2014.  Through this funding, Ireland responded to emergencies in the Philippines, South Sudan, Syria, Central African Republic and to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.  In keeping with Ireland's policy commitment to protracted and underfunded crises, significant support was directed to crises in Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Chad, Somalia and Ethiopia.  In addition, eight airlifts transported 269 tonnes of essential supplies to affected populations and 32 highly-skilled members of Ireland's Rapid Response Corps were deployed to work as surge capacity with Ireland's UN Stand-by Partners in a number of emergency response operations.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government is strongly committed to Ireland's overseas aid programme, which funds our humanitarian assistance, and has managed to stabilise the ODA budget despite the very difficult economic circumstances facing the country in recent years.

The agreement provides a basis for regular discussion with Cuba on international and bilateral relations at a senior level, and is a welcome development in our relationship.<\/p><p>Officials of my Department are also in discussion with the Cuban side on a Memorandum of Cooperation between our two countries.  This will provide an important basis for cooperation across various areas of interest, including economic and cultural interaction and engagement in the areas of investment, scientific and research collaboration.<\/p><p>As regards bilateral trade in goods, this was valued at &euro;1.35 million in 2014, consolidating the increase of the previous year.  We hope that, as the process of economic reform proceeds, and as Cuba's relations with the US are normalised, it will be possible to develop our trade relationship further. <\/p><p>In the context of the European Union, I am pleased that negotiations are underway on an EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Co-operation Agreement.  This agreement, which the EU is seeking to conclude before the end of the year, will strengthen the EU-Cuba relationship and provide an improved framework for political dialogue, economic relations and cooperation in the period ahead.  The EU is Cuba's second most important trading partner, accounting for 20% of total Cuban trade.  The EU is also Cuba's biggest external investor and approximately one third of all tourists visiting the island every year come from countries of the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400064#WRB05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Israeli Settlements","counter":96,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400064#WRB05800"},{"type":"question","counter":97,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[28357\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400064#WRB05900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he is aware that at the beginning of May 2015, the Israeli High Court ruled that officials could carry out demolition orders on the entire village of Susiya in the southern West Bank; that, if these demolitions go ahead, over 250 persons will be evicted from the place in which they have lived since before the occupation of the West Bank in 1967; and if he will inform the Israeli Government of Ireland's opposition to its plans to demolish the entire village of Susiya.","asker":"1028","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":98,"content":"<p>Ireland has consistently condemned the dispossession and eviction of Palestinian people in order to clear land for Israeli settlements.

The apparent intention of the authorities is to force them off the land altogether and into the already crowded cities under Palestinian government administration, in order to clear the land for settlements and other purposes.

Against this background and in the context of the possible future ESM programme, they agreed to consider possible additional measures to ensure that gross financing needs remain at a sustainable level.  It was stressed that nominal haircuts on the debt cannot be undertaken.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout these negotiations, I have expressed Ireland's understanding and empathy with the difficult situation faced by the Greek people.  I have highlighted our willingness to negotiate a way forward and achieve a sustainable solution that takes account of the realities of the situation in Greece, while also respecting existing commitments.  I have stressed our determination to ensure that Greece can continue as a member of the euro area.  At the two Euro Summits I intervened along these lines, and participated in the Summit's negotiations on the texts of the Conclusions. <\/p>  <p>  The negotiations were undoubtedly difficult and Greece remains in a very challenging situation.  However, if the agreed measures are now taken forward swiftly, I believe that there is a basis for Greece, with the support of partners, to return to stability and growth within the euro area.  That is the objective towards which we have all worked and will continue to work.<\/p>  <p>  While ECB President Draghi participated in the Euro Summit meetings of 7 and 12\/13 July with a particular focus on financial stability and the situation of the Greek banks, there was no discussion on  the general role of the ECB, nor is this in question.  The ECB is, of course, independent in carrying out its mandate and tasks.    <\/p>  <p>  The issue of youth unemployment was not specifically discussed.  However, the importance of supporting growth and job creation in Greece, as part of an overall agreement, was fully recognised, and is reflected in particular in the final paragraph of yesterday's Euro Summit conclusions which deals with the funding of investment in Greece.<\/p>  <p>  I did not attend any bilateral meetings in the margins of the Euro Summit meeting on 7 July.  Neither have I had specific bilateral contacts with Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande or President Juncker since the Greek referendum.  However, I did, of course, meet and talk to these three leaders and my other euro area counterparts at the two Euro Summit meetings.<\/p>  <p>  On 10 July, I had a detailed meeting with Prime Minister Renzi in Rome.  During that meeting, we reviewed a range of issues on the EU agenda, including the situation in Greece, and discussed proposals to enhance our bilateral cooperation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400065#WRC02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Census of Population Data","counter":133,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400066#WRD00150"},{"type":"question","counter":134,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[28916\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400066#WRD00200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"with regard to next year's census, if he is satisfied that the question on the religion of each citizen ought not to be changed to a question on the practising of a religion, if any, given the growing disparity between stated religion and actual life practice; if the question on religion ought to be asked of each citizen above a certain age, for example 15 years, and should it be answered directly by that citizen, rather than by the head of household, hotel, or school manager, etc; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1053","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","counter":135,"content":"<p>The next census of population will take place on 24th April next year.

It has been common practice in advance of each census to conduct a public consultation on possible new questions and changes to existing questions, which are then considered by a specially convened Census Advisory Group in advance of testing in the field in the form of a pilot survey of some 12,000 dwellings. Unfortunately given the very tight budget circumstances in 2013 and 2014, with constraints on resources right across the public sector, it was not possible to pursue this route for census 2016. Accordingly the 2016 census is being run as a &lsquo;no-change&rsquo; census with the questions (including the religion question) on the 2016 questionnaire remaining unchanged from those used in the 2011 census, with the exception of the question on marital status.<\/p>  <p>  The format of the question on religion used in 2011, and being repeated in 2016, was agreed by the Census Advisory Group which was established to assist the CSO in developing the 2011 questionnaire.

The best route out of social welfare dependency and poverty is through paid employment.  Research shows that being at work reduces the at-risk-of-poverty rate of lone parents by three-quarters when compared to not being at work.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the recently implemented OFP scheme reforms is to maximise the opportunities for lone parents to enter into and increase employment by providing them with enhanced access to the wide range of education, training, and employment supports that make up the Department&rsquo;s Intreo services.  These supports include the recently introduced Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD), which provides a significant incentive for families with children to move into employment, as recently reported by the ESRI.<\/p>  <p>  At present, the level of employment among lone parents stands at 45%.  Although it is too early to anticipate what the levels of participation by lone parents in paid employment will be in the months and years ahead, access to the Department&rsquo;s Intreo services is imperative for transitioning lone parents in order to ensure that their prospects of securing employment and financial independence are further improved.<\/p>  <p>  Any reversal of the OFP scheme reforms would delay the critical interaction between lone parents and the Department&rsquo;s Intreo services and would potentially increase the barriers they face to entering employment in the future.  I therefore have no plans to reverse these reforms.  Instead, my priority is to ensure that we, as a society, arrive at a situation where lone parents can avail of the same opportunities to access employment, education, and training as everyone else in order to attain their full potential.<\/p>  <p>  However, I look forward to examining the various supports that are available to all families with children, including lone parent families, in the next Budget.  In particular, I will look at the scope for improvements in the child benefit payment as well as in other supports for families that are engaged in both full-time and part-time employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400069#WRG04000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Unemployment Measures","counter":306,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400069#WRG04100"},{"type":"question","counter":307,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[28622\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400069#WRG04200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of persons, by county, who are 24 years of age or younger and in receipt of a jobseeker's benefit or a jobseeker's allowance, with the numbers for each payment provided separately; the number, by county, who are not participating in any training, education or job activation scheme; the number of dedicated training placements she has made exclusively available to those who are 24 years of age or younger; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1188","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":308,"content":"<p>Table 1 shows the number of persons on the Live Register at the end of June, by county, who are 24 years of age or younger, classified by payment type.<\/p><p>The only available measure of young persons who are not in employment, education or training (NEET) is from the Eurostat Labour Force Survey (in Ireland the Quarterly National Household Survey, or QNHS).  Data from this sample survey are not available at the county level. The most recently published Eurostat data indicate that in 2014, on average, 15.2% of young people aged 15-24 years (or approximately 79,000 young people) were in this situation.<\/p><p>Table 2 sets out the number of training and other programme places set aside for young people in each of the years 2014 and 2015.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is through policies to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by unemployed jobseekers and, in accordance with the EU Council recommendation for a Youth Guarantee by young jobseekers under 25 in particular. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee plan.<\/p><p>As, under services such as Intreo, Youthreach, VTOS, PLC programmes, and JobBridge, Ireland already had many of the recommended component parts of a Youth Guarantee, the main plank in Ireland is to prioritise access to these existing supports for young people, who become unemployed, with the objective of ensuring that they have an opportunity for employment, further education or work experience within the recommended period of four months as per the EU council recommendation.<\/p><p>In this regard our first intervention is to provide case officer support to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs. Accordingly operating processes are being refined in each of our regions to prioritise the early engagement of young people through Intreo to ensure that all young people receive expert advice and have access to progression options. For those who do not find employment through the process just described, additional offers are provided for. Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.

FIS is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependants and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment.  There are in the region of 50,000 families in receipt of FIS, an increase of 70 per cent since 2011.  The average FIS payment per family is &euro;114 per week.<\/p>  <p>  To qualify for FIS, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight (or 19 hours per week).  The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is supported by them.  Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.<\/p>  <p>  Reforms to the one-parent family payment (OFP) which were implemented in a phased basis in July 2013, July 2014 and July 2015, have resulted in an increase in lone parents applying for FIS.  Approximately 1,600 new FIS applications have already been received from lone parents who were affected by the reforms on 2 July 2015.  This is evidence that lone parents whose entitlement to OFP ceased on foot of the age reforms have over the previous two years increased their working hours in order to claim FIS.  Where lone parents are working less than 38 hours per fortnight they may qualify for a jobseeker's payment including the jobseeker's transitional payment if their youngest child is under 14 years of age.<\/p>  <p>  The Labour Market Council has established a sub-Group to specifically examine the issue of how employers nationwide can assist transitioning OFP customers with increasing their hours of work in order to enable them to qualify for the FIS payment and, subsequently, for the newly introduced BTWFD dividend.  In addition in cases where affected lone parents lose financially as a result of the reforms and are having difficulty increasing their hours, my Department will work with them to offer every possible assistance.<\/p>  <p>  The previous experience of the OFP reform, together with the introduction of the BWFD and the initiative of the Labour Market Council, would indicate that lone parents will have both the incentive and the opportunity to increase their hours of work, and thus to become eligible for FIS, thereby greatly enhancing their income and living conditions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400071#WRJ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme Application Numbers","counter":356,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400071#WRJ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":357,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[28820\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400071#WRJ00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if an oral hearing in relation to a refusal of mortgage support to a person (details supplied) in County Kildare will be facilitated; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":358,"content":"<p>As outlined in previous replies to the Deputy, the most recent being PQ 19202-15, the documents required to enable a review remain outstanding.

Over 10,000 new tenancies have been processed since the start of the year, including new claims, change of address and churn within the scheme. This level of activity shows that significant numbers of people are being accommodated under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Department carried out a review of the maximum rent limits which found that increasing rent limits could potentially add to further rental inflation in an already distressed market, affecting not alone rent supplement recipients, but lower-income workers and students. Between rent supplement, the Rental Accommodation scheme and the new Housing Assistance Payment administered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the State accounts for a third of the private rented market and is, therefore, a very significant player in the sector. The Department&rsquo;s review of rent limits points out that the main cause of difficulty for persons renting and seeking to rent is the reduced availability of affordable private rented accommodation.  In this regard, the Government will deliver significantly increased supply of social and affordable housing through the Construction 2020 Strategy and the Social Housing Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  Rather than a blanket increase in rent limits at this time, the Department has implemented preventative measures to provide for flexibility in assessing customers&rsquo; accommodation needs through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework. Under this approach, the circumstances of tenants throughout the country, including those in the Meath area, are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents are being increased above prescribed limits (for both existing and new cases). The Department also works with Threshold&rsquo;s Tenancy Sustainment service in Dublin and Cork city where supply is most acute, with plans underway to extend this service to Galway city. This flexible approach has already assisted some 2,700 rent supplement households nationwide through increased rent payments.<\/p>  <p>  Where Departmental staff are notified of a threat of tenancy loss, the preventative measures are implemented as appropriate. The Department has also undertaken a communications campaign to encourage people at risk to avail of these measures. I am continuing to keep this matter under review to ensure that the appropriate supports continue to be provided in the light of valuable feedback received from various advocates working in the area of homelessness through engagement with Department officials and publications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400072#WRK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":402,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400072#WRK00450"},{"type":"question","counter":403,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[29018\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400072#WRK00500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she supports the work of a charity (details supplied); and if she will provide State funding to the charity; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1034","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":404,"content":"<p>Housing is the responsibility of the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.

The meetings focused on the mortgage market and specifically the comparatively high standard variable rates currently being charged by the banks.<\/p><p>I outlined my view, that Standard Variable Rates being charged in the Irish market are too high.\u00a0 There was agreement from all lenders that customers should have access to more competitive mortgage products as per my recommendation.<\/p><p>The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for SVR customers. The position of home owners who are in negative equity was also discussed and assurances were sought and received that these homeowners will be able to avail of options to reduce their monthly repayments. The main banks have since announced a range of new products offering customers lower monthly mortgage repayments.<\/p><p>In addition to the issue of rates I also outlined the need for greater competition in the market and the need for a more active and well-resourced campaign by the individual banks. This should focus on promoting awareness of their best offering and how easy it is for customers to take up new products and switch between different institutions if they wish to avail of better rates.<\/p><p>In relation to switching, I\u00a0understand that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is planning to provide more information to consumers to encourage switching. I expect that\u00a0if financial institutions are convinced that\u00a0there is a threat that\u00a0they will lose these customers, they will reduce the rates that they currently charge\u00a0existing customers. The CCPC website is a valuable source of information on the rates charged by various financial institutions.<\/p><p>The Government made a commitment in the Statement of Government priorities 2014 to 2016\u00a0to applying downward pressure on mortgage rates by increasing and supporting competition in the market and it will continue to work to fulfil that commitment.<\/p><p>A review of what progress has been made is now taking place. The main lenders have initiated new measures ranging from lower Standard Variable Rates to new loan to value products and fixed rate products. These new offerings could result in monthly savings for mortgage customers and I urge customers to see if there is an option available which would suit their circumstances and also save them money on their repayments. The Central Bank is also continuing to conduct research in this area following its earlier report. <\/p><p>As I have previously made clear, a follow up set of meetings with each of the six banks will take place in September in advance of the Budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400073#WRL01400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"R&aacute;ta&iacute; &Uacute;is Morg&aacute;iste","counter":469,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400073#WRL01450"},{"type":"question","counter":470,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[28455\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400073#WRL01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"c&eacute; na molta&iacute; a rinne s&eacute; do na bainc maidir le r&aacute;ta&iacute; &uacute;is na morg&aacute;ist&iacute;; an ndearna s&eacute; aon mholadh faoi leith chun go bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; r&aacute;ta&iacute; laghdaithe a thabhairt do dhaoine faoi leith a roghn&oacute;dh na bainc; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.

These included the portfolio's heavy concentration in provincial and secondary property markets and the limited evidence at the time of the sale of any prospect of a sustained recovery in those markets over the medium term.  The NAMA CEO specifically stated that the asset portfolio securing NAMA loans was very granular and had few major assets which might have been of interest to purchasers if NAMA\u00a0had decided to proceed to sell the assets on an asset-by-asset basis.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Taking these factors into account, I am advised that NAMA set a reserve minimum sales price which equated to the net present value of its projected cashflows from this portfolio over the medium-term, and only agreed to sell the portfolio when that minimum price was obtained.  The portfolio sold for what it was worth at the time.\u00a0<\/p><p>Though I\u00a0am not specifically\u00a0made aware of the detailed outcome of each sales process such as level of proceeds, gains or losses,\u00a0as was the case with Project Eagle,\u00a0I am realistic in recognising that NAMA will, in some instances, recognise\u00a0a\u00a0loss on the\u00a0sale of some of its\u00a0loans and assets. \u00a0<\/p><p>However, I would like to point out that losses\u00a0recognised on NAMA sales stem from poor underwriting at the time these loans were issued\u00a0and\u00a0from\u00a0the significant deterioration in property values securing these loans.  The decline in asset values prior to November 2009 was reflected in the purchase price at which NAMA acquired these loans from the banks at steep discounts to the amounts borrowed.  The further decline in asset values after November 2009 was reflected in NAMA's books through impairment provisions meaning\u00a0that the amount NAMA expected to recover from these loans\u00a0continued to fall with prices.  At the time of the portfolio sale a further impairment was recognised.I am informed that given the nature of the portfolio\u00a0there is no reason to believe that this impairment would not have been recognised by NAMA in subsequent\u00a0financial statements if it had not sold the portfolio.  The portfolio sold for what it was worth at the time.The NAMA Board believes it did achieve best value for the portfolio. <\/p><p>On the more general point, the Deputy will also note that NAMA is obliged to repay its senior debt.  That debt is guaranteed by the Irish Government and therefore is a contingent liability for Irish taxpayer.  During 2014 NAMA repaid &euro;9.1 billion of senior debt for which the proceeds of this portfolio made a significant contribution.  NAMA has to sell loans and assets to enable it to repay its debt and this requires the NAMA Board to make commercial decisions, based on the best available information, on the sale of loans and assets.<\/p><p>The Deputy will note that, to date, NAMA has redeemed &euro;19.35 billion of the &euro;30.2 billion it issued in senior debt.  The significant progress it has made in terms of senior debt redemption has been a major factor in prompting credit ratings agencies to upgrade Ireland s creditworthiness.  These upgrades have, in turn, contributed to significant reductions in Ireland's borrowing costs.  I agreed with the NAMA Board as part of my 2014 Section 227 review that NAMA would aim to repay 80 per cent of its senior debt by end 2016.<\/p><p>Profit or loss on loan sales is accounted for in NAMA's Annual Report and Financial Statements and Section 55 Quarterly Report and Accounts published by NAMA for the relevant period.

In the period to the end of 2013, this meant concentrating sales in Britain, particularly London, where commercial investment property yields had fallen in some cases below 3%.  Over that period, sales in Britain accounted for 73% of NAMA's total sales proceeds.<\/p>  <p>  In contrast, I am advised that NAMA's strategy in Ireland over that period was to limit asset disposals into the market, particularly in the period to end-2012 when prices were still trending downwards.  Reflecting this, in the period to end-2012, NAMA had disposed of less than &euro;1 billion or 5% of its Irish portfolio.  This\u00a0information is\u00a0set out in my Section 227 Review of NAMA, which was published in July 2014.<\/p>  <p>  NAMA advise me that the Agency's focus during that period was primarily on ensuring that debtor properties were efficiently managed, that rental and occupancy were optimised and that rental income was fully captured.  NAMA also sought to assist the Irish market's recovery by offering a limited number of assets for sale to test investor appetite and help bring about price discovery.  I am advised that\u00a0NAMA did so in a number of cases with the benefit of NAMA vendor financing.  The interest generated by those transactions\u00a0strongly pointed\u00a0towards a basis for\u00a0the market s ultimate recovery.  NAMA, however, waited until that recovery was fully underway before increasing the flow of assets to the Irish market.<\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0would argue\u00a0that this patient approach, which has been\u00a0supportive of market recovery, is not how an agency engaged in \"fire sales\" would behave.  Indeed, NAMA inform me that the Agency\u00a0strongly resisted attempts from opportunistic buyers looking to acquire Irish assets at what could be regarded as \"fire sale\" prices in 2010 and 2011, instead, as mentioned,\u00a0focusing on the sale of appropriately yielding\u00a0British assets\u00a0in order to fund its operations,\u00a0fund\u00a0its investments in Irish assets to enhance their longer-term value and\u00a0to retire\u00a0debt.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is my experience that those who suggest that NAMA sold assets prematurely tend to\u00a0draw attention to the same handful of transactions in 2011 and 2012.  Such critics ignore the fact that NAMA had to sell some assets in Ireland\u00a0to help generate some level of transactional activity and seed a recovery\u00a0in the Irish property market.  In addition, NAMA sold assets\u00a0in order\u00a0meet its end-2013 debt repayment target, a target which was monitored by the Troika.  NAMA has, since mid-2013, been able to sell substantially more assets at far more favourable pricing and, in turn, accelerate its senior debt repayments and progressively remove that contingent liability on Irish taxpayers - further enhancing our economy's recovery.<\/p>  <p>  The value of loans and assets as at end-2014 was, as per NAMA's Annual Report and Financial Statements for 2014, which is available on the Agency's website, &euro;13.44 billion.

If it is received as capital it will be taxed under the Capital Gains Tax rules. <\/p>  <p>  In last year's Finance Act, I included provisions allowing for a measure of tax relief to the many thousands of Irish shareholders with a small shareholding in Vodafone plc who inadvertently found themselves subject to an unintended liability to income tax, PRSI and USC rather than a nil capital gains tax liability arising from a return of value payment from that company.  I did this because the shareholding of very many of those individuals arose originally from their investment in Eircom plc and, as a result of which investment, they continue to carry capital losses.  I considered, given the particular background in that case, that to leave those shareholders with income tax and other liabilities on foot of a decision they inadvertently made or did not make at all would have been inequitable.  This particular background is not a feature of the Standard Life return of value case.<\/p>  <p>  The fact that notifications of the options made by some individuals in the Vodafone case last year were delayed in the post beyond the deadline date in that case or were otherwise not dealt with by the company as shareholders would have wished were not factors in my decision to provide the relief, the reason for which I have outlined above.<\/p>  <p>  I am not in a position to say who or what is responsible for the problem that has arisen for the Irish shareholders in Standard Life plc.

The NPRF was a supplementary investment fund intended to support the Exchequer when budgetary pressures increased as a result of mounting pension costs. <\/p><p>Section 18 of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 required the payment of a contribution equivalent to 1% of GNP from the Exchequer to the National Pensions Reserve Fund each year.  In the period from 2001 to 2009 cumulative contributions to the NPRF from the Exchequer in respect of 1% of GNP amounted to &euro;11.943 billion.  Under 2009 legislation, an additional &euro;1.416 billion was paid into the Fund in 2009 to help recapitalise AIB and BoI. In addition, &euro;993 million was received from university and certain non-commercial semi-state pension schemes in 2009 and a further &euro;1,079 million in 2010 under legislation which provided that the pension liabilities of those schemes will be met from the Exchequer.  These additional contributions were offset against future Exchequer contributions to the Fund, with the result that no contribution was required in 2011 and a partial contribution would have\u00a0been required in 2012.  However an amendment to the NPRF Act, which was inserted by the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010, empowered the Minister for Finance to suspend the payment of the annual contribution, in 2012 and 2013. D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approved the suspension of Exchequer contributions in 2012 and 2013 on 7 December 2012.<\/p><p>Following the commencement of the\u00a0relevant section of\u00a0the NTMA (Amendment) Act 2014 on 22 December 2014 the assets of the NPRF\u00a0became the assets of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF).  At the time of the transition to the ISIF (end 2014) the total value of the NPRF\u00a0including the Directed portfolio was &euro;22.2 billion.Regardless of opinions on whether or not a restoration\u00a0of the NPRF is valid\u00a0it must\u00a0be noted that under the provisions of the NPRF Act 2000 1% of GNP was payable from the Exchequer to the NPRF each year.

This support for\u00a0economic activity and employment puts the State in a better position to meet its pension's obligations in the longer-term.

To date over 8,000 property owners have used this facility to put their LPT affairs in order <\/p><p>The final strand of the programme involves monitoring the Register for properties that seem out of line with other comparable properties ('outliers'). To support this element of the programme, Revenue have developed a very sophisticated data analysis reporting tool that compares LPT Returns for properties within a geographic area. The system in effect allows Revenue staff to identify individual properties where the value returned is much lower than the average for its neighbours. LPT information available to Revenue is also linked to publicly available information such as 'Google Maps' and 'Google Instant Streetview', to further assist staff in profiling potentially non-compliant valuations. <\/p><p>As is the case with any tax liability, Revenue may contact the taxpayer for validation of the original valuation.

Choices available to individuals (after taking the tax-free retirement lump sum) include the option to purchase an annuity with the remaining funds, to receive the balance of the pension funds in cash (subject to marginal rate income tax, as appropriate), to invest in an Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) or an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF), once certain conditions are met.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  To deal first of all with the changes to access to AMRFs, I should explain by way of background, that under the flexible options at retirement arrangements, where an individual in a DC pension savings arrangement is under age 75 at the time of exercising the option and does not meet the guaranteed pension income requirement of &euro;12,700 per annum, that individual must place a maximum  set aside  amount of &euro;63,500 (or the remainder of the pension funds if less than &euro;63,500 after taking the retirement lump sum) in an AMRF or purchase an annuity with those funds.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Any amount of remaining pension funds in excess of &euro;63,500 can be invested in an ARF with access to those funds at the owner s discretion, subject to tax, at the marginal rate.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that an individual without the minimum guaranteed pension income for life has a pension  nest-egg  to provide for the latter years of his\/her retirement. Up to Finance Act 2014, the capital invested in an AMRF could not be accessed, except to purchase an annuity, until the AMRF owner reached age 75 (or meets the guaranteed pension income requirement before then) at which point the AMRF becomes an ARF with unrestricted access to the funds, subject to taxation. While the capital sum in an AMRF could not be accessed, as set out, any income, profits or gains accrued from the investment of the capital could, up to now, be withdrawn by the AMRF owner, subject to tax at the marginal rate.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I decided to change, from the 2015 tax year, the arrangements for AMRFs so as to allow AMRF owners voluntary, tax-liable access to a maximum of 4% of their AMRF assets each year up to the point at which the AMRF becomes an ARF. This change provides AMRF owners with access to a definitive and certain level of income from their AMRF rather than the uncertain level of income which access to the accrued income, profits and gains in the AMRF provided.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the previous access arrangements for AMRFs, the extent of any income, profit or gains would depend on the performance of the investment options taken and could, therefore, be highly volatile with the possibility of little or no gains accruing in certain years. In addition, the scale of the capital allowed for in an AMRF, at &euro;63,500, would not always permit for investment returns of any significant scale to be made using a prudent investment policy.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The change allowing access to a specified percentage of the capital in an AMRF is primarily aimed at those individuals whose AMRF constitutes a significant part of their retirement funds and who, while not wishing to purchase a pension annuity with those funds, may require access to a portion of these funds to provide a more certain form of supplementary pension income prior to reaching age 75. This facility also ensures that an individual will have some remaining funds in the AMRF at age 75 to provide for their remaining years, assuming the individual has not purchased a pension annuity in the meantime.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Individuals whose AMRF represents a less significant part of their retirement funds and whose circumstances would allow for greater investment risk and, therefore, potentially greater investment returns will be limited to the 4% level of asset draw down. However, this draw down will also be available to them for periods when their AMRF investments make losses or returns of less than 4% of the value of their AMRF assets and where, under the previous arrangement, they would not have been able to make a draw down or the draw down would have been of a lesser value than will now be permitted.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Finally, in this regard, it is open to the owner of an AMRF at any time to use some or all of the capital in an AMRF to purchase a pension annuity.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As to changes in legislation relating to AMRFs over the past 3 years, there have been a number of changes made in this period relating to the ARF option of which AMRFs form part.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Budget and Finance Act 2012 increased the annual imputed distribution applying to ARFs from 5% to 6% in respect of ARFs with asset values in excess of &euro;2 million while also extending the imputed distribution arrangements to vested Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (i.e. PRSAs where benefits have commenced.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Finance Act 2014 reduced the annual imputed distribution rate from 5% to 4% for ARF owners in the age group 60 to 70 years whose ARFs have assets of &euro;2 million or under. This change was introduced in order to reduce the risk that individuals in that age group might outlive the funds in their ARFs.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2013, I rescinded the Finance Act 2011 changes to the specified or guaranteed pension income requirement for ARF access which had increased that income requirement from &euro;12,700 to a variable limit based on 1.5 times the State Pension (Contributory) which amounted to &euro;18,000 per annum. At the same time, I also rescinded the Finance Act 2011 change which increased the maximum  set aside  amount required to be invested in an AMRF from &euro;63,500 of the remaining pension fund (after taking the permissible tax-free lump sum) to a variable amount equal to 10 times the annual State Pension (Contributory) rounded to the nearest &euro;100 which amounted to &euro;119,800 or the remainder of the pension fund if less than this increased amount.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I re-introduced the original specified income requirement and maximum AMRF set-aside amount on the grounds, among other reasons, that without an appropriate transition period the 2011 Finance Act changes would detrimentally affect the plans of many individuals preparing for retirement over the medium term. The intention at the time of Finance Act 2013 was that the 2011 changes would be re-introduced in 2016. This matter is being examined in the context of the preparations for Finance Bill 2015 taking account of developments since 2013 and the current situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400076#WRO04100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":618,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400076#WRO04200"},{"type":"question","counter":619,"qnumday":317,"qnumall":"[29197\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400076#WRO04300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the current average age of permanent staff employed within his Department and the agencies under his Department's remit; the way this varies from the end of 2008 and the end of 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":620,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that the current average age of permanent staff employed within my Department at end June 2015 was 43.6.

However,\u00a0the pension levels paid to former office holders are based on their salaries at the point of departure agreed and implemented\u00a0by previous Governments.\u00a0The Courts view pensions as vested property rights.\u00a0As Minister, I am required to work within the constitutional and statutory legal framework under which all Irish\u00a0Governments operate.<\/p>  <p>  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI)\u00a0Acts, including the FEMPI 2010 Act which imposed the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) on public servants in receipt of public service\u00a0pensions,\u00a0owe their constitutional legitimacy\u00a0to the presence of an overriding public interest, in this case the fiscal crisis, and\u00a0because they are very general in application, fair and proportionate.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for the reductions in pensions applicable to\u00a0former members and office holders of the Houses of the Oireachtas.\u00a0\u00a0The Deputy will be aware\u00a0that this Government in 2012 increased the PSPR applied to that amount of pension in excess\u00a0of &euro;100,000\u00a0from the 12% enacted by\u00a0the previous administration to 20%, and further increased it to 28% under the 2013 Act,\u00a0 for those who have retired before March 2012.

Upon the dissolution of the body corporate, such property becomes State property. The effect of Section 28 is that the Minister does not hold the assets of dissolved companies as beneficial owner. He holds them in trust. The title which the Minister acquires under this Section has been described as a defeasible title since, if the dissolved company is restored to the Register of Companies within twenty years of the date of its dissolution, its property is automatically restored to it.

This includes time spent by the FOI body determining whether it holds the information requested; locating the information or documents containing the information; retrieving such information or documents; extracting the information from files, documents, electronic or other information sources containing both it and other material not relevant to the request; and preparing a schedule specifying the records for consideration for release.\u00a0 There is of course an onus on requesters to ensure that their requests contain sufficient particulars in relation to the information sought to enable the records sought to be identified by the taking of reasonable steps.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My Department's attention has not been drawn to any specific problems\u00a0for FOI users relating to the\u00a0new reformed FOI fees regime.\u00a0 Indeed,\u00a0the change in fees has been received favourably by requesters.\u00a0\u00a0If the Deputy has been made aware of\u00a0problems in this area and if she provides me with details of same,\u00a0I will ask my officials to examine the matter and\u00a0I can advise the\u00a0Deputy of the outcome.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to use of exemptions under the Act to redact material, I provided a new section 11(3) in the Act which sets out that in performing functions under the Act, FOI bodies must have regard to the need to achieve greater openness in the activities of FOI bodies and to promote adherence by them to the principles of transparency in government and public affairs; and the need to strengthen the accountability and improve the quality of decision-making of FOI bodies.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  That said, each request is dealt with on a case-by-case basis and there are specific exemptions set out in the Act which each FOI body will assess to see if they are relevant or applicable.\u00a0 I have no role in reviewing the decisions made under the Act.\u00a0 As the Deputy will be aware, the Act provides the requester with recourse to appeal internally if he\/she is not satisfied with the initial decision.\u00a0 Once a decision on Internal Review has been received by the requester, he\/she may appeal to the Information Commissioner if he\/she is dissatisfied with that decision. <\/p>  <p>  As regards the provision of guidance, the FOI Central Policy Unit (CPU) in my Department has responsibility for formulating policy and issuing guidance in relation to FOI matters.\u00a0 The publication of the Code of Practice for FOI is a positive step in that it promotes best practice in the operation of FOI and seeks to bring about greater efficiency and consistency throughout public bodies in dealing with FOI requests.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The FOI CPU website has been redeveloped and is an important\u00a0resource for public bodies and the general public.  In addition to the provision of manuals on the processing of requests, the CPU has issued notices on a range of topics, including on the application of search, retrieval and copying charges.\u00a0 Such Notices also provide practical guidance on how to process requests and how the various exemptions should be interpreted and used by the decision maker.\u00a0 This information is all available on the FOI website.\u00a0 In addition, the CPU, in conjunction with the Office of Government Procurement, has also put in place a\u00a0single FOI Training Framework which provides a panel of trainers from which FOI bodies can procure quality-assured training in a consistent and cost-effective manner and which covers all aspects of processing requests.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Finally, work is almost completed on the development of a\u00a0model publication scheme for FOI which I propose to make this year.\u00a0 Publication Schemes will bring about more proactive publication of information by public bodies.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I believe that, taken together, the new FOI Act, the new fees regime, the publication schemes once in place and other transparency initiatives including the Open Data Initiative and other Open Government Partnership (OGP) actions currently being implemented, represent a fair and equitable balance between maximising the level of access to information for citizens while maintaining the ability of public bodies to deliver services, including FOI services, in an efficient and effective manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400078#WRQ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Lobbying Activities","counter":677,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400078#WRQ00650"},{"type":"question","counter":678,"qnumday":338,"qnumall":"[29112\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400078#WRQ00700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he is satisfied that there is a legal obligation under the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 for persons based outside of the jurisdiction, but engaged in lobbying activities on a relevant matter as defined under the Act, to register their activities and adhere to the Act; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1180","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":679,"content":"<p>The Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 sets out arrangements for bringing transparency to lobbying activities through a web-based register.<\/p><p>The Act\u00a0does apply\u00a0to lobbying activities which take place within the State even though the lobbyist is based abroad.

The Scheme of the proposed Bill deals with the rights of consumers and the obligations of traders in contracts for the supply of goods, digital content and services.  Under Irish law, the enforcement of contractual rights has been, and will remain, a matter primarily for the parties to the contract.  That is why it is important that the rights of consumers and the remedies available to them if those rights are breached are set out in a manner that is clear and comprehensible.  Though the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission cannot act directly on behalf of individual consumers in contractual disputes, it has an important public enforcement role in ensuring that traders do not apply contract terms which contravene the provisions of consumer legislation or engage in practices contrary to this legislation.  In the case of a contract for the supply of goods, such as for petrol or diesel, the Scheme provides that the consumer would, among other remedies, have a right within a period of 30 days after the supply of the goods to terminate a contract and receive a full refund of the price where goods are not in conformity with the specified quality and other requirements.  The statutory remedies provided for in the Scheme are expressly said to be without prejudice to the right of the consumer to pursue other remedies, in particular damages.  Under section 74 of the Consumer Protection Act 2007, a consumer aggrieved by a misleading or other practice prohibited by the Act has a separate right of action for damages, including exemplary damages, against a trader who commits or engages in a misleading or other prohibited practice.  Where a trader is convicted of an offence under the Act, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission may, on behalf of an aggrieved consumer, also apply to the court for a compensation order requiring the trader to pay the consumer an amount of money that the court considers appropriate in respect of any loss or damage to the consumer resulting from the offence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400078#WRQ02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":705,"qnumday":347,"qnumall":"[28333\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400078#WRQ02500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of prosecutions of fuel traders under the Consumer Protection Act 2007 for breaches of the Act in supplying contaminated fuel such as stretched petrol or laundered diesel, since the enactment of the Act; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The 10<sup>th<\/sup>round is being held this week (13 &ndash; 17 July) in Brussels.  The objective during these rounds is to make as much progress as possible in all areas of the negotiations.  During the last Round, work advanced in all three pillars of the negotiations: market access, regulatory cooperation and rules.  On market access, the discussions were technical, aimed at better understanding the respective tariff offers and issues around government procurement.  Regulatory issues took up a lot of the time, with a focus on both horizontal co-operation as well as the 9 specific sectors [cars, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, cosmetics, engineering, textiles, chemicals, pesticides, ICT].  The regulatory discussions are aimed at enhancing transatlantic trade by reinforcing regulatory co-operation in areas of shared interest and cutting out overlapping, unnecessary red-tape.  The discussions in the area of rules included sustainable development, and energy and raw materials.  Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) were also discussed in the last Round, specifically, how SMEs might benefit from a new free trade deal.  A Report released by the EU Commission on 20 April, which identifies perceived obstacles to trade for SMEs, will inform the EU approach in this area.  The definitive time-frame is difficult to predict but it is expected that there will be substantial progress in these negotiations in 2015.  According to assessments made by the EU Commission, a comprehensive free trade deal could over time boost EU GDP by 0.5% bringing significant economic gains as a whole for the EU.  This converts into 400,000 jobs across the EU. An independent study commissioned by my Department, carried out by Copenhagen Economics, estimates that these benefits in Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole. It suggests a boost to GDP of 1.1%, growth in Irish exports of almost 4%, increases in investment of 1.5%, and an increase in real wages of 1.5%. It estimates somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs. <\/p><p>It also suggests that Irish SMEs will be particular beneficiaries.  Many of these are part of European supply chains where their exports to the UK, Germany or elsewhere to the EU, feed into Europe&rsquo;s exports to the U.S.  Ireland&rsquo;s approach to negotiations will be informed by the analysis from Copenhagen Economics.

The Ecorys 2009 study addresses the technically and analytically complex task of calculating the impact of non-tariff barriers in transatlantic trade.  Non-tariff barriers include licences, standards, administrative rules or other measures that make it difficult or impossible for firms to sell into new markets.  The aim of the EU US free trade agreement is to break down as many non-tariff barriers as possible.  The Ecorys study presents a detailed qualitative and quantitative estimate of these NTBs using a multi-faceted methodology combining literature reviews, business surveys, econometric analyses, consultation with regulators businesses and sector experts.  This was also used by the European Commission&rsquo;s assessment of the likely benefits of a new free trade agreement between the EU and US which was conducted by the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR).<\/p>  <p>  The study commissioned by my Department on the impact of a new deal in Ireland was prepared by Copenhagen Economics who are independent and renowned external experts in this field.  The study is based on the best available techniques of economic modelling and uses the same model and methodology as the CEPR study, to facilitate direct comparison. <\/p>  <p>  The CEPR and Copenhagen Economics studies use a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to simulate the impact of TTIP.  These are standard tools for trade economists that create a computerised simulation of the world economy and model what happens when changes are introduced.<\/p>  <p>  The CGE model is state-of-the-art. It needs to make assumptions about the economy in order to work but these are as reasonable as possible to make it as close to the real world as possible.  For instance, it is able to account for the effects of economies of scale, different skill-levels of employees, imperfect competition between companies and many other features of the real world economy. <\/p>  <p>  Like any model, the CGE model has limitations.  The figures are an indication of the economic effects rather than precise predictions of exactly what will happen. But the model is not able to take all effects on productivity into account, for example, nor the positive effects on foreign investment by multinational firms, which is very significant for international trade in services in particular.  This suggests that the estimated benefits of an Agreement are conservative.<\/p>  <p>  Alternatives to the CGE approach may have their merits but none has yet proven to be sufficiently reliable for an ex-ante analysis of economy-wide effects of trade policy changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400079#WRR03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Enterprise Offices","counter":758,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400080#WRS00150"},{"type":"question","counter":759,"qnumday":367,"qnumall":"[29095\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400080#WRS00200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the steps that the Meath local enterprise office will take over the remaining months of 2015 to increase the number of net jobs that the office is helping to create in County Meath; if he will outline details of this plan in his response; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1076","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":760,"content":"<p>The Local Enterprise Office in Meath is the <i>First Stop Shop<\/i>for anyone seeking information and support on starting or growing a business.

This system is entirely based on European legislation and is designed to ensure a very high level of protection for humans and the environment.<\/p><p>As part of the product authorisation system under Regulation (EC) No 1107\/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 <b>concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market<\/b>, risk assessments are carried out to ensure that: <\/p><p>a) there are no harmful effects for spray operatives, workers, bystanders or consumers,<\/p><p>b) there are no unacceptable risks to non-target species (e.g. birds, fish, wild mammals, bees or other insects, earthworms and soil macro- and micro-organisms), <\/p><p>c) surface and ground waters are protected. <\/p><p>Consequently, only products that can be used safely, without any unacceptable risks to humans or the environment are authorised for use.<\/p><p>In addition, Directive 128\/2009\/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 <b>establishing a framework for Community action to achieve the sustainable use of pesticides, <\/b>aims to reduce the risks associated with pesticide use. This Directive enhances the high level of protection achieved through the product approval system and places obligations on users, advisors and distributors to be trained and requires equipment to be tested at regular intervals. The Directive also prohibits the aerial spraying of pesticides, requires a more restrictive approach to applying pesticides in certain vulnerable areas and makes the application of integrated pest management a legal requirement.<\/p><p>In addition it requires each Member State to derive and implement a National Action Plan to achieve a more sustainable use of pesticides.<\/p><p>A screening monitoring programme in 2005-2006 looked for Cypermethrin at targeted sites but did not result in any detections. My Department is not aware of any subsequent detections.<\/p><p>The licensing system, involves the evaluation of data and the assessment of risks, to ensure that there are no harmful effects for spray operators, workers, bystanders or consumers. In addition, risk assessments are also carried out to ensure that there are no unacceptable impacts on non-target species such as birds, fish, wild mammals, bees or other insects. Additionally, risk assessments are undertaken to ensure that surface and ground waters are protected to the highest level possible.<\/p><p>A plant protection product is not approved unless it has been proven that it can be used in a particular use scenario without undue risks to non-targets. Therefore, when used in a proper way (dipping and individual application, i.e. no indiscriminate broadcast application), it is not expected to result in widespread deleterious effects to non-target organisms. <\/p><p>The system I have just outlined is similar to that which exists in all EU Member States. During the assessment, each Member State, including Ireland, takes local conditions, such as climate and pest pressure, into account.<\/p><p>Cypermethrin is used to control the large pine weevil <i>Hylobius abietis<\/i>which can be a devastating pest in replanted conifer sites. It is predominantly used as a dipping treatment where plants are allowed to dry before being transplanted in the field. No effects on non-target organisms are envisaged using this method. It can also be applied to individual plants if infestation of <i>Hylobius spp.<\/i>recurs in year 2 by placing a nozzle on the top of the saplings growing point and administering a dose by pressing a trigger. There is no spray or overall application. Thus exposure of non-target organisms is minimised as much as is practicable.<\/p><p>Cypermethrin is included in the Environmental Protection Agency's Water Framework Directive groundwater quality monitoring programme as an operational monitoring parameter. My Department is not aware of any impact studies in Ireland into the effects of Cypermethrin on the woodland bio-diversity.<\/p><p>My Department has been involved in research for alternative control mechanisms and some certainly offer some promise. Currently, my Department is supporting a research project, called Multi-agent control options for pine weevil. The aim of the project, building on previous research, is to investigate the potential of entomopathogenic (insect-killing) fungi (EPF) alone and in combination with nematodes, for weevil population suppression.<\/p><p>In relation to Coillte&rsquo;s use of the pesticide, the company has advised me that Coillte has signed up to the Forest Stewardship Council&rsquo;s&reg; (FSC&reg;) forest\u00a0certification scheme, a voluntary international forest certification scheme since 2001 and that, under this forest certification scheme, cypermethrin is classed as &lsquo;highly hazardous&rsquo;\u00a0and\u00a0can only be used in FSC-certified woodlands under a derogation from FSC International. Coillte further advised that there is currently no effective treatment available to control this pest which can cause significant damage to young trees other than using cypermethrin. Coillte state that it currently\u00a0has specific controls to minimise use, consider non-pesticide management options and trials for practicable alternatives to the use of cypermethrin but added that, until a suitable alternative is available cypermethrin is the only option available to control large pine weevil.<\/p><p>The company also advised that the FSC&reg;\u00a0cypermethrin derogation is currently up for renewal\u00a0and that Coillte therefore has applied to FSC International for its continued use in Coillte&rsquo;s forests. Coillte added that a consultation process has just been completed with stakeholders on the derogation for continued use of cypermethrin.<\/p><p>Coillte advise me that it fulfils its legal obligations and ensures that both staff and contractors engaged in the manual application of cypermethrin are fully trained and certified and that all pesticides are applied according to Environmental &amp;amp; Health and Safety guidelines. In relation to the specific query about water testing, Coillte advise me that it is not obliged to conduct water testing for the impacts on the environment but, to address stakeholder concerns, it conducted a water testing exercise on one site resulting in no cypermethrin being detected in any of the samples taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400081#WRT00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dairy Equipment Scheme","counter":809,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400081#WRT00550"},{"type":"question","counter":810,"qnumday":383,"qnumall":"[28674\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400081#WRT00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in County Westmeath has not received a grant under the dairy equipment scheme, for which the person was approved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1062","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":811,"content":"<p>The person concerned is an applicant under the Dairy Equipment Scheme.

During this inspection, it became apparent that the servicing and repair of the aircraft would have involved a significantly higher level of investment than was anticipated.  Given the number of flying hours achieved and the age of the aircraft it was decided\u00a0that all work on the aircraft should cease, the servicing and repair of the aircraft would not be completed, the aircraft was to be withdrawn from operational service in the Air Corps and the aircraft would not be returned back to Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The aircraft, which was on the Irish military register, was not in a saleable position.  In order to put the aircraft in a saleable position by tender, public auction or otherwise would have required the demilitarisation of the aircraft, the transfer of the aircraft to the civil register and the re-registration of the aircraft which would have been reliant on the completion of a full aircraft inspection and the completion of significant repairs to the aircraft.  This would have required major expenditure by the Department of Defence with no certainty at that stage that a buyer for the aircraft would be found.   <\/p>  <p>  With the assistance of Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation and over a period of some months, the Department eventually concluded the sale of the aircraft on an \"as seen\" basis with a US based company, Journey Aviation based in Florida, USA in December 2014 for US $500,000.

The Deputy may wish to note that protection related legal costs are also incurred by the Chief State Solicitor's Office.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) estimates that the overall costs to the State for provision of services to protection applicants for the years 2009 to 2013 are as follows, &euro;185m, &euro;174m, &euro;153m, &euro;129m and &euro;91.4m respectively. Figures in relation to 2014 have not yet been finalised.  The reduction in costs is related to the numbers of persons in the system at any given time, particularly in relation to the numbers in the direct provision system which is the largest single expenditure item.  The question of costs of the Direct Provision system were examined in considerable detail in the 2010 Value for Money (VFM) Report which is available on the RIA website - www.ria.gov.ie.  The Report found that there are no cheaper alternatives to the Direct Provision system and that any other system which by necessity would entail payment of rent supplement, rent benefits and so forth would be twice the cost.  Moreover such a system would amount to a major pull factor which in turn would give rise to further costs which based on patterns would likely to be very significant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400084#WRW02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":978,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400084#WRW02850"},{"type":"question","counter":979,"qnumday":445,"qnumall":"[28417\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400084#WRW02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide an update on the case of a person (details supplied) in County Offaly; when the person can expect a decision on an application for a visa.","asker":"1101","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":980,"content":"<p>I am informed by officials in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that an application for a 'join family' visa from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in the Visa Office, Dublin on 7 April, 2015.

Currently, there are over 4,599 residents in 34 centres across the State under contract to RIA.  Details of all of these centres and the companies or persons RIA has contracted to provide accommodation services are published in RIA's Annual Reports available on its website - .<\/p><p>All centres are managed by private companies under contract to RIA.  Seven of the 34 centres are State owned &ndash; i.e. the land and buildings are owned by the State &ndash; while the remainder are owned or leased by private entities.  There is a difference in the rates as State-owned facilities are not obliged to pay for rent, maintenance and utilities.  None of the three centres which are the subject of this question is State owned.  The rate paid to commercially owned centres is an all-in price that includes: VAT, staffing; energy and other utility costs; housekeeping; catering; security; maintenance, capital maintenance; etc.  Rates also vary depending on the location of and the services available in each centre.<\/p><p>In fulfilling its general accommodation responsibilities, RIA does not own, lease or rent premises from commercial contractors.  Rather, it contracts in a comprehensive range of services and facilities, including accommodation, housekeeping and so on, for a fixed sum over the period of a contract.  The amounts paid reflect this all-in price.  Generally, it can be said that there are three variables in a standard contract between RIA and the service provider: the numbers to be accommodated in the centre i.e. its capacity; the length of the contract; and the per person per day rate paid i.e the <i>per diem<\/i>rate.  It is not possible to provide values for current contracts entered into by RIA.  Negotiations take place with a number of commercial entities on an ongoing basis and RIA endeavours to achieve the best value for money in respect of each contract.

The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, with penalties of up to life imprisonment for human trafficking, greatly strengthened the law in this area and this legislation was further bolstered in 2013 with new forms of exploitation, for forced begging and forced criminal activities, being provided for in new legislation.<\/p>  <p>  A dedicated Anti-Human Trafficking Unit was established in the Department of Justice and Equality with the purpose of ensuring that the State's response to human trafficking is coordinated and comprehensive.  A new National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Human Trafficking in Ireland was recently issued for consultation to civil society organisations active in this field.  This new Plan seeks to build on progress made to date in this area and address issues raised in independent international evaluations of Ireland&rsquo;s response to this important issue.  The new National Action Plan will outline both the Government&rsquo;s strategic approach to this issue as well as setting out a clear work programme for the relevant state authorities to collaborate with civil society and agencies in other jurisdictions in advancing the fight against trafficking and enhancing the protection of victims.<\/p>  <p>  This year, and for the past few years, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in its Annual Policing Plan, has identified trafficking in human beings as one of its priorities with an increased focus given to prevention and detection of human trafficking.  The Garda Commissioner has recently established the Child Protection and Human Exploitation Unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This unit includes Child Protection, Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit (DVSAIU) and the Human Trafficking Investigation and Coordination Unit.  A Detective Chief Superintendent has taken charge of this new unit.<\/p>  <p>  Specific detailed training is provided to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Over 900 have participated in the in-depth training course developed jointly by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).  The most recent course took place in late June 2015.  Since 2007, PSNI officers have attended this course and contributed greatly by sharing their experiences with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There are also a wide range of other training and awareness raising activities on-going and extensive consultation structures exist with up to 70 State Agencies, Non- Governmental Organisations and International Organisations.  <\/p>  <p>  The State provides a wide range of support services to victims of human trafficking, these include: accommodation, medical care and planning, psychological assistance, material assistance, legal aid and advice, vocational training and education. <\/p>  <p>  There is frequent contact between the Department&rsquo;s Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) and the Department of Justice Northern Ireland (DOJNI) to discuss issues of mutual concern in relation to human trafficking and to share experiences. AHTU and the DOJNI have a very close working relationship and work together on awareness raising activity where appropriate and possible.  For example, there have been two cross border forums on human trafficking involving representatives from a wide range of State, Non-Governmental and International Organisations from both sides of the border.  The first in October 2013 focussed on trafficking for sexual exploitation and looked at issues such as victim location and demand reduction measures.  The second event took place in January 2015.  This conference focused  on forced labour.  <\/p>  <p>  AHTU, in partnership with Ruhama, has been successful in obtaining EU funding for an all island project aimed at delivering activities that promote zero tolerance of human trafficking as a form of violence against women.  The Department of Justice Northern Ireland, Women's Aid Northern Ireland and the PSNI are also partners in this project.  Further information on the REACH project is available on www.reachproject.eu.<\/p>  <p>  The Organised Crime Task Force Sub Group on Human Trafficking and Illegal Immigration meets at Stormont on a quarterly basis.  The Detective Inspector of the Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-ordination Unit (HTICU)  is a member of this group.  The function of the Group is to monitor trends and facilitate the detection and prevention of human trafficking and illegal immigration, which has a cross-land border dimension.

As the Deputy will appreciate, the deployment of specific Garda resources in an area is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and her management team.<\/p><p>The Garda strategy for tackling crime in the city centre area is being pursued within the framework of the Dublin City Centre Policing Plan.  This involves a high-visibility uniformed presence on key thoroughfares, as well as the use of undercover Garda&iacute; as appropriate.  A range of dedicated policing operations and measures are also in place including  Operation Spire in the O'Connell Street area and Operation Pier<b><\/b>in the Pearse Street District, which includes Temple Bar.  The resumption of Garda recruitment and the deployment of the first group of newly attested Garda&iacute; are of course key components in providing visible policing in the city centre and elsewhere.  Since September last year 300 new recruits have entered the Garda College in Templemore and a further 250 additional Garda recruits will commence training during 2015.  The first set of new Gardai were assigned to stations throughout the country in May and I am advised that twenty of these were assigned to the Dublin Metropolitan Region, with five assigned to Pearse Street station. I understand that a further group of new recruits will attest as Gardai at the end of July 2015.  The increased resources which are now coming on stream will undoubtedly support enhanced policing and community safety in all areas, including Temple Bar and other areas of Dublin City Centre.<\/p><p>I am sure the Deputy will acknowledge that the incidence of crime in the city centre is often linked to the complex issues which contribute to drug addiction and related behaviours, and that these must be addressed in a coordinated and cross-cutting manner.  In response to the particular issues arising in Dublin City Centre a  multi-agency street outreach approach is being used to work with vulnerable and high-risk individuals and an offender management programme is being piloted to address repeat offending in the Dublin City area.  The team includes personnel from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Anna Liffey Drug Project, Dublin City Council Housing and the HSE.  These measures, combined with the Government's initiatives to tackle homelessness, are helping to address the broader issues which may contribute to the incidence of petty crime and anti-social behaviour in the city centre area.<\/p><p>I am encouraged by the continued close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Dublin City Council and other agencies as well as ongoing consultation with key stakeholders, such as the Dublin City Business Forum.

In accordance with the legislation, the Commission was entirely independent in how it carried out its investigation.  As the Deputy is aware, the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Alan Shatter TD, and Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch TD, published the Report of the Commission on 1 May 2014 along with the reply by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service, Mr. Michael Donnellan.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s Final Report contained several conclusions relating to the management, medical treatment and psychiatric care of Stephen Egan prior to and subsequent to the killing by him of Gary Douch.  The Commission also recognised the many significant improvements which had been put in place since 2006, including reductions in prison overcrowding, investment in prisoner accommodation and improved health services for prisoners.  Having considered the Report of the Commission of Investigation, the Government decided to refer the Report to the Interdepartmental Group examining the issue of people with mental illness coming into contact with the criminal justice system.  The Interdepartmental Group was directed to consider the recommendations in a cohesive way and to report back with an implementation plan within three months.  The Group includes representatives from my Department and the Department of Health as well as relevant services including the Health Service Executive, the National Forensic Mental Health Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Irish Prison Service.<\/p>  <p>  The Group proceeded to examine the recommendations of the Commission of Investigation which relate to persons with mental illness and the criminal justice system and submitted an Implementation Plan for those recommendations to me and Minister of State Kathleen Lynch in September 2014.  I am advised that the Irish Prison Service has reported that significant progress has been made and that a comprehensive action plan has been put in place to ensure that the recommendations relating to the Service are being implemented.  Actions in relation to recommendations not yet complete are being progressed and I have requested that implementation of these actions be closely monitored.  I am also advised that progress is also being made by the Department of Health on the Commission's recommendations, including plans to replace the existing Central Mental Hospital and to otherwise enhance forensic mental health services nationally.  I can assure the Deputy that these issues will continue to be pursued in an objective and transparent manner, with a view to enhancing mental health services in this area.  I understand that there is correspondence on file, advising the Commission of Investigation prior to the completion of its report, that the then Minister had decided not to have a personal involvement in dealing with matters arising in relation to it, because the legal firm with which he was connected had acted as legal advisor to the Prisons Officers Association.

The Commission proposed the establishment of an EU-wide resettlement scheme to offer 20,000 resettlement places by the end of 2016.  Under the new resettlement scheme, specific numbers would be allocated to all Member States, calculated on the basis of a distribution key based on GDP, size of population, unemployment rate and past numbers of asylum seekers and of resettled refugees.  The distribution key would also take account of the efforts already made on a voluntary basis by Member States.  The Commission's calculation envisaged Ireland accepting 272 persons over the 2015\/2016 period.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has already committed to accept 220 persons over the 2015\/16 period. In response to the Commission's proposals the Government agreed to accept an additional 300 persons bringing the total to be admitted to 520 persons by the end of 2016, well above the figure suggested by the European Commission.  Ireland is one of 27 States that participate in a refugee resettlement programme led by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).  The focus of the Irish resettlement programme in recent years has been on the resettlement of refugees displaced by the Syrian conflict who are living in one of the hosting countries in the region, for example those living in Lebanon, Jordan or Turkey.  Internally displaced persons, such as the Circassians in Syria, are not eligible for resettlement under this resettlement programme. NGOs working in cooperation with the UNHCR at a local level identify the most vulnerable persons for resettlement, regardless of their race, religion, nationality or ethnicity.<\/p>  <p>  Resettlement is just one of a suite of responses to persons displaced by the Syrian conflict.  In 2014, Ireland introduced a Syrian Humanitarian Admission Programme (SHAP).  The SHAP offered naturalised Irish citizens of Syrian birth and Syrian nationals already legally resident in Ireland an opportunity to make an application for vulnerable close family members to join them in Ireland for up to two years under a sponsorship programme.  These are persons who are considered by their sponsoring family member present in Ireland to be most at risk. 114 beneficiaries have been granted admission under the programme.  In addition, Syrians legally resident in Ireland, for example, students or persons on work permissions may apply for an extension of their permission to remain in the State while the crisis situation continues.  I am informed by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) that 17 applications for refugee status were received from Syrian nationals in the first 6 months of 2015.

My Department works closely with the Department of Education and Skills and other relevant Government departments to achieve these aims.<\/p>  <p>  Under the remit of my Department, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency  has a statutory function to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. The Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency is a statutory service supporting regular school attendance for all school age children and young people. Where school attendance problems arise for a child, the Agency concentrates on finding solutions within a collaborative intervention framework involving children and their families, schools and other relevant agencies. The aim is to generally improve the school attendance, participation and retention of young people, in particular, young people who are at risk of  early school leaving and educational disadvantage.<\/p>  <p>  Educational Welfare Officers work with families and schools to support children who are experiencing difficulties which impact on a child's capacity to attend school. Homelessness and temporary accommodation can impact on a child's attendance and participation in school. In such cases, I am advised that, the Educational Welfare Officer draws on a range of supports including the Home School Community Liaison and the School Completion Programme to assist the child in attending school.<\/p>  <p>  The School Completion Programme is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion. It provides targeted supports annually to approximately 36,000 children.  There are 144 local school completion projects throughout the country operating in 470 primary and 224 post primary schools. <\/p>  <p>  Supports provided by local school completion programme projects including breakfast clubs, after school supports, homework clubs, summer activity projects and friendship clubs can help to support a child's participation in education and engagement in school life. Educational Welfare Officers employ these supports for the child and may seek to provide assistance with transport where this is feasible.  An Educational Welfare Officer may also engage with the Family Support Worker where this is appropriate in the child's and family's particular circumstances. The objective is to work with the family and child to support continued participation in school and good educational outcomes for children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400087#WRZ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Postcode System Implementation","counter":1100,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400087#WRZ01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1101,"qnumday":488,"qnumall":"[28310\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400087#WRZ02000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his plans to include the new Eircode postcode in all schemes and administrative roles operated by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"995","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1102,"content":"<p>Officials in my Department are currently liaising with their colleagues in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources regarding this matter. <\/p><p>My Department aims to fully comply with Departmental best practice regarding the roll-out of the new Eircode system, in the most efficient manner possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400087#WRZ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Inquiries","counter":1103,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400087#WRZ02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1104,"qnumday":489,"qnumall":"[28468\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400087#WRZ02200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the reason detailed financial records from the Bessborough Mother and Baby Home were not handed over to the Health Service Executive and to the Child and Family Agency by the Order in 2011.","asker":"1192","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1105,"content":"<p>The issues raised by the Deputy are a matter for  the Child and Family Agency and I have asked the Agency to reply directly to the Deputy <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400087#WRZ02300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Workers Recruitment","counter":1106,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400087#WRZ02350"},{"type":"question","counter":1107,"qnumday":490,"qnumall":"[28484\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400087#WRZ02400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will address the deficiencies in social work resources on the northside of Dublin, where there were 3,797 referrals over a 12 month period.","asker":"1017","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1108,"content":"<p>The Health Information and Quality Authority recently published its report on an inspection of the child welfare and protection services in the Dublin North administrative area of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.

Approximately 65,000 children are participating in this Programme in the current school year. My Department does not collate figures in relation to the number of  children with special  needs who are within the eligibility age range for the ECCE programme.  <\/p>  <p>  While there is currently no specific funding available from my Department to provide additional support to children with special needs accessing the ECCE programme, there are a number of measures in place to ensure that the free pre-school year is more accessible to these children.  These include an exemption from the upper age limit where a child would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, while the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the free pre-school year, it does work at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This is done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities. In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with disabilities in some instances to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and subject to resources. <\/p>  <p>  This Government recognises however, that co-ordination and provision of appropriate supports for pre-school children with special needs could be improved. Accordingly, when I established the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and School Age Care and Education, I included in its terms of reference the need to examine how best to provide for children with special needs within the ECCE Programme.<\/p>  <p>  To advance this, the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, and Health have agreed to work together to develop a new model of supports for pre-school children with special needs.

They are issued with a Marketing Authorisation (MA).  Roaccutane was first authorised for use in Ireland on 19 April 1983.  Comprehensive standards of quality for applications for MA's are contained within EU and Irish legislation, and regulatory guidance documents.  These were comprehensively referenced in my answer to PQ 26769\/15. The same legislation covers all data requirements as well as pharmacovigilance requirements.<\/p>  <p>  The product information requirements, including their format and content, are also detailed in these guidance documents.  Both are approved as an intrinsic part of the licensing of a medicine and continuously updated to reflect the current state of knowledge of the medicine concerned and the risks associated with its use, as new data become available and is assessed by the HPRA and\/or its European counterparts.<\/p>  <p>  The package leaflet is subject to user-testing to ensure its ease of readability by patients.  Package leaflets are available in the medicine&rsquo;s packaging and on the HPRA and other websites.  Any changes to the licence document or product information deemed necessary after assessment of applications are made by the company concerned.  There have been numerous updates to the product information for Roaccutane; currently available records indicate at least 27 updates to these documents, with multiple changes made to them in the context of some of these updates.<\/p>  <p>  There is currently no fee for the renewal of MA's.  Rather, companies pay the HPRA an annual maintenance fee of &euro;650 for the first 10 MA's they hold and &euro;812 for additional authorisations; this is to cover all aspects of routine dossier management and maintenance, including the work associated with on-going pharmacovigilance activities.  Information on the renewal of the authorisations for medicinal products was provided in my response to PQ 18776\/15.<\/p>  <p>  Roaccutane was last renewed on 10 July 2009 with an unlimited MA. Unlimited MA's are a requirement of the legislation as explained that same response of May 2015.  An unlimited authorisation does not preclude changes to the product information for healthcare professionals and patients.  Changes can be made, when required, on the basis of ongoing pharmacovigilance activities and assessments.<\/p>  <p>  Part of this ongoing pharmacovigilance is the monitoring, review and evaluation of reported adverse drug reactions. Reporting of adverse events has been a function of the HPRA since its establishment as the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) in 1995, and prior to 1995 by the National Drugs Advisory Board (NDAB).  Reporting of suspected adverse reactions by healthcare professionals (e.g. doctors\/dentists\/pharmacists\/nurses) and patients\/carers is undertaken on a voluntary basis, with all groups strongly encouraged to report when they consider a medicine may have contributed to the effects experienced.  WHO data indicates that Ireland was ranked tenth highest reporter across 121 participating countries during 2014, reflecting the active contribution of Irish healthcare professionals to the reporting programme.  Given these levels of reporting and the very positive response of healthcare professionals to requests for reports over the years, it is not considered that a mandatory based system of reporting by healthcare professionals is appropriate or necessary.  The HPRA does however continue to regularly remind health care professionals about reporting adverse drug reactions via its Drugs Safety Newsletter.<\/p>  <p>  Since it was first authorised for use in Ireland, Roaccutane (isotretinoin) has been contraindicated in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.  Use of isotretinoin has also been consistently contraindicated in women of childbearing potential since the product was first authorised, unless all of the conditions specified in the product information are met.<\/p>  <p>   An EU wide Pregnancy Prevention Plan (PPP) was introduced in October 2003 to further reduce the potential risk of pregnancy in women by expanding the available information and highlighting the well-known and documented risks related to use in women of child-bearing potential.  These measures include supplementary information distributed to prescribing doctors, pharmacists, other relevant healthcare professionals and patients, including the following:<\/p>  <p>  -  Physician&rsquo;s guide to prescribing Roaccutane to female patients;<\/p>  <p>  -  Physician&rsquo;s checklist for prescribing to female patients;<\/p>  <p>  -  Patient information brochure;<\/p>  <p>  -  Important information for patients prescribed Roaccutane on contraception; and<\/p>  <p>  -  Pharmacist&rsquo;s guide to dispensing Roaccutane.<\/p>  <p>  The PPP applies across all EU member states and is monitored and reviewed at EU level.  The company submits the information gathered through the PPP on a yearly basis to the competent authority for each EU member state (i.e. HPRA in Ireland).  The European Medicines Agency&rsquo;s (EMA&rsquo;s) Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC), (at which Ireland is represented by the HPRA) assesses the data provided to consider any need to strengthen\/amend the PPP as part of the regular review of the effectiveness of these risk minimisation measures.<\/p>  <p>  Licence applications and licence renewal applications contain commercially sensitive information.  The HPRA has a duty to protect confidential information submitted by companies, healthcare professionals and patients and cannot release the information requested without third-party consent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400090#WRCC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Funding","counter":1231,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400090#WRCC01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1232,"qnumday":534,"qnumall":"[28353\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400090#WRCC01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will report on his recent estimations of the amount of funding that is required to fix our failing healthcare systems, including funding for acute hospitals, emergency rooms, community care, nursing home care, residential care for those with disabilities, and residential detoxification services, per heading; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1190","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1233,"content":"<p>Health care infrastructure projects support service delivery and are determined by the demands and pressures of the service to be delivered.

The levels of home supports planned for in the NSP are:<\/p>  <p>-  10.3 million hours of home help service supporting 50,000 people -  this is same level of service as 2014.<\/p>  <p>- 13,800 people in receipt of a home care packages at any one time - this includes an additional 600 people supported under the delayed discharges initiative.<\/p>  <p>-  190 people in receipt of an intensive home care package at any one time - these packages were introduced for the first time in 2014 for people with more complex care needs.<\/p>  <p>  It would be of great concern to me if we were placing more people in residential care than happens in other comparable countries, but I do not think that this is in fact the case.  The proportion of older people in residential care is a constantly changing one, and international comparison can be quite problematic because of differences in models of care and in definition of what constitutes long term residential care etc.  However, in Ireland we generally have somewhere between 4% to 4.5% of those aged over 65 in residential care, and this is about average for other countries in the OECD.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I would hope to reduce this number further.  The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, as well as considering the historical and future operation of the Scheme itself, will consider how community and other services should be developed in order to facilitate more older people to stay at home for longer, and towards this end it identifies the services that should be prioritised into the future as resources allow.  These include home care, better linkages between acute and community services, short stay beds, the use of assistive technology and consideration of new residential models on a collaborative basis by the Departments of Health and Environment and Local Government.

There have been several significant cross-Border and all-island initiatives over the past 20 years, with the early experience gained through local and regional pilot projects in the Border area, building the confidence to put more permanent collaborative arrangements in place. Today, there are many examples which illustrate that co-operation between North and South in health makes sense. I am committed to strengthening and increasing North-South health co-operation.<\/p>  <p>  There is continued engagement between my Department and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland on progressing co-operation in paediatric cardiology services on an all-island basis. The expert international working group report on an all-island service for cardiology and cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease was published in October 2014. This report is a pragmatic example of co-operation across both jurisdictions which seeks to create an effective, integrated service for the benefit of patients. It makes clear and explicit recommendations on the development of a single congenital cardiac service for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. One of the recommendations was that paediatric surgery and interventional cardiology should cease in Belfast and that all services should be provided in Dublin, giving us the critical mass needed for such a centre. This development will ensure that a very vulnerable group of sick children and young people get the best level of care no matter where they come from on the island.<\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the report recommendations has commenced on a phased basis at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin this year and these  services will move to the new children's hospital when built. The new hospital will be co-located with St. James's Hospital, and ultimately tri-located with the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, which will relocate to the campus in due course. In addition to the main hospital, the project includes two satellite centres at the campuses of Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals.  Design development for the hospitals and satellite centres is ongoing and a planning submission is to be made in the coming weeks. Subject to planning, work is scheduled to commence at all three sites in early 2016. The intention is that the new children&rsquo;s hospital will become a child-centred and family-focused world class facility, capable of anticipating and responding to developments in healthcare expected over the next generation. The hospital will provide tertiary and quaternary paediatric services, including on an all-island basis where agreed, as well as secondary paediatric services for the greater Dublin area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400092#WREE02000","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1323,"content":"<p>Question No. 566 answered with Question No. 564.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Funding","counter":1324,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400092#WREE02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1325,"qnumday":567,"qnumall":"[28511\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400092#WREE02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding an application for funding (details supplied) to address a shortfall in services in County Kildare (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1326,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p><p>If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400092#WREE02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1018"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff","counter":1327,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400092#WREE02350"},{"type":"question","counter":1328,"qnumday":568,"qnumall":"[28514\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400092#WREE02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will ensure that a person who is a clerical officer (details supplied) in the Health Service Executive is provided with a transfer to County Longford, as formally requested.","asker":"1065","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1329,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly on this matter.

This delivered on a commitment in the Programme for Government to develop a national Alzheimer&rsquo;s and other dementias strategy to increase awareness, ensure early diagnosis and intervention and develop enhanced community based services.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy distinguishes between those Actions that can be progressed within existing resources and others to be addressed as more resources become available.  Those identified for first implementation include:<\/p>  <p>- Clear responsibility for dementia to be assigned within the HSE. A dedicated Office, led at General Manager level by Mr. John Linehan, Specialist, Services for Older People, has been established within the HSE to support implementation of the Strategy;<\/p>  <p>- Clear descriptions of care pathways, and better information and guidance on services to be made available to GPs and to people with dementia and their families and carers;<\/p>  <p>- A better understanding of dementia, including modifiable risk factors, to be promoted;<\/p>  <p>- The use of existing resources to be reviewed to ensure that they are used in the best way possible;<\/p>  <p>- Research to inform the design and delivery of dementia services in Ireland to be supported and given appropriate priority.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE have agreed a joint initiative with the Atlantic Philanthropies to implement significant elements of the Strategy over the period 2014-2017.  This National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme will represent a combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12m, and the HSE contributing &euro;15.5m.<\/p>  <p>  This programme will promote a greater focus on timely diagnosis of dementia and on the value of early intervention, along with the long-term objective of making people in Ireland generally more aware and understanding of the needs of people with dementia, and of the contribution that those with dementia continue to make to our society. Key elements of the initiative include:<\/p>  <p>- the rollout of a programme of Intensive Home Supports and Homecare Packages for people with dementia;<\/p>  <p>- the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GPs, who are the critical and initial point of contact with the health system for those with dementia - the resource material will include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points, etc.; and<\/p>  <p>- Measures to raise public awareness, address stigma, and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia.<\/p>  <p>  A Monitoring Group, chaired by the Department of Health, has been established to assist with and advise on implementation of the Strategy, including the National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme.  This Group includes health professionals, administrators, researchers, and advocates. In addition, the Group includes a number of new members including a person living with dementia and a representative of those who care for people with dementia.  The Group held its first meeting in April 2015 at which it commenced consideration of an Implementation Plan for the Strategy.  A further meeting is scheduled for 24 September 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Progress has already been made on a number of fronts.  The HSE has established a central Dementia Office to drive and oversee implementation of the Strategy.  Work has commenced on the development of a Dementia Friendly Ireland programme to raise awareness and increase understanding of the condition.  Research into the educational needs of GPs and Primary Care Team members is underway, and a body of training will follow when this is complete.  Roll-out has commenced of intensive home care packages for people with dementia, and 38 people with dementia have benefitted to date.<\/p>  <p>  There is no formal signing-up process for GPs in this context:-the Irish College of General Practitioners are collaborators on and supportive of this project.  We are still in the early stages of implementation, but the National Dementia Strategy is a clear indication by Government of the importance that it attaches to dementia, and of our commitment to ensuring that those with dementia can live well for as long as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400097#WRKK01300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Contracts","counter":1543,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400097#WRKK01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1544,"qnumday":644,"qnumall":"[28905\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400097#WRKK01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide in tabular form, by county, the number and list of general practitioners who have signed up to the proposed scheme of free general practitioner care for children under six years of age.","asker":"1066","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1545,"content":"<p>As at 16.00 on 10th July 2015, 2,122 contracts had been received from GPs (over 88% of GMS contract holders).

Given the limited funding available and our health infrastructure needs priority for funding must be based on verified service needs and all capital funding must be directed to supporting these core services.  The Health Service Executive is required to obtain value for money when disposing of surplus property assets the proceeds of which, with Department of Public Expenditure consent, will be re-invested in delivering much needed health care infrastructure.  The HSE is concentrating on applying the limited funding available for capital works in the most effective way possible to meet health care needs now and in the future.   <\/p>  <p>  The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan sets a public sector energy efficiency target to reduce energy use by 33% by 2020.  The HSE is endeavouring to comply with the Government&rsquo;s Green Procurement Guidelines which requires public bodies to ensure that a minimum building energy rating of B3 is achieved in all newly built and leased buildings from January 2012 and a minimum rating of A3 from January 2015.  The HSE's design and building construction tenders all reflect these targets and all buildings being procured will meet these standards.  Given the age of the old buildings on the Portrane campus, their vastness and total unsuitability for modern health care service delivery, it is generally not value for money and economically advantageous to expend scarce health care resources on their redevelopment.  However, the HSE is actively engaged in rationalising the Portrane health care accommodation needs and reducing its energy use.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the planning application for the new hospital the HSE identified some buildings for inclusion in the OPW register where if future use was compatible with existing health care operations these buildings could be utilised by other public bodies.  In relation to the use of State property the Government's Reform Plan sets out commitments relating to property asset management which include ensuring that optimal value for money is achieved in the management of the State's property portfolio.  Developments including the rationalisation of State bodies, changing business practices and health care needs combined with reduced property requirements necessitate a multi-faceted adjustment to the management of the State&rsquo;s property portfolio.  The development and implementation of the Property Management Delivery Plan has been one of the outcomes of the reform process.  This plan aims to improve the planning and management of the public service property portfolio by improving co-ordination of strategies and activities, processes for strategic planning, projects and property management, standards for accommodation fit-out and data capture, accountability for decision making and deployment of resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400099#WRMM01800","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Abortion Legislation","counter":1635,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400099#WRMM01875"},{"type":"question","counter":1636,"qnumday":678,"qnumall":"[29078\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400099#WRMM01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the methods used to terminate pregnancies under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013; the number by medical induction; the number by\u00a0suction or dilation and curettage-dilation and evacuation; for the terminations arising from suicidal ideation, if these patients were first treated with the standard treatment given to suicidal patients, those being counselling, psychotherapy and-or psychopharmacology; his views on reports that staff in one hospital were concerned at how the Act was being implemented, in relation to a termination for suicidal ideation-intent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1637,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the first annual report on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, as required under Section 20 of the Act.

The National Clinical Programme for Asthma (NCPA) and the Asthma Society of Ireland have welcomed the introduction of this first step in the provision of a comprehensive programme for asthma across primary and secondary care.  The cycle of care includes key actions such as checking inhaler technique, provision of a written asthma action plan, review of asthma medications and recording of smoking status of the home. <\/p>  <p>  A key focus for the National Clinical Programme for Asthma this year has been the two Asthma Integrated Care Demonstrator Projects.  Funding for these projects commenced from June in the HSE Primary Care Service Plan 2015.  The process for recruiting the clinical care staff is underway with expected commencement in October 2015.  These projects will facilitate the implementation of the cycle of care and demonstrate how care can be integrated for Asthma between Primary and Secondary Care.  This Integrated Asthma Care will be delivered by a community based Clinical Nurse Specialist (Respiratory - Integrated Care).  These projects will be further extended in 2016 so that the needs of asthma patients can be further addressed. <\/p>  <p>  The NCPA has made significant progress since its establishment which to date includes:<\/p>  <p>  - The development of asthma guidelines in acute and chronic management, care pathways, treatment protocols and care bundles for use in all care settings (primary and secondary care levels), in conjunction with National Emergency Medicine, Acute Medicine, COPD, Critical Care, Obstetrics &amp;amp; Gynaecology, Paediatric programmes and Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP);<\/p>  <p>  - The development of a Model of Care for Asthma (MOCA) approved by the Leadership in HSE and planned for launch in 2015;<\/p>  <p>  - The development and implementation in conjunction with the Asthma Society of Ireland, of asthma education programmes for healthcare professionals to underpin the guidelines implementation;<\/p>  <p>  - The planning of a structured Asthma Programme at Primary Care level in conjunction with ICGP and Primary Care programme to ensure implementation of evidenced based chronic asthma management guidelines and asthma care;<\/p>  <p>  - Supporting the work of the Asthma Society of Ireland in patient asthma education supports initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined above, the components of the programme are being implemented on an ongoing basis.

In the absence of any detailed proposal it is difficult to speculate on potential consequences.  Obviously were any proposal to be made it would have to be carefully analysed.  On the broad question of human rights and the Good Friday Agreement, the views of the Government are clear and unchanged.  The protection of human rights in Northern Ireland law, predicated on the European Convention on Human Rights, is one of the key principles underpinning the Agreement. As a guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government takes very seriously its responsibility to safeguard its institutions and principles.

Through our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the U.S., we continue to work closely on this agenda with high level Government contacts and with many other individuals and groups across Irish America and beyond.  The aim of these contacts is to achieve relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the US and to improve channels for legal migration between Ireland and America. The administrative measures announced last November by President Obama, which could benefit thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants based in the US, were very welcome.  I am conscious however that they remain under legal challenge in US Federal Courts and that in any case legislation in Congress is still needed to build on what has been promised in President Obama&rsquo;s announcement.  For that reason, the Government and our Embassy continue to avail of all contacts with the Administration and with Republican and Democratic political leaders to make the case for comprehensive immigration reform legislation.  To that end, I recently met with John Boehner, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and a number of his Congressional colleagues, when they visited Dublin.  The Taoiseach also met with him and we both took the opportunity to re-emphasise the Government&rsquo;s wish to see comprehensive legislative reform so as to provide relief for the undocumented Irish and a legal pathway to allow for future Irish immigration to the US.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has also repeatedly raised the issue of immigration reform during other high level visits with US officials.

Ireland is playing a strong international role in the overall process to agree a new framework for global development to succeed the Millennium Development Goals.  The contours of agreement at Addis will need to be broad if they are to support the new set of Sustainable Development Goals to be adopted at the  Summit at the UN in New York.  Official Development Assistance (ODA) will be a vitally important element of the package, but agreement will also be needed on a much wider range of resources for development.  It will be important that all<i><\/i>parties contribute on an equitable basis and that we also look at measures to unlock all available sources of financing.  These must include domestic resource mobilisation, the most rapidly growing component of development finance over the last decade, taxation, science and technology and ways of involving the private sector as inclusive partners in development.  While ODA will not be sole focus of negotiations at Addis, it remains particularly important for the fight to end poverty in the Least Developed Countries.  The Government remains firmly committed to the 0.7% target for ODA and to making further progress towards it as our economic recovery consolidates.

In the Government&rsquo;s recent review of foreign policy, <i>The Global Island: Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World<\/i>, we re-affirmed our commitment to the universality, indivisibility and interrelatedness of all human rights, to accountability for human rights violations and abuses, and to the protection of those who are most vulnerable and marginalised.  Ireland attaches great importance to combating all forms of discrimination, including that based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.  We firmly believe in tolerance, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief.  It is of deep concern that freedom of religion and belief is in danger in many places worldwide.  Members of minority religious communities, including those of Christian, Muslim and Baha&rsquo;i faith, have been subjected to appalling levels of violence, discrimination, and harassment.  The recent rise in the number of anti-Semitic attacks worldwide is also of serious concern. Ireland works within and alongside the EU to address<i><\/i>the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, notably with the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief adopted during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013. These Guidelines provide EU officials with an overview of the legal and policy framework within which the right to freedom of religion or belief is protected. They also elaborate an EU strategy on how to engage with third countries on the right to freedom of religion or belief, a strategy which we hope to see bear fruit as we assess the implementation of the Guidelines.<\/p><p>The EU Action Plan for Human Rights and Democracy 2015-2019 will be adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) on 20 July 2015.  The Action Plan forms part of the EU Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy which was adopted by the FAC in June 2012.  Its purpose is to improve the effectiveness and consistency of the EU&rsquo;s policy and commits the EU to promoting human rights in all areas of its external action.  Responsibility for the implementation of the Action Plan is shared between the EEAS, European Commission and EU Member States.<\/p><p>Within the EU, Ireland pressed for the promotion of freedom of religion or belief to be included in the Action Plan, and this is now reflected as a stand-alone point with the following actions:<\/p><p>Ensure that freedom of religion or belief remains high on the agenda of relations with third countries, as well as in multilateral fora, in close cooperation with relevant stakeholders; promote the exchange of best practices, and deepen awareness on the various components of freedom of religion or belief at Headquarters, EU delegations and Member State embassies.<\/p><p>Encourage and support relevant partner countries and other stakeholders&rsquo; initiatives on freedom of religion or belief in particular those aimed at protecting and promoting the rights of persons belonging to religious minorities, enabling them to manifest their religion or belief without fear of violence, discrimination, political pressure, censorship or persecution.<\/p><p>Promote inter-cultural and inter-religious dialogue and the role of religious and other leaders in ensuring freedom of religion or belief.<\/p><p>Ireland also raises the issue of the safety of religious minorities through its official bilateral contacts with the countries in question, stressing the responsibility of the government to protect all citizens and minorities. We consistently press for effective action to counter the persecution of minorities in all relevant international fora, including the EU and UN.  I personally highlighted the issue when I addressed the UN General Assembly in New York on 29 September 2014.

Concerns about this case have been raised by the European Union on behalf of its Member States, including Ireland, with the Saudi authorities.

In the Government&rsquo;s recent review of foreign policy, <i>The Global Island: Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World<\/i>, we re-affirmed our commitment to the universality, indivisibility and interrelatedness of all human rights, to accountability for human rights violations and abuses, and to the protection of those who are most vulnerable and marginalised.  Together with our EU partners, Ireland closely monitors the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world. We do this on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including both official channels and non-governmental\/civil society organisations. Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question.  We do this bilaterally, through the EU or via the positions we take at the UN General Assembly and in the UN Human Rights Council.  We support the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses.  This includes support for the role of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the UN Human Rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, the Special Procedure Mandate Holders and for the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council. The EU regularly makes statements at these bodies on the human rights situations in individual countries and Ireland is fully associated with these statements. The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries.<\/p><p>Since March 2006, when the UN Human Rights Council was formed, Ireland has engaged proactively with the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism initiated by the Council. The UPR mechanism allows for the review of the domestic human rights records of all 193 UN Member States approximately every four and a half years, based on human rights obligations under UN human rights and other instruments. Any UN Member State can take part in the interactive dialogue (i.e. the actual examination of the State under review) and submit written questions in advance. Ireland was itself examined under the UPR process on 6 October 2011. <\/p><p>The process enables UN Member States to raise issues, some of which would have been identified by members of the public and civil society, and to make recommendations about the protection and promotion of human rights in the State concerned.  Ireland has engaged fully with the UPR process and welcomes the open and constructive dialogue associated with it. We have also made numerous interventions during the UPR examination of other states, raising issues of concern such as gender-based violence, freedom of expression, religious freedom, freedom of assembly, and the protection of human rights defenders within the State under review.<\/p><p>The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law.  In addition, the EU conducts human rights dialogues with a number of countries and also raises human rights concerns as part of political dialogue meetings.  In June 2012 the EU adopted a Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy.<\/p><p>Ireland and its EU partners have been strong and consistent supporters of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. The Court&rsquo;s Prosecutor has opened investigations into a number of country situations and we will continue to monitor this work closely.<\/p><p>Ireland has also consistently taken the lead in negotiating resolutions at the United Nations General Assembly and in the Human Rights Council, of which we are a member for the period 2013 to 2015, on the promotion and protection of human rights defenders, as well as on the implementation of EU Guidelines in relation to human rights defenders in third countries, the aim being to ensure that the latter can operate in an environment free from hindrance and insecurity.<\/p><p>The promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms has always been a cornerstone of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme. Ireland&rsquo;s new policy on international development, &lsquo;One World One Future&rsquo;, reaffirms the centrality of human rights to Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and aid programme, and commits to ensuring that human rights principles and standards are promoted, protected and integrated in all of our development efforts. The Government&rsquo;s development cooperation programme, Irish Aid, addresses the root causes of poverty and exclusion by focussing on the most vulnerable and promoting their participation, representation, and the means to realise their rights.  This includes investing in the improvement and expansion of essential services, and support to organisations that promote human rights, governance, and democracy in developing countries, including civil society and the UN office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.  Mindful that the risk of human rights violations is greater where political, economic and administrative systems are weak, Irish Aid promotes access to justice and supports the strengthening of government institutions, parliaments, and independent media, and national human rights institutions.  <\/p><p>The Government will continue to avail of all the above-mentioned mechanisms and instruments with a view to highlighting violations of human rights and furthering their protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400103#WRQQ02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Humanitarian Aid","counter":1795,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400103#WRQQ02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1796,"qnumday":735,"qnumall":"[28943\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400103#WRQQ02700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the degree to which humanitarian aid continues to be made available in the regions throughout the globe currently most affected by conflict; if adequate steps have been taken to ensure the availability of aid and-or the establishment of safe havens for civilians; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1797,"content":"<p>The core objective of Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian assistance is to save and protect lives, alleviate suffering and maintain human dignity, before, during and in the aftermath of humanitarian crises, including in regions affected by conflict. Ireland's humanitarian response is underpinned a strong commitment to the humanitarian principles of independence, neutrality, impartiality and humanity. The international community is currently challenged by an unprecedented scale of humanitarian need globally, with 80 per cent of those in need of humanitarian assistance living in situations of conflict.  Ireland&rsquo;s Official Development Assistance budget includes specific funding to enable Irish Aid to respond to emergencies.  Last year, we dedicated &euro;85 million to provide lifesaving humanitarian aid to vulnerable people across the world, including those affected by conflict.  In March, Ireland pledged further funding of &euro;12 million to help meet the urgent needs of those affected by the Syria conflict in 2015. <i>This will bring the total value of the Government&rsquo;s response to the crisis in Syria to over &euro;41 million<\/i>.  This year we have also provided humanitarian funding in response to the needs of conflict-affected people Libya and Yemen. In addition, we are responding to the humanitarian situation in Northern Nigeria, where conflict has displaced civilian populations and has affected neighbouring countries, Chad and Cameroon.  We will continue to respond to the effects of conflict in other regions, including South Sudan and Central African Republic.<\/p><p>At a global level, Ireland is a major supporter of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which is often the best placed to provide assistance in conflict situations and where other organisations cannot operate, such as Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan. Last year, Ireland provided over &euro;9 million to the ICRC to support its global operations in conflict contexts and we intend to maintain this level of support in 2015. <\/p><p>On 2 July, I addressed the first ever Irish Humanitarian Summit, which took place in UCD and was opened by President Higgins.

The growth of Euroscepticism must be taken seriously, but it should not be overstated. In last year&rsquo;s European elections, the vast majority of the European electorate endorsed pro-European parties and candidates, while Eurosceptics recorded significant gains in several larger Member States they made little impact in many others, losing a share of the vote in several cases.  Since the election, a new European Commission has been appointed, headed by President Jean Claude Juncker, as well as a new High Representative and a new President of the European Council. The &lsquo;&lsquo;refresh&rsquo;&rsquo; of the institutions has presented an opportunity to refocus the work of the EU and to strengthen engagement with the public.

Ireland co-sponsored the Resolution along with 103 other States, including all other EU member states. <\/p>  <p>  UN Security Council Resolutions, including 1373, 2170 and 2178 provide a comprehensive framework of measures to address the threat of terrorism including through taking active steps to prevent travel by persons suspected of planning or intending to participate in terrorist acts; cooperation in exchanging information on actions and movement of terrorists; prevention of recruitment and radicalisation of possible members of such groups, and denying financial transfers to individual terrorists and terrorist groups. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland supports the comprehensive approach being taken at UN and EU levels to preventing and countering terrorism.  We support the need for measures to be human rights-compliant and in accordance with international law and have stressed the need to tackle underlying factors that contribute to radicalisation and terrorism and in particular the importance of the link between security and development.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support all international efforts, including by the EU and UN, to promote a political resolution of the current conflict in both Syria and Iraq. We will also continue to address the humanitarian consequences of the conflict and provide urgent assistance and support to the civilian populations within Syria and Iraq who have been displaced or suffered violations of their rights at the hands of ISIS and other extremists.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400103#WRQQ05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Conflict Resolution","counter":1824,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400103#WRQQ05500"},{"type":"question","counter":1825,"qnumday":745,"qnumall":"[28953\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400103#WRQQ05600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which he, in conjunction with his European Union colleagues, may continue to encourage the installation of democratic structures in Libya, that have been the subject of regime change in recent times; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1826,"content":"<p>Since the elections which took place little more than a year ago, Libya has descended into conflict.

We are therefore monitoring developments very closely, engaging with our British counterparts and doing all we can to help to ensure that the UK remains in the EU. For my part and that of my Department, this includes regular engagement at political level with the British Foreign Secretary and ongoing diplomatic engagement through our Embassy in London, Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels and across the member states of the European Union and beyond. At home and abroad, we also engage with a large cross-section of opinion leaders and members of civil society engaged in this debate.  I met in Dublin with the British Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond MP, on 19 June. Building on the regular exchanges we have had since last year, we discussed the current negotiations in the light of the re-appointment of Prime Minister Cameron in May and I outlined the Irish approach in detail. <\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach met with Prime Minister Cameron in London on 18 June. Both my meeting with the Foreign Secretary and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s meeting with the Prime Minister were very positive and constructive. We have made clear to our UK colleagues how much value we attach to the fact that both our countries are members of the EU. We have said that without necessarily agreeing on all points, Ireland will be as helpful in the negotiations as we can be.  <\/p>  <p>  The issue is also of importance to our partners in the EU, and indeed to the EU as a whole.  It arises frequently in discussions with my EU counterparts, not just at Council meetings but also in bilateral encounters.  Furthermore, it is of obvious interest to governments outside of the EU and the matter is raised with me regularly by my counterparts around the world. <\/p>  <p>  At the European Council on 25 to 26 June, Prime Minister Cameron presented a brief outline of his proposals for possible changes to EU policy and legislation. A lengthy debate did not take place at that meeting but partners agreed that consultations would be undertaken to see how the proposals might be taken forward. The outcome of that process will be reviewed by the European Council in December. <\/p>  <p>  The government welcomes the recent publication by the Joint Committee on EU Affairs on the subject of the EU-UK relationship. It acknowledges that British membership is important not just for Ireland, but for the EU as a whole. The report makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of the issues at stake and is a powerful symbol of the cross-party consensus that Ireland is best served by our closest neighbour and friend remaining in the Union. <\/p>  <p>  The Government fully recognises that the economic dimension to this issue is particularly significant. Regular contact is maintained with business groups who also understand how crucial common EU membership is for the Irish-British bilateral economic relationship. Further work is being undertaken to enhance that understanding, including research that the Department of Finance has commissioned from the Economic and Social Research Institute on macro-economic links between the UK and Ireland in the context of joint membership of the EU.<\/p>  <p>  More widely, Government Departments are also very much engaged on the matter and have been so for some time. Preparatory work has already been undertaken on the issues that might arise for Ireland. This has included an examination of the policy areas that might be affected by a change in the nature of the EU-UK relationship, including a possible British exit from the Union. I want to emphasise, however, that the main focus of our work has been on examining how to secure British membership of the Union. That will continue to be the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400104#WRRR00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":1832,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400104#WRRR00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1833,"qnumday":748,"qnumall":"[28957\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400104#WRRR00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which the European Union remains conversant with issues emerging in Macedonia, and the relevance for the European Union in general; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1834,"content":"<p>The European Union has been deeply worried by the deteriorating political situation in Macedonia for some time, and it has been the subject of high-level meetings of the Council, most recently last month, when both the Foreign Affairs and General Affairs Councils discussed it. Ongoing political instability and dysfunction as demonstrated by the boycott of parliament by the opposition since December 2012 and the wire-tapping scandal have been a cause for concern, and violent clashes in May between police and an alleged terrorist group brought the overall situation to international attention.  Talks between the leaders of the political parties have been facilitated variously by MEPS, the EU and US Ambassadors, and Commissioner Hahn, who brokered an initial agreement on 2 June. We view this agreement as a first step to addressing the political crisis: it sets out commitments by the leaders of the four main political parties to democratic principles, good neighbourly relations and good inter-ethnic relations, as well as to tackling rule of law issues. <\/p>  <p>  The EU has urged the political leaders of Macedonia to implement the agreement, and to address breaches of fundamental rights and freedoms.<\/p>  <p>  In the interests of Macedonia and the wider Western Balkan region, Ireland continues to support the country on its accession path and we urge the four leaders of the main political parties to continue engaging constructively to resolve outstanding issues.

Accordingly, the purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school\/ETB.<\/p><p>The detailed supplementary assignment arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for the 2015\/2016 school year are set out in Departmental Circular 0041\/2015 which issued on 12 June 2015 and which is available on the Department's website at the following address: <\/p><p>Once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service (Service in a substitute capacity i.e. covering for maternity leave, sick leave, career breaks, job-sharing etc. does not count) is notified by his\/her employer that s\/he is to be made redundant then s\/he shall be deemed to be a member of a supplementary assignment panel for SNAs. <\/p><p>The operation of this panel is described and outlined in Circular 0041\/2015 and it is designed to be as flexible as possible which enables all eligible SNAs, who have the requisite Panel Form 1 completed by their former employer, to apply for any SNA position that is advertised by a school or an ETB with no sectoral, diocesan or geographical limitations imposed.  It does not work on a list basis.  Every eligible SNA will remain on the panel for two years with a view to getting further employment.  If they are not successful over that period of time in obtaining a further SNA position then they will be eligible for a Redundancy payment.  Furthermore, an SNA may opt out of this supplementary assignment panel at any point in time triggering the processing of his\/her redundancy payment in line with the terms set out in the SNA redundancy scheme (DES Circular 58\/06) or any revision of same that is applicable at that time.<\/p><p>It is important to note that when an employer has a vacancy to fill, they must undertake the recruitment process in accordance with the provisions outlined in paragraphs 15-22 of Circular 41\/2015.<\/p><p>Finally, my Department has set up a dedicated e-mail address to deal with all queries in relation to the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel and any queries in respect of the operation of the Panel can be directed to this dedicated e-mail address: snasupplementpanel@education.gov.ie<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400105#WRSS00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Postcode System Implementation","counter":1863,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400105#WRSS00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1864,"qnumday":758,"qnumall":"[28313\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400105#WRSS00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her plans to include the new Eircode postcode in all schemes and administrative roles operated by her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"995","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1865,"content":"<p>Business areas within my Department are drawing up implementation plans to include Eircodes on key databases, i.e. those holding addresses of school employees, schools, Boards of Management, suppliers etc. Development work needed to support Eircodes will be scheduled along with other changes to our systems to minimise costs and disruption to the everyday work of the Department. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400105#WRSS00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Amalgamation","counter":1866,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400105#WRSS00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1867,"qnumday":759,"qnumall":"[28366\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400105#WRSS00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will address issues raised in correspondence regarding the amalgamation of schools (details supplied) in County Galway; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1108","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1868,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Patron of the schools to which he refers has determined that the new amalgamated school should be located on the site and buildings of one of the schools in question. In reaching this decision, the Patron and schools had available to them an independent technical report that reviewed the curricular capacity of both school buildings and sites. A separate technical report completed by my Department has also been made available that supports the Patron's decision. Whilst deficits of accommodation in both buildings were identified, the independent report recommended that one of the school buildings was the location that \"requires the least amount of re-modelling of the existing structure and has the potential for expansion to accommodate a combined curriculum and additional teaching spaces\". The Patron has advised my Department that they accept the report's recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that funding for a significant extension project has been approved in principle in recent days to facilitate the proposed amalgamation of the schools concerned, which are proposing to amalgamate from September 2016. This extension includes for the provision of a science laboratory, business studies\/commerce room, technology room with associated preparation areas and three interlinked standard classrooms. This extension is expected to significantly enhance the accommodation available to the amalgamated school. The position of the prefabs, referred to by the Deputy, which are on the site in question will be addressed as part of the extension project.<\/p>  <p>  To also facilitate the amalgamation, a site extension to the existing site in question has been agreed under a lease agreement at a nominal rate and this arrangement will be reviewed in 5 years. This site extension includes the gardens, referred to, and significantly enhances the school site in question.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is aware that the amalgamated school will not have access to a PE hall. As the Deputy will appreciate, due to the competing demands on my Department's capital budget imposed by the need to prioritise available funding for the provision of essential school classroom accommodation, it is not possible at this point to provide an indicative timeframe for the provision of funding towards a PE hall for the school concerned. However I understand that the school concerned will continue to have access for PE purposes to a swimming pool, the rowing club and a local hall.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the future use of the remaining building, the Patron has advised that they have not formulated proposals for its future use, but consider that the buildings would be suitable for alternative education use.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I understand that a Steering Group has been established to support the amalgamation process.  It is understood that this Group has nominees of parents, teachers and members of the Boards of Management of both schools.

When state monies were provided to facilitate building works to school property owned by a third party, a legal mechanism had to be put in place in order to protect the State's interest. This was known as a Charging Lease or Declaration of Trust. These leases protect the Minister's capital investment in the school property and require that the property be used as a school for a set period.<\/p><p>As a result of negotiations in the late 1990's on the reconstitution of Boards of Management, an agreement was reached whereby patrons agreed to cede representatives on the Boards of Management in lieu of the Department agreeing to insert a Deed of Variation into the existing property lease. The Deed of Variation refers to a change in the terms of a charging lease or Declaration of Trust. The objective of this Deed of Variation is to provide security for the denominational ethos of a school in cases where a patron or trustee owns the property. Discussions have taken place with the relevant patron bodies over the years to obtain a mutually acceptable solution which meets this objective and these discussions are ongoing. <\/p><p>Section 15 of the Education Act, 1998 provides that a board of management shall manage the school on behalf of the patron and uphold, and be accountable to the patron for so upholding, the characteristic spirit of the school as determined by the cultural, educational, moral, religious, social, linguistic and spiritual values and traditions which inform and are characteristic of the objectives and conduct of the school.<\/p><p>In relation to school admissions, parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.<\/p><p>Schools are not permitted to discriminate against an applicant for admission on any of the grounds set out in the Equal Status Act, 2000.  However, the Equal Status Act provides that an educational establishment does not discriminate where the establishment is a school providing primary or post-primary education to students and the objective of the school is to provide education in an environment which promotes certain religious values, it admits persons of a particular religious denomination in preference to others or it refuses to admit as a student a person who is not of that denomination and, in the case of a refusal, it is proved that the refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school. Schools that comply with the requirements of the equality legislation do not therefore discriminate on religious grounds.<\/p><p>The recently published Education (Admission to Schools) Bill does not propose changes to the existing equality legislation. However, the Bill provides for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion while including provision for single sex schools and denominational schools to reflect, in their admission policy, the exemptions applicable to such schools under equality legislation.<\/p><p>The Bill also provides for schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the patronage determination process for new schools requires prospective patrons to commit to enrolling pupils from the area to be served by the new school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400105#WRSS03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staffing","counter":1896,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400105#WRSS03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1897,"qnumday":769,"qnumall":"[28495\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400105#WRSS03900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position in relation to the appointment of a third teacher to a school (details supplied) in County Mayo; if this request will be given serious consideration; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1074","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1898,"content":"<p>The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to primary schools is published annually on the website of the Department of Education and Skills.

","asker":"1182","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1907,"content":"<p>Since September 2012 at post primary level guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. Guidance is a whole school activity and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students. The Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations.  Guidance counsellors have two distinct functions. The first is general career guidance and guidance on the educational opportunities a child or young person might pursue, while the second involves support for students' well-being. The principal and leadership of a school have the best knowledge and experience to determine how exactly guidance resources and teaching resources should be allocated.<\/p>  <p>  The representative organisations for school principals and school management developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation. This approach puts a greater emphasis on group-work and class-based activity at senior cycle and maximises the amount of time available for those pupils that need one to one support.<\/p>  <p>  There are also a range of other supports available to promote and support the wellbeing of students. NEPS psychologists are available to offer their advice and support to schools in establishing and developing School Support Teams. The extension of the NEPS service to all mainstream schools since September 2013 also puts it in a good position to provide advice to the Teams in regard to students with particular difficulties and on onward referral or liaison with other community based services that also have a role in providing service to schools. Student Support Teams in Post-Primary Schools (DES 2014) is a NEPS booklet to promote the well-being of pupils in post-primary schools.<\/p>  <p>  Wellbeing Guidelines for Post-Primary and more recently for Primary Schools have been produced by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. The guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of current research. They provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour. <\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE, Health Promoting Schools Process. Information is also provided on how to access support from the SPHE Support Service and other external agencies and support services.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the proposals on the reform of the junior cycle envisage a new subject on \"wellbeing\" being studied by all pupils.<\/p>  <p>  I have repeatedly argued that improvements to the staffing and funding of our schools must be a priority as the economic recovery takes hold. The last Budget included an increase in spending on education for the first time in recent years, amounting to additional funding of &euro;60m during 2015. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400105#WRSS04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Eligibility","counter":1909,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400106#WRTT00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1910,"qnumday":773,"qnumall":"[28548\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400106#WRTT00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding an application by a person (details supplied) in County Louth under the Free School Transport Scheme; when a decision is expected; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1911,"content":"<p>Under the terms of my Department's School Transport Scheme, a child with special educational needs is eligible for transport if s\/he is attending the nearest recognised: mainstream school, special class\/special school or a unit, that is or can be resourced, to meet the child's special educational needs under my Department's criteria.<\/p><p>Children who are eligible for school transport, under the terms of this scheme, are exempt from paying an annual charge.<\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education through its network of Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) acts in an advisory role to my Department on the suitability of placements for children with special educational needs. <\/p><p>In this case, it has been reported that the school the child in question is attending is not the nearest school resourced to meet his educational needs and therefore he is not eligible for school transport to this school. <\/p><p>Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only, subject to a number of terms and conditions including the availability of spare seats on an existing service and the payment of the annual charge. <\/p><p>In this regard, the family should liaise with the local Bus &Eacute;ireann office at 042.6825999.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400106#WRTT00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1078"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Status","counter":1912,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400106#WRTT00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1913,"qnumday":774,"qnumall":"[28568\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015071400106#WRTT00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the current status of the review of the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools Scheme; the number and identity of stakeholders consulted in 2015 to date, and to be consulted; if the special conditions disadvantage in rural areas will be considered in the review; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1914,"content":"<p>The process I have recently commenced to renew the DEIS programme involves a number of strands including:-a consultation process with education partners, which commenced in April with a closing date of 22nd May 2015, to inform development of appropriate interventions to tackle educational disadvantage; -the establishment of an inter-Departmental Group to ensure a joined-up approach to future delivery of services in the DEIS programme; -the establishment of a Technical Group to develop criteria for a new identification process for which schools should participate in the DEIS programme; -the establishment of a DEIS Advisory Group within my Department.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the first strand I sought written submissions from approximately twenty education partners such as the Teaching Unions, Management Bodies, the National Parents Council and the Community and Voluntary Pillar.

The Circular explains that, while professional reports provide valuable assistance to education providers in identifying a diagnosis or identifying appropriate interventions, responsibility for deciding on the quantum of educational supports and resources to be allocated to schools to support pupils with special educational needs resides with the NCSE through the SENO.<\/p><p>Professional reports are provided to the NCSE as part of the application process through multiple channels including my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), Department of Health\/HSE practitioners as well as private practitioners.
