It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE has extensive information concerning Lyme disease on its website <i>www.hpsc.ie\/a-z\/vectorborne\/lymedisease\/. <\/i><\/p><p>Lyme borreliosis can be asymptomatic or have a range of clinical presentations.  Current best advice is that diagnosis should be made only after careful examination of the patient's clinical history, physical findings, laboratory evidence and exposure risk evaluation.  Exposure to ticks prior to disease manifestations is necessary for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis.  Since an awareness or recollection of a tick-bite is not always present, however, this should not exclude the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis.  Later stages require the use of antibody detection tests (or advanced DNA detection techniques).  Testing for Lyme Disease is provided routinely by all major, regional hospitals in Ireland.  In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient.  If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory Service of Public Health England in Porton Down facility which uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities.  This involves a screening serological test followed by a confirmatory serological test.  <\/p><p>Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, then management of patients can be undertaken by Infectious Disease consultants in our regional hospitals when intravenous antibiotics may be considered as a method of treatment.<\/p><p>There is no controlled evidence that viable <i>Borrelia burgdorferi <\/i>persists in patients with prolonged, subjective symptoms following confirmed Lyme disease.  Fatigue, pain and cognitive impairment are the primary complaints among patients who claim to be suffering long term effects.  However, these symptoms are very common in the general population, and the evidence does not show that they occur any more commonly in patients with a history of Lyme disease.  The diverse nature of these symptoms, which can have both physical and psychological causes, are shared by many conditions which has implications for both diagnostic and treatment services.  Misinformation concerning the long term effects of Lyme disease is causing real harm to people who seek inappropriate treatments for real conditions who are advised to seek information and advice from their family doctor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092800060#WRA05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Waiting Lists","counter":53,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092800060#WRA05200"},{"type":"question","counter":54,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[40900\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092800060#WRA05300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if additional resources will be provided to the HSE north east to reduce waiting lists for orthopaedic assessments and procedures in view of delays in counties Cavan and Monaghan accessing such services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":55,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that waiting times are often unacceptably long and I am conscious of the burden that this places on patients and their families.<\/p><p>Reducing waiting times for the longest waiting patients is one of this Government's key priorities.

Securing affordable access to existing and new medicines in a timely manner is a key objective of the Irish Health Service.  However, the challenge is delivering on this objective in an affordable and sustainable way in line with the resources allocated by the D&aacute;il and the relevant legislative provisions.  Expenditure on medicines represents one of the largest areas of expenditure across the health service and will continue to grow in the years ahead as our health service continues to meet the needs of our citizens.<\/p>  <p>Under the community pharmacy schemes over 70 million prescription items will be dispensed in 2017 at an estimated cost of approximately &euro;1.7 billion - taking account of fees and ingredient cost.  In addition, the HSE will spend in excess of &euro;0.5 billion on medicines in our hospitals, nursing homes and other settings.  Expenditure on the high tech scheme, the scheme through which the majority of new medicines are funded, has increased by over 80% since 2012, and will continue to increase significantly in 2018 as demand for existing treatments grows and new drugs are approved by the HSE.  Since 1 August 2016, the HSE advise that 36 new treatments have been made available to Irish patients.<\/p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are engaging in a number of initiatives which have lead and will continue to lead to better access to medicines for patients, value for the taxpayer and the cost- effective provision of medicines in Ireland.  Key initiatives include reference and generic substitution, under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, the four year Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines with IPHA, the Medicines Management Programme and National Drugs Management Programme within the HSE, and the development of a National Biosimilar Medicines Policy.  Ireland is also participating in a number of voluntary EU forums to explore possible areas for collaboration including price negotiations and joint procurement.<\/p>  <p>  However, access to medicines is not solely a funding issue.  A significant barrier to accessing new medicines is the price being sought by some manufacturers for their products.  The solution to increased access is multi-facetted and is not simply a matter of allocating more funding for medicines at the expense of other health or public services.  The health service must continue to seek better value and lower costs for both existing and new treatments.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drugs schemes, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  This Act gives full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decision on the reimbursement of medicines, taking account of expert opinion as appropriate.  There is also an increased level of engagement and commercial negotiations between the HSE and manufacturers in an effort to reduce the price to affordable levels.  So while this process is resource intensive, it is clear that as a result of such a robust and scientific process, Ireland is paying significantly less for medicines and the ability to invest is enhanced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092800061#WRB06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists Action Plans","counter":131,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092800061#WRB06600"},{"type":"question","counter":132,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[40780\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092800061#WRB06700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the scoliosis waiting list targets were missed; the steps he is taking to address the problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":133,"content":"<p>The HSE is actively implementing the action plan they developed to ensure that no child will be waiting over 4 months by year end and are focussed on maximising all available capacity both internally and externally to achieve this target.<\/p>  <p>  Additional nurses are now in post in both Crumlin and Temple Street.

During 2016, my Department convened a Cross-sectoral Steering Group to develop a national strategic framework for health workforce planning.  A consultation draft of the framework was completed in mid-2017 and was subject to a stakeholder consultation process over the summer.  Submissions received as part of this consultation process have been considered by the Steering Group and the draft Framework  has been updated accordingly.  I expect to receive the final version of the Framework shortly, accompanied by a high-level implementation plan. <\/p><p>It is Government policy to move to a consultant delivered service.  While there are difficulties in filling posts in certain specialties and locations,  the number of consultants employed in the public health system continues to increase year on year.  At the end of July 2017 there were 2,892 whole time equivalents, an increase of 105 compared with the end July 2016 number and an increase of over 700 in the past decade.  The HSE has been focused on addressing issues associated with the creation and approval of consultant posts and successful recruitment.  It is now giving effect to the report 'Towards Successful Consultant Recruitment, Appointment and Retention', completed in December 2016.  The number of NCHDs has also increased significantly given service demands and the need to progress compliance with the provisions of the European Working Time Directive. Similar to consultants, recruitment to certain specialties, e.g. surgery and paediatrics, is challenging.  At the end of July 2017 there were 5,962 whole time equivalent NCHDs, an increase of 178 compared with the end of July 2016 number and an increase of over 1,100 in the past decade. <\/p><p>Recruitment of nurses and midwives is a key priority this year.  The HSE has been focused on increasing nursing numbers over the past two years as the budgetary position has improved.  The number of nursing and midwifery staff stood at 36,278 in August 2017; this is an increase of 739 whole time equivalents in the past 12 months, notwithstanding intense global competition for our nurses and midwives.  The HSE has developed a fully funded workforce plan for an additional 1,224 nursing\/midwifery posts in 2017 as provided for in the agreement reached with the nursing unions last February on recruitment and retention.  These posts are being filled through a broad range of initiatives including the conversion of agency employed staff into HSE direct employees, national recruitment campaigns and offering all graduating nurses and midwives full time contracts.  Key measures to retain nursing and midwifery staff include the creation of new development specialist posts, a unified approach to recruitment across hospitals and offering nurses and midwives improved educational opportunities and career pathways. <\/p><p>The Report of the Public Service Pay Commission identified problems in recruitment and retention in specific and specialist groups that are internationally in demand particularly in the health sector Following the ratification of the Public Service Stability Agreement, the Commission will now carry out a more comprehensive examination of underlying difficulties in recruitment and retention in those sectors and employment streams where difficulties are clearly evident.  The Commission is committed to reporting on medical and nursing grades in 2018.

The Department of Health collates an annual report on the progress made by all Government Departments and their Agencies in implementing the Strategy, which is to be implemented on a cost neutral basis. The fourth progress report, for the period September 2015 to December 2016, was published earlier this year.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to respite, the report notes that &ldquo;Respite service needs are addressed on an individualised case by case basis and can include planned and emergency respite care options in the home, community and residential settings including services provided by non-statutory organisations.

The report points out that the 2016 HSE Annual Report confirms a reduction of over 4,000 respite overnights delivered. <\/p>  <p>  In the context of disability services, there are a number of factors impacting on capacity.  A significant number of respite beds have to be utilised where admission is unplanned leading to the number of available respite nights being down against planned activity.  In addition, within the regulatory and policy context, the manner in which residential and respite services is provided has also changed, as Agencies comply with regulatory standards.  Capacity has generally decreased with requirements for personal and appropriate space. In some situations beds are no longer available.  For instance, they may be vacated by residents who go home at weekends or for holidays and can no longer be used for respite.  Implementation of the national policy on congregated settings is also affecting available capacity.  <\/p>  <p>  In the HSE's Social Care Operational Plan for 2017, 6,320 people with a Disability are expected to avail of centre based respite services totalling 182,506 overnights.  Based on existing levels of service and in addition to the centre-based respite service, it&rsquo;s planned that between 2,000 and 2,500 persons will avail of respite services such as holiday respite or occasional respite with a host family.  It is also planned that based on existing levels of service, a further 41,100 day only respite sessions will be accessed by people with a disability.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE has been funded to provide 185 new emergency residential placements and new home support and in-home respite for 210 additional people who require emergency supports has been allocated.

If it is, the FSO writes to the financial services provider and requests confirmation of the status of the mortgage loan account by reference to the Examination. \u00a0Where it is confirmed by the financial services provider that a mortgage loan account is considered to be within the scope of the Examination, the FSO is of the view that the best way of ensuring that\u00a0he has all of the necessary information to deal with such complaints is to await the outcome of the Examination.  For this reason, the FSO considers it necessary to place these complaints on hold pending confirmation of the impact, if any, of the Examination on those mortgage loan accounts.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The FSO\u00a0does not have any oversight function with respect to the manner in which the financial services providers are conducting their Tracker Mortgage Examinations.  The Central Bank of Ireland has laid down the Framework for the Tracker Mortgage Examination and the phases for a Bank to complete including Central Bank assurances that must be completed as part of that process.<\/p>  <p>  I understand from the Central Bank that it invoked its powers under Section 22 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act to set specific timelines for lenders to complete Phase 2 (the &ldquo;Review Phase&rdquo;) of the Examination and in line with those timelines, the Bank expect the vast majority of impacted customers to be identified by lenders by end September 2017.  As the lenders&rsquo; reviews are subject to assurance work by the Central Bank, it is possible that additional impacted accounts may be identified after this date.\u00a0 The Central Bank has and continues to challenge lenders through a combination of bilateral engagements and on-site assurance work to ensure that this Review Phase is completed as quickly and accurately as possible.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has clearly articulated its expectations of lenders to provide appropriate redress and compensation to all impacted customers in line with prescribed principles for redress developed by the Central Bank.  The timeframes for progression of the redress and compensation programmes vary from lender to lender, however, the Central Bank remains focussed on challenging lenders to ensure that they are progressing redress and compensation and that impacted customers are treated fairly.  Some lenders have already commenced redress and compensation programmes and these programmes, along with the Central Bank&rsquo;s assurance work, will continue beyond September 2017 for some lenders. <\/p>  <p>  Lenders are also required to establish a dedicated unit to deal with any queries, complaints, and\/or concerns that customers may have during the course of the Examination.  The unit must continue to be available to deal with such queries, complaints and\/or concerns for at least 6 months after the four phases of the Examination have been completed and until all complaints have been adjudicated on.  The Central Bank will continue to engage with lenders in respect of the conduct of the Examination and will consider appropriate supervisory action, up to and including enforcement action, where necessary.  I understand that a further update on the Examination will\u00a0issue in October 2017. <\/p>  <p>  When the Examination is over in respect of each complainant, the FSO will resume their investigation of those complaints which complainants want to pursue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092800063#WRD02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services Ombudsman Administration","counter":222,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092800063#WRD02200"},{"type":"question","counter":223,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[41011\/17]  ","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092800063#WRD02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there have been technical issues with the Financial Services Ombudsman's online complaint submission process; if so, the issue; the length of time it lasted; the number of complaints that were delayed or lost as a result; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","counter":226,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092800063#WRD00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights","counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092800063#WRD00200"},{"type":"question","counter":226,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[41074\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092800063#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 141 of 20 September 2017, if the legal obligation to comply with the order in terms of rates of pay and so on only relates to the employer concerned; if there will be an obligation on the end user of the employee's services in which, for example, an agency is the employer but a building contractor is the end user of the employee's services; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":227,"content":"<p>Ireland has a robust suite of employment legislation which applies where an employer\/employee relationship exists.

As it was a Maltese incorporated company, the liquidation is being carried out under Maltese law.<\/p>  <p>  As you are aware, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment on 25 May 2017 and overturned the previous decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal that the Motor Insurers&rsquo; Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) is liable in respect of third party motor insurance claims made against the policyholders of Setanta Insurance.  The consequence of this is that the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) has been deemed responsible for the payment of such third party claims.<\/p>  <p>  As the judgment has been delivered, the process of making payments in accordance with the provisions of the Insurance Act, 1964, as amended, has commenced.  Payments can only be made out of the ICF, with the approval of the High Court and only if it appears to the High Court that it is unlikely that the claim can be met otherwise than from the ICF.  If satisfied, the High Court can order payments out of the ICF up to 65% (or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser) due to relevant claimants.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, an Order was granted in the High Court on Monday 24 July 2017 in relation to 324 claims which were subsequently paid by the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice.

In identifying the requirement for additional school places, my Department uses a Geographical Information System to identify the areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide. <\/p>  <p>  When it is decided that a new school is required to meet demographic needs in a school planning area, a patronage process is conducted to decide who will operate the school. Parental preferences for each patron from parents of children who reside in the school planning area are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process. <\/p>  <p>  All new schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand are required to enrol children from within the designated school planning area which the school was established to serve.  This does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the designated school planning area, rather it reflects the need to accommodate in the first instance the demographic for which the school was established.<\/p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  In schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to prioritise enrolment of children from particular areas or particular age groups or on the basis of some other criterion. For example, some schools give priority to applicants who have attended a particular primary school (known as a feeder school).  The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  However, it may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice.<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s priority is ensuring all pupils have access to a school place which unfortunately may not always result in a school place that is their first choice.

I am assured by the Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division.<\/p><p>Rathcoole Garda station forms part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) West Garda Division.  I am informed that on 31 August 2017 the total strength of the DMR West Garda Division was 664 with 15 assigned to Rathcoole Garda Station.  There are also 27 Garda Reserves and 47 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of the Division is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. <\/p><p>This plan is progressing well. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves. <\/p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner, that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that almost 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of which 118 were assigned to the DMR West Division.  I understand that another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to allow to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the DMR West Division, in the coming years.<\/p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.  <b><\/b><\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that as of the 31 August 2017, the latest date for which figures are available, the Garda strength of Rathcoole Station and the Garda Reserve strength of Clondalkin, Lucan, Ronanstown and Rathcoole Stations from January 2012 up to 2017 are as set out in the following tables:<\/p><p><b>Rathcoole Garda Station 2012-2017<\/b><table><tr><th>2012<\/th><th>27<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>25<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>23<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>22<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017*<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>*As of 31 August 2017<\/p><p><b>Garda Reserve Strength 2012 - 2017*<\/b><table><tr><th>Station<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Clondalkin<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Lucan<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ronanstown<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Rathcoole<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>*As of 31 August 2017<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092800064#WRE05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Status","counter":337,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092800065#WRF00300"},{"type":"question","counter":338,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[41129\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092800065#WRF00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding stamp 4 status in the case of a person (details supplied) who has been informed by their immigration officer that ministerial authorisation is required; if same can be arranged; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":339,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that an application for residence in this State as a family member of an EU citizen was submitted by the person concerned on 5 January 2015.

Not every person who seeks international protection in Ireland chooses to accept the offer of full board accommodation and of course many choose to live with colleagues, family or friends in communities across the country, as they are entitled to do. <\/p>  <p>  Those who accept the offer of accommodation are in turn offered a health screening check on arrival at the initial Reception Centre in Balseskin.\u00a0 These services are provided by the HSE and assessments as to individual vulnerabilities are made at this stage by the HSE team.\u00a0 This service is, by definition, made available by the HSE on a voluntary and strictly confidential basis.\u00a0 Screening covers Hepatitis, TB, HIV, immunisation status and any other ailments or conditions that the medical officers feel require further investigation and\/or treatment.\u00a0 In addition, arrangements are in place in various parts of the country to offer this service to those who do not avail of it in Dublin.\u00a0\u00a0 Figures supplied by the HSE show that approximately 84% of asylum seekers availed of health screening in 2015 while residing in the reception centre in Dublin.\u00a0 No figures are available in relation to those who subsequently availed of screening after being dispersed from the Reception Centre.<\/p>  <p>  While the Health Unit in RIA assists in the coordination of the provision of health services and communications with various stakeholders, RIA has no role in the provision of health services as this remains the sole responsibility of the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  Following on from this initial health screening, access to health services in Ireland thereafter for asylum seekers residing in State provided accommodation is 'mainstreamed' i.e. it is provided on the same basis as the general population.  Asylum seekers in State provided accommodation will also generally qualify for a medical card and an exemption from prescription charges.  They are then eligible to avail of a wide range of health services free of charge including GP services. They also have access to the Public Health Nursing System, social work services and Community Welfare services.  A dedicated asylum seeker psychological service operates in Balseskin Health Centre and the North Strand Health Centre. North Strand Road, Dublin 1.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla and the HSE link in with accommodation centres to provide on-site services and monitoring of children and families through Public Health Nurse and GP services, social work teams, mental health specialists and through the positive engagement of accommodation centre management teams.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Community Welfare Service of the Department of Social Protection holds clinics in many centres to assist families with needs which may fall to be assisted under the Exceptional Needs Payments. <\/p>  <p>  Children are linked in by local management to mainstream primary and post-primary schools in a like manner to the general population.  Younger children may also avail of the free ECCE pre-school placements.\u00a0 Homework clubs are provided at certain family centres.  The Department of Education has also made changes to allow children who are 5 years in the system and who have attended a minimum of five years in the Irish school system to avail of third level education.<\/p>  <p>  RIA has a dedicated Child and Family Services Unit, whose role is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all asylum seekers residing in State provided accommodation.\u00a0 It also acts as a conduit between RIA and Tusla, the latter having statutory functions in this area.\u00a0 The Unit is headed up by an official seconded from Tusla who has clinical expertise in the area of child welfare and protection.  <\/p>  <p>  The Child Protection\u00a0 and Welfare Policy and Practice Document in force in all accommodation centres is based on the HSE's &ldquo;Children First - National Guidelines for the protection and welfare of children.  The HSE and Tusla have provided 'Keeping Safe' child protection training and Designate Liaison Person Training (DLP) to each centre's Designated Liaison Persons and other staff members.  RIA has recently updated\u00a0its Child Protection Policy to include a Practice Document.

All staff of centres under contract to RIA are Garda vetted.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, those in the protection process have access to the same set of assessments as other persons resident in communities across the country and have the same rights to appeal decisions or make complaints through the relevant Departmental channels and through the relevant Ombudsmen where appropriate and necessary.

The only statutory scheme in place at present to support older people is the Nursing Home Support Scheme, commonly known as &lsquo;A Fair Deal&rsquo;, and there have been calls to extend this scheme to cover home care services.  However, the Government is committed to establishing a new separate statutory home care scheme along with a system of regulation for home care services.  The Department of Health is currently engaged in a detailed process to progress this. <\/p>  <p>  The statutory scheme for home care will introduce clear rules in relation to what services individuals are eligible for and how decisions are made on allocating services.  For that reason, developing a new statutory scheme will be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner for all those who need home care services.  It will also help to improve access to the home care services that people need, in an affordable and sustainable way.  The system of regulation for home care will help to ensure that the public can be confident that the services provided are of a high standard.     <\/p>  <p>  As an initial step, the Department commissioned the Health Research Board to undertake an evidence review of the home care systems that are in place in four other European countries.  This review, which was published on 11 April, will help us to learn from the experiences of other jurisdictions and will inform the debate and future consideration of approaches to formal home care financing and regulation here in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  I, along with Minister Harris, also launched a public consultation on home care on 6 July.  The purpose of this consultation is to allow all those who have views on this topic to have their say, including home care users, their families, and healthcare workers.  It will also allow us to find out what people think about current home care services as well as the public&rsquo;s views on what the future scheme should look like.  The deadline for submissions is 2 October, 2017.  A report of the findings of this consultation process will be published and the findings will be used by the Department in the development of the new home care scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The development of a regulatory and funding model for home care services is a complex undertaking.  While the public consultation and evidence review are important steps in the process of developing the new scheme, a significant amount of additional preparation needs to be carried out before final decisions are taken on the form of home care scheme and system of regulation.  This is required if the reforms are to be successful, affordable and sustainable.

A number of sources provide data on GPs working in Ireland at present.  The Medical Council collects and analyses data from the general, specialist and trainee specialist registers to produce valuable data on the GP workforce.  The HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service collects data on the number of GMS contract-holders and those GPs delivering state-funded primary care services.  The Irish College of General Practitioners also collects and analyses data on the GP workforce, including the number of doctors registered for professional competence and those holding membership of the ICGP.<\/p><p>As of 19 September 2017, there are 3,556 doctors on the Medical Council's Specialist Register in the Speciality of General Practice.  Holding registration does not, however, necessarily mean that a medical practitioner is active in general practice at the time.  In the last ten years, the number of GPs contracted by the HSE to provide services to medical card holders and GP visit card holders under the GMS scheme has increased. At the end of 2007 there were 2,129 GPs who held GMS contracts.  As of 1 September 2017, there are 2,496 GPs who hold GMS contracts.  Many GPs also hold contracts with the HSE to provide services under other state schemes, e.g. the Primary Childhood Immunisation Programme.  There are a further 437 GPs at 1 September 2017 without GMS contracts who hold other such contracts with the HSE, bringing the total number of GPs contracted by the HSE at present to 2,993.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to the continued development of GP capacity to ensure that patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.  Several efforts to increase the number of practising GPs have been undertaken in recent years.  These include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible\/shared GMS\/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, as well as the introduction of enhanced supports for rural GP practices.  These steps should help to address the future demand for GPs by enticing GPs who may have ceased practicing for family or other reasons back into the workforce, facilitating GPs to work past the standard retirement age and encouraging more GPs to work in rural areas.  Separately, the State is seeking to train more GPs to provide GP services to the population. In 2009, there were 120 GP training places and in 2017 there were 170 training places filled.

Forestry is also compatible with other agriculture schemes and farmers can continue to receive their Basic Payment on land which is also planted.<\/p>  <p>  It is important now that the benefits of the schemes are clearly communicated and well understood by landowners.  Minister of State\u00a0Andrew Doyle has established a group jointly with industry to specifically examine the marketing and promotion of the schemes and this group has met once already and will meet again next week.  This group will come forward with a series of initiatives in the very near future on communicating the benefits of forestry to farmers to ensure that landowners are considering forestry as\u00a0a viable land use option. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092800070#WRL03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Aid","counter":632,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092800070#WRL03100"},{"type":"question","counter":633,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[41201\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092800070#WRL03200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to the recent announcement by European Commissioner for Agriculture that countries worst affected by Brexit-related currency changes are invited to apply for EU state aid to help the agricultural sector, if Ireland has formally submitted an application to the European Commission in this regard; and if not, the reason therefor.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":634,"content":"<p>I am in regular contact with Commissioner Hogan and my European counterparts in relation to the threat posed by Brexit, and the currency related difficulties that have been and are continuing to be experienced.

During the first phase, of 12 months duration, the PA provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.  In addition to the two phases jobseekers may also undertake training while with the service and this may extend the period the jobseeker is supported through the service for up to a further 6 months.<\/p><p>It will therefore take time to accumulate a sufficient number of clients (who have completed their engagement period with the service) for complete and robust outcome data to be available.  With this in mind, it is intended that an econometric evaluation of the service will commence at the end of 2017.
