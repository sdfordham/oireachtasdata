In July, following consideration of proposals from hospitals to increase capacity, a further &euro;18 million was provided  to support the acute hospital system over the winter period by providing additional bed capacity and other initiatives to support access to care.  This additional funding included &euro;8 million capital funding which allows for renovation and reopening of wards, opening of additional acute beds, isolation rooms, rehabilitation beds and transitional care beds. <\/p>  <p>  There has been considerable capital investment in the upgrading and reconfiguration of Emergency Departments in recent years including:<\/p>  <p>  -  a new ED in Wexford General Hospital and St Luke's General Hospital  Kilkenny;<\/p>  <p>  -  a new ED and acute medical assessment unit in the Mater, which opened in 2013<\/p>  <p>  -  construction of a new ED underway in Limerick University Hospital, to be completed in 2016;<\/p>  <p>  -  newly refurbished and expanded adult ED and provision of a short stay observation unit in the paediatric ED at Tallaght;<\/p>  <p>  -  upgrade to South Tipperary General Hospital to provide additional treatment spaces;<\/p>  <p>  -  refurbishment of the ED at Our Lady's Hospital in Navan and<\/p>  <p>  -  refurbishment of the ED at Mullingar, providing improved facilities for care, to be finished in January 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Beaumont Hospital is also undertaking a feasibility study on the location, size and cost of building a new ED at the hospital and a report on this is expected shortly.

However where an involuntary patient is 'unable' or 'unwilling' to give consent, the programme may be administered if it has been approved by the Consultant Psychiatrist responsible for the care and treatment of the patient and also authorised by another Consultant Psychiatrist.<\/p>  <p>  The Mental Health Commission recently published 'The Administration of Electro-convulsive Therapy in Approved Centres Activity Report 2013'. The Commission noted that in 85.5 per cent of cases, ECT was administered with the consent of the person. The Commission also noted that there was an increase in the number of treatments that were administered without consent. However when the figures are examined further there was only one single case where both Consultant Psychiatrists agreed that ECT should be administered on the basis of the 'unwilling' criterion and the overwhelming majority were in the 'unable' to consent category.  The Mental Health Commission publishes rules regarding the administration of ECT  to involuntary patients and adherence to these rules is monitored on an annual basis by the Inspector of Mental Health Services.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that ECT is an individual -specific treatment prescribed by the treating consultant based on the assessment of the patient concerned. Within the profession, it is acknowledged that there exists a cohort of people with severe treatment-resistant depression for whom ECT appears to be the only treatment that offers any real possibility of improvement. This is also supported by NICE Guidelines in the UK and the World Health Organisation. It is also noted from the recent Mental Health Commission report that in over 90% of cases, the Consultant Psychiatrist reported that treatment of ECT resulted in the improvement of the health of the person concerned.<\/p>  <p>  I fully agree that where a person with capacity refuses ECT, this should be respected. To this end, I have prioritised a change to the existing legislation to remove the 'unwilling' criterion from Section 59 of the Mental Health Act 2001. I will shortly bring legislation before the House to bring about this priority amendment.  I have recently written to the Deputy with my proposals on amending the legislation and I appreciate the support  that the Deputy has indicated he will give to this short Bill. Subject to obtaining and securing adequate D&aacute;il time, I hope to make this amendment before the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300030#WRA02900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":44,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300030#WRA02950"},{"type":"question","counter":45,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[43007\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300030#WRA03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the plans that are in place to improve and develop services at Naas General Hospital in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":46,"content":"<p>Capital investment in Naas Hospital in recent years has provided a new Central Sterile Stores Department, Minor Injuries Unit,  Acute Medical Assessment Unit and an MRI service.

If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and my officials will follow the matter up.<\/p>  <p>  As I have previously indicated the safety of service users is of paramount importance and steps need to be taken to anticipate and avoid things going wrong and to reduce the impact if they do.  All employees including medical staff are required to disclose and report incidents in line with the HSE's Safety Incident Management Policy.  Creating a culture of open disclosure and learning from the things that go wrong is the bedrock of making systems safer.  Open Disclosure is defined as 'an open consistent approach to communicating with patients and their families when things go wrong in healthcare. This includes expressing regret for what has happened, keeping the patient informed, providing feedback on investigations and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the adverse event'.<\/p>  <p>  I recently announced that the Government has given its approval to the drafting of provisions to support open disclosure of patient safety incidents.  This will be included in the Department of Justice and Equality&rsquo;s draft Bill on Periodic Payment Orders which is well advanced.  The legislation is part of a broader package of reforms aimed at improving the experience of those who are affected by adverse events. <\/p>  <p>  This legislation builds on the joint development by the HSE and State Claims Agency of the National Policy on Open Disclosure (2013).  The HSE is progressing the implementation of the Policy across all health and social care services.  We all know that when error or harm is experienced by a patient, the trust and confidence of that patient and their family are compromised.  That is why honest, open disclosure and communication, which demonstrate empathy and sensitivity, are so essential.  The intent of this legislation is to provide certain legal protections for healthcare staff for open disclosure, which is undertaken in good faith and in compliance with national standards. This will give further support to those staff in their communications with patients and family members if an adverse event occurs.  The Ethical Code of Practice set out by the Medical Council also makes clear the responsibilities of doctors in relation to open disclosure.  <\/p>  <p>  Open disclosure is now HSE policy and therefore any unjustified breach of the policy (as with any HSE policy) will be managed in line with the HSE disciplinary procedures.  Where potential deviations have been identified the Healthcare records must be reviewed to ascertain any documentation in relation to communication with the patient about the adverse event and to establish if any rationale for non-disclosure has been documented.  Where there is no evidence that open disclosure has occurred the incident must be reviewed with the staff involved in the event.  The patient must be informed of the event and the impact of the event explained and acknowledged.  The patient should also be informed of the initial failure to disclose and an appropriate acknowledgement, explanation and apology provided. <\/p>  <p>  From a patient safety perspective the key focus of open disclosure is on learning so that systems and processes can be improved in order to reduce potential future harms to patients.  If a person is not satisfied that a health professional or administrator has fulfilled their obligations regarding open disclosure then that person has recourse to the HSE's complaints procedures. It is also open to a person to raise a complaint with the appropriate professional regulatory body or with the Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300031#WRB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":96,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300031#WRB01750"},{"type":"question","counter":97,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[42986\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300031#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the measures being put in place to boost services in arthritis and rheumatology for both adults and children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In Wexford, Mental Health Services are arranged by geographic location. There are General Adult Mental Health Teams based in Summerhill, Wexford (7-day service), Maryville, New Ross (5-day service), Carn House, Enniscorthy (7-day service) and Tara House, Gorey (7-day service).  <\/p><p>In addition, there is a Psychiatry of Old Age Team providing services for people aged 65 years and over. Also, the Rehabilitation Team works with internal referrals from the General Adult Teams for people with chronic and enduring mental health issues.<\/p><p>There are four day hospitals in County Wexford; three of which are open seven days per week (9am to 5pm). If someone is feeling suicidal, and wish to have a consultation, they can be referred through their General Practitioner to any of the four day hospitals and be seen by a Consultant Psychiatrist.  General Practitioners are familiar with the process for making such referrals.  If someone presents to the Emergency Department in Wexford General Hospital, who has not been referred through their General Practitioner, and is found to require a psychiatric assessment, then they are seen by a nurse-led liaison service (9am to 5pm Monday to Sunday) which will assess and triage, as appropriate. If the person is deemed to require admission for further assessment, diagnosis or treatment for a mental health illness, the liaison nurse makes contact with the Consultant on-call to make a referral and the person would be admitted to the Department of Psychiatry in University Hospital Waterford. If someone self-presents at the Emergency Department in Wexford General Hospital, and also requires medical attention, they would treated for their physical condition in the first instance. People who self-refer to the Emergency Department, Wexford General Hospital between 5pm to 9am, and who may require psychiatric assessment, will first be triaged by staff in that Emergency Department. <\/p><p>In line with the significant ring-fenced resources provided by this Government to prioritise and enhance mental health nationally, services in Wexford are being developed on an evolving basis, including the recruitment of additional appropriate staff to improve care provision. This has been underpinned, for example, by an overall budget allocation for Waterford\/Wexford Mental Health services which increased by over &euro;2m in 2015, from an allocation of just over &euro;39m in 2014 to slightly over &euro;41m this year. The Waterford\/Wexford  area received a total of 61 new development posts for mental health since 2012. I will ensure that, in common with other areas of the country, the mental health service in this  geographic area will improve over 2016, as part of  an overall package of new initiatives planned by the Government over the course of next year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300032#WRC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Accident and Emergency Departments","counter":115,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300032#WRC01100"},{"type":"question","counter":116,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[42714\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300032#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of his efforts to improve overcrowding challenges at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, County Louth; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1180","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":117,"content":"<p>Last December I convened the ED Taskforce to provide focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges presented by ED overcrowding.

Recruitment campaigns are underway in Ireland and abroad. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE Census returns for the end of October 2015 show that we have over 750 more nurses employed in the public health services than a year ago - 35,163 whole time equivalent's compared with 34,404 in October 2014. In July the HSE launched an International Staff Nurse\/Midwife Recruitment Campaign which focused on the UK to attract staff nurses and midwives to jobs in Ireland. The current relocation package is up to &euro;1500 in vouched removal\/relocation expenses including the cost of flights. At present there is no closing date for this campaign, as the HSE welcomes applications from nurses and midwives who are interested in joining the HSE from abroad on an ongoing basis.

There are 2 licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland (Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;<\/sup>).  Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme and over 100,000 girls have received this vaccine since its introduction. The vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers. Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.<\/p><p>Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>is a fully tested vaccine which was licensed by the European Medicines Agency in 2006.  No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmacovigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use.  The safety profile of Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised.The introduction of new vaccines is based on the expert advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC).  Decisions on the supply of vaccines into the market are undertaken by specific expert agencies rather than being the responsibility of the Minister of the day.  <\/p><p>The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recently completed a review of the HPV vaccine.  The review which the HPRA participated in, specifically focused on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome associated with heart rate increase.  The outcome of the review which was carried out by the EMA Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined.  <\/p><p>As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.  <\/p><p>As of the 27 November, the HPRA has received 936 reports of suspected adverse reactions or events notified in association with the use of HPV vaccines.  Of the 936 reports received, 933 were associated with use of Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>and three were associated with Cervarix<sup>&reg;<\/sup>.  The vast majority have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects for the vaccines, as described in the product information, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, malaise, headache, dizziness and injection site reactions.  Parents of any child with a suspected adverse reaction following administration of a vaccine are advised to contact the HSE vaccination teams or their general practitioner for advice and are referred for further management if required.<\/p><p>All vaccination information provided to parents is prepared from the available licensed documentation for each vaccine, the Summary of Products Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet. The information is presented in clear simple language and approved by the National Adult Literacy Agency so that it can be understood by all adults as the average reading age in Ireland is 12 years of age. <\/p><p>Prior to all school immunisation parents receive an information pack in a sealed package which contains an information leaflet, consent form and cover letter.  Information packs for all immunisation are standardised nationally.  The information booklets include information on the most common adverse events that can occur after each vaccination.  Parents are also given contact details for their local immunisation office and advised to speak to a member of the school immunisation team if they have any further questions. <\/p><p>Should parents require additional information about vaccines the immunisation leaflet refers to the HSE&rsquo;s national immunisation website () where further information is available.  The national immunisation website has been accredited by the World Health Organisation for credibility, content and good information practices.  The website allows members of the public to contact the National Immunisation Office to ask a question if they require further information.  These questions, when possible, are answered by the staff of the National Immunisation Office within one working day.<\/p><p>The EMA has advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines as there are no new safety concerns regarding HPV vaccines.  Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using the vaccines in accordance with the current product information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300032#WRC02500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":130,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300032#WRC02600"},{"type":"question","counter":131,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[42988\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300032#WRC02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the action that is being taken to address the unacceptable waiting times for surgical intervention to treat scoliosis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1188","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":132,"content":"<p>The Government is working to ensure that long waiting times for scoliosis surgery are reduced.

All professionals providing community-based services, including occupational therapists, physiotherapists, and public health nurses, will be aware of the prioritisation criteria and will provide any necessary and urgent items of equipment following appropriate assessment as soon as possible. However, the Health Service as a whole has to operate within the parameters of funding available to it, and this is a major challenge for all stakeholders, including the HSE, voluntary service providers, services users and their families.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to mobility equipment, occupational therapists carry out assessments and review applications in light of the individual&rsquo;s current and ongoing needs, with the priority being to provide functional mobility for indoor and short-distance outdoor use. Therefore the equipment recommended by the clinician will be appropriate to the needs of the individual. The provision of wheelchairs is not a demand-led service, and requests are prioritised according to need and according to resources. A client is prioritised according to clinical need. If the referral is for essential equipment, then it is deemed a P1 (high priority). If resources are available, equipment is sanctioned based on highest assessed prioritisation. Wheelchairs are issued based on client need and functional abilities rather than any specific waiting time.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has no plans at present to develop a register of wheelchair users. However, the National Physical and Sensory Disability Database (NPSDD), established in 2002, holds information to assist the Department of Health and the HSE in providing appropriate services designed to meet the changing needs of people with a physical or sensory disability. The NPSDD contains over 24,000 records of individuals using or requiring physical or sensory disability services. Information is collected on a voluntary basis and records the number of assisted mobility aids, including wheelchairs, used by people who are registered on the database.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300034#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services","counter":183,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300034#WRE00750"},{"type":"question","counter":184,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[42929\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300034#WRE00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the measures he has taken to attract a greater number of general practitioners to rural counties like Donegal, and how he will retain medical staff in this region; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":185,"content":"<p>The HSE, Department of Health and Irish Medical Organisation are currently engaged in a comprehensive review of the GMS and other publicly funded health sector contracts involving GPs.

While certain flexibilities had been built into the ECCE Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs was conscious for some time of the difficulty experienced by some children with a disability in accessing and benefitting fully from this Programme. With this in mind, he requested that an Inter-Departmental Group, led by his Department, be established with a brief to bring forward recommendations to address this issue. Representatives of my Department and the Health Service Executive participated on this Group.<\/p>  <p>  The Group has concluded its work and its recommendations have been fully accepted by Government. As part of Budget 2016, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs announced the necessary funding to implement the new model of supports for children with a disability with costs for these supports estimated to be &euro;15 million in 2016 and full year costs estimated to be &euro;33 million from 2017 onwards.<\/p>  <p>  The model of supports was launched on 18 November last by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with my full support and the support of my Government colleague Jan O'Sullivan T.D., Minister for Education and Skills. I believe that this Group has identified a practical, workable model for meeting the needs of children with a disability and the allocation of funding is clear evidence of the Government's commitment to supporting such children. The new model will provide supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.<\/p>  <p>  Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Building on additional investment in recent years, funding of &euro;8 million is being provided to the HSE in 2016 to expand, inter alia, the provision of speech and language therapy in primary care and the further development of early intervention therapy services under the Progressing Disabilities Programme. It is anticipated that the development of early intervention services in particular, as part of the roll-out of the new inclusive pre-school supports model, will help children with a disability to access mainstream pre-school settings.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that while the HSE has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to participate in the ECCE Programme, it has, to date, worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and where resources are available.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has asked the HSE for a report on the specific matter raised by the Deputy pertaining to pre-school children in County Meath.

These provisions are in respect of all financial instruments, including commodity derivatives, and have the purpose of providing regulators with tools to avoid excessive speculation in financial instruments, including commodity derivatives.<\/p>  <p>  Commodity futures are required to be cleared which improves the stability of commodity futures markets. Separately, under the European Markets Infrastructure Regulation\u00a0(EU 648\/2012), the Central Bank\u00a0has available to it data on transactions and positions of non-financial as well as financial counterparties engaged in commodities future markets, data which is held in various trade repositories.<\/p>  <p>  The MiFID II proposals complement initiatives taken in other financial services files such as Market Abuse Regulation and Benchmarks, and together they are are expected to result in a more robust regime for all commodity derivative markets, including food securities, whether traded OTC or through exchanges.

The Central Bank had briefed industry representatives\u00a0in August\u00a0that it was proposing significant increases in those\u00a0levies in 2015. The proposed increases were\u00a0driven by a proliferation of legislative regulation and corresponding regulatory activity; a need to meet a shortfall from 2014's levies;\u00a0and an increase in staff pension costs arising from Financial Reporting Standard 17 (which was coupled with\u00a0prevailing low yields on the bond market).<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank's original proposals have since been revised to partially mitigate those increases as per a statement of 30 September 2015 published on the Central Bank's website.

Returns for each year are due by 15 January of the following year, and the total value of DIRT due and paid is reported to the Revenue Commissioners on the January returns at institutional level.

It should also be noted that the reporting threshold was reduced from &euro;635 to &euro;300 from 2014 onwards.<\/p>  <p>  The number of interest bearing deposit accounts reported under the S891B regulations for 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 is 1.43 million, 1.23 million, 1.21 million and 1.32 million respectively.

BiaFoodInitiative have met <font color=\"#222222\">Tesco, who are providing equipment and some other support. <\/font>The Department of Social Protection has supported staffing of the hub and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has provided advice on carrying out the business safely and in compliance with the food regulations, as such organisations come under the definition of a food business in the general food law.

Using their app, or through their website, participating businesses can upload details of their surplus food and the time period in which the food can be collected.

By donating surplus food to various charities, businesses can assist charities to reduce their food costs and so allow them to redirect funding to programs to assist the disadvantaged, creating tangible and long lasting local benefits. Following a successful pilot programme, Tesco Ireland and FoodCloud last year announced a partnership that will see all surplus food from Tesco&rsquo;s 146 stores redistributed to charities and community groups through the use of FoodCloud&rsquo;s innovative app.  There is much to be said for promoting voluntary engagement by the industry with such initiatives before consideration by Government on whether legislation is appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300038#WRJ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme","counter":312,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300038#WRJ00750"},{"type":"question","counter":313,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[43353\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300038#WRJ00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if his Department will confirm whether all successful applicants for the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme 2 under the rural development programme 2014-20, which provides grants to farmers to build or improve a specified range of farm buildings and equipment on their holdings, will receive approval in early December 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"962","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":314,"content":"<p>There are six schemes involved\u00a0in the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme TAMS II.

This figure comprises 12,866 members, 978 reserve members, and 2,012 civilians as of 31 October. <\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to provide effective, visible policing throughout the country. The number of Garda&iacute; is crucial to this but, also of importance, is ensuring that the overall composition of the Garda workforce achieves the right balance between highly trained Garda&iacute; and professional, skilled civilian staff, and that the Service harnesses the energy and skills of volunteers through the Garda Reserve.<\/p>  <p>  The optimal number of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a factor of a number of different considerations, including population size and composition, crime trends, the level of civilianisation, etc. Having said that, the Government is committed to on-going seamless recruitment into the future and as the Deputy will be aware, provision has been made in Budget 2016 for the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year bringing to 1,150 the number of new Garda&iacute; that will be recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014. So far 295 of those new recruits are fully attested and are on the ground in communities nationwide. It is expected that a further 395 will attest by the end of 2016 which, taking account of projected retirements, will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark.  I expect recruitment to continue at or around the current levels for the next number of years having regard to factors such as the level of retirements in any one year.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to civilian staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, they are employed in a wide range of management, administrative, technical and operational roles where they make an invaluable contribution to the delivery of effective policing services throughout the country. The increased budget allocation for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2016, in addition to providing for the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute;, provides for the recruitment of additional civilian experts, in particular to develop the Garda ICT investment programme. Having regard to international experience, I believe that there is undoubtedly value in exploring the opportunities for increasing the ratio of civilians to Garda&iacute;, and for releasing Garda&iacute; from administrative and other positions to front-line duties. The process which is currently ongoing to civilianise border control functions at Dublin airport and the transfer of these responsibilities from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department is an excellent example of this.  Further work in this area will be progressed in conjunction with the Garda Commissioner in the context of the report of the Garda Inspectorate of its review under the Haddington Road Agreement. The terms of reference of that review include all aspects of the operation and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including the structure, organisation and staffing of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the deployment of members and civilian staff to relevant and appropriate roles.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the County Louth Division, I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the number of Garda&iacute; on the 31 October 2015, the latest dates for which figures are readily available, is 281 (including 10 newly attested Garda&iacute;) of which 104 are assigned to the Drogheda Garda District. There are also 42 Garda Reserves and 23 Civilians attached to that Division.  I have also been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the allocations of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored to ensure optimal use of Garda human resources.  This process is periodically reviewed in light of particular incidents of concern or challenges and it is in this context that the Commissioner has directed the allocation of an additional 27 Garda&iacute;, including two Sergeants, to the Louth Division as an interim measure.  These Garda&iacute; are being transferred on a temporary basis to support the work of the 283 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assigned to the Louth Division. <\/p>  <p>  I am further informed that the work of local Garda&iacute; in the Louth Division is augmented by a number of Garda national units which are assisting with covert and overt operations targeting prolific criminals and dissidents who reside within and outside this jurisdiction.\u00a0The Emergency Response Unit is actively deployed in the Division and is providing a presence in the vicinity of checkpoints which are being carried out by uniform personnel. Furthermore there is ongoing liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland under the auspices of an agreed Cross-Border Policing Strategy to continue the excellent levels of cooperation between both police services in addressing crime and terrorist activities in all its manifestations<\/p>  <p>  In addition to investing in renewing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Government has have invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units. So far this year the  Louth  Division has been allocated 12 new Garda cars as a result of this increased investment. The Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for a further &euro;46 million of investment in vehicles as well as an additional &euro;200 million for Information and Communications Technology which will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime. We are also investing in airborne surveillance.  Taken together, this step-change in investment in policing will ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300039#WRK02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Postal Codes","counter":367,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300039#WRK02150"},{"type":"question","counter":368,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[43247\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300039#WRK02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na uses the Eircode system when responding to a call out during its day to day operations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":369,"content":"<p>I have requested the information sought by the Deputy from the Garda Commissioner and I will write directly to him on receipt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300039#WRK02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Accommodation Refurbishment","counter":371,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300040#WRL00150"},{"type":"question","counter":372,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[43307\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300040#WRL00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 395 of 16 July 2015, the plans the Office of Public Works has to refurbish Roscommon Courthouse; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":373,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the Courts Service Act 1998 provides that management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions, including the provision of accommodation for court sittings.

This figure comprises 12,866 members, 978 reserve members, and 2,012 civilians as of 31 October. <\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to provide effective, visible policing throughout the country. The number of Garda&iacute; is crucial to this but, also of importance, is ensuring that the overall composition of the Garda workforce achieves the right balance between highly trained Garda&iacute; and professional, skilled civilian staff, and that the Service harnesses the energy and skills of volunteers through the Garda Reserve.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Garda numbers I am committed to on-going seamless recruitment into the future and as the Deputy will be aware, provision has been made in Budget 2016 for the recruitment of 600 new\u00a0Garda&iacute;\u00a0next year bringing to 1,150 the number of new\u00a0Garda&iacute;\u00a0that will be recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in\u00a0Templemore\u00a0in September 2014. So far 295 of those new recruits are fully attested and are on the ground in communities nationwide. It is expected that a further 395 will attest by the end of 2016 which, taking account of projected retirements, will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark. \u00a0I expect recruitment to continue at or around the current levels for the next number of years having regard to factors such as the level of retirements in any one year. In recent years there have been c. 300 retirements per year and this trend is expected to continue.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to civilian staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, they are employed in a wide range of management, administrative, technical and operational roles where they make an invaluable contribution to the delivery of effective policing services throughout the country. The increased budget allocation for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2016, in addition to providing for the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute;, provides for the recruitment of additional civilian experts, in particular to develop the Garda ICT investment programme. Having regard to international experience, I believe that there is undoubtedly value in exploring the opportunities for increasing the ratio of civilians to Garda&iacute;, and for releasing Garda&iacute; from administrative and other positions to front-line duties. The process which is currently ongoing to civilianise border control functions at Dublin airport and the transfer of these responsibilities from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department is an excellent example of this.  Further work in this area will be progressed in conjunction with the Garda Commissioner in the context of the report of the Garda Inspectorate of its review under the Haddington Road Agreement. The terms of reference of that review include all aspects of the operation and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including the structure, organisation and staffing of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the deployment of members and civilian staff to relevant and appropriate roles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300040#WRL01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sexual Offences Data","counter":386,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300040#WRL01250"},{"type":"question","counter":387,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[43346\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300040#WRL01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of convicted sex offenders who will be released in the next 12 months under the current remission system having completed their sentences; the number of these who have engaged in a treatment programme to date, who are scheduled for release within 12 months and who she anticipates will have participated in such a programme prior to release; the nature of the programmes concerned; and the qualifications and training of those who provide such programmes.","asker":"1177","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":388,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that the number of convicted sex offenders due for release between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2016 is 104.

This means, for example, that children born between 2 February 2011 and 30 June 2012 qualified for free pre-school from September 2015. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2016, it was announced that, from September 2016, children will be eligible to start free pre-school when they turn age 3, and can continue in free pre-school until they start primary school (once the child is not older than 5&frac12; years at the end of the relevant pre-school year i.e. end June). Until this date however, the current eligibility criteria and rules of the Programme will remain.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, children are entitled to one year free pre-school (i.e. 38 weeks during the academic year) under this Programme. As the first child mentioned by the Deputy  availed of this entitlement during the 2014\/5 programme year, no additional provision can be made for him. In addition, the second child mentioned by the Deputy is below the age range for eligibility for ECCE in the 2015\/2016 programme year but will qualify for the 2016\/17 programme year.<\/p>  <p>  This extension of free pre-school will increase the number of children benefiting from free pre-school from about 67,000 per annum, to 127,000 in a given programme year. Accommodating this increase requires a significant increase in capacity in the pre-school sector; pre-school services need time to consider and implement any needed infrastructural or service changes, and to put in place extra staff resources. The September 2016 implementation date was set to allow pre-school providers to put such measures in place.  <\/p>  <p>  It is appreciated that this does mean that a small cohort of children, including one of the children referred to by the Deputy, while continuing to avail of the 38 week entitlement to free pre-school currently provided under the ECCE programme, will not benefit from additional free pre-school provided under this new budgetary measure. However, should an earlier start date have been chosen, the likelihood is that there would not have been sufficient capacity in the sector to accommodate all children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300042#WRN00700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services Funding","counter":440,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300042#WRN00800"},{"type":"question","counter":441,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[43412\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300042#WRN00900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will augment the funding available to Kildare youth services, with particular reference to Leixlip youth project which has to meet demands in excess of the ordinary; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":442,"content":"<p>My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.

which may include respite in-patient services and which apply to adults with full or limited eligibility &ndash; are provided for under the Health (Amendment) Act 2005 and the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005, as amended. <\/p>  <p>  Children under the age of 18 are exempt from these charges. On  foot of the Deputy's question, I arranged for enquiries to be made regarding the issues raised and have ascertained that they relate to a young adult, rather than a child.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Act, long-stay charges for in-patient services only apply to the further provision of in-patient services to adults who have already received at least 30 days of in-patient services during the immediately preceding 12-month period. Accordingly, many respite episodes would not attract any charge.  Those receiving ongoing acute care as well as those being supported under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme are excluded from these charges.<\/p>  <p>  The Regulations provide for two different classes of income-based charges in respect of the maintenance element of the in-patient services provided:<\/p>  <p>  - Class 1 relates to charges for those receiving in-patient services on premises where 24-hour nursing care is provided, subject to a current maximum of &euro;175 per week for a person whose income is &euro;208 or more, and<\/p>  <p>  - Class 2 charges apply where 24-hour nursing care is not provided, subject to a current maximum of &euro;130 per week for a person whose income is &euro;194 or more. <\/p>  <p>  Affordability and the avoidance of financial hardship are built-in features of the charging provisions under the 2005 Act and Regulations:<\/p>  <p>  - Firstly, the Act caps the amount which may be charged &ndash; at 80% of the non-contributory State Pension weekly rate.  At present, that means an upper limit of &euro;175.20 per week.<\/p>  <p>  - Secondly, the charges are structured to ensure that those paying them retain a reasonable income for personal use: at least &euro;33 per week for those paying Class 1 rates and at least &euro;64 per week for those paying Class 2 rates.<\/p>  <p>  - Thirdly, the Act provides that the HSE may reduce or waive a charge imposed on a person if necessary to avoid undue financial hardship. <\/p>  <p>  To assist in the fair application of the provisions of the 2005 Act and Regulations, the HSE has developed national guidelines for the determination of long-stay charges for in-patient services. These include the need to have regard to the individual circumstances of each service user and his or her dependants. The guidelines ensure that the applicable charge is determined taking account of each person&rsquo;s income and necessary outgoings while receiving care, including reasonable regular financial commitments. This avoids any unfair burden on the service user or his or her dependants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300042#WRN01600","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":449,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300042#WRN01700"},{"type":"question","counter":450,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[42998\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300042#WRN01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the measures being taken to address the long waiting times for an outpatient appointment at University Hospital Limerick; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1059","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":451,"content":"<p>The University of Limerick Hospitals Group is committed to reducing waiting times for out-patient appointments, not only in University Hospital Limerick, but across the Hospital Group. An Outpatient Lead has been appointed to oversee the management of the waiting list, and improvements in waiting time performance are being achieved.  <\/p>  <p>  The Group achieved the maximum permissible waiting time of 18 months by 30 June 2015, and is on target to achieve the maximum permissible waiting time for an outpatient appointment of 15 months by year end. To this end, a series of measures are being put in place. Firstly, waiting lists have been validated to ensure accuracy. In addition, an exercise is underway to ensure that all appointment slots are being used appropriately, and contact is made with patients in advance of their appointment in an effort to minimise the number of people who do not attend.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Specialties have been identified where additional measures are required to achieve waiting time improvement. In specialties such as ENT and Orthopaedics, arrangements are in place to refer patients, as appropriate, to private facilities. Additional clinics have been put in place across the Group in certain specialties such as Ophthalmology, Orthopaedics and Neurology. A locum Consultant Neurologist has been employed for 2 weeks to facilitate additional clinics in that specialty.<\/p>  <p>  Looking ahead, the University of Limerick Hospitals Group is centralising the process for the management of all new outpatient referrals. Work to streamline the service and deliver on shorter patient wait times, is already well underway, and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300042#WRN01900","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Support Services","counter":452,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300042#WRN02000"},{"type":"question","counter":453,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[43203\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300042#WRN02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide funding in 2016 for the construction of a new Holy Angels day care facility in County Carlow to replace the outdated prefabricated facility which is home to the support services of mental and physically disabled children.","asker":"968","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":454,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[43204\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300042#WRN02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status on locating a new respite house, T&iacute;r na n&Oacute;g, for the Holy Angels day care facility in County Carlow.","asker":"968","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":455,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 and 160 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy's questions relate to service matters, I have arranged for the questions to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.

The amount payable in respect of certain of these supports is related to the doctor's panel size.  In addition, medical indemnity insurance premia are refunded to contracted GPs, also based on the size of each doctor's GMS patient panel.  The HSE pays into a superannuation scheme a sum equivalent to 10% of total capitation fees payable to contracted GPs.<\/p>  <p>  The most recently published Statistical Analysis of Claims and Payments of the HSE's Primary Care Reimbursement Service relates to the year 2013.  This report indicates that payments totalling &euro;451.7 million were made to some 2,400 GMS contract holders.  In total these costs related to approximately 1.9 million GMS patients.  There was substantial variation in the average amount paid, ranging from &euro;14,753 for a patient panel of up to 100 patients to &euro;448,960 for a panel of 2,001 or more patients.  The addition of substantially more contract-holding GPs would enhance the choice available to patients in the first place but any impact on the Exchequer would be dependent on the distribution of the eligible patients across the panels of contracting doctors.

The objective of the Redress Board was to provide compensation to women who were former patients of Dr Michael Neary, who had unnecessary obstetric hysterectomies and also to women under 40 years of age who had unnecessary bilateral oophorectomies, i.e. the removal of both ovaries or a remaining single functioning ovary at the time of obstetric hysterectomy, or as a gynaecological procedure.  In each case the surgical procedure would have led to early menopause.  The Redress Board determined that awards were payable in 119 cases. <\/p>  <p>  Following on from this, the Lourdes Hospital Payment Scheme was set up in November 2013 in keeping with a commitment in the Programme for Government to make awards to women over 40 who had a bilateral oophorectomy, or removal of a single functioning ovary, but whose applications were rejected on age grounds alone by the Redress Board.  To date 45 awards have been made with a small number of applications awaiting final determination.  Thirty seven applications were refused under this latter Scheme, because they did not meet the criteria for awards and another 9 applications were withdrawn. <\/p>  <p>  The criteria for eligibility under both Schemes were very clear and unfortunately the person who has requested consideration of her case did not meet the criteria for either Scheme.  The total gross cost of both Schemes to date is &euro;23.4m.  With contributions from indemnifiers of &euro;7.7m, the net cost to the Exchequer is therefore &euro;15.7m.   <\/p>  <p>  I met with Patient Focus during Summer 2015 concerning a small number of women who were represented by Patient Focus, who did not meet the criteria to receive awards under either of the schemes.  Following this meeting my officials carefully considered this matter.  Having looked at the cases in question, and the broad range of conditions detailed, despite being sympathetic to the plight of the women, I do not propose to seek approval from Government to establish a further Redress Scheme.  It is of course, open to any woman to seek redress or compensation in the normal way should her legal adviser determine she has a case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300043#WRO02800","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Records","counter":494,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300043#WRO02900"},{"type":"question","counter":495,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[43238\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300043#WRO03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Cork will be provided with medical records, as requested; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":496,"content":"<p>I have asked the Health Service Executive to reply to the Deputy directly on this operational matter.<\/p><p>If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, he can contact my Private Office and the matter will be followed up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300043#WRO03100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service Data","counter":498,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300044#WRP00150"},{"type":"question","counter":499,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[43246\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300044#WRP00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the ambulance service is currently using the Eircode system when responding to call-outs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, it should be noted that the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.  <\/p>  <p>  Following the publication of a National Disability Authority report commissioned by the Department of Health and the HSE, a major emphasis is being placed on reconfiguring children&rsquo;s disability services into integrated multi-disciplinary geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams under the HSE&rsquo;s Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme.  The key objective of this Programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities, including autism, and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to, or the nature of the individual child&rsquo;s difficulties.  In 2014 an additional &euro;4 million was specifically allocated to drive implementation of the Programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts.  A further additional &euro;4m (equating to &euro;6m in a full year) has been allocated to the Programme this year to support its ongoing implementation.  <\/p>  <p>  Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Funding is being provided in 2016 to expand the provision of speech and language therapy in primary care and to support the reorganisation and expansion of speech and language and other therapies under the Progressing Disability Services Programme.  Full implementation of the Programme is expected before the end of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Within this context, I have asked the HSE to provide the Deputy with the detailed operational information he has requested.

There is an international nursing and medical manpower shortage, leading to difficulties in recruiting nurses, doctors and consultants.  This difficulty is being experienced by other English speaking countries including the UK, Australia, and Canada.  Added to this these countries compete for our graduates.<\/p>  <p>  Given the challenging economic position since 2008 and the need to reduce the public sector pay bill it is difficult to compete with other countries on pay.  However, we have now moved from a time of retrenchment with the moratorium on public sector recruitment and pay reductions to a time of recovery and building for the future.  With a recovering economy, the HSE is now in a position to offer a wide range of career opportunities to medical professionals.  Pay reductions are also being reversed under the Lansdowne Road Agreement and take home pay improved as taxation levels are reduced.<\/p>  <p>  It is also necessary to support training and career structures.  The MacCraith Group was established in 2013 to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structures.  The Group made a series of recommendations in its three reports aimed at improving the retention of medical graduates in the public health system and importantly, planning for future service needs.  The implementation of the Group's recommendations is being actively pursued and monitored. <\/p>  <p>  In July the HSE launched an International Staff Nurse\/Midwife Recruitment Campaign which focused on the UK to attract staff nurses and midwives to jobs in Ireland.  The current relocation package is up to &euro;1500 in vouched removal\/relocation expenses including the cost of flights.

In order to achieve a more balanced health service the vast majority of patients and clients who require urgent or planned care should be managed within primary and community-based settings.  This must be achieved while ensuring that services are cost-effective, safe and of the highest quality, and also well-integrated and aligned with relevant specialist services.  Significant steps have already been taken to extend the range of services provided in the primary care setting as well as, in the current year, extending universal access to GP care without fees to all children aged up to five years of age and all adults aged 70 or over.<\/p>  <p>  Primary care teams and networks located on the same site in a Primary Care Centre or in very close proximity in convenient, accessible, locations offer individuals and families the opportunity to avail of &lsquo;one stop shop&rsquo; primary care services and a greater range of health and social services in one location.  They also afford team and network members increased access to colleagues and the opportunity to work in a more integrated way.  The HSE is continuing the delivery of Primary Care Centres (PCCs).  To date, there are 90 Primary Care Centres in operation, 47 of which have opened since 2011.  These Primary Care Centres complement the existing network of smaller Health Centres around the country and a variety of privately-owned GP and primary care premises which are used to facilitate delivery of publicly-funded care to patients.  The next phase of the programme is to deliver an additional 52 Centres over the next three years as follows:<\/p>  <p> - Under the Public Private Partnership method, the contract for the provision of 14 PCCs has been awarded and it is expected that construction work will commence before the end of 2015, with the centres expected to be completed in 2017.<\/p>  <p> - Under the Operational Lease method, in November 2014, the HSE advertised an additional 73 locations for delivery of Primary Care Centres by Operational Lease.  The HSE is at an advanced stage of negotiation with developers in 24 new locations where Agreements for Lease have been entered into.<\/p>  <p> - Through the Exchequer Funded\/Direct Build method, there are currently 14 additional locations where construction is underway or the centres are at advanced planning stage.<\/p>  <p>  The range of services provided through primary care centres varies according to local circumstances, which include the needs of the community served.  Amongst the core services concerned are primary care team services such as those of general practitioners and their practice staff, general nursing, public health nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and social work.  A wide range of other services are provided in these settings and may include child health developmental clinics, dental care, dietetics, community ophthalmology, podiatry, psychology, maternity\/paediatric outreach services, adult and child\/adolescent mental health services, psychiatry of old age services and  counselling and addiction services.  Primary care centres can also support other public services and communities generally by having meeting facilities that facilitate cross-sectoral working and support to a range of community-based organisations. <\/p>  <p>  Enhancements of service which are being implemented and which already enable patients to receive specific elements of care in the primary care rather than the hospital setting include:<\/p>  <p> - the appointment of Integrated Diabetes Nurse Specialists who support diabetics in the management of their condition;<\/p>  <p> - the recent commencement of a diabetic Cycle of Care for GMS patients whose doctor deems them suitable for this service;<\/p>  <p> - the provision, for children aged under six and who are diagnosed with asthma, of periodic checks to assist in the management of the condition;<\/p>  <p> - the provision of diagnostic radiological services in some PCCs, with access being further enhanced in 2015 with the provision of prioritised access to diagnostic ultrasound services via an external provider at six locations nationally, providing in excess of 16,000 scans per annum;<\/p>  <p> - the commencement in 2015 of new minor surgery services in 20 primary care locations.  In a full year it is estimated that 10,000 procedures can be provided in the primary care rather than hospital setting.<\/p>  <p>  There is potential for further expansion of the range of care provided on a multidisciplinary basis in primary care and the current negotiations on a review of the GMS GP contract will include consideration of such matters.<\/p>  <p>  There are now ten primary care-led community intervention teams in operation.  These focus on both hospital and admission avoidance and also in facilitating early discharge of patients from hospital.  Areas currently served are Dublin North, Dublin South, Kildare, Louth, Meath, Wicklow, Carlow\/Kilkenny, Midwest (Limerick, North Tipperary, Clare), Cork and Galway.  A new CIT service will be commence in Waterford in the coming weeks.  Many of the CITs operate from PCCs and liaise closely with health professionals based at these centres.  At any one time, there are over 200 patients in receipt of CIT services in the community who would ordinarily have been in hospital.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt but that the developments in primary care which I have outlined above are strengthening the capacity of this sector to meet the healthcare needs of our growing and ageing population.  It is of course important to view these advances as merited in their own right and not primarily a response to or a solution to the pressures experienced in the acute hospital services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300047#WRS03300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services","counter":625,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300048#WRT00300"},{"type":"question","counter":626,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[43436\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300048#WRT00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which out-of-hour services, particularly at weekends, remain available or need to be augmented; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":627,"content":"<p>General Practitioners contracted under the General Medical Services Scheme must make suitable arrangements to enable contact to be made with them (or a locum\/deputy) for emergencies outside normal practice hours.

The average price of an item dispensed on the GMS scheme has reduced to below the price paid in 2002, while the average item price dispensed under the DPS and LTI schemes is now below the price paid in 2000.<\/p>  <p>  However, expenditure on high tech medicines increased from &euro;315 million to &euro;485 million between 2009 and 2014.  This increase is due to the introduction of highly expensive new medicines and the increased use of existing medicines.<\/p>  <p>  The reductions achieved to date are due to a sustained and ongoing programme of initiatives, which includes the implementation of price reduction Agreements with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (now the Irish Generics Medicines Association).  Cumulative savings and cost avoidance generated between 2006 and 2014 amount to approximately &euro;1.5 billion.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing, as provided for by the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, has also contributed to the reductions in the cost of medicines.  The prices of reference priced products are generally of the order of 70-80% lower than the prices paid when medicines were on patent.  On the date of introduction of the 2013 Act, the HSE was reimbursing in excess of &euro;22 million per month on medicines reference priced in 2014.  By December 2014, this had reduced to &euro;10.3 million due to the combination of reference pricing, increases in generic utilisation and generic price reductions prior to reference prices.  Reference pricing delivered savings of over &euro;47 million in 2014, and is expected to generate in excess of &euro;25 million in additional savings in 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300049#WRU00700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":665,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300049#WRU00750"},{"type":"question","counter":666,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[43449\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300049#WRU00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is aware of the case of a person (details supplied) in County Meath, who has been given a waiting period of 12 months after diagnosis for treatment to begin; if this case will be reviewed, given its urgency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1202","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":667,"content":"<p>The Deputy's questions relate to service delivery matters and accordingly I have asked the HSE to respond directly to her.<\/p><p>If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300049#WRU00900","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":669,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300049#WRU01000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":668,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300049#WRU00950"},{"type":"question","counter":669,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[43381\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300049#WRU01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of the situation of an Irish citizen (details supplied) detained in Egypt; the recent actions he has taken regarding this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":670,"content":"<p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has a clear strategy in this case which is focused on achieving a positive outcome at the earliest time possible for this citizen.

The approach taken is sometimes described as a \"college of professionals\" approach. In the first instance, a group of people who are deemed to have an expert knowledge of what the students in the target audience ought to be able to achieve in the subject concerned reach a consensus regarding the content standards of the syllabus.  This is achieved through the various committees in the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).<\/p>  <p>  Following on this, these content standards are then put into effect as a set of performance standards by the State Examinations Commission (SEC).  Once these performance standards have been tested, reviewed and fully established, the SEC, in accordance with its Establishment Order, then endeavours to ensure that the standards remain consistent over time.<\/p>  <p>  As part of its remit the SEC is charged with maintaining standards year on year and it endeavours to achieve this by the processes it has in place for the preparation of examination papers and other test items, and by the quality assurance procedures it implements at the examining and appeal stages of the state examinations.<\/p>  <p>  All of the SEC's examinations are prepared in accordance with the principles outlined in the document,  The Preparation of Test Items &ndash; Principles and Protocol, available on its website at www.examinations.ie.  Similarly, all examinations are assessed in accordance with the key assessment principles of validity and reliability.<\/p>  <p>  In order to maintain standards, the Chief Examiner for each examination takes all necessary steps to ensure that the examination paper, the marking scheme and its application combine to ensure that established standard are maintained.<\/p>  <p>  Standards of achievement of large cohorts of students do not radically change in the space of a year.  A certain amount of variation from year to year may happen, and a gradual change in the pattern of grades may occur over time, provided the subject experts involved are satisfied that it reflects real changes in achievement.  Furthermore, syllabus change and other deliberate interventions may impact on grade patterns, as may changes to the size or composition of the cohort.<\/p>  <p>  The examinations are marked by examiners, (generally experienced teachers in the subject), who work under the overall direction and management of the Chief Examiner for the subject. Examiners normally mark scripts from a number of schools.  Examiners do not know either the region or the schools from which the papers they mark are drawn.  They have sight only of examination centre numbers and candidate numbers, thus maintaining the anonymity of the system.  There are no 'quotas' applied to the number of grades, including E, F and NG, coming from any examination centre or indeed from the overall batch of scripts allocated to any examiner or the cohort generally.<\/p>  <p>  The marking process is overseen by a team consisting of the Chief Examiner, a Chief Advising Examiner and a number of Advising Examiners, who monitor and advise the examiners in their work.  The Chief Examiner and the advisory team test the draft marking scheme at a two day pre-conference.  During the pre-conference, the draft marking scheme is also considered in the light of commentary and correspondence from teachers, professional bodies and other interested parties, before being applied to exemplars of candidates' work.<\/p>  <p>  All examiners attend at a training conference prior to commencing the marking. The training process involves the use of exemplars of candidates' work both for standardising purposes and for purposes of training examiners in the consistent application of the marking scheme.  Random sampling is conducted in the early stages of the marking which serves to assist in the appropriate adjustment, clarification and refinement of the marking scheme as well as an initial quality assurance on the work of examiners.  If the grade distribution differs substantially from the established norm, this is interrogated to determine the underlying factors and where appropriate adjustments may be made to the marking scheme before the full marking process executes.  Once the marking scheme has been finalised, the marking proceeds, subject to rigorous ongoing monitoring of the process.<\/p>  <p>  Ongoing and systematic monitoring is a critical element of the marking process. The monitoring is designed to enable each examiner to apply the agreed marking scheme consistently and accurately to all scripts.  A minimum of 5% of the scripts, marked by each examiner, is monitored by Advising Examiners during the course of the marking.  As a consequence of this examiners who are found to be off-standard are required to remark all scripts that had been marked to that point. This may result in grade changes.  Advising Examiners are also available to the examiners for consultation and advice throughout the marking period.<\/p>  <p>  The marking schemes in each Leaving Certificate subject are published shortly after the issue of the examination results and in advance of the viewing of their scripts by candidates.  These are issued to all schools and are available to download from the SEC's website.  The Junior Certificate marking schemes are published on the website.<\/p>  <p>  A formal appeals process is provided by the State Examinations Commission.  It is open to every candidate to appeal the result awarded in any particular subject.  The appeals system involves a sophisticated combination of measures. Candidates are provided with the option to view the marked scripts and are also provided with the facility to comment on the marking through a dedicated form. Appealed scripts are re-marked in accordance with the same standard as applied in the initial marking, and the same marking scheme as utilised in the initial marking.  Candidates may also view the appealed script after the appeal marking.<\/p>  <p>  Quality assurance measures are in place at each stage of the appeal process to ensure that the marking scheme is applied fairly to the work of each candidate. If a candidate is still dissatisfied with the result after the appeals marking has concluded, he\/she has recourse to a review by the Independent Appeals Scrutineers and beyond that to the Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300049#WRU02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations Exemptions","counter":691,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300050#WRV00200"},{"type":"question","counter":692,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[43237\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120300050#WRV00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will extend the exemption for students who fail an examination by a slim margin and who are entitled to a spelling and grammatical exemption to honours mathematics students, given the potential limitations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1202","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":693,"content":"<p>The State Examinations Commission (SEC) operates a scheme of Reasonable Accommodations for candidates with special needs in the Junior and Leaving Certificate examinations.

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally.  The staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 2015\/16 school year are set out in Department Circular 0005\/2015 which is available on my Department's website.<\/p>  <p>  The circular sets out the improvements to the staffing schedule for the 2015\/16 school year for small schools.  These improvements are improved retention thresholds for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th classroom teacher and also the improved appointment and retention thresholds for one-teacher schools situated 8km or more from the nearest school of the same type of patronage and\/or language of instruction.<\/p>  <p>  This package of measures will provide rural communities with security about the future of their small schools, recognising the essential social function which small schools can play, especially in isolated communities.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I have announced a 1 point improvement to the primary staffing schedule in the context of Budget 2016.

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.<\/p><p>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services.

This map is available at . The areas marked BLUE represent those areas that will have access to commercial high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>The AMBER areas show the target areas for the State intervention.
