The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support, which is set out in my Department's Circular 0030\/2014.  <\/p><p>Circular 0030\/2014 clarifies the purpose of the SNA scheme which is to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  The circular is based on recommendations contained in my Department's Value for Money and Policy Review of the SNA scheme and also the National Council for Special Education Policy Advice on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools.<\/p><p>Both reports concluded that the SNA scheme has been highly successful in supporting the care needs of children with special needs in schools, and with assisting to facilitate their integration and inclusion. However, the reports also concluded that the intended purpose of the scheme was not always generally well understood by parents or schools and that the scope and purpose of the scheme should be clarified for schools.  In developing both of these policy review papers my Department and the NCSE consulted widely with education partners and stakeholders, including parents of children with special educational needs. <\/p><p>Circular 0030\/2014 sets out the policy of allocating SNA support for a newly enrolling Junior Infant who has clear and obvious need for such support e.g. a child who has a significant additional care need arising from an intellectual, sensory or physical disability.  <\/p><p>For those children where it is not yet clear whether difficulties will manifest in a classroom environment, the Circular states that, in general, it is expected that all primary school pupils having their first school experience will have been enrolled and will have commenced attending school before any application for SNA support will be made.

The challenge for all schools is to ensure that they utilise their allocated resources to best effect to maximise teaching and learning outcomes.<\/p><p>On the capital side, the Government recently announced a very significant investment of more than &euro;4 billion in capital funding for education projects over the next six years. This will fund the construction of additional school places at primary level to address demographic demand, the refurbishment of schools in older buildings, the replacement of prefabs with permanent accommodation and investment in IT and wireless broadband capacity in schools. <\/p><p>In relation the specific areas mentioned by the Deputy:<\/p><p>1. Restoring teachers' pay and conditions including newly qualified teachers<\/p><p>Since the beginning of the financial crisis, there has been a need to enact a number of measures to reduce public expenditure. The previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable of all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011 and required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale. <\/p><p>Subsequently, following the public service-wide review of allowances and premium payments, the Government decided to withdraw or modify allowances for new beneficiary public servants with effect from 1 February 2012. Under this decision, certain allowances were withdrawn for new beneficiary teachers, including qualification allowances. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.<\/p><p>Alleviation of the salary imbalance between those who entered the public service since 2011 and those who entered before that date began under the Haddington Road Agreement. Improved pay scales for post-1 January 2011 and post-1 February 2012 entrants to teaching were agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement. In addition, allowances payable to post-1 January 2011 entrants and such allowances as remain payable to post-1 February 2012 entrants were restored to pre-2011 levels.<\/p><p>The Lansdowne Road Agreement has, through salary increases and a reduction in the Pension-Related Deduction, begun the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years. The issue of equalised pay scales was not one which could be resolved in the discussions which lead to the Agreement. However, the flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement will be proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers. The LRA proposals have been accepted by the INTO and are currently under consideration by the post-primary teacher unions, ASTI and TUI.<\/p><p>In addition, in order to address concerns about the casualisation of employment in the teaching profession, my Department recently implemented the seven key recommendations of the Expert Group on Fixed-term and Part-time Employment in Teaching, which was established under the HRA. This will enable newly qualified teachers who are on fixed-term contracts to acquire permanent positions more easily and quickly and part-time teachers to gain additional hours.<\/p><p>2. Reducing class sizes<\/p><p>In addressing the INTO Congress earlier this year, I made clear that I personally believe that improving class sizes could deliver better outcomes, and that reducing class sizes will be a personal and political priority for me during 2015.<\/p><p>3. Reversing cuts to the DEIS Scheme<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that I have recently begun a process to review the DEIS Programme. This work will be ongoing during the current school year and I will consider all issues pertaining to educational disadvantage in all areas. I hope to be in a position to make an overall proposal for the delivery of future interventions to tackle educational disadvantage after that. As I have previously announced, I do not intend to make any changes to the current programme, including any additionality to it, while the review is underway.<\/p><p>4. Special needs education<\/p><p>In July of this year, I announced that that up to 610 additional Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts would be made available for allocation to schools from September 2015. This decision reflects the Government's commitment to ensure that every child with an assessed care need has access to a SNA. The additional 610 posts being provided means that a total of 11,940 SNA posts are now available for the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to allocate to primary, post primary, and special schools. The number of SNA posts available for schools has risen by almost 13% during the lifetime of this Government, having risen from 10,575 posts in 2011 to 11,940 posts available for the 2015\/16 school year.<\/p><p>In May of this year, I also announced that the NCSE would increase its allocation of Resource Teacher Posts to schools by over 9% for the start of the coming school year. The NCSE allocated 6,454 resource teacher posts to schools for September 2015, which is an increase of 554 posts (or 9.4%) since September 2014 and a total increase of 1,169 posts (or 22%) since September 2013. It is therefore clear that not only has there not been a reduction in the overall number of resource teaching posts and hours being allocated to schools, but that there has been a very significant increase in the overall allocation to schools in recent years.<\/p><p>The NCSE is also in the process of finalising a second round allocation process to respond to late enrolments, or from diagnosed disabilities emerging after the closing date for the first allocation round, to the start of the new school year. <\/p><p>Even in the constrained economic circumstances we have faced in recent years, we have been able to continue to meet the needs of children with special educational needs attending our schools. This year we have again increased the number of Resource Teachers which will be allocated to schools, keeping pace with both demographic growth and increased demand.<\/p><p>The NCSE has recommended that a new model be developed for allocating resource teachers to schools. My Department has devised a pilot of the new model which is taking place in a number of schools during the 2015\/16 school year. In taking the decision to conduct a pilot of the new model, I have been guided by the advice of the NCSE Working Group report, which recommended sufficient time be allowed for consultation before the new model is implemented. I therefore do not propose to amend the existing allocation process, pending the completion of the pilot project and the introduction of a new allocation model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600053#WRA04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pupil-Teacher Ratio","counter":64,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600053#WRA04450"},{"type":"question","counter":65,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[33948\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600053#WRA04500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her plans to reduce class sizes to the European Union average; the measures she plans to put in place to address this problem; when these measures will commence; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":66,"content":"<p>Average class size and the ratio of teachers to students are two important measures of the resources that we make available to schools.

","asker":"1003","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":175,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 187 and 233 together. <\/p><p>Rent supplement plays a vital role in housing families and individuals with the scheme supporting approximately 65,000 people at a cost of &euro;298 million in 2015.  The provision for 2015 represents a transfer of funding in excess of &euro;20 million to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to support the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).<\/p><p>Details of rent supplement recipients and expenditure each year since 2012 is provided in the attached tabular statement.  This information is not available on a monthly basis.  Rent supplement is a demand led scheme and the expenditure on the scheme has reduced each year since 2012 in line with the reduction in recipient numbers and changes to the scheme. <\/p><p>The two local authority sponsored schemes; the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) and the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) have contributed to the gradual decline in rent supplement numbers.  The improvement in the economy and the reduction in the live register are also key factors in the reduction in numbers on the scheme.<\/p><p>It is a condition of rent supplement that a person must have been residing in private rented accommodation or accommodation for homeless persons or an institution (or any combination of these) for a period of 183 days within the preceding 12 months of the date of claim for rent supplement. A person may also qualify for rent supplement where an assessment of housing need has been carried out and the person is deemed by a housing authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support. <\/p><p>In all other cases, a person who wishes to apply for rent supplement is referred, in the first instance, for an assessment of eligibility for social housing support by the housing authority. Only when the person has been assessed as being eligible for and in need of social housing support does the person become eligible for consideration for rent supplement.  There is no entitlement to rent supplement pending the completion of this assessment. <\/p><p>It is the Department&rsquo;s policy that an assessment of eligibility for social housing support should generally be carried out by the relevant local housing authority in the area where a claim to rent supplement is made and the person intends to reside.  This ensures that the relevant local authorities are made aware of and can take responsibility for the long-term housing needs of rent supplement tenants living within their administrative area.  This reflects both the responsibility of local authorities in providing long-term housing supports and the temporary income support nature of rent supplement. Without this measure rent supplement recipients would be unknown to their respective local authority, where they currently reside, with the potential that they may lose out on an offer for social housing. <\/p><p>In view of the reduction in supply in the private rented market the Department has put measures in place to provide for increased flexibility under the rent supplement scheme where there is a threat of homelessness or loss of a tenancy.  If the Deputy has details of a particular case where a person&rsquo;s ongoing entitlement to rent supplement was delayed due to a change of address across a local authority area in the Dublin area, the details should be provided to the Department for review. <\/p><p>It should also be noted that the conditions for rent supplement have changed following the introduction of HAP which is in place in South Dublin County Council.  In local authority  areas where HAP is in place, new applicants assessed as requiring social housing support will be considered for HAP rather than rent supplement.  <\/p><p>Policy in relation to persons remaining on housing lists is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p><p><b>Tabular Statement <\/b><\/p><p><b>Table 1: Rent Supplement:  Recipient Numbers &amp;amp; Expenditure: 2012 to Present<\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Recipients<\/th><th>Cost &euro;000<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>87,684<\/td><td>422,536<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>79,788<\/td><td>372,909<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>71,533<\/td><td>338,347<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>67,016<\/td><td>298,415 1<\/td><\/tr><\/table>1Approved Expenditure provision for 2015<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600054#WRB04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Guardian's Payment Appeals","counter":176,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600054#WRB04350"},{"type":"question","counter":177,"qnumday":188,"qnumall":"[34231\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600054#WRB04400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will review the case of a person (details supplied) who her Department has informed that the person is no longer entitled to the guardian's payment; if her Department will provide the person with a copy of the full file; and if she will ensure the matter is investigated fully","asker":"1003","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":178,"content":"<p>Based on the evidence available, the Deciding Officer decided that the person concerned was not entitled to guardian&rsquo;s payment (non- contributory) in respect of her granddaughter, who was over 18 years of age and not certified as having been in full time education at a recognised school or college for the period from 5th June 2009 to 9th June 2011, resulting in an overpayment. <\/p>  <p>  It was also decided that the person concerned was not entitled to the rate of guardian&rsquo;s payment (non- contributory) in payment during the period 2005 to 2008 as her granddaughter was in employment during that time, resulting in a further overpayment.

The Department will continue to work with stakeholders in planning the longer term needs of jobseekers and other customers.  I remain committed to ensuring the ongoing recognition and support of the strong social inclusion and community benefits that accrue from these schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600055#WRC05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Allowance Appeals","counter":240,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600055#WRC05300"},{"type":"question","counter":241,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[34402\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600055#WRC05400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will examine and expedite an appeal in respect of a jobseeker's allowance by a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":242,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that a Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 29<sup><\/sup>September 2015, who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.

The first payment will be made by her selected payment method on 21 October 2015. <\/p>  <p>  Arrears of payment due will issue as soon as possible once any necessary adjustment is calculated and applied in respect of any overlapping payments or in respect of outstanding overpayments (if applicable).<\/p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 263 to 265, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  Rent-a-room relief is provided for in section 216A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. Under section 216A, sums arising to an individual in respect of the letting of a room or rooms as residential accommodation in his or her home and from meals or other services supplied in connection with the letting are exempt from income tax where they are below the annual limit for the tax year in question (&euro;12,000 for 2015) and certain other conditions are satisfied.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the relief is to increase the supply of rental accommodation by incentivising homeowners to rent out rooms in their principal primary residences to individuals on a residential basis, that is where an individual is effectively using the room either on its own or in conjunction with other parts of the residence, as their home. It is not, and never was, intended to apply to income arising from the provision of guest accommodation to occasional visitors.<\/p>  <p>  Having regard to both the express policy intent of the legislation and the construction of section 216A, the Revenue Commissioners\u00a0have consistently taken the view that the relief does not apply in respect of income from the provision of accommodation to occasional visitors for short periods or where rooms are let for business use or guest accommodation. This position is clearly stated in Chapter 7.1.32 of Revenue's Income Tax, Capital Gains Tax and Corporation Tax Manual, which is available on www.revenue.ie. The manual was updated in February 2015 to reflect the fact that I had increased the annual limit for the relief from &euro;10,000 to &euro;12,000 for 2015 and, in that context, Revenue took the opportunity, in the light of media comments, to emphasise that the exclusion of short term guest accommodation applies equally where such accommodation is provided through an online accommodation booking site such as AirBnB.<\/p>  <p>  Any question relating to the charging of income tax is a matter for Revenue. In this regard, the Commissioners advise that property owners who receive income from the provision of occasional guest accommodation (including from AirBnB lettings) should make a return of their taxable profits to Revenue and pay the resultant income tax, if any, under self-assessment rules in the normal manner depending on their circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  Under self-assessment rules, an individual in receipt of income from any source is obliged to notify Revenue of the income in question so that the amount of any tax due can be determined. Individuals who pay their tax through the self-assessed income tax system (mainly the self-employed), who are referred to as 'chargeable persons', will generally submit an annual tax return of their income from all sources, make a self-assessment of their tax liability and pay any tax due.<\/p>  <p>  An individual who, in a tax year, has both PAYE and non-PAYE income is not regarded as a chargeable person for self-assessment purposes providing the net non-PAYE income does not exceed &euro;3,174 for the year. The easiest way for such individuals to declare any taxable income from AirBnB or similar lettings, is by completing an eForm12 which is available on www.revenue.ie.<\/p>  <p>  A self-assessed individual who received income from lettings in 2014 should include the income on their 2014 Form 11, which should be submitted by 31 October 2015, or 12 November 2015 if payment and filing is made electronically through ROS. The deadline for submission of an eForm12 for 2014 is 31 October 2015.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A taxpayer who is dissatisfied with a determination by Revenue in respect of a claim for a tax relief has a right of appeal to the independent Appeal Commissioners and to the Courts.<\/p>  <p>  The Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 imposes an obligation on an agent (such as AirBnB) who is in receipt of rent or other payments arising from a premises to provide the following information to Revenue:<\/p>  <p>  -  The name and address of the hosts\/landlords;<\/p>  <p>  -  Details of rent or other payments received; and<\/p>  <p>  -  The address of the premises being leased.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue will use this information as part of its overall programme of identifying compliance risk and targeting its interventions and resources towards those areas of greatest risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600055#WRC06100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Applications","counter":250,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600056#WRD00200"},{"type":"question","counter":251,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[34440\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600056#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will facilitate an increase in rent allowance to a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":252,"content":"<p>The client concerned has been requested to provide the Department with landlord proof of ownership for his rental property.

The bar was abolished in 1973.<\/p>  <p>  Where such employees were in the public service, they paid a modified rate of PRSI.  These contributions provided no cover for the State pension and, accordingly, the marriage bar would not have impacted on State pension entitlement.  It may, however, have impacted upon their eventual entitlement to a Public Service pension which is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension contributory (SPC) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or caring for incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for the maximum rate of SPC.  However, it is important to note that the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions must also be satisfied.  These require a person to enter insurable employment at least ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the appropriate rate (credited contributions do not satisfy this condition) and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions paid or credited on their record.  A yearly average of 48 or more is required to qualify for a maximum rate SPC.<\/p>  <p>  It is not the case that someone with at least 10 years (520 weeks) of reckonable contributions, paid after an earlier period working in the public service, would be denied a State pension because of that earlier employment.  Such pensioners would still have a yearly average above the 10 contributions required to qualify for the SPC.  It is probable, however, that they would have a reduced rate of SPC entitlement, as a result of the years during their working life when they were not making full-rate PRSI contributions, and it may be that they would qualify for a higher rate of payment under an alternative scheme, unless they had significant means.<\/p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a maximum rate State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory) which has a maximum personal rate of &euro;219, or just over 95% of the maximum rate of the contributory pension.  Alternatively, if a person&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a SPC, they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;206.30, which is just less than 90% of the maximum personal rate of the SPC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600056#WRD03800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Applications","counter":287,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600056#WRD03900"},{"type":"question","counter":288,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[34588\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600056#WRD04000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a claim for a Disability Allowance by a person (details supplied) in County Tipperary will be assessed as a priority; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Following\u00a0enactment, different parts of the 2012\u00a0Act have been commenced in tranches at different times. This approach was taken, as the Department is cognisant of the fact that credit unions needed time to implement all aspects of the 2012 Act and so has informed the timeline for implementation of the various measures on different dates. <\/p>  <p>  I have not yet signed a commencement order for the remaining sections of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 which covers the following areas: reserves; liquidity; lending; investments; savings; borrowing; systems, controls and reporting arrangements; and services exempt from additional services requirements.<\/p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that the draft regulations set out in\u00a0Consultation Paper 88 (CP88), will be introduced\u00a0at end December 2015. \u00a0It is my intention to commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act on 31 December 2015 in line with the introduction of the regulations.\u00a0 These sections of the 2012 Act, when commenced, will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the 1997 Act. <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of the new sections into the 1997 Act by the 2012 Act will, in effect, remove some of the requirements (including limits) that currently exist in certain sections and will provide regulation making powers to the Central Bank. The new sections will also contain a number of new requirements.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My role as Minister for Finance is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions. <\/p>  <p>  The Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank\u00a0is the independent regulator for credit unions.\u00a0 Within her independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members. <\/p>  <p>  While it is important to distinguish this division of roles,\u00a0it is equally important to recognise that both the Registrar of Credit Unions and myself, as Minister for Finance are working together for the safety of members' savings and the security of the credit union sector. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>The regulations introduce a maximum individual member's savings limit of &euro;100,000 which will ensure the protection of members' savings   and continue to ensure that credit unions' funding is sufficiently diversified and is not dependent on a small number of members.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Following consultation with the credit union sector and representative bodies, the Central Bank amended the transitional arrangement for the savings regulations to provide for credit unions that have individual member savings in excess of &euro;100,000 at the commencement of the regulations to apply to the Central Bank to retain these savings where they can demonstrate that it is appropriate and prudent for them to do so. <\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the Central Bank's feedback statement on CP88, as part of the consultation process I proposed that in the interests of clarity and fairness, credit unions are provided with details of the process of applying for a retention of savings above the limit amount.\u00a0 I have been informed by the Registry of Credit Unions that all credit unions have been contacted giving further information on its application criteria for the retention of savings in excess of &euro;100,000.\u00a0 The Registry of Credit Unions intends to engage with the representative bodies and to invite comments from them prior to finalisation of the application process. When the application process is finalised, the Registry will provide an application form and explanatory notes in order to assist credit unions. It is anticipated that application forms will be available during December 2015.\u00a0 It is envisaged that applications will be accepted in the first quarter of 2016 and that applicant credit unions will be informed by the end of the second quarter of 2016 on the outcome of the process, which is well within the 12 month transitional period. Where a credit union has demonstrated that it meets the criteria, it will be in a position to retain members' savings in excess of &euro;100,000 held at the commencement of the regulations. <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the steps that have been taken to provide clarity for credit unions on the criteria for the retention of savings over &euro;100,000 and also welcome the proposed engagement with the representative bodies to seek their comments on the application process.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also informed me that it is committed to undertaking a review of the continued appropriateness of the savings limit, once the impact of the restructuring process can be assessed. It is envisaged that this review will commence within three years of the introduction of the regulations.

At that time I undertook to bring your concerns regarding this issue to the Central Bank\u00a0and accordingly my Department wrote to the Central Bank on 13th July. In that letter, the Central Bank was asked to revert to you directly in response and also to provide my office with the details of the matter. I understand that\u00a0the Central Bank wrote to you on this issue on 28th July and they have informed me that their position has not changed since then. The Central Bank have said, in relation to mortgage holders who are not in arrears converting from tracker rates to standard variable rates, that they do not collect data series on this topic. However, they did draw attention to their Economic Letter on Mortgage Interest Rate Types in Ireland and, in particular, a point in time study of one cohort of loans entered into as tracker loans by covered banks. It showed that 4 per cent of them had converted to fixed rates or variable rates since inception. <\/p>  <p>Furthermore, on the topic of tracker-mortgage related issues,\u00a0it is worth noting that on 30th   September permanent tsb announced that the PTSB Group had established a Mortgage Product Review Group (MPRG)\u00a0to review the bank's mortgage product suite and to establish if there are any instances where the contractual terms and conditions attached to mortgage accounts are not being fully honoured by the bank and\/or whether other material issues such as the provision of key information at relevant times require further examination.<\/p>  <p>  As you will be aware, this follows the identification earlier in the summer of over 1,300 mortgage customers at PTSB and Springboard Mortgages who, following an investigation by the Central Bank of Ireland, were found in particular circumstances to have lost a contractual right to be offered a tracker rate mortgage. This led to a Mortgage Redress Programme announced in late July through which impacted customer accounts are now being\u00a0returned to the correct position and the bank is paying compensation to the relevant customer accounts holders.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the considerable work undertaken to ensure consumers are appropriately protected, the Central Bank has informed me that they remain concerned that there may be other tracker-related issues which could be impacting on consumers across the system. In this regard, they are currently engaging closely with a number of lenders on points of concern relating to their ability to demonstrate that they have acted in the best interests of their tracker mortgage customers, with a number of lenders currently undertaking their own internal reviews. The Central Bank has also been engaging with consumer groups as well as the Financial Services Ombudsman to help inform their future work. On 2 October, the Central Bank announced that they had decided that a broader examination of tracker-related issues covering, among other things, transparency of communications with and contractual rights of tracker mortgage borrowers, was warranted. The Central Bank has commenced this examination. I also understand that they have written to lenders notifying them of this.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to mortgage holders who are facing repayment difficulties, as you are aware,\u00a0the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA)\u00a0provides protections for borrowers in these circumstances. The lender may offer the borrower an alternative repayment arrangement which requires the borrower to change from an existing tracker mortgage to another mortgage type, if the proposed alternative repayment arrangement satisfies the following conditions: all other options, which would retain the tracker rate, have been considered to be unsustainable; it is affordable for the borrower; and it is a long-term sustainable solution which is consistent with Central Bank of Ireland policy on sustainability. In addition, the CCMA requires lenders to explain in the offer letter the reasons the alternative arrangement offered is considered to be appropriate and sustainable as well as the advantages and any disadvantages or potential disadvantages of any arrangement offered, with regard to the individual circumstances of the borrower. Furthermore, and importantly, lenders must engage with the Central Bank on any proposal to avail of provision 46 of the CCMA. This means there are further strong protections in place. The Central Bank has indicated that to date no lender has engaged with it on developing any such products. This was also confirmed in the outcome of the Central Bank's recently published report on its themed inspection on compliance with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears. During this inspection all lenders confirmed that, as a matter of policy, they do not require, and have not required, borrowers to move from a tracker mortgage rate to a more unfavourable rate during the lifetime of the mortgage. If the Deputy is aware of any\u00a0banks that may\u00a0have acted improperly, he should bring them to the attention of the Central Bank. While it does not investigate individual consumer complaints, it does welcome information from consumers of financial products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600057#WRE04800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":367,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600057#WRE04900"},{"type":"question","counter":368,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[34338\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600057#WRE05000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding the rent-a-room scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":369,"content":"<p>Section 216A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for the rent-a-room scheme.

Under section 216A, sums arising to an individual in respect of the letting of a room or rooms as residential accommodation in his or her home and from meals or other services supplied in connection with the letting are exempt from income tax where they are below the annual limit for the tax year in question (&euro;12,000 for 2015) and certain other conditions are satisfied.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the relief is to increase the supply of rental accommodation by incentivising homeowners to rent out rooms in their principal primary residences to individuals on a residential basis, that is where an individual is effectively using the room either on its own or in conjunction with other parts of the residence, as their home. It is not, and never was, intended to apply to income arising from the provision of guest accommodation to occasional visitors.<\/p>  <p>  Having regard to both the express policy intent of the legislation and the construction of section 216A, the Revenue Commissioners\u00a0have consistently taken the view that the relief does not apply in respect of income from the provision of accommodation to occasional visitors for short periods or where rooms are let for business use or guest accommodation. This position is clearly stated in Chapter 7.1.32 of Revenue's Income Tax, Capital Gains Tax and Corporation Tax Manual, which is available on www.revenue.ie. The manual was updated in February 2015 to reflect the fact that I had increased the annual limit for the relief from &euro;10,000 to &euro;12,000 for 2015 and, in that context, Revenue took the opportunity, in the light of media comments, to emphasise that the exclusion of short term guest accommodation applies equally where such accommodation is provided through an online accommodation booking site such as AirBnB.<\/p>  <p>  Any question relating to the charging of income tax is a matter for Revenue. In this regard, the Commissioners advise that property owners who receive income from the provision of occasional guest accommodation (including from AirBnB lettings) should make a return of their taxable profits to Revenue and pay the resultant income tax, if any, under self-assessment rules in the normal manner depending on their circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  Under self-assessment rules, an individual in receipt of income from any source is obliged to notify Revenue of the income in question so that the amount of any tax due can be determined.

The threshold was initially set at &euro;5 million, which was subsequently reduced to &euro;2.3 million in 2010 and further reduced in Budget 2014 and Finance (No 2) Act 2013 to &euro;2 million with effect from 1 January 2014.  <\/p>  <p>  Information on the numbers and values of individual pension funds or on individual accrued benefits in pension schemes are not generally required to be supplied to either the Revenue Commissioners or to my Department by the administrators of pension schemes and personal pension arrangements.  The estimate of the yield of &euro;120 million in 2014 and in a full year arising from the changes to the SFT regime introduced in Finance (No 2) Act 2013 was arrived at following considerable internal work over a period by my Department involving, among other things, data gathering and consultation with private sector sources relating to the specific changes to be made.  There is no readily available underlying data or methodology on which to base reliable estimates of the savings that would arise from further changes to the SFT of the scale envisaged in the questions.  <\/p>  <p>  I should explain that the valuation factors to be used for establishing the capital value of defined benefit (DB) pension rights at the point of retirement for SFT purposes, and which accrue after 1 January 2014, were changed by Finance (No 2) Act 2013 from the previous single factor of 20 to a range of higher age-related valuation factors that vary with the individual's age at the point at which the pension rights are drawn down.  The higher factors range from 37 for defined benefit pension entitlements drawn down at age 50 or under to a factor of 22 for pensions drawn down at age 70 or over.  <\/p>  <p>  This change was introduced in response to the major criticism levelled at the \u00a0SFT regime that the fixed rate conversion factor of 20:1 used up to 1 January 2014 was inequitable relative to defined contribution pension arrangements, given the higher market annuity rates that those with defined contribution (DC) arrangements could face if they were to purchase annuities.  The move to higher age-related factors that vary according to the individual's age at the point the benefits are drawn down will substantially improve the equity between DC and DB arrangements and as between those who retire at younger ages and those who retire later in life.    <\/p>  <p>  Based on legal advice regarding the protection of pension rights, the higher valuation factors apply to DB pension entitlements accruing after 1 January 2014.  The impact of the higher valuation factors on the SFT regime for DB scheme members will depend on a number of things including,\u00a0for example, the choices made by affected individuals about their continued accrual of pension entitlements (where that choice is available) and the age at which they decide to draw down their pension entitlements.  Since my Department or the Revenue Commissioners can have no information on these choices or on the accrued pension entitlements of such individuals as at 1 January 2014, or indeed generally, I am not in a position to provide the costing requested in the question about the application of post 1 January 2014 conversion factors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600058#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":393,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600058#WRF00750"},{"type":"question","counter":394,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[34491\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600058#WRF00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the residential properties and development land in the ownership of the banks, of which the State is a shareholder; if he will detail the availability of both categories by county; the steps taken to use these assets to alleviate the housing emergency; and the timescales for the delivery of these steps and plans.","asker":"1080","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":395,"content":"<p>As the deputy may be aware, the three Irish banks in which the state is a shareholder do not seek to hold on to property assets for any substantial period of time.

As outlined in response to Parliamentary Questions No.s' 346 and 347 of 22 September 2015, a process of de-listing must occur to remove a person or entity from the sanctioned list and only at that point can frozen funds be released.\u00a0 In this circumstance, Ireland remains ready to respond speedily to any amending EU Regulations that may take into account a de-listing.   <\/p>  <p>   It should be noted that financial restrictive measures do not involve a change in ownership of the frozen funds and economic resources; as the resources remain in the ownership of the designated person or entity, they are not available for 'release'. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600058#WRF01400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry","counter":403,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600058#WRF01450"},{"type":"question","counter":404,"qnumday":274,"qnumall":"[34533\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600058#WRF01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the discussions that have taken place between his Department, the Central Bank of Ireland, the regulatory authority and the Professional Insurance Brokers Association regarding the planned increase in levies payable by insurance broker intermediaries.","asker":"1190","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":405,"content":"<p>Every year, in order to cover the costs of financial regulation, the Central Bank prescribes levies to be paid by entities subject to such regulation.

It requires organisations to focus on the range of skills they need to deliver on their objectives and to identify emerging skills gaps, whether arising from staff turnover or from changes in the external environment which may require new skillsets.\u00a0 Workforce planning, therefore, assists\u00a0public bodies\u00a0to \u00a0identify the number of staff and the skills and experience required\u00a0and provides the basis on which planned and structured recruitment campaigns can be initiated which\u00a0are likely to\u00a0help re-balance over time the age profile\u00a0across the public sector.<\/p>  <p>  The age profile of applicants\u00a0from\u00a0recent open competitions run by the Public Appointments Service for the grades of Clerical Officer, Executive Officer, Administrative Officer and Principal Officer and the recently announced graduate recruitment campaign will help to improve the demographic profile of the civil and public service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600059#WRG04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Status","counter":505,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600059#WRG04050"},{"type":"question","counter":506,"qnumday":313,"qnumall":"[34745\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600059#WRG04100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the Office of Public Works engagements on an issue (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1180","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":507,"content":"<p>Meath County Council and the Office of Public Works (East Region) engineers have been co-operating in looking at the flooding problem at the location mentioned in the Deputy's question.

This option is only available where the Member State is not applying voluntary coupled support to the sector concerned under the new CAP.\u00a0 Accordingly, while the legal basis for the former Grassland Sheep Scheme is no longer in place under the new regulations, these payments have been taken into account under the new Basic Payments Scheme.   <\/p>  <p>  In addition, in negotiating and developing the new Rural Development Programme, 2014-2020, I have included a number of schemes that will be of direct benefit to the farmers in question.  For example, a strong commitment to continuation of funding under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme (formerly the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme), a range of supports under the new Capital Investment Scheme TAMS II, the prioritisation afforded to commonage farmers under GLAS, and support for a specific Knowledge Transfer Group for sheep farmers will be of particular benefit in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600062#WRK00300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Payments","counter":669,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600062#WRK00350"},{"type":"question","counter":670,"qnumday":368,"qnumall":"[34236\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600062#WRK00400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when payment will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Galway under the 2015 areas of natural constraint  scheme and the basic payment scheme; the reason for the delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It is part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.  There is funding of &euro;300 million available within the scheme and it builds on my Department&rsquo;s previous Beef Data Programme and Beef Genomics schemes.  The BDGP aims to (i) address widely acknowledged weaknesses in the maternal genetics of the Irish suckler herd, (ii) reduce the Greenhouse Gas intensity of Ireland&rsquo;s beef production and (iii) make a positive contribution to the future viability of suckler farmers and the national suckler herd.   <\/p>  <p>  To achieve these objectives my Department has drawn up six requirements that farmers must meet in order to draw down payment from the scheme.  Participants will be required to complete surveys and submit information related to criteria such as milking ability, docility, size and animal vigour.  Farmers will be very familiar with these surveys which were previously part of the Beef Data Programme operated in recent years. <\/p>  <p>  Participants will also be required to genotype animals on their farms which have been selected by the ICBF (Irish Cattle Breeding Federation).  The number of animals to be genotyped each year will be equal to 60% of the number of calved suckler cows that the applicant had on his\/her holding in 2014 &ndash; these are known as the farmer&rsquo;s reference animals.  It should be noted that the cost of the genotyping tag has been significantly reduced from the pilot 2014 Beef Genomics Scheme and now stands at &euro;22 &ndash; a drop of over 26%.   <\/p>  <p>  Farmers will also then be required to undertake a replacement strategy to ensure that a certain percentage of the animals on their herd at particular deadlines are of 4 or 5 star rating on the Euro Star ratings system.  It should be noted that most farmers are already well on the way to meeting the requirement for replacement animals on their herds, with significant numbers of 4 and 5 star animals already in scheme participant&rsquo;s herds.   <\/p>  <p>  Participants in the programme will receive a payment of &euro;142.50 for each of the first eligible 6.66 hectares and &euro;120 for each of the remaining hectares up to the maximum payable area.  The maximum payable area is based on the number of calved suckler cows in each herd in 2014.  The payment rates provide for a higher payment linked to the first 10 animals on each herd as I felt it was important to favour smaller herds through this programme.  The payment rate of &euro;142.50 is the maximum amount which could be provided based on the cost incurred and income foregone associated with the actions under the BDGP, as negotiated with the European Commission, and it would not be possible to arbitrarily increase the payment. <\/p>  <p>  I have asked officials from my Department in conjunction with the ICBF and Teagasc to hold information meetings for scheme participants.  These meetings will enable farmers within the scheme to have one to one time with Department, ICBF and Teagasc staff in order to query any aspect of the scheme and look at their own personal circumstances with regards to the requirements they will have to fulfil to ensure full compliance, and therefore full payment, with the scheme.  Scheme participants will be contacted directly to inform them of upcoming meetings.   <\/p>  <p>  I have committed to a mid-term review of the operation of the programme, which will include input from all of the stakeholders, including farm organisations.

For example, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, which includes the European Investment Bank as one of its funding partners, has recently announced a new 'Agriculture Investment Loans' product.  This credit is available at favourable terms for investments by agricultural SMEs involved in primary agricultural production, the processing of agricultural products or the marketing of agricultural products.  The features of these products compared with those currently on the market are lower interest rates, loan amounts up to &euro;5 m and increased repayment flexibility.  Of the almost &euro;45 million in loans approved and drawn down by SMEs between March and end-June from the SBCI, a third has been accessed by the agricultural sector.<\/p><p>As to the EIB itself, earlier this year, the European Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB) presented a model guarantee instrument for agriculture, developed within the framework of their Memorandum of Understanding on co-operation in agriculture and rural development within the EU.  The model instrument aims to help ease access to finance for farmers and other rural businesses.  Member States and regions can adapt and use this model to set up financial instruments funded by their rural development programmes (RDPs) under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).  Financial instruments can take the form of loans, guarantee funds or equity investments.  The funding for any such financial instruments would have to draw on Ireland&rsquo;s existing RDP allocation of European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development funding as well as National Exchequer funding.  It is also possible to incorporate funding from other sources for such instruments.<\/p><p>In our RDP, we have made a commitment to examining the potential for the use of financial instruments.  However, the inclusion of financial instruments by way of a modification to the RDP is required by EU regulation to be based on an <i>ex ante<\/i>evaluation which must assess:<\/p><p>- The existence of a market failure;<\/p><p>- The potential for added value;<\/p><p>- The resources required to implement a proposed financial instrument; and<\/p><p>- The proposed strategic approach to financial instruments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600062#WRK03000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Safety Standards","counter":709,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600062#WRK03050"},{"type":"question","counter":710,"qnumday":382,"qnumall":"[34337\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600062#WRK03100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he is satisfied that in the preparation of meat, including in the preparation of halal and kosher meats, all standards are met; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":711,"content":"<p>Slaughter of animals for meat for human consumption is subject to compliance with relevant EU regulations, which are designed to ensure inter alia that food is safe, to protect human health and to safeguard animal welfare at time of slaughter.

The design of the measure has been informed by experience from previous discussion groups, extensive stakeholder consultation, and the relevant EU regulations. Participants are required to attend Knowledge Transfer Group meetings and complete a Farm Improvement Plan. I believe that the combination of both farmer knowledge exchange meetings and one to one interaction between the farmer and advisor in the development of a Farm Improvement Plan will ensure the transfer and exchange of information and best practice to participating farmers.<\/p>  <p>  The analysis of previous discussion group schemes and consultations leading up to the design of the Knowledge Transfer Programme highlighted the importance of addressing all aspects of a farming enterprise including profitability, environmental sustainability, farm safety and animal health and welfare measures. This is reflected in the scheme design which includes the requirement for a private veterinary practitioner (PVP) to oversee the preparation of an individual animal health and welfare plan.<\/p>  <p>  While a payment to cover the PVP&rsquo;s involvement is not an eligible cost under the relevant article in the Rural Development Regulation covering knowledge transfer, the time spent by the farmer in completing the Animal Health Measure aspect of the Farm Improvement Plan is included in the total payment to participating farmers. Over the period of the programme this totals &euro;160. In effect this reduces the PVP cost over the period of the programme by &euro;160, thereby significantly reducing the net PVP cost. The total payment to a farmer participating in a knowledge transfer group will be &euro;2,250 over the three years.   <\/p>  <p>  As currently constituted, participation in more than one Knowledge Transfer Group across sectors is not permitted. This is largely due to potential double funding which would arise from the completion of more than one Farm Improvement Plan for a single farming enterprise. I have, however, asked my officials to examine how farmers could participate in more than one Knowledge Transfer group across two sectors, while at the same time avoiding double funding issues. <\/p>  <p>  The issue of allowing a named nominee to attend a Knowledge Transfer Group has been raised on a number of occasions. Following on from further consideration of this issue, an appropriate named nominee will now be allowed to attend meetings in the place of a farmer participating in a Knowledge Transfer Group. This would include spouses\/partners or children of 18 years or more. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600063#WRL03400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":777,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600063#WRL03600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":776,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600063#WRL03500"},{"type":"question","counter":777,"qnumday":404,"qnumall":"[34139\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600063#WRL03600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the numbers of supernumerary positions in his Department, and those agencies, organisations or bodies funded by his Department; the maximum period in each case that supernumerary positions have existed; the total cost in maintaining supernumerary positions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":778,"content":"<p>The Defence Organisation includes civil servants, military personnel, and civilian employees attached to military installations.

Since their introduction on Wednesday last (28th September, 2015), the following arrangements are now in place to improve throughput and relieve the congestion in the public office that occurs at this time of the year as demand for registration increases as students return to their studies. The measures have been successful by reducing the number of persons who are required to call to the office to a minimum and on a par with the number who call at all other times of the year where no significant issues with queuing arise.<\/p><p>One of the key measures is that persons who are students of the colleges listed below and who are registering for the first time or seeking to renew their registrations are not required to<b><\/b>attend at the Public Office.  Separate arrangements are being put in place to register students of these colleges. The colleges concerned have been contacted and the arrangements communicated directly to the colleges and students involved. Students from these colleges are already being registered under the new arrangements which will see periods set aside to deal with students by arrangement. There is no need for students of these colleges to queue at Burgh Quay and no person will lose residence status or continuity of permission to remain by the application of these arrangements.  The colleges concerned are:<\/p><p>- Dublin City University (DCU), <\/p><p>- Dublin Institute of Technology and constituent colleges (DIT)<\/p><p>- Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland (RCSI),<\/p><p>- Dublin University (Trinity College),<\/p><p>- University College Dublin (UCD).<\/p><p>From 30th September, all new registrations are being be dealt with on Monday and Tuesday of each week.  Wednesday to Friday is reserved for renewal of registrations i.e. for those who have an existing GNIB registration certificate.  In addition to these measures, extra staff resources are being deployed to the GNIB to assist with the registration process.  The Public Office will operate on every Saturday in October and November. With the exception of 10th October, Saturday openings will be by prior arrangement only and in most cases confined to students of the above colleges. The arrangements will be kept under constant review and changed or added to as required to address the demands on the office in this peak period.<\/p><p>The nature of the services provided is such that it is demand led and accordingly, there are peaks and valleys in the numbers of callers at different times of the year.  For the purpose of the efficient processing of the registration of up to five hundred people who are dealt with in the peak period at this registration office every day, GNIB personnel who are employed there operate a shift system, which ensures it is open from 8am to 9pm each Monday to Thursday and 8am to 6pm each Friday (excluding bank holidays) and remains open through lunchtime.  A numbered ticket issuing system is operated at the office; priority is given in the early morning period for particular categories including those coming here to work or conduct business.  This is to minimise the amount of time persons at work are required to be away from their jobs.  In addition, the GNIB with the assistance of the Garda Press Office has recently established a Garda website notification system for the purpose of assisting persons who are required to attend at Burgh Quay for registration.  On three separate occasions during each day an announcement is posted on the Garda Website alerting customers to the number of available tickets remaining at the Burgh Quay public office for that day.  Furthermore, those attending are advised of the approximate time that they will be dealt with, which allows them to leave the office and return later in the day, if they so wish.  A GNIB officer is also deployed to meet with each person on arrival at the office to ensure that they are in possession of all of the necessary documentation required for registration, so that unnecessary delays are avoided.<\/p><p>In common with the operation of immigration functions in other States, immigrants seeking to register are required to present in person at my offices.  This is necessary for establishment of identity and as an anti-fraud measure and is the practice of immigration services worldwide.  For the majority of customers the Garda National Immigration Bureau provides a 'same day service' at its Burgh Quay office.  Currently, this office handles all registrations in the Dublin area.  At times of high demand, it is not possible, currently, to send this demand elsewhere, it has to be accommodated within the capacity of the Burgh Quay office where the necessary technical infrastructure for registration card recording, generation of registration certificates and fingerprinting exists.  Use of other buildings for this purpose is not an option because the biometric equipment and elaborate smart card production systems are not mobile and in any event has to be linked up in real-time to the Garda IT systems.<\/p><p>Work is underway to transfer the registration function to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS).  As part of that work new systems are being developed with the aim of reducing footfall and random arrivals to the public office by use of on-line systems and to undertake registrations renewals offsite.<\/p><p>I would like to acknowledge the work of the staff in the Public Office who diligently perform a very important function for the State.  It is one of the busiest public offices in the State dealing with, in the region of, 100,000 people every year.  The new arrangements outlined above mean that queuing is not necessary and these arrangements will be strictly enforced to ensure that they are implemented as effectively as possible.  The new arrangements are in their first week of operation and are proving effective in addressing queue times and in improving the service experience for customers in this busy period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600064#WRM03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":857,"qnumday":433,"qnumall":"[34416\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600064#WRM03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans ensure that persons who attend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na National Immigration Bureau office are fully informed of the next steps they need to undertake if they are looking for employment, for example, that a job offer is required before they can apply for a personal public service number.","asker":"1011","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":858,"content":"<p>The purpose of non EEA nationals attending at the Registration Office, Garda National Immigration Bureau is to obtain or renew permission to be in the State and to furnish particulars as required as part of the registration process pursuant to Section 9 of the Immigration Act, 2004.

The inspection report was published on 31st August 2015.  In Ballydowd Special Care Unit, single separation means the removal of a child to a separate locked room for as short a period as possible during times of challenging behaviour which poses a significant risk to themselves or others.<\/p>  <p>  The inspection report indicated that decisions to initiate single separation generally complied with national guidance and that children's Guardians ad Litem and social workers were informed when they took place.  However, it found that the practice was used for excessive lengths of time in a small number of cases, record keeping and notification to senior management was inadequate and there was a poor response to complaints made by children regarding the events. <\/p>  <p>  Following on from the inspection, HIQA requested Tusla to undertake an immediate review of single separation that lasted for excessive periods of time. The findings have led to a change in authorisation of single separation to ensure it is for the shortest time necessary and also improved recording and information sharing. Incidents of single separation that are longer than three hours are to be escalated to senior management and improvements have also been put in place to have single separation in Special Care reviewed as part of the national significant event notification system. <\/p>  <p>  Restrictive practices and children's rights has been placed as a standing item for meetings regarding Special Care.  An action plan, approved by HIQA, to address the standards identified as \"requiring improvement\" and \"at significant risk\" was published with the report. It noted that the majority of the actions had been implemented at the time of publication. The remainder were due to be completed by the end of Q4 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Other actions that have taken place include the purchase of fire &amp;amp; ligature proof mattresses and blankets which will be available in Safe Rooms at all times. The definitions and permissions in relation to Restrictive Practices have been clarified and limits and governance have been imposed on the use of single separation. Actions in progress include improvements in the recording and reporting processes, and a dedicated Challenge Response team is to be developed to improve resilience and provide assistance within Special Care teams. A Review is also to be undertaken of international best practice relating to restrictive practices and the design of dedicated accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600065#WRN02700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":916,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600065#WRN02750"},{"type":"question","counter":917,"qnumday":457,"qnumall":"[34137\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600065#WRN02800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the numbers of supernumerary positions in his Department, and those agencies, organisations or bodies funded by his Department; the maximum period in each case that supernumerary positions have existed; the total cost in maintaining supernumerary positions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":918,"content":"<p>On the basis of the clarification received from the Deputy on the information he requires, I wish to confirm that neither my Department nor any of the agencies under its remit have any positions exceeding the usual number in place.

It examines the School Completion Programme structures, and how they can best support an integrated approach to address early school leaving. <\/p>  <p>  The findings of the review reflect that the School Completion Programme encompasses a broad range of measures and interventions that have been developed by local projects to address the needs of children over the years. The findings in the review cover the processes involved in identifying target children for support, the form and focus of the supports provided and the complexities involved in measuring the outcomes for children at risk of educational disadvantage.<\/p>  <p>  The review makes findings and recommendations on these aspects of the programme and on strengthening the current governance and programme structures and on the resourcing of the programme.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla has advised that it is initiating a number of actions to address the findings in the review. My Department will continue to support Tusla to develop the programme as a key strand in Tusla's integrated educational welfare response to children and their families, taking account of the Review's findings in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the future funding for the programme, this will be determined in the light of the resources that become available to the Agency  in the annual estimates and budgetary processes. I have advised the Agency of my commitment to ensuring that there is no diminution in the school completion programme services. The School Completion Programme is an important service within the Agency&rsquo;s educational welfare services. It is highly regarded as a key response in securing improved educational outcomes for children and young people at risk of early school leaving.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600065#WRN04200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":938,"content":"<p>Question No. 464 answered with Question No. 453.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Funding","counter":939,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600065#WRN04275"},{"type":"question","counter":940,"qnumday":465,"qnumall":"[34471\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600065#WRN04300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the criteria used for allocating funding to community child care services under strand 1 of early years capital programme 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":941,"content":"<p>A total of &euro;7 million was provided under the Early Years Capital Programme in 2015.

The HSE strives continuously to achieve greater efficiencies in the areas of drug pricing, supply and distribution. For example, the HSE reduced the fees and allowances paid to pharmacists in 2009, 2011 and 2013 under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.  Under the present agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, savings of some &euro;400m in the cost of drugs will be achieved over the period 2012-2015.<\/p>  <p>  The current distribution model results in over 70 million items being dispensed annually through local pharmacies across the State, including centres of low population in rural areas.

A State pharmacy would  require a system capable of distributing some 70 million items across the State annually and I am not aware of any evidence that this could be achieved reliably and more cheaply through a centralised State function.  It is worth noting also that the establishment of such a State-run arrangement would most likely have implications for the current network of community pharmacies, which fulfil a considerably wider role than the dispensing of State-funded medication.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600067#WRP05800","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme","counter":1077,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600067#WRP05900"},{"type":"question","counter":1078,"qnumday":511,"qnumall":"[34230\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600067#WRP06000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons whose nursing home care is paid for under the fair deal scheme; the annual cost; the average cost per patient; the amount that is recouped from the assets and incomes of the residents; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1079,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.

In 2008, the then Government decided, in the light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  However, in light of legal advice following a ruling of the High Court, children born after 1 June 2002 are being treated by the Health Service executive as eligible to apply for an assessment under the Act.  Part 2 of the 2005 Act provides for an assessment of the needs of eligible applicants, occasioned by their disability, to be commenced within three months of receipt of an application and completed within a further three months.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process, given the number and complexity of cases, and has taken a number of measures to address the issue.  While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, it should be noted that the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.  The HSE has issued guidance to its staff that where there is a delay in the assessment process, this should not affect the delivery of necessary and appropriate interventions identified for a particular child.<\/p>  <p>  Following the publication of a National Disability Authority report commissioned by the Department of Health and the HSE, a major emphasis is being placed on reconfiguring children&rsquo;s disability services into integrated multi-disciplinary geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams under the HSE&rsquo;s Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme.  The key objective of this Programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities, including autism, and their families to services, regardless of where they live, where these children go to school or the nature of the individual child&rsquo;s difficulties.  Implementation of the Programme is a key priority for the HSE in 2015.  In 2014 an additional &euro;4 million was specifically allocated to drive implementation of the Programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts.  A further additional &euro;4m has been allocated to the Programme this year.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has requested the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the specific operational issues he has raised.

This Capital Plan presents the Government&rsquo;s new &euro;42 billion framework for infrastructure investment in Ireland over the period 2016 to 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The Capital Plan includes just over &euro;3 billion for investment in health infrastructure, and the Department of Health has identified five main priority areas to begin a long term programme of transformation of health care facilities across the country, including primary care.<\/p>  <p>  The development of primary care remains central to the Government&rsquo;s objective to deliver a high-quality, integrated and cost-effective health care system. The policy is to enable people to easily access a broad spectrum of services in the community, through their local Primary Care Team. The development of Primary Care Centres (PCCs), through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of multi-disciplinary services capable of meeting the great majority of people&rsquo;s healthcare needs, in the most appropriate and economic setting.<\/p>  <p>  During the period of the Plan, additional primary care facilities will be provided across the country, building on the 46 PCCs delivered since March 2011. This will be done through a combination of direct build by the State, through Public Private Partnership (PPP) and by way of operational leasing. The mechanism and timescale for delivery of primary care infrastructure is dependent on a number of factors.  Regardless of the delivery mechanism, all potential primary care infrastructure is  subject to  suitable locations being offered \/ provided \/ available, to successful planning processes and GP commitment to sharing accommodation and delivering health care services with HSE staff. In addition, the operational lease mechanism is subject to market pressures such as the developers' access to adequate financing. Delivery of primary care infrastructure is a dynamic process, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances, including the feasibility of implementation.<\/p>  <p>  At present, there are 50 locations where primary care infrastructure is under construction or at an advanced planning stage, under the three methods of delivery:<\/p>  <p>- 14 &ndash; Direct Build (funded by the HSE&rsquo;s annual capital allocations);<\/p>  <p>- 14 &ndash; PPP (also funded by the HSE&rsquo;s annual capital allocations); and<\/p>  <p>- 22 &ndash; Operational Lease (funded from the HSE&rsquo;s annual revenue allocations).<\/p>  <p>  Following the tender process for the above PPP project (14 PCCs), Prime Balfour Beatty has been appointed as the preferred bidder.  Subject to successful completion of financial and contractual arrangements, it is expected that construction work will commence before the end of 2015, with the centres expected to be completed by the first half of 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Operational Lease model, construction work has started in ten locations and the HSE is at advanced stages with developers in a further 14 locations where Agreements for Lease have been entered into and Letters of Intent have issued for a number of other locations.<\/p>  <p>  In November 2014, the HSE advertised an additional 73 locations for delivery of Primary Care Centres by Operational Lease.  The HSE is currently reviewing all Expressions of Interest to determine which are suitable for more detailed consideration and progression to the next stage of the process.<\/p>  <p>  As the HSE has responsibility for the provision, maintenance and operation of Primary Care Centres, the Executive has been asked to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to the breakdown of proposed centres by county, progress on same and estimated expenditure.

This represents 6.4% of the overall gross non-capital health budget of &euro;12.295 billion.<\/p><p><i>A Vision for Change<\/i>recommended that there be a commitment to progressively increase the proportion of funding given to mental health services which, if implemented, would have increased the percentage total health spend on mental health to 8.24% by 2016.  This Government has prioritised funding for mental health, despite the severe resource constraints of recent years.<\/p><p>Historically, funding for the mental health services constituted a high proportion of overall health spend in Ireland. In part, this reflected the traditional emphasis on an institutional model of service delivery with a clinical care focus.  In addition, other areas of the overall health budget in Ireland may not have received an adequate level of funding appropriate to a modern community-focussed health service.  This has been rectified in recent times in, for example, the primary and community care areas, whose development is also important for users of social care services such as people with mental health issues.<\/p><p>In line with <i>A Vision for Change,<\/i>the HSE mental health service is now moving towards a more person-centred recovery model of care, with an increasing focus on community delivery. This model of service is widely agreed to be more focussed on the needs of the service user in the first instance. It is also considered to be more cost effective, and aims for a planned greater integration of services across the primary and community care sectors over time.  Therefore, while every effort will be made to maximise resources for mental health, the promotion of positive mental health extends on a much broader range of HSE service areas.<\/p><p>A total of &euro;125m additional ring-fenced funding has been provided by this Government since 2012 for mental health developments.  This has facilitated upwards of 1,100 new staff for the enhancement of community mental health teams, in particular, and to underpin a recovery-focussed and community-centred service. Bearing in mind the many competing demands on both the wider Health budget and Exchequer funding generally, this represents a substantial and widely acknowledged ongoing commitment to mental health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600070#WRS04700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Provision","counter":1285,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600070#WRS04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1286,"qnumday":583,"qnumall":"[34624\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600070#WRS04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there is an intensive care rehabilitation unit for psychiatric services in the west of Ireland; if he will provide a list of the number of such units that are in the country; where they are located; his plans to establish such a unit in the West; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1198","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1287,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue this question has been referred to for direct reply.

For some problems such as psychosis or severe depression, medication is essential and prescribed along with psychosocial interventions.<\/p>  <p>  Another group of children and adolescents usually referred to CAMHS services are those with a possible diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Up to 5% of school going children will have ADHD and until recently it was poorly recognised and under-treated. The diagnosis is again made following assessment by skilled professional staff with subsequent care and treatment delivered as the relevant bio psychosocial interventions based on the assessed needs of the child. These may include occupational therapy, guidance to parents on managing behaviours and medication to reduce hyperactivity and improve concentration. Educational supports may be also required and schools are advised accordingly.<\/p>  <p>  Hence, medication is used as one of a range of interventions with most children requiring two or more interventions. The medications are used in line with prescribing guidelines and monitored carefully. Primary Care Reimbursement Service data on the number of prescriptions for methylphenidate shows an approximate nine fold rise from 2001 and 2015 but the absolute number of prescriptions is not out of line with the known prevalence of ADHD.

My Department has been in correspondence with a relative of the person murdered in July 1972 and my officials have recently met with the relative. I have conveyed my concern concerning the continued delays in the inquest into the death of the person in question and with problems experienced regarding access to requested information. Given my Department&rsquo;s work on dealing with the legacy of past related to the Troubles, I am only too aware of the deep frustration and distress experienced by those seeking truth and justice for their loved ones.    The Irish Government continues, in our ongoing bilateral relations and through the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg, to raise with the British Government their Article 2 obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in relation to specific Troubles-related deaths.   <\/p>  <p>  Over 3,500 people died during the Troubles.  The suffering of their relatives and friends endures to this day.  I understand and acknowledge the frustration of families who for too long have had to contend with inadequate mechanisms for addressing their cases.  For that reason, the establishment of a new comprehensive framework for dealing with the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement, remains a priority of the Government.<\/p>  <p>  These institutions will include a Historical Investigations Unit (HIU) to take forward investigations into Troubles-related deaths, as well as an Independent Commission on Information Retrieval (ICIR) to enable families to seek and privately receive information about Troubles-related deaths.<\/p>  <p>  In the Stormont House Agreement, it was acknowledged also that recent domestic and European judgments have demonstrated that the legacy inquest process in Northern Ireland is not providing access to a sufficiently effective investigation within an acceptable timeframe. In light of this, the NI Executive has undertaken to take appropriate steps to improve the way the legacy inquest function is conducted to comply with ECHR Article 2 requirements. The Irish Government supports the full and expeditious implementation of the Stormont House Agreement including in relation to legacy inquests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600071#WRT04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":1357,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600071#WRT04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1358,"qnumday":610,"qnumall":"[34143\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600071#WRT04900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of supernumerary positions in his Department and those agencies, organisations or bodies funded by his Department; the maximum period in each case that supernumerary positions have existed; the total cost in maintaining supernumerary positions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1359,"content":"<p>My Department now operates under the delegated sanction arrangements which were granted in February 2015 to manage its staffing resources.

The 17 new Sustainable development Goals (SDGs) are at the heart of the final outcome, &lsquo;Transforming Our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development&rsquo;, which was adopted by the UN Summit in New York from 25 to 28 September.

The 2030 Agenda is the second of three major agreements that will be concluded this year and which, taken together, have the potential to deliver a truly transformative agenda that can end poverty and promote sustainable development. The first of these is the Addis Ababa Accord on the means of implementing the new SDGs which was agreed in July, and the third, the climate agreement, should be concluded in Paris in December.<\/p>  <p>  The SDGs will guide the actions of all countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty and hunger and achieve sustainable development over the next fifteen years.

The first two weeks of roundtable talks have been relatively positive and constructive with a clear willingness on all sides to address the issues around the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement and dealing with the legacy and impact of paramilitarism. I remain hopeful that, with committed collective engagement, we can make real progress on both of these critical issues. An agreed outcome would be an important step forward - not just for politics but for the further normalisation of society in Northern Ireland.  In an effort to facilitate inclusive talks, the Secretary of State has announced a British Government assessment of the current profile of paramilitarism in Northern Ireland. This is a one-off assessment which will be completed in the coming weeks and does not pre-empt the discussion of the paramilitary issue in the talks. It may indeed be of assistance to the parties as they consider how best to tackle the issue.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of criminality stemming from the legacy of paramilitarism is also an important point for the talks. I welcome the Secretary of State&rsquo;s announcement that there will be enhanced support and resources for tackling criminality in Northern Ireland. This is very much in keeping with our Government&rsquo;s strong determination to tackle crime, including organised crime. There is already very strong North-South cooperation involving the police and other relevant agencies when it comes to cross-border crime. My colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality had the opportunity to engage with the parties on these issues when she participated in the Stormont talks last week.<\/p>  <p>  Of equal importance in the talks is the need to fully implement the Stormont House Agreement. This agreement, concluded in December 2014, offers a blueprint for overcoming current difficulties in the Executive, especially around financing, welfare reform and dealing with the legacy of the past. While financing and welfare reform is primarily an issue for the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly, I have continually encouraged the parties to resolve their difference for the sake of Northern Ireland's economic stability and the sustainability of public services.<\/p>  <p>  It is also crucial that the work started by the Stormont House Agreement on establishing institutions to deal with the legacy of the past is completed so that justice and truth can bring what healing is possible to victims and survivors of the troubles and their families. My officials and I are working intensively with the Secretary of State and the Northern Ireland Office to ensure the rapid establishment of the institutions, including the Independent Commission for Information Retrieval, the Historical Investigations Unit and the Implementation and Reconciliation Group.<\/p>  <p>  A successful outcome to the talks, which will respect and protect the Good Friday Agreement and its power sharing institutions, is a crucial priority for the Government. It is essential that all of the five main parties in Northern Ireland, with the support of the two Governments, urgently get down to the serious business of fully implementing the Stormont House Agreement and addressing the impact and legacy of continuing paramilitary activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600071#WRT05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Issues","counter":1369,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600071#WRT06000"},{"type":"question","counter":1370,"qnumday":614,"qnumall":"[34170\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600071#WRT06100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he or his departmental officials are concerned regarding the referendum on a possible withdrawal of Britain from the European Union, Brexit; the plans in place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1371,"content":"<p>The question of the UK&rsquo;s membership of the EU is of clear national importance and is a strategic priority for this Government.

For my part and that of my Department, this includes regular engagement at political level with the British Foreign Secretary and ongoing diplomatic engagement through our Embassy in London, Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels and across the member states of the European Union and beyond. At home and abroad, we also engage with a large cross-section of opinion leaders and members of civil society engaged in this debate.  I have established a strong working relationship with the British Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond MP, who works closely with Prime Minister Cameron on this issue. The Foreign Secretary has visited Dublin twice in the past year, most recently on 19 June. Both my meeting with the Foreign Secretary and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s meeting with Prime Minister Cameron in London on 18 June were very positive and constructive.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to regular political contacts, I have also brought Ireland&rsquo;s concerns to audiences in the UK. Most recently, on 7 September at Chatham House in London, I set out some implications for Ireland of a possible UK exit from the EU, with a focus on our two-way trading relationship and on Northern Ireland. I also reflected on Ireland&rsquo;s experience of referendum campaigns, especially those related to the EU.<\/p>  <p>  I intend to meet the Foreign Secretary again on this issue in the period ahead as negotiations continue.

It is for individual States to determine in what way they might best contribute to the concerted international effort underway to tackle the threat posed by ISIS and other fundamentalist jihadists.

The previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable of all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011 and required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale. <\/p><p>  Subsequently, following the public service-wide review of allowances and premium payments, the Government decided to withdraw or modify allowances for new beneficiary public servants with effect from 1 February 2012.  Under this decision, certain allowances were withdrawn for new beneficiary teachers, including qualification allowances.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.<\/p><p>  Alleviation of the salary imbalance between those who entered the public service since 2011 and those who entered before that date began under the Haddington Road Agreement.

In addition, allowances payable to post-1 January 2011 entrants and such allowances as remain payable to post-1 February 2012 entrants were restored to pre-2011 levels.<\/p><p>  The Lansdowne Road Agreement has, through salary increases and a reduction in the Pension-Related Deduction, begun the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years.  The issue of equalised pay scales was not one which could be resolved in the discussions which lead to the Agreement.  However, the flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement will be proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers.

In relation to the project referred to in the Question, this project, if supported by the local authority and local community, may be eligible for funding under the new Scheme. However, it should be noted that primary responsibility in relation to projects of the kind referred to rests with my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600076#WRY02200","answer":true,"speaker":"964"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":1694,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600076#WRY02250"},{"type":"question","counter":1695,"qnumday":728,"qnumall":"[34599\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600076#WRY02300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 723 and 1146 of 22 September 2015, his plans to introduce new legislation, or to amend existing legislation, to clarify the definition of an assistance dog; and if he will ensure that there is the appropriate oversight and accreditation of the training of assistance dogs, and of their provision to persons with disabilities.","asker":"998","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1696,"content":"<p>My Department has policy and legislative responsibility for matters related to the control of dogs including, for example, matters in relation to dog-licencing, restricted dog breeds and local authority responsibilities, as set out in the Control of Dogs Acts and relevant Ministerial Regulations.

Information on social housing units constructed and acquired in respect of all local authorities is published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <\/p><p>.<\/p><p>Indications from the local authorities are that the overall target of 7,000 additional social housing units in 2015 will be achieved.<\/p><p>I am determined that local authorities will have the opportunity to maximise the number of vacant units brought back into productive use this year.  Last year local authorities returned 2,300 vacant units under my Department&rsquo;s capital programme. The target set for this year was 1,000 units.  However, based on continuous interaction with local authorities scope for further action has been identified and funding for some 2,500 units has now been put in place for 2015. <\/p><p>The <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020<\/i>sets a target of 8,400 households to be supported by the Housing Assistance Paymentby end 2015.  The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), has been introduced incrementally to 13 local authority areas to date- Limerick City and County Council; Waterford City and County Council; Cork, Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin, Monaghan, Donegal, Offaly, Carlow, Clare and Tipperary County Councils; and Cork City Council.  Dublin City Council is also implementing the HAP pilot scheme for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all four Dublin local authorities.  Consideration is currently being given to the sequencing of a further cohort of local authorities to commence HAP in the coming months.  To date, over 4,000 HAP tenancies have been set up across the pilot local authority areas. As the HAP scheme is being rolled out on a phased pilot basis, formal targets for individual local authority areas were not set for 2015. <\/p><p>I am confident thatby utilising all delivery mechanisms available to them, local authorities will continue to deliver across all <\/p><p>programmes in 2015.  As outlined above, significant extra funding has been allocated in terms of vacant units. Given the time-lag between approval and delivery in terms of construction projects, acquisitions are a very important part of delivery this year.  Local authorities have indicated that the vast bulk of acquisitions are being progressed and will be finalised between now and the end of the year.  My Department is working with local authorities to ensure that maximum delivery takes place.<\/p><p>Specific targets for 2016, under both capital and current programmes, will be finalised as part of the annual Estimates process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600076#WRY04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Expenditure","counter":1722,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600076#WRY04150"},{"type":"question","counter":1723,"qnumday":738,"qnumall":"[34648\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600076#WRY04200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide details, by category, and by local authority, of the spend on social housing support, including each of the different funding models, social housing construction, and acquisition, in each year since 2011 to date in 2015; and the projected funding for each of the various models in the coming years to 2021.","asker":"1003","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1724,"content":"<p>The data requested, to the extent available are currently being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600076#WRY04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":1725,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600076#WRY04350"},{"type":"question","counter":1726,"qnumday":739,"qnumall":"[34649\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100600076#WRY04400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the amount that was allocated from his Department to the Social Housing Strategy 2020; the amount of this that was, transferred from other budgets; new funding; collected from the local property tax; the amount of this revenue that, was spent; is projected to be spent over the lifetime of the Strategy; and if he will provide details of the breakdown of this funding, by each funding model of the Strategy.","asker":"1003","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1727,"content":"<p>The <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020<\/i>is a comprehensive response to the need for social housing and targets the provision of over 110,000 social housing units to 2020, through the delivery of some 35, 5 00 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme. The cost to the  Exchequer of building, acquiring, or leasing the 35,5 00 new social units over the period to 2020 under the various financing models, in place and under development, is estimated to be &euro;3.8 billion.  The strategy is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:<\/p><p>. <\/p><p>Table 1 in the Strategy is based on the three year capital provision for housing announced in Budget 2015 and the one year of agreed current provision.

In 2015, the total housing provision will result in almost &euro;800 million being provided under the various housing programmes, of which some &euro;119 million is being self-funded by certain local authorities arising from the introductionof Local Property Tax. <\/p><p>To date in 2015, over &euro;248.4 million in Exchequer funding has been expended and a further &euro;62.8m in respect of housing services hasbeen self-funded by local authorities from Local Property Tax.

This programme has been designed to maintain high standards of contractor workmanship; build consumer confidence; monitor health and safety; and ensure proper governance of the spend of public money.
