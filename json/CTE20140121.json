The purpose of the meeting is to consider Vote 30, Revised Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Before I ask the Minister to make an opening statement, I will briefly deal with the proposed timetable, copies of which have been circulated to members.  Following the Minister's opening statement of approximately ten minutes, we will spend 20 minutes discussing administration, including a question and answer session.  We will then deal in turn with each of the four programmes.  While discussion of some programmes may take longer than 20 minutes, it is proposed to complete our discussion in two hours, although further time will be provided, if necessary.  As the Minister noted, a consultation paper on the rural development programme has been circulated to us.  While he may wish to expand on the paper, the secretariat has been in discussions with officials from the Department with a view to arranging a briefing for the joint committee.  That is being done to be fair to non-D&aacute;il members who do not sit on the select committee.  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2014012100003#J00300","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1390309200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The outlook for the agrifood sector remains very bright and the sector will continue to contribute strongly to national economic recovery.  There is a new awareness of its vital economic importance and a strong recognition that it has the fundamental building blocks in place to reach the demanding targets it set for itself in Food Harvest 2020.  This blueprint will contribute significantly to growth in food and drink exports and national prosperity.  I am confident that the measures introduced in budget 2014 in a highly challenging fiscal environment will help us to continue on this path towards national recovery.<\/p><p>  The agrifood and fishing industry is enjoying a period of strong success.  I was pleased to note recently that the most recent statistics from Bord Bia confirmed that this trend was continuing, with all signs pointing to ongoing growth in the sector.  The value of Ireland's food and drink exports grew by more than 9% in 2013 to slightly less than &euro;10 billion in the year.  Since 2009, the value of food and drink exports has increased by more than 40%.  <\/p><p>  The Exchequer contribution to the Vote of my Department will amount to &euro;1.22 billion in 2014.  This figure comprises &euro;1.019 billion in current expenditure and approximately &euro;200 million in capital expenditure.  While on the current expenditure level, the allocation amounts to a modest fall in overall terms in 2014, reflecting the reality of macro-level budgetary constraints, but it is also worth noting that some agricultural schemes are coming to the end of their natural life.  Separately, the Department continues to reduce the administrative cost of delivering its programme for farmers and the agrifood sector as part of its reform package.<\/p><p>  When drafting the Estimates for 2014, I was conscious of a number of key areas, including the need to provide support for vulnerable sectors and maintain family farm income; the need to provide a support for the very important suckler beef sector; and, consequent on the new Common Agricultural Policy, the need to ensure schemes and programmes under the rural development programme were well funded.  On this latter point, last week I was pleased to be in a position to announce that under the new rural development programme, &euro;1.9 billion in national funding would be added to the &euro;2.2 billion European Union funding already secured for expenditure on the seven year programme.  Combined with the &euro;8.5 billion in EU funding that will be paid in direct payments to farmers in the period to 2020, this brings total funding for the sector over the period from 2014 to 2020 to more than &euro;12.5 billion.  This constitutes an ongoing and significant strategic financial investment in the agrifood sector.  <\/p><p>  I have demonstrated the Government's ongoing commitment to support farmers in vulnerable sectors, particularly those farming in disadvantaged areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2014012100003#J00400","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390309500,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I propose that we proceed with the consideration of the Estimate proper.

It is important now to know how the various schemes will be focused to achieve their objectives and to minimise administration costs.  Administration includes inspections.  The charter of rights of farmers is several years old.  Will it be reviewed and renewed?  I note that the Minister has to deal with a clearance account for the EU budgets and to ensure that a certain number of inspections are carried out but landing in on people and expecting them to be ready causes significant angst.  It is important to take cognisance of the fact that people have to work on farms.  Appropriate procedures in respect of the charter should be implemented and reviewed.<\/p><p>  The Minister spoke very cogently and clearly about saving money.  It is important to save every cent that we can on administration and give it to the areas where it is needed at ground level.  That is why I am disappointed by the threatened industrial action at Portlaoise.  It would be remiss of me not to avail of this opportunity to raise this issue.  The action started yesterday with technical staff reporting in the traditional way and refusing to co-operate with proposed transfers of staff within the grade.  Initially it will be mild and will cause administrative inconvenience to management without impacting on farmers and the agricultural and food industries.  It has, however, been indicated that if there is no resolution to this dispute it will escalate to include action that will delay grant payments to farmers and disrupt the processing and export of cattle and other agricultural products.  This could happen in late February or early March.<\/p><p>  I would like to see every effort made to use the normal industrial relations channels to put a stop to this threatened industrial action.  There are 600 agricultural staff where a few years ago there were 1,200.  Nowhere has there been greater co-operation.  There has been a rationalisation from 58 officers to 16, and redeployment of 400 staff.  The Minister said that staff members had fallen at the Department.  One of the biggest cuts was the 18.6% among the technical staff who cooperated fully with the rationalisation which resulted in tens of millions of euros saved.  Along with other public servants they have been subject to two pay cuts since 2009, as well as other changes in their working terms and conditions, applicable under the Haddington Road agreement, which we all saluted as being extremely important.  Why did the Department not intervene?<\/p><p>  The root cause of this dispute is well known.  The management in the Department appears to be refusing to implement official policy, which denies these agricultural officers an opportunity to compete for posts at a time when their traditional role is being diminished.  Management persists in allocating inspections to more costly staff.  That costs everybody money.  We are taxpayers, like the farming community and everybody else.  I am confused.  There was a policy on cross-stream promotion and redeployment which was always agreed.  Why under the Haddington Road agreement have those people not been allowed to participate in competing for those opportunities?  Every other Department has implemented the new approach.  Why is this policy being blatantly ignored and excluding agricultural officers from competition for assistant principal posts?  If there are savings involved in the administration we are entitled to ensure that takes place.  Why is that happening?  Why was it allowed to reach this impasse?  When will it be resolved?  Are there not significant savings to be achieved by following Government policy?  This is not a new policy.  I would appreciate a reply to those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2014012100005#L00300","speaker":"1063"},{"type":"speech","time":1390310100,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for coming here today for a very detailed estimates process.

One of the great features of Irish public administration is that we tend to do both simultaneously in that people retire with a lump sum and they are brought back and paid again.  I refer to the case of Irish Water as a great example and also the teaching profession, although the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Quinn, has been trying to combat that practice.  How many consultants were previously departmental staff?  The Minister may not have that information to hand.  Are many such people employed in various capacities by the Department, such as the consultants to whom the Minister referred?

The Department has a policy of tendering for consultancy services.  For example, consultancy services for the horse racing industry was won by Indecon.  There is no arrangement for retired staff to be hired as consultants.  One exception was made for good reason because the Department needed that individual's expertise.  For example, retired departmental veterinary staff are not hired as consultants.<\/p><p>  On the question about IT costs, the increased Estimate for expenditure on IT is related to the implementation of the new CAP and CFP, Common Fisheries Policy.  The Department will need to redesign its IT systems to fit the new policy direction.  A new scheme will be needed for the new GLAS environmental programme.  The new IT system will need to be in place this year to allow for the introduction of the new CAP policy in 2015.  The Department manages its own IT services as opposed to hiring outside services.  For example, Revenue uses an external consultancy to run its online service.  My Department has an internal IT section which requires staff who can write code and design new systems.  This work will need to be done this year and this is the reason IT costs will be higher than last year.  The expenditure will be used to implement a system to manage the implementation of a new CAP and CFP.<\/p><p>  In reply to Deputy Penrose, negotiations on the charter for farmers' rights will commence this month.  We gave that commitment to farming representative bodies.  It is appropriate to discuss a new charter for farmers' rights at a time when a new CAP is being finalised.  We know the policy direction and how much money we need to spend.  We will discuss matters such as inspections and the implementation of regulations.<\/p><p>  The Department of which I am the political leader has shown a willingness to adopt to change and reform to an extent that is more impressive than any other Department, bar none.  We have an outstanding team of people who have accepted and embraced that significant change, such as a reduction in staff numbers, redeployment and office closures.  I have nothing but positive things to say about the attitude to reform shown by staff in my Department.  There is a difference of opinion on a particular issue between IMPACT - which represents technical staff - and management with regard to a competition for promotion for assistant principal officer positions.  We have invited the workers involved to discussions tomorrow and this invitation has been accepted.  I am hopeful that any differences can be resolved tomorrow and so avoid any escalation of industrial action that would potentially affect services.  The management has an open mind with a view to resolving an issue.  I know the workers will also approach the discussion on that basis.  Nobody in the Department wants to be involved in industrial action.  The Department has provided a lot of good news stories with regard to public sector reform and delivery for our clients.  I am hopeful tomorrow's meeting will be an opportunity to end that industrial action before it becomes more serious.<\/p><p>  We have clarified the figures for consultancy services raised by Deputy Heydon.<\/p> <p>There is a reduction there from &euro;150,000 down to &euro;40,000.  Depending on the issues on which I need to obtain advice or in respect of which the Department needs an outside opinion, that consultancy figure can go up or down.  We are not budgeting for a significant sum this year.<\/p><p> Deputy Barry raised the issue of the pay bill coming down but the pensions bill possibly increasing.  It is general Government policy to seek to reduce the numbers in the public sector.  Those numbers rose steadily over a period time until we ended up with a public sector that was larger than it needed to be.  That growth was fuelled by overspending at a time when we could afford it.  Under this Government and towards the end of the last Government's term, there was a realisation that Ireland as a country could no longer afford a pay bill of that magnitude.  We have been successful in reducing numbers across the public sector, including in my Department.  In fact, my Department is ahead of its targets in this regard.  It was a whole-of-government decision to reduce numbers.  Clearly, there is a consequence of that in terms of pensions, but the net cost to the State is significantly down.  That is clear from the figures coming from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in terms of the overall cost of salaries and pensions across the public sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2014012100006#M01800","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390311300,"counter":44,"content":"<p>In regard to expenditure on information technology services and office equipment, how much of that budget is for external services?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2014012100007#N00200","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1390311300,"counter":45,"content":"<p>From time to time, we need to take on advice and consultancy to help us to redesign systems within the Department.

How can the Minister justify reductions of 17% in respect of disadvantaged areas, 30% in respect of animal health, 53% in respect of the REPS - a reduction over three years - and only 9% and 7%, respectively, in respect of the administrative budget and non-commercial State bodies?  It seems that farmers are being hit, while the bureaucracy is being saved.  What is being done in this regard is completely unacceptable.  We know that the use of technology means that much of what needs to be done manually from an administrative point of view can be reduced.<\/p><p>  The second issue to which I wish to refer relates to those who were responsible for writing the code for the maps issued by the Department and its claim to the effect that certain people over-claimed in respect of their lands.  One would need a microscope to see the X01, X02 and X03 designations on the maps to which I refer.  Many farmers are elderly and either cannot understand what is involved or cannot see the X designations on maps.  I have looked at many such maps in recent months and trying to find an X on one is similar to playing a child's game.  It is also difficult to establish whether a designation is X01 or X03.  If the Department had done what I am about to suggest, it would have saved itself a great deal of trouble.  When it wrote farmers, why was it not in a position to indicate the estimated over-claims made - according to its computer files - and the penalties that would arise in 2013 as a consequence?  Many farmers receive letters which only indicate the plots of land that the Department is disputing.  They do not understand they are obliged to revisit their figures, carry out a new calculation in respect of the eligible area and discover whether it is over or under 3% or over or under 20%.  If it is greater than 3%, one multiplies the figure for the lost land by three.  If it is greater than 20%, one is out the gate and cannot claim.<\/p><p>  In the light of all of the computer technology used and all of the money spent, it is amazing that the information the Department has in its possession cannot be provided for farmers in an accessible and understandable form.  If a farmer knows he or she is going to lose &euro;100 in a year, he or she might not bother to pursue the issue.  The Department might state 60% of an area of his or her property is scrubland, whereas he or she might state it is 40%.

I have given credit where it is due in the context of correct decisions made by the previous Administration.<\/p><p>  There was a requirement to reduce the cost of administration across government.  That requirement was forced on both the previous Administration and the current one.  I would like to believe the reductions relating to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine were achieved in a way which did not undermine services to farmers.  To be clear, the idea that one can simplify all of this and try to make a political point by stating we are cutting REPS payments by more than we are cutting administration costs is a non-runner.  We can only do what we are allowed to do under agreements - the Croke Park and Haddington Road agreements - that were signed up to by the previous and current Government.  One cannot just lay people off or reduce their salaries without agreement being reached on such actions.  We have reduced staffing levels dramatically - by one third, to be precise - since 2009.  Like all other public servants throughout the country, those in my Department have been obliged to accept reductions in their salaries.  The idea that we could somehow start to slash both salaries and numbers in one Department and ignore the rules of engagement negotiated is nonsense, as I think the Deputy knows.<\/p><p>  The issues relating to mapping have nothing to do with the writing of code or anything of that nature.  The actual accuracy of maps has changed.  Last summer we were required to introduce a new mapping system by the European Commission.  We now rely on satellite imagery rather than images taken by high flying aircraft.  Mapping systems are much more accurate than they have ever been and it is now much easier to identify land that is eligible and that which is not.  Whether we like it, we must deal with the reality whereby land which attracted funding in the past, even as recently as last year, should not have attracted it.  We addressed this matter last year in the context of more accurate mapping.  We have put an appeals committee in place which involves staff from within the Department and external to it and which is chaired by Mr. Padraig Gibbons who was a popular choice among farmers.  We will ensure farmers receive fair treatment.  We are aware that 93% have no issue above the figure of 3%.  In other words, a relatively minor over-claim took place and the figure for retrospection to 2009 will also be relatively minor because less than 3% of farmers' land is involved.  The figure for the other 7% of farmers is slightly higher than this.<\/p><p>  Approximately 400 farmers throughout the country have a difficulty in respect of over-claims in excess of 20%.  We are going to try to deal with them on a case by case basis.  If it is possible to do so, we will reduce the figure below 20%.  We will work with farmers and net off parcels of land in respect of which they might have slight over-claims or under-claims.  We will do everything possible to try to minimise the financial impact for farmers who, for whatever reason, over-claimed on land that was not eligible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2014012100008#O02500","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390312500,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Is it &euro;400 per annum?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2014012100009#P00200","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1390312500,"counter":95,"content":"<p>Yes, in total.

Many of them claimed they are losing between &euro;3,000 and &euro;5,000 as a consequence of this.  That might be the accumulated figure or the yearly figure, I am not sure but I will work on the basis of the accumulated figure.  Most of these people are low income farmers and are totally dependent on this income.  Many of those to whom I spoke after the meeting stated categorically that the claims they submitted were claims that were agreed with the Department.  They did nothing wrong in their eyes.  They were claims the Department approved in terms of what they were claiming for and they now find they are being penalised for overclaiming and retrospective payments are being taken from them. The consequences of this affects not only the applicant-recipient but the wider community.  I have attended many meetings over the years and the farmers at this meeting were very angry.  They were angry with the Minister, the Department, local representatives and the leadership of the farming organisations.  The problem with this is the retrospective aspect of it.  The farmers firmly believe that they did nothing wrong, the Department was well aware of the position from their previous maps and so forth.  These digital maps were approved by the Department and now they find themselves in this position.  Is there any flexibility the Minister can exercise to alleviate this problem?  I do not see how they can be penalised if they were compliant.

This is a very difficult issue.  I accept many farmers feel very angry and hard-done by in terms of the issue but in the position I am in I only have two alternatives.  Either we deal with this as a country through my Department and an appeals process working with farmers on a case-by-case basis to try to get an accurate assessment of what is eligible and what is not, and repay the money that was drawn down on land that was not eligible.  Failing that the Commission, which is coming in February to assess the process, will determine a figure of over-claim and it will multiply the figure substantially and apply a fine to this country, just like it has done in France, Italy and the United Kingdom, for very substantial amounts of money.  Every farmer will suffer as a result of that.  We are trying to address a difficult situation.  Simply putting our head in the sand and ignoring it is not an option, nor is it an option to say we will not make retrospective payments because we do not want to do that.  We must deal with the retrospection issue and we will try to deal with it as fairly as we can with farmers.  Nobody will pay back a cent more than they have to in terms of claiming a payment on land that is not eligible.  We will work with farmers on that but, unfortunately, I cannot simply ignore what I am required to do by the European Commission.

There is an estimate for legal costs under subhead A10(7) of &euro;3.3 million.  The figure in the 2013 Estimate was &euro;3.35 million but the outturn was &euro;685,000.  When we questioned this in July we were told it was prudent to include &euro;3.3 million for 2013 but we see the outturn is &euro;685,000.  We are back again this year with another &euro;3.3 million.  I believe that is an over-estimate and it might be overly prudent.  In 2013 we were dealing with a &euro;5 million reduction in the disadvantaged area payment but when we consider the outturn for 2013, and I did a rough calculation on the figures the Minister gave us, there was an underspend of approximately &euro;19 million under the different programme headings, which would have offset the &euro;5 million reduction in the disadvantaged area payment last year if we were not being so prudent in terms of the figures.  Has an overly cautious approach been taken in regard to some of the figures before us?  It may not be significant this year because no scheme has seen a reduction but it is something I would like to tease out with the Minister.<\/p><p>  Regarding subhead A10(11), which is the commercialisation of State agencies, there is an Estimate of &euro;150,000.  I accept that is a small amount but there is a new line in that regard and I wonder what is the intention into the future in terms of the meaning of the commercialisation of State agencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2014012100011#R00300","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1390313700,"counter":182,"content":"<p>In subhead A3 on research and training there is a 5% reduction of &euro;1.5 million.

It must be recorded that the horse and greyhound industry cannot continue in the long term with this level of funding.  I spoke on the Betting (Amendment) Bill last week.

Suckler cow herds are the genesis of our beef industry and that sector has suffered.  The Minister indicated yesterday that there will be &euro;80 per calf.  A total of &euro;23 million is provided.  How will he make that up to ensure we secure the &euro;80 per calf?  It is a great step forward to allow us penetrate the lucrative markets still available.  There is a lot to be done regarding our level of penetration across the eurozone in terms of the big, high quality beef markets but this measure will give us the impetus to achieve the full-scale penetration we deserve for a quality beef product and our traceability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2014012100011#R00500","speaker":"1063"},{"type":"speech","time":1390313700,"counter":184,"content":"<p>On the beef genomics scheme, I outlined earlier how that will work but essentially, any farmer with suckler cows who is also participating in the beef data programme, which is currently approximately 34,000 farmers, will be eligible to join the beef genomics scheme.  The beef data programme will be opened to new participants as well in 2014.  The farmer will receive &euro;40 per calf under the beef genomics scheme.  When added to the &euro;20 per calf provided for on the beef data programme, that will mean &euro;60 per calf for the farmer involved in the two amalgamated schemes.  The farmer will be required to genotype about 15% of his or her cows by submitting samples to the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF.  Farmers who own a stock bull will also have to have it genotyped.  The farmer will pay ICBF for the collection kit required for the animal selected for genotyping and for the cost of genotyping, estimated at &euro;30 per animal genotype.  Obviously, we will try to get down that cost down as much as we can.<\/p><p>  Farmers with BVD permanently infected calves will have to commit to disposing of those calves.  Essentially, that is how it will work.  Only 15% of the animals will be required to be genotyped but the farmer will be paid the &euro;60 per calf on all of their animals.  In the new rural development programme, RDP, we are looking to increase that figure to &euro;80.  It will be the new beef genomic and data scheme in the new RDP, which essentially is what makes up the &euro;40 and &euro;20, the current &euro;60 per calf.  That will be increased to &euro;80 per calf to make sure we incentivise as many farmers as we can, and we are planning to make that payment on about 650,000 calves in the suckler herd.  We have budgeted for approximately &euro;53 million.<\/p><p>  To ensure people understand this, the idea behind this scheme is to try to help the suckler herd become more commercially viable and more profitable by building a national database that matches an animal's DNA with its likely performance.  In other words, if a farmer is sending in performance data on his or her animals around ease of calving, confirmation and so on, and they have also data on that animal in terms of its genotype, its DNA, we will then be able to make much more accurate predictions as to how calves are likely to perform based on their DNA.  We will also be able to give farmers much more accurate information in terms of breeding programmes and the kind of bull they should be using depending on the genotype of the animals they are breeding.  This is about applying technology to improve our breeding programmes and to have a national database that can inform farmers to make decisions that will help them become more profitable in the marketplace.  <\/p><p>  While we need to give some income support in terms of the suckler farmer in Ireland, we are doing that while incentivising a change in behaviour that will help this sector in its entirety become more efficient and more profitable.  That is the idea.  When we add that to sexed semen technology and genomics technology, and no other country in the world is attempting to do this, we are in a position to get a much better understating and to provide more information that can allow farmers make more informed decisions in terms of their breeding programmes and the performance of their herds.<\/p><p>  We always have to be cautious in regard to legal costs.  People take us to court all the time.  As the Deputy knows from the fishing industry, people challenge decisions we make all the time, therefore, we have to have enough money in the kitty in case we get a major legal challenge that we have to deal with in the year.  We do not spend the money if we do not have to, which is the reason the outturn in terms of legal costs is much less than was anticipated, but we move budget lines from one line to another line if we can see that we will be underspent in the year.  We can give the Deputy some detail on the overall underspend later if he wishes so that people can understand where the underspend was but there will always be some level of underspend in a Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2014012100011#R00600","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390314300,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his explanation of the beef genomic scheme.

It went to the Congo and was sanctioned in December.  I assure the Chairman it is money that is being well spent.  However, that contribution, which is part of the overall calculation in respect of the Government's commitment to the development aid budget, is not money that would have been spent elsewhere.  Nevertheless, I consider it to have been worthwhile expenditure.<\/p><p>  As for some of the other questions, on education and the new young farmers schemes that will be rolled out in the new rural development programme, RDP, farmers will be obliged to show they have an appropriate qualification.  One cannot have a situation in which families decide to hand over the farm to a son or daughter simply to get a 25% top-up on their single farm payment if that son or daughter is not actually farming.  In other words, there is a no-change scenario with the running of that farm but people simply try to reapply in a son or daughter's name to get the top-up payments.  This is not acceptable and, consequently, a young farmer would be obliged to show he or she has come into farming within the past three years.  Obviously, such farmers must be under the age of 40 and will get a young farmers top-up payment for five years, while under the age of 40, as part of Pillar 1.  Likewise, under Pillar 2 preferential treatment essentially will be given in respect of grant aid.  If they are investing in their farms, they will receive a 60% grant support for the total cost of a project, rather than the 40% grant aid support that applies to everyone else.  However, for those positive supports for young farmers, there will be a requirement and an obligation on that young farmer to show he or she has a suitable qualification, such as, for example a green certificate.  They will be obliged to get this either on a temporary course through evening classes or whatever or will be obliged to attend an agricultural college to get it.  I consider this to be appropriate.<\/p><p>  The agricultural colleges unquestionably are under some pressure.  It is amazing that a decade ago, people were talking about the need to close agricultural colleges and we now are struggling to provide enough places and to have enough staff.  However, the Department will continue to support Teagasc in respect of the resources it needs to provide that education.  I can provide the Deputy with a note, if he wishes, with regard to Teagasc training programmes but the figures are available for him to seek.<\/p><p>  On the beef genomics, essentially this is a policy approach.  I do not think it possible to patent DNA testing, which is essentially what this does.  However, if a genuinely unique management system is developed that can be patented, perhaps that should be considered.  Essentially, this programme is about gathering data on to a central database and comparing accurately DNA samples with the performance of animals in order to be able to make accurate predictions into the future.  This type of centralised database approach will provide farmers with really useful information for their future breeding programmes.

There has been more done on horse welfare over the past 12 months than over the past 12 years.  The process had commenced prior to the horse meat crisis to improve the regulations and data relating to horses such as who owns them, their location, the premises they are on and the process by which some enter the human food chain, which needs to be checked and examined and so on.  We now have a centralised database and passport issuing organisations, of which they are seven, must agree to supply information to the database before they can issue a passport for a horse.  We, therefore, have a handle for the first time on the number of horses in Ireland, where they are, who owns them and so on.  It is illegal to own a horse that does not have a microchip and a passport.  This is not a option.  One cannot have one's horse slaughtered for human consumption unless in its first six months or before the end of its first calendar year it has been microchipped and issued with a passport because we cannot trace the veterinary drugs and so on that it has consumed.  Phenylbutazone is one example but there are others.  Under EU regulations, no horse can enter the human food chain unless it has a passport and has been microchipped in its first six months of life.<\/p><p>  Many farmers have asked why I do not introduce a system to test horses before they go into factories to check if there are traces of bute and so on in their blood.  That is not acceptable.  EU regulations are clear on this and they are in place to protect the integrity of the human food chain.  Last year, approximately 10,500 horses were slaughtered in Ireland for human consumption compared to 24,000 in 2012.  People think there has been a dramatic reduction on previous years but while there was a dramatic reduction on the previous year, 10,500 is the third highest number of horses slaughtered ever in the State.  There was a glut of horses that were not wanted in our system.  One of the problems associated with a recession is people cannot afford to keep horses and many of them sought to dispose of them.  If they can be sold for human consumption, the owners will be paid between &euro;400 and &euro;600, otherwise they have to pay to have them humanely disposed of, rendered and so on.  That is why they want to sell horses to factories.<\/p><p>  Last year, we tightened up dramatically on this issue.  There was evidence to suggest that some horses may have been going to factories to be slaughtered on the back of false passports.  That is no longer possible.  My Department supervise every slaughtering facility.  Up until this time last year, some of them were supervised by local authorities but that is no longer the case.  Now that we have a centralised database, the information regarding passports is much more accurate.  If a person owns a horse in this State, he or she must have a passport and a microchip for the animal and he or she must register his or her equine premises otherwise he or she is keeping an animal in breach of the regulations.  If the horse is at risk of welfare abuse, we will confiscate it.  Last year, with the co-operation of the Garda and local authorities, we confiscated approximately 4,500 animals because we felt their welfare may have been compromised.  We will not give the animals back to their owners unless they can demonstrate they have appropriate identification for them and they have an equine registered premises.<\/p><p>  We are changing attitudes regarding how horse owners need to behave.  We will enforce the law and we will take prosecutions against those who abuse horses.  The Animal Health and Welfare Act to which many of the members contributed addresses this.   We have made dramatic strides in horse welfare.  Some people would like me to introduce a mass cull of horses that are valueless and for which there is no market as a welfare initiative.  We have a plan that could work to facilitate such an approach but it is not the right approach because many of the welfare compromised horses would not be handed over in that scenario.  People who have horses out the back that they no longer want or do not want to feed and do not have a market for expect the Minister to take the horses off their hands.  I am sorry but I will not do that.  I will spend public money to protect the welfare of animals; I will not spend it to help the income of people who have horses and who want grant aid to get rid of them because they cannot sell them.  We take seriously the responsibility that goes with horse ownership and people need to understand that.  I will happily give members who want a detailed outline of what the Department has done on horse welfare and protecting the integrity of the food chain in the context of horse slaughtering because we have spent a great deal of time on it and we will continue to focus on the issue.<\/p><p>  We are getting value for money from local authorities, which is why I have not allocated as much money as last year for the confiscation of horses but if I need to increase that figure this year, I will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2014012100015#V00400","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390316700,"counter":256,"content":"<p>Could the Minister provide the committee with all the different categories?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2014012100016#W00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1390316700,"counter":257,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p><p>  The BSE testing programme is again a positive story.

We rehomed 42 of those horses through a voluntary organisation.  Most of them were rehomed in the UK.

We also have an obligation from the social point of view to examine expanding programmes for young people connected with horses but who live in an urban environment and who may benefit from learning horsemanship.  In the meantime, until we have those programmes in place, we will intervene on welfare grounds and be pretty uncompromising in doing so, as we have an obligation in this regard.

With regard to piers, it is set down that there is a separate allocation for fisheries, harbours and aquaculture development.  The subcommittee on fisheries released a report last week.  One of the recommendations was that county councils be funded to carry out an assessment of existing infrastructure and any surveys required to enable them to apply for funding from the Department.  The current situation is that the Department does provide funding for necessary works but only provides funding for the actual physical works.  County councils must get to the stage of planning so that involves various environmental impact statements and other costly works that are required to get them to the stage where they can apply for funding.  Has there been any change to that policy and is the Department now in a position to fund the surveys and desktop work to get them to the stage of being able to do the bricks and mortar work?<\/p><p>  The second issue I wish to raise relates to the Irish Seed Savers Association, which is an organisation of national importance and gets quite an amount of national coverage regarding the financial difficulties it is in.  Obviously, there has been a reduction in funding from the Exchequer to the Irish Seed Savers Association.  I am very grateful to the Minister for his interest in the association and for the fact that, subject to EU approval, he has agreed to increase the budget for the association in 2014.  A large part of the difficulty the association is encountering is not just because of a reduction in Exchequer funding.  It is also because there is a reduction in the volume of sales on which it relies for a large part of its funding and a reduction in membership as people across the country seek to reduce expenditure.  The association performs a fairly vital national function in maintaining biodiversity in this State, which Department officials have acknowledged.  Will the Minister look at a multi-annual funding approach?  Again, I do not wish to appear ungrateful for the additional funding the Minister has agreed to provide.  It has been communicated to the Irish Seed Savers Association and we are all grateful for it but the Minister might look at a multi-annual approach which might enable it to look at how it is funded into the future. <\/p><p>  I am not entirely sure whether the final issue to falls to the Department, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or other Departments.  I suppose the fact that the OPW falls between many Departments is part of the problem.  A considerable amount of farmland in south west Clare around Kildysart and Ballynacally was flooded due to storm damage when the embankments along the Shannon estuary were breached.  There was a time when those embankments and culverts up across the west of Clare in Carrigaholt and right up to Quilty would have been maintained by the OPW.  They are not now maintained by the OPW and there is a bit of a bunfight between Clare County Council and the OPW as to whose responsibility they are.  The same is true of the embankments along the estuary.  That is of little consolation to the farmers involved.  All of these areas are designated as special protection areas, SPA, and special areas of conservation, SAC.  There is a very detailed protocol and detailed analysis in Great Britain regarding how state agencies must respond when flood protection mechanisms are damaged. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2014012100017#X02600","speaker":"977","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390317900,"counter":287,"content":"<p>With regard to targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, under subhead C.5.1, the allocation for 2013 was &euro;20.1 million but the outturn was &euro;11.07 million, or just over 50% of the original allocation.

In regard to Deputy Penrose's question on whether we will introduce a new installation aid scheme, we investigated how we can spend money to the maximum effect.  When installation aid was introduced, there was no requirement on young farmers to spend it in any particular way.  The money was given to young farmers, supposedly to get them started.  That was a good principle but they could spend it on anything.  There was no requirement for them to spend it on agriculture.<\/p><p>  We will continue to positively discriminate in favour of young farmers by giving them a top-up of 25% on their single farm payments which means &euro;16,000 over five years to someone who claims the maximum available under the scheme.  Obviously that figure varies according to how much land is being claimed.  They also have access to preferential capital supports under Pillar 2.  Under the rural development programme, a young farmer who wants to invest in capital infrastructure on his or her farm can get 60% grant aid, whereas his or her parents would get 40% grant aid.  These capital grants amount to a significant amount of money.  They can also get support for establishing partnerships or producing artisan food.  There is a strong package for young farmers.<\/p><p>  I made what I think was the right judgment call, as I explained to Macra na Feirme at its annual meeting.

We have only so much money to spend.  We are looking to increase horticulture grant aid.  We are importing a lot of horticulture in Ireland.  We provide for only approximately 60% of our domestic needs here.  We can increase that.  That is why we are examining grant aiding the development of more horticultural facilities such as polytunnels and glass houses.<\/p><p>  A number of people asked about the harbours funds.  We have two ways of supporting the physical development of harbours.  My Department is responsible for, and owns on behalf of the State, seven fisheries harbours.  We need to invest in the infrastructure of those harbours.  Killybegs is the biggest, then Castletownbere and we have many others such as Rossaveal, Greencastle, Howth and Dunmore East.  There is an ongoing maintenance requirement there and some capital projects that we are trying to spend money on.  We have a second programme where we work with local authorities who apply for marine access projects, mainly around fishing, but not solely.  We provide 75% co-funding for local authorities for projects up to a certain value.  Last year and the year before, local authorities applied for that financial support and we have given it as much as we can support.<\/p><p>  Following the storm damage of the last number of weeks I have made the case in Cabinet and outside it that this model might be a good model for repairing some of the storm damage to the coastal harbours that have been affected.  We have done quite some work with local authorities in 92 piers and harbours to get an assessment of physical damage we might be able to support.  The Government will make a collective response in terms of resources that will be available for that work, along with the Ministers, Deputies Brian Hayes and Hogan.<\/p><p>  We will not provide money for survey work and consultants for fisheries harbours.  If local authorities want to develop their harbours they can do the ground work first in terms of surveys or consultancy.  I insist on spending our money on physical work.  It is a stimulus.  It is about creating jobs in coastal communities around the country.  We have a relatively small amount of money to spend and I want it to be spent on physical construction jobs around harbours, piers, access points, slipways, walkways and rock armour.  They are the kind of projects we have been supporting.  If we had more money we would also look at supporting some of the survey work required, but we do not.  A local authority can make a special case to us, for example if there is a special reason around marine safety, such as the need for a harbour to be dredged.  Generally we support physical construction activity and that is the best way to spend our limited resources.  It is small money in the bigger scheme of things.<\/p><p>  We have revised the Estimate for Irish Seed Savers upwards by 15%.  One would not think that looking at the Seed Savers campaign on social media and the questions asked of me.  It is the right thing to do.  It is an important organisation but it also needs to find ways it can help to fund itself.  We cannot pay for everything.  There are very few examples where I have decided to increase anybody's budget by 15%.  We made that decision virtually overnight because we had overlooked it during the budget debates.  The Deputy raised it with me and so we responded to it.<\/p><p>  Flooded farm land exists not only in County Clare.  There has been much physical damage to agricultural land right along the western seaboard.  OPW has primary responsibility for managing floods and ensuring we take action to reduce the effects of floods in the future.  Essentially a climate-change adaptation strategy is required.  It is very expensive and OPW has limited resources and must prioritise how it spends them.  If the Deputy is asking me whether the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine can provide capital resources for reinstating farmland that has been washed away, that is a difficult ask.  There will be a collective response from Government on the overall flood damage.

That option is not open to me, as the Commission has made very clear.  We are adopting those options that are open to me.  We will work with farmers on a case-by-case basis.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is right in saying that most of the farmers who have problems in terms of the 20% have small holdings.  There are a few big ones - only 400 of those - but most of them are relatively small farmers.  There are issues we need to go through with those landowners and farmers explaining why the land is not eligible.  Where there is an overclaim of more than 20%, we plan on dealing with those individually with the farmer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2014012100021#BB00600","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390319700,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I have a further question.

Adding in the capital carryover of &euro;23 million, which we have secured, will allow us to maintain capital spending at the same level as the outcome of last year.  <\/p><p>  On the jobs, enterprise and exports area, we can look back on a very good year in terms of employment performance.  Not only does the CSO data show growth of almost 62,000 in private sector employment but IDA and Enterprise Ireland had record job performances.  Enterprise Ireland has reached record levels on its exports and sector strategies are making good progress.  We are encouraged that the Action Plan for Jobs process which achieves cross-Government support for the enterprise and jobs agenda is adding value.  That is not to say that everything we are doing is perfect.  There will obviously be comments on the success of our new access to finance measures.  They have definitely added value but our ambition would be to see them grow further. <\/p><p>   In the small business area for which the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, has responsibility we will shortly publish an entrepreneurship forum which was a piece of independent work conducted by Mr. Sean O'Sullivan with a group of practical entrepreneurs.  We will follow that up with our own enterprise strategy.  In the course of the year we will seek to make entrepreneurship and small business a very central focus of what we are about.  We are rolling out the local enterprise offices this year and we want to see them help provide a first-stop shop for business in order that anyone who is seeking access to any of the State programmes can have an easy and understandable location from which to get that support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2014012100003#B00400","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390311600,"counter":396,"content":"<p>Thank you Minister.

Are there other issues that attract companies primarily to those locations?  Can more be done to attract inward investment into Galway?

I will take them in order.  I can inform Deputy Calleary that the targets are based on an original five-year strategy.  We do not tend to change them suddenly on the basis of something like a record year.  We will not take last year's figures as the new baseline.  IDA Ireland is a long-term operation.  Its remit is to build strength in certain sectors.  It operates in a long-term planning environment.  I do not think it should suddenly change.  Last year was certainly an exceptionally strong year.  Even though 13,300 new jobs were delivered last year, it will still be a stretch to achieve this year's target of 13,000.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also mentioned the 50% target.  It is true that over a number of years, IDA Ireland has consistently found it difficult to achieve this target.  Last year's figure actually represents a significant improvement on the previous year's figure, which was less than 25%.  Last year, 35% of new jobs were created outside Dublin and Cork.  This was a substantial step forward.  There is no doubt that this target presents difficulties.  The sort of mobile investment we are now seeing is different from the sort of investment we saw a number of years ago.  As a result, this activity has become more focused on cities.  As part of our efforts to counteract that, we have developed new initiatives like ConnectIreland, which has a better spread and offers regions the capacity to use their own resources to try to assist the foreign investment effort.  As part of the review of foreign direct investment that is being undertaken, IDA Ireland is looking at the challenges that lie ahead and how we can best capitalise on them.  That review will definitely look at the regional challenge.  As the Deputy said, it has not been possible to deliver on the targets that have been set in that regard.<\/p><p>  I am anxious to develop a more broad-based discussion on how a region can achieve competitive advantage for itself.  In many regions, foreign direct investment has not been the backbone of the local economy - it accounts for a small percentage of that economy.  There are areas in which there can be a legitimate expectation of building foreign investment.  There has to be a strategy around that in the region.  I think that needs to involve more stakeholders.  It should not simply be a question of asking why IDA Ireland is not bringing more visits to the area.  In the case of each region, a strategy needs to be developed that assesses the competitive advantage of that region and focuses on the elements of foreign direct investment which can build into that.  Similarly, there is a need to look across the region.  Enterprise Ireland, which is strong in many regions, has a much better regional spread.<\/p><p>  In this context, there is a need to look more strongly at the existing base of companies.  IDA Ireland has been doing this in the last 12 months, in particular.  Perhaps that is reflected in its numbers.  Approximately 70% of new jobs come from the existing base of companies.  We need to work on the base of companies that we have at regional level.  We should look at how we can build services in each region to meet the needs of companies that are already in the region.  I accept that there is a need for a broader regional enterprise strategy.  The sole focus should not be on IDA Ireland visits or IDA Ireland jobs, as if that represents the entire sum of what a regional strategy is about.  The short answer to the Deputy's question is to assure him that a review has been commissioned.  In addition, we must start to look at how we can shape a better regional strategy across all of our agencies and embrace stakeholders that are outside of our agencies.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked whether there are difficulties with the way IDA Ireland spends its money.  I have no reason to believe there are difficulties in that regard.  IDA Ireland has a strong system of evaluating the added value that companies bring.  I have seen that in the past as well as in more recent times.  IDA Ireland builds into its grants a requirement to surrender funds if targets are not delivered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2014012100005#D00500","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","time":1390312200,"counter":413,"content":"<p>How much money was returned to the organisation in surrenders in 2012 or 2013?

Company A's stated intention was to sell off the company after phase 2 two clinical trials, company B's application did not make any forecast of jobs to be achieved and the said forecast did not meet the scheme requirements.  It found that the valuation documentation was inadequate.  This was a pilot scheme launched in the south east.  The object was to assist new start-up companies and individual entrepreneurs.  Some 14 companies were approved for funding under the scheme, five fully completed the study while a further five are in the process of completion.  In both cases the evaluation team deemed the application to be of sufficiently high quality to be awarded the funding, particularly as regards their development and employment potential.  While the applications in question did not fully meet all the relevant criteria they did meet all legal-based eligibility criteria with regard to the awarding of funding by Enterprise Ireland.  To date one of the companies has drawn funding of &euro;10,000.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland acknowledged that there were shortcomings in the pilot scheme.

We have tried to have a compendium of what is available across our agencies but the point is well made that Enterprise Ireland could have a simpler source document for the uninitiated as to what is available.  Many of these schemes have developed names which are great if one knows them and they mean something if one knows them.  If one does not know them and sees the name they do not mean anything.  One of the things we are doing this year, not just across my Department but across the wider Government, is to have a communications strategy to make it easier for people to access.

I have with me the Technology Centre Expo 2013 booklet, which acts as a very good guide to the technology centres that exist within the institutes of technology, for example.  Those centres are natural gateways for industries involved in a range of sectors, from the production of food right through to medical devices, to come on board.  The key point is that the system relating to more well-established or technology-driven companies is quite advanced.  What we are concerned with here is trying to get those who operate small or medium-sized businesses to start considering how they might obtain access to the information that is available.  As stated, it costs nothing to get involved in a conversation.  It could be argued that the walls are impenetrable.  However, I am of the view that those walls are being broken down quite quickly.  The Deputy would be surprised by the number of people who attended the launch of Horizon 2020.  I met a man from my region who is a painter and decorator by trade and who was present at that launch to examine a business opportunity.

Perhaps that matter might be examined in terms of making the position with regard to vouchers more flexible.  For example, would it be possible for the colleges to receive the money directly?  I am not familiar with the entire process but it seems to be somewhat cumbersome, especially for those with small businesses.

I am accompanied by the Ministers of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan and Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd.  To assist members, we have prepared briefing material on the Department&rsquo;s Vote for 2014, which sets out details on the overall Vote, as well as key financial and performance information about each strategic programme.<\/p><p>  The key objective for Government in framing budget 2014 has been to do what is required to support our exit from the EU-IMF programme; this has now been achieved.  Getting to this position has, of course, presented major challenges, including the need to maintain tight controls on public spending generally.  Despite these constraints, considerable resources are being made available to my Department for 2014 and these will be used to make the maximum contribution to job creation and economic recovery and help the less well-off in our society.  In these and other ways, we will work to the greatest extent possible to improve public well-being and support delivery of better services for our citizens.  The budget of &euro;817 million being provided to the Department for 2014 is firm evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the sector.  The provision is made up of &euro;456 million in current spending and &euro;361 million in capital investment.  It includes an additional &euro;50 million made available to the Department on budget day for investment in infrastructure stimulus measures in the housing and related areas.   There will also be a further &euro;72 million of carryover capital funding for use on the LEADER, rural development and housing programmes in 2014.  In addition, there will be &euro;240 million in Exchequer equity investment in the newly-established Irish Water to fund the water and waste water capital programme this year.  Departmental programmes will also benefit in 2014 from resources available from both the local government and environment funds.<\/p><p>  I will turn now to specific areas.  As the committee is aware, 2014 will see major reform in the local government sector.  The action programme for effective local government sets out a wide-ranging reform agenda across local government to address weaknesses, enhance effectiveness and accountability and improve performance across the entire system.  Key features of the programme to come into effect following this summer&rsquo;s local elections include the restructuring of local government at regional, county and sub-county levels and the strengthening and widening of the scope and role of local government.  This represents the most far-reaching changes since the present system of local government began in the 1890s.  As members will be aware, local authority financing will change radically in 2014.  Irish Water assumed responsibility for the delivery and funding of water services from 1 January, the local property tax will operate on a full year basis, with an amount equivalent to the money collected in 2014 transferring into the local government fund, and 2013 will be the final year of operation of the non-principal private residence charge.<\/p><p>  The establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing.  Irish Water will fund local authorities to deliver water services through service level agreements.  In this regard, Irish Water will cover some &euro;730 million in operational costs of providing water services in 2014, which formerly were funded by local authorities.  Last month I announced general purpose grants to local authorities of &euro;281 million for 2014.  When taken with the water costs of some &euro;730 million that are transferring from the local government sector to Irish Water in 2014, this represents a funding boost of some &euro;100 million or 11% to the sector when compared to the corresponding funding and costs for 2013.  This reaffirms the strong central government support for a reformed local government sector and the essential services which local authorities deliver to our people.  I acknowledge again the efforts being made by local government to reduce demands on the commercial sector.  It is vital that progress in this area is maintained, and indeed built upon, given the importance of local enterprises to employment and to the economy generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014012100002#A00400","speaker":"967","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390319400,"counter":525,"content":"<p>I, too, thank the committee for providing this opportunity to discuss the Estimates, in my case for the 2014 housing programme.<\/p><p>  I am pleased that 2014 will see a significant level of new investment in housing across a range of measures which will increase the supply of homes to be made available and enhance quality of life for families.  In 2014, almost 70% of the budget for the Department will go directly to supporting housing - this will result in an investment of over &euro;0.5 billion across a range of programmes.<\/p><p>  A &euro;50 million stimulus package was announced for the housing sector on budget day.  Some &euro;30 million of this funding is being made available for investment in local authority housing.  This will allow for a new social housing construction programme to be developed over the period to end 2015 and for a retrofitting programme to return vacant houses to productive use as soon as possible.  I expect that this investment will deliver up to 500 new homes for households.  The detailed arrangements for the implementation of these measures are being compiled by my Department and I expect to be in a position to announce details shortly.<\/p><p>  Considerable work has been undertaken in tackling the issues around unfinished estates.  The next step now involves resolving the residual cohort of estates which remain in a problematic condition.  Therefore, in 2014, &euro;10 million is being provided for a site resolution fund to resolve public infrastructure issues on the most problematic unfinished estates which cannot be resolved by other means.  My Department has recently invited local authorities to submit proposals for funding under the site resolution fund which will enable collaborative solutions to be found for unresolved developments.<\/p><p>  In continuing to support the objective of the Government's Housing Policy Statement of meeting the needs of people who are unable to provide for accommodation from their own resources, I expect that approximately 5,000 new social housing units will be provided in 2014.  These units will be delivered through a range of mechanisms, including through continued investment in leasing and RAS, the completion of existing capital programmes and mortgage-to-rent arrangements, and the continued transfer of NAMA units.<\/p><p>  Reflecting the ongoing importance of leasing as a primary delivery mechanism for social housing, increased funding of &euro;40 million is being made available and some 1,200 new leasing units will be delivered in 2014.  This provision also provides for increased output under the mortgage-to-rent scheme which is a crucial element in tackling the mortgage arrears crisis and 350 new transactions will be delivered in 2014.<\/p><p>  To support the most vulnerable in society, funding is being provided for the development of 175 new housing units for those with special housing needs.  Furthermore, up to 150 persons with disabilities will be provided with new homes in the community under the Government's de-institutionalisation programme.<\/p><p>  To support Government strategies on the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities, some 7,800 adaptation grants will be available to assist people to remain at home for longer and prevent premature entry to residential care.  As the committee will be aware, adjustments to the administrative structures for the grant schemes for new applicants became effective from the start of this month following a review of the schemes.  The aim of the review was to give priority to finding ways to spread the benefits as widely as possible, to target those most in need, and to ensure that the grants supported the maximum numbers of households.  With the level of funding now available and the revised administrative arrangements, the most vulnerable will be better placed to benefit from the grant schemes.<\/p><p>  This year will also see a continuing focus on a programme of regeneration and remedial works projects, with a provision of &euro;79 million being made available.  These projects target the country's most disadvantaged communities through a programme of physical, social and economic regeneration.  Priorities for 2014 include a new focus on construction and refurbishment in Limerick regeneration, the final phase of construction and refurbishment in Tralee and Ballymun, and refurbishment, demolition and construction works in Dolphin House and St. Teresa's Gardens.<\/p><p>  In order to ensure continued progress towards the achievement of the 2016 target of ending long-term homelessness, the homeless budget is being maintained at &euro;45 million in 2014.  As the committee will be aware, the first report of the Homelessness Oversight Group was published last December.  That group was established to examine the approaches being pursued in the Homelessness Policy Statement and to review progress, identify obstacles and propose solutions.  I am currently considering the group's report and its recommendations and will consult with colleagues in Government on the implementation of these recommendations, as appropriate.<\/p><p>  Additional innovative measures in 2014 will see &euro;25 million being made available for the energy efficiency stimulus measure which will improve the energy efficiency of some 12,500 local authority houses, resulting in warmer homes and lower energy bills for thousands of families.  This initiative will also create approximately 1,000 jobs in the construction sector over the period 2013&ndash;2015.<\/p><p>  The social housing reform programme will also continue during 2014 with the commencing of the testing phase of the new housing assistance payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014012100003#B00200","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390320000,"counter":527,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014012100004#C00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1390320000,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I thank both Ministers for their contributions so far today.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss this issue.  It is no secret that we need to ask many questions about the transfer of duties from the local authorities to Irish Water.  If it were not for events of the past few weeks, much information may well have been absent here today.  However, there are a few items that need to be clarified before we proceed even to this year's programme.  I am conscious of a comment made by the Minister, Deputy Hogan, last week that this committee would have discussed the costs associated with the setting up of Irish Water in November 2012, further to his having received approval from the Cabinet of &euro;180 million for set-up costs. As the &euro;180 million to which he referred was raised as a commercial loan from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, can he confirm that there is no way it was discussed at this committee in 2012 with regard to the spend in 2013?  Furthermore, can he confirm what the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, said in the D&aacute;il on Wednesday when he stated this point and, more to the point, said that any parliamentary questions from Members of the D&aacute;il on behalf of taxpayers relating to that spend and how it is being carried out would not be answered because that information was judged to commercially sensitive?  That was in contradiction to what the Taoiseach has said earlier about how Irish Water is a public utility in public ownership and that all questions asked in the form of parliamentary questions would be answered.  If that is the case, is it the position that I or anybody else is not entitled to ask questions about information relating to costs associated with consultants such as IBM, Accenture or Ernst &amp;amp; Young, to name a few, and that in receiving answers to those questions we are at the mercy of Irish Water, which is not yet subject to freedom of information legislation or the oversight of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and is only obliged by virtue of the legislation that was guillotined before Christmas to come before this committee once a year, when we are at its behest as to when it specifically wishes to answer questions?  I inform the committee that the Secretary General of the Department thankfully contacted me last night to apologise on her Department's behalf for not answering questions from me and others in the past pertaining to this matter.  I accept that apology and her commitment to discuss with Irish Water a mechanism by which information may flow - I emphasise the words \"may flow\" - in the future.  I await the Minister's comments in that regard.<\/p><p>  As I mentioned in the debate on a motion we had before House last week, I asked the Minister on 13 November 2012 about the specific costs associated with the setting up of Irish Water.  I asked how much he had committed towards Irish Water for next year - that would have been for 2013.  While the Minister has argued that it was in the context of water metering, which is fine, he came back and said a provision of &euro;10 million had been provided for the establishment of the structure of Irish Water in 2013.  He said that legislation to set up Irish Water on an interim basis would be introduced pending full implementation in 2013.  We have since had that legislation.  He said the cost of metering would be paid out of a loan from the National Pensions Reserve Fund - we were always aware of that, so there was nothing new there - and that it would not be included in the Department's Estimates, as metering would be rolled out over a number of years, but he never mentioned the specific set-up costs.  In his response to my statement last week he said that he provided a breakdown of the &euro;10 million, part of which was &euro;2.7 million towards administration and set-up costs.  A good deal of explanation is required to clear up what the Minister has said.  I left Dublin last Tuesday night wondering what the situation was, having been told it was my responsibility for not having raised this issue in the normal fashion, the Minister having gained approval from the Cabinet prior to that, but we now know that he did not gain approval from the Cabinet in the normal fashion.  It was the economic council that designed the funding in such a way that it would be a loan, and that only copperfastens the accusations that have been made in regard to the overall secrecy that has surrounded this whole debacle since then.  That is my point regarding what has happened so far following the chief executive officer's admission on the national airwaves about the costs associated with Irish Water, the consultancy fees of &euro;50 million that had been spent up to then, and the &euro;85 million being provided in the overall scheme of things. <\/p><p>  To return to the Minister's presentation today, he said that &euro;240 million would be provided from the Exchequer towards Irish Water.  Is that in respect of new capital projects or ones carrying over from last year?  How much in total was spent last year by local authorities on capital projects relating to water programmes?  How much is proposed to be spent this year either in respect of projects carrying over from last year for which approval has been given by the Exchequer, or in respect of commitments that may have been given to the Minister on foot of representations from local authorities for this year coming?<\/p><p>  The Minister said that Irish Water would cover &euro;730 million of the operational costs next year.  What is the source of the &euro;730 million?  I expect part of it is derived from the collection of commercial water rates, to the tune of &euro;200 million, but from where does the balance come?  Perhaps it is quite obvious, but it is not very obvious to me when I read what is before us today.  The Minister said that &euro;486 million from the Local Government Fund was also being given to Irish water.  The amount of &euro;730 million is in addition to the &euro;486 million that the Minister, according to his statement here, is providing towards operational costs.  That indicates that there is an operational cost of &euro;1.216 billion in total next year.  I think the amount was substantially less last year because the &euro;1.2 billion that we have all been quoting with respect to the operational costs in a given year is inclusive of capital spending in that area also.  <\/p><p>  Where is the &euro;400 million that was taken from local property tax revenues that had initially been committed to local authorities that have found they are not able to strike budgets, that find it very difficult to provide the services and facilities they had intended to provide and that had considered this funding a windfall?  The Minister took that from them at the back end of last year.  Where is it to be spent now?  Is that not also gone to Irish Water?<\/p><p>  The Minster said there would be an emphasis on water conservation.  How specifically will that manifest itself?  Will it be by the local authorities or by Irish water?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014012100004#C00300","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1390320000,"counter":529,"content":"<p>In relation to what?

Can he assure us that the associated funds will be spent on what it says on the tin?<\/p><p>  Can the Minister confirm that if a household, for example, conserves water such that it uses less than the flat rate set by the regulator, there will not be any additional charge associated with its efforts at conservation?  <\/p><p>  In regard to the &euro;28 million that the Minister said was provided for group water schemes and septic tanks - I presume that is for a rectification scheme - can he give a specific breakdown of the amount?  Is he providing any money for local government training towards the testing that is required on the data collected from the registration of septic tanks in the past few years?  I do not believe one grant was made by any local authority to any individual in this State who had registered his or her septic tank knowing that it needed rectification works.  The reason for this is that local authorities have not been carrying out the testing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014012100004#C00500","speaker":"1101","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390320600,"counter":532,"content":"<p>Managing our water resource effectively is a key economic issue that we must face.  We have 18,000 people on public water supplies that have a boil water notice or other restrictions.  The EPA has determined that remedial action is required on supplies that are at risk, which include large supplies in Dublin and Cork, affecting a million people.  We have significant supply constraints in Dublin.  Where we normally have a cushion of 15% on supply, we now have 3% or 4%.  There is water unaccounted for, meaning there are leaking water pipes costing a lot of money.  Some &euro;1.2 billion comes from the taxpayer and 40.8% of the water is leaking.  Thirty-six percent of our wastewater treatment plants did not meet our effluent standards in 2011 and European Commission has launched a pilot infringement in respect of 80 of those plants.  That is the legacy I inherited.  I was faced with the challenge of deciding which programmes we would cut further in the context of a troika programme in order to deal with these serious issues.  We had to provide good-quality water to meet water quality directives in 2016 and 2021, and this required a capital investment of &euro;600 million per annum, which is almost triple what we spent this year and last year.  We have &euro;500 million of investment projects on hold because we did not have the money.  We have no hope of meeting those objectives without having some new initiative to deal with it.<\/p><p>  We set up a study that did not cost a whole lot of money.  We studied the situation internationally to see what we could do.

The Taoiseach gave figures also.  I heard the Minister say the establishment of Uisce &Eacute;ireann would save &euro;2 billion over seven years.  The cost of water services is to become more expensive.  On this matter, I will make a bet of &euro;50 or &euro;100 with the Minister that my projections are correct.  The Chairman can hold the bet and I will collect the winnings in a few years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014012100007#F00600","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1390321800,"counter":617,"content":"<p>Gambler.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014012100007#F00700","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1390321800,"counter":618,"content":"<p>The Minister's officials referred to an annual saving of &euro;1.1 billion over seven years.  The Minister said it would be &euro;2 billion, which points to a difference of &euro;900 million.  It is costing roughly &euro;1.2 billion at present.  Over seven years, this will amount to &euro;8.4 billion.  The Minister is saying he will save &euro;2 billion.  I asked him before how he would do that because he has created a macro-structure on top of what exists already, with 500 extra employees, call centres and God knows what else.  How will it be cheaper given all the investment?  Why is the Taoiseach on a different page from the Minister?  Why are officials on a different page?  I know the page I am on because when I calculate the current investment and analyse the structure of Uisce &Eacute;ireann, I realise it cannot be less expensive.  The iron laws of economics show it will be more expensive.<\/p><p>  What I am asking about regarding the expenditure on Uisce &Eacute;ireann is simple.  We know the position of the Comptroller and Auditor General on accessing information.  As the Minister said many times, this will be a stand-alone utility, a stand-alone commercial entity.  Both he and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, said it many times in the Chamber.  It was obvious at the time where they were going with this.  When will the utility be subject to FOI mechanisms?<\/p><p>  Can the table of expenditure be set out in a clear form for 2013?  No more than a page or two is required.  It would demonstrate to me and the public exactly what has happened.  How much was spent last year on leaks?  This is related to a question I have already asked.  How much will be spent fixing leaks this year?  Some 40% of the water is lost through leaks.  I understand some good work has been done in Dublin on fixing leaks over recent years.  I understand we cannot reduce leakage to zero.  The Germans have probably gone as far towards zero as possible and their leakage percentage is still in double figures.  However, if we could halve the number of leaks over the coming years, we would save a substantial amount of money, or several hundred million euro, in terms of water provision.<\/p><p>  There is talk of new sources but there is no point pumping water from a new source into a leaking system.  I have heard no talk to date about leaks being fixed.  I have heard all about where the &euro;180 million was spent, and we know about the call centres and other facilities that must be set up.  If we could fix half the leaks, we would be going somewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014012100007#F00800","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390322400,"counter":620,"content":"<p>To take the Deputy's last question first, I will definitely be doing that.

I have already told the Deputy that I will do it in 2014 and I am doing everything I can to amend the building regulations to ensure that new buildings and new planning applications will have to include a rainwater harvesting plan.  I totally agree with the Deputy on that point.<\/p><p>  I will provide the committee with the one or two pages of information on the financial issues that the Deputy raised.  I have no difficulty with that.  It is interesting to note that the figure for leakage in the network is 40%, which is exactly the same as the figure in 2006.  We have spent &euro;30 million per year every year since then and have made no impact because as we solve a problem in one area, another arises somewhere else.  We have not been able to catch up with the low level of investment that we have on the leakage side.  We will take three initiatives on the leaks.  First, we need additional capital investment and that is where, off balance sheet, Irish Water will be able to borrow money in order to provide the additional capital investment for that purpose.  Second, we are going to introduce a first-fix leak system to the metering programme so that when the meters are turned on, we will provide financial assistance in order to ensure that the customer is not held responsible for a legacy leak outside his or her boundary.  However, there is customer side leakage as well and customers will have to find a way to resolve those themselves.<\/p><p>  We estimate that with the metering programme, there will be a 15% reduction in consumption, which will save a considerable amount of water.  This is based on an analysis of group water schemes, which are already metered.  A lot of people in this country have had water meters for a long time.  Those in the commercial sector and those in group water schemes have had meters for some time.  When water meters were installed in the group water sector, the drop in consumption was between 20% and 30% because leaks had to be detected and repaired.  There is a lot of good work going on in the group water sector that we are trying to learn from and which the contractors are learning from.  The customer will also have to learn.  The water conservation plan, to be outlined by Irish water, will take the best practice, knowledge and expertise that is out there and impart it to people.  <\/p><p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will be making Irish Water subject to the Freedom of Information Act as quickly as possible.  Indeed, he repeated that to me yesterday.  We have no difficulty in doing that.  We are not waiting for the legislation to go through the House before doing that.  We will bring it in under the existing regulations.  The Minister feels that he will be able to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014012100008#G00400","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1390322400,"counter":623,"content":"<p>Will it be retrospective?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014012100008#G00500","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1390322400,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I do not know the answer to that but I will check.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014012100008#G00600","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1390322400,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I would ask that it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014012100008#G00700","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1390322400,"counter":626,"content":"<p>I have no difficulty if it is retrospective.

In terms of the income of local government, some years ago the motor taxation income was ring-fenced for the purposes of having a Local Government Fund.  That has largely proven to be the case.  I have figures from 2006 to 2014.  It is a sizeable amount of money &ndash; close to &euro;1.1 billion.  Basically, what appears to have happened is that in 2012, &euro;46.5 million was taken out of that and given to the Exchequer.  Last year &euro;100 million was given to the Exchequer and this year &euro;600 million is going from the Local Government Fund to the Exchequer.  What has happened is that a decision was taken to change the regime in terms of ring-fencing the motor taxation fund.  That fund is now going to the Exchequer.  The money is primarily going to pay the national debt &ndash; the &euro;8.2 billion it is costing this year to service the debt.  We must focus on that.  It is an enormous amount of money.<\/p><p>  The money is in addition to the &euro;490 million that is going from the local government system to Irish Water.  That is changing the dynamic hugely in terms of local government.  I wish to highlight the language that is being used on savings.  The language that is used refers to savings to the Exchequer in regard to the &euro;2 billion for water services.  The reason it is a saving to the Exchequer is because there is a new income stream, namely, domestic water charges.  The Minister might outline the extent of the domestic component he includes in that.  Some significant changes are taking place.  We got a presentation from both Ministers about what would be done but we did not hear about what will not be done.  I hear expectations all the time about what people are getting for the property tax, why they have to pay water charges and whether it is a conservation measure.  They are the two big issues people raise in terms of the impact of such taxes on their personal finances.<\/p><p>  The Minister&rsquo;s script referred to amalgamations at local government level such as of the Leader fund.  There has been a dramatic reduction in the Local Government Fund which will affect all of the functions carried out by local authorities such as libraries, arts, parks maintenance, playgrounds &ndash; where they exist - and street lighting.  The fund has been reducing year-on-year.  The allocation for the Local Government Fund is not evenly spread due to variations around the country in terms of the resources and the income from commercial rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014012100009#H01200","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390323600,"counter":671,"content":"<p>It is all on page 16 on the Revised Estimates briefing paper circulated to the committee.

I absolutely share her concern about the number of people waiting on housing waiting lists.  This is the reason that for the first time, the Government has introduced a mainstream construction programme through local authorities.  The Government was unable to do it heretofore.  It was not because it did not wish to do it but in recent years, it simply did not have the money because of the cut-back in the general amount of money available to the Government under the troika, following on from the debacle of what happened to the economy.  However, the Government now has a housing construction programme, of which &euro;65 million will go directly through the local authorities and &euro;35 million through the voluntary sector.  The programmes will be announced as soon as possible this year.<\/p><p>  I listened to Deputy Murphy specifically on the fact that a small number of local authorities have the largest number of people waiting.   I have specifically instructed in respect of this funding that there be a focus on those local authorities that have demonstrated the greatest need and the longest waiting lists.  I do not wish to spend the money where there are no problems but wish to spend it where the predominant problem exists in respect of housing supply.  This will be part of the policy pertaining to the expenditure of this money.  I am highly conscious that a number of local authorities have particularly long waiting lists.  As for the European money, Ireland has applied under the social investment programme of the European Union.  This European Investment Fund is under the European Investment Bank and we have applied for funding under the scheme.  If the Government gets this money, it expects it will provide approximately 1,500 units.  While a response has not yet been received, it was brought to the Government's attention that there were very few applications under that fund from Ireland over a number of years since the fund was set up.  In fact, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance now is a member of the governing board of the European Investment Bank.  The Government has been made aware that there were fewer applications from Ireland than should have been the case and an application now has been made that is specifically related to the housing sector.  I hope we will be successful in getting funding.<\/p><p>  The issue of homelessness is a top priority for me and I have stated that clearly.  I set up an oversight group, which has reported and I will bring a memorandum to the Cabinet shortly regarding its recommendations for addressing long-term homelessness in particular, as well as having a housing-led approach to it.  In respect of the involvement of the not-for-profit sector, there certainly is scope for it to become involved in this area and I am working with that sector in this regard.  The Government has now introduced voluntary regulation of the sector, which believes that if it is regulated, it will be better able to attract funding.  This now is under way and eventually will lead to statutory regulation but for the present, voluntary regulation applies and the sector is very supportive of this.<\/p><p>  Overall, the Government is addressing the housing supply issue in a number of areas, the main one being the return to mainstream construction, which obviously also is important for job creation, as well as applying for European funding.  There is another programme called the social impact investment programme, which is starting this year and which is geared specifically at families.  Again, it involves working with the voluntary sector and is geared towards addressing families in the Dublin area who have presented as being homeless.  The Department also wishes to expand this programme.  The Government is involved in a number of other areas and obviously, it continues to lease and to seek units from NAMA.  In addition, approximately 50% of those who are on housing waiting lists are in receipt of rent supplement through the Department of Social Protection and thereby are in receipt of some housing support.  There will be a gradual movement onto the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, which I acknowledge the sub-committee does not have time to go into today.  I accept it is a question of addressing the growing waiting lists and that there are real problems with such waiting lists.  However, the Government is addressing this in a variety of ways and the construction of housing is the new element this year.  There had been construction for people with special needs, for older people and those who are homeless but the construction programme will now revert to being a mainstream local authority programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014012100011#K01100","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1390324200,"counter":699,"content":"<p>Three questioners remain and I will take them together, namely, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, Deputy Kevin Humphreys and Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014012100011#K01200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1390324200,"counter":700,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, the Ministers of State and their officials for their attendance this afternoon.  On the local government section, will each new municipal district will have the opportunity to strike its own rate at its own level?  In the past, they would have struck the rate but some councillors have suggested that flexibility be provided for start-up businesses in particular, perhaps in the retail sector. One might start off with 10% of the rate in the first year, perhaps rising to 30% of the rate in the second year and so on, until reaching 100% by year four or year five.  Will such flexibility be included?  If so, it will be welcomed by many of the new municipal districts, which will be welcoming the additional powers under the legislation.<\/p><p>  In respect of water services and wastewater, I welcome the establishment of Irish Water and have listened with interest to some of the comments.  It is greatly welcome that it now will be amenable to freedom of information requests.  It also is welcome that since the presentation last week and the presentations by the Ministers and Department, there is clarity on the source of the funding and on what it is being spent.  Irish Water has been clear in that regard.  I also note the negative commentary in respect of consultants and contractors.  When one considers the companies that have been asked to provide the processes and systems, the list includes IT specialists and architects.  I make the observation that one is talking about young people working in those companies and it does them no favours to be disparaging about the work they are doing.  In addition, political footballs have been kicked around at this meeting for the past hour or so and it is only right that I pick it up and kick it back.  It is welcome to hear Fianna F&aacute;il members talk about their concerns regarding spending.  However, I remind them of the messes they left behind.  I think of one in particular that pertains to the environment, namely, electronic voting machines, and I note that at least one company in County Offaly benefitted from dismantling them.  That project certainly gave no value for the taxpayer.  However, I feel strongly about the companies involved and some of the young people working therein.  It is not right to be so disparaging about the work they are doing on behalf of Irish Water.  While it is absolutely clear that it is very important to get value for the taxpayers' money, the testimony the witnesses gave last week from Bord G&aacute;is makes clear the amount of savings it has been possible to put in place for the taxpayer, based on existing services, such as software contracts and so on, which I greatly welcome.  Every effort should be made to ensure a smooth transition from the local authorities because they contain great expertise in this regard.<\/p><p>  On the community and rural development aspect of the Estimate, I greatly welcome the funding that has been provided.  On the transitional arrangements to be put in place under the new local community development committees, what does the Minister hope to do for this year in order to have it up and running by January 2015?  Coming from the midlands and a rural area, I note these Leader and community development schemes have been really critical to capacity building in these areas.  It will be of critical importance to continue with such capacity-building activities, particularly now when opportunities are to be put in place for retraining and to continue with such schemes.  I greatly welcome this development and seek information on the transitional arrangements.<\/p><p>  I will turn to the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and the unfinished estates.  I have been following this issue with great interest even though County Offaly does not have a huge number of such estates, although there are some.

Depending on the fullness of the answers we can see whether the new system operates.  Those questions are on their way to the Minister.<\/p><p>  In the six target urban areas Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned, my experience is that the vast majority of landlords are leaving the rental accommodation scheme because they can get a lot of money in the private sector.  In urban areas in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway there has been a major exodus.  Can we examine ring-fencing that funding to target social housing?  If it cannot be spent in the rental accommodation scheme we need the flexibility to shift the money into other areas to provide accommodation.  Has much of the &euro;15 million carry over of capital funding already been pre-committed?<\/p><p>  According to page 39, more and more voluntary housing systems are being developed as the model to provide social housing, yet we are still using the RAPID programme to specify disadvantaged areas for applying for funding.  The flaw in the RAPID system is that it excludes people in the rental accommodation system or in voluntary housing.  Many communities are under pressure because they have people in voluntary housing.  In my constituency one of the very clear examples is the Iveagh Trust.  People housed by the trust are not accounted for in the RAPID system because it is not deemed to be social housing.  The Iveagh Trust provides a huge number of social units in an area of deprivation in the city and has been left out of many funding projects.  That whole area has been left out of targeted funding projects for deprived areas.  Should we still be using a model that was designed ten or 12 years ago?  Does it need to be updated?<\/p><p>  The Minister was going to establish an expert advisory group on climate change on an <i>ad hoc<\/i> basis until we can get a statutory situation.

All they can go on is whether they are confident in the person who is running it.  The Minister must be aware of Mr. Tierney's past record.  Why is he still in the job?<\/p><p>  Have some of the people on whom the Minister is spending this money already received money from the local authorities through retirement packages?  If so, how much have they received?  An important question that was not asked of Irish Water is whether we will be able to drink the water and what systems are being implemented so that local authorities do not continue to investigate themselves.<\/p><p>  The Minister has informed us that if someone is aware that there is a possible problem with his or her septic tank and does not do something about it, he or she is committing a criminal act.  If people do not have money to do something about it, can they apply for a grant or do they need to come out of the tombola, have their tank tested and fail it, following which they are then entitled to a grant?<\/p><p>  On the issue of solutions to our water pollution problems, what beginning-of-pipe solutions is the Minister considering?  There is a problem with testing the septic tanks.  Has the Minister examined the idea of locally run, community based anaerobic digesters for animal waste as a solution to the problem that the only way the Government can secure drinkable water is if it doses the water with chlorine and numerous other chemicals?  It passes the test but, bar swimming in it, it does not seem to be much use to us.  The Minister will come up with some system that will solve all this.  If we cannot drink the water, will we have to pay for it again?  We are already paying for it through general taxation.<\/p><p>  I will be very pleased if freedom of information legislation is to apply in this area but it is a little inconsistent with another semi-State entity, Coillte.  If would be easier to get information out of the Kremlin.  The Minister is running the country and does not seem to be too bothered about the fact that there is no freedom of information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014012100012#L01100","speaker":"1084"},{"type":"speech","time":1390324800,"counter":712,"content":"<p>The Minister to reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014012100012#L01200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1390324800,"counter":713,"content":"<p>There seems to have been hundreds of millions of euro spent on rent allowance at a time when the Government could refurbish some of the houses with some of the money involved.

The commercial rate will be struck by the county or city authority, not by the municipal district.  However, the municipal district members will be members of the plenary session when that happens, whatever municipal district they are from.  If they want to have certain enterprise initiatives at local authority level, offhand I am not sure what discretion they will have in terms of commercial rates, there is nothing stopping these municipal districts or local authorities generally proposing these initiatives, as they do.  For example, the bid scheme in Cork County Council is working exceptionally well, as is the bid scheme in Dublin City.  These are examples of where the community comes into partnership with local authorities to advance certain enterprise schemes or develop certain enterprise initiatives.  Arising from the changes we are making in local authorities, we want to see local authorities more to the front and centre in regard to enterprise, particularly in regard to promoting small businesses.<\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the word \"consultant\" and I agree it was an unfortunate use of word that did not tell the full story in regard to all of the start-up costs required for any public utility.  We needed an ESB, we needed an EirGrid, we needed An Bord G&aacute;is and we needed this public water utility.  As I said earlier to Deputy Cowen, 90% of these costs will be assets of the company.  These costs are necessary to have the asset management systems and for us to sweat down those assets in order to deliver good value.<\/p><p>  Let me give an example.  Shannon has a very bad situation in terms of waste water treatment systems currently.  Effectively, nobody can connect in to the system there and if we wanted a new foreign direct investment to come into that area, it would be very difficult.  Irish Water is  looking at innovative ways to deal with this, at least temporarily, over the next five to seven years, with a low cost model, pending the new moneys that will come on stream in the future that will mean it can do a much better job.  This is one of the new ways we can tide ourselves over, considering the fact the European Commission is considering launching a new infringement procedure in regard to 80 such plants, which is a concern.<\/p><p>  The local community development committees which will be and are being established will be the partnerships between local authorities and the communities in terms of operating the local development programmes and new EU funded programmes under the rural development programme.  I expect that after the local elections in July, all of these committees will be in place.  The timescale for the next round is early 2015 and we are working currently on the new plans to be submitted to the European Commission for approval, now that we got agreement in Brussels with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine who is responsible for acquiring the funds for us for the rural development side, just before Christmas.  We are working away at official level with the authorities in Brussels to fine tune the next round and we will come back to this committee to talk about the principles that should underpin this new round of funds.  In regard to the European Regional Development Fund, we are also trying to include an urban based model so that we can accentuate some of the good work that is going on in the context of local development companies. <\/p><p>  I can confirm for Deputy Humphreys that we will shortly set up the expert group on climate change and put in place the necessary arrangements and funding to make that happen.  I will also make a statement soon on the progress we are making on the climate Bill.  We will take into account some of the important issues raised in committee hearings when discussing the heads of the Bill.<\/p><p>  In response to Deputy Flanagan, there was open competition for all senior management positions in Irish Water, including Mr. Tierney's position.  He got through the interval panel and he has my full confidence and support for what he is trying to do.  He has a very difficult job in setting up a new utility company, but there are governance arrangements in place for the board and he must report to a board whose members have good skills, including people with legal and governance expertise.  He will report to these people.  The chairperson of that board is Rose Hynes, who was chairperson of Bord G&aacute;is also and she has significant experience in terms of public accountability and governance arrangements in regard to any managing director.<\/p><p>  I do not need to tell Deputy Flanagan about the situation regarding the water supply in Roscommon, as he is aware of the situation as he indicated in a colourful manner to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014012100013#M00400","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1390325400,"counter":718,"content":"<p>It was much appreciated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN12014012100013#M00500","speaker":"1084"},{"type":"speech","time":1390325400,"counter":719,"content":"<p>However, the Deputy did not acknowledge that we are now, at last, making an investment there.

I would see it as very unfair for the regulator not to take these issues into account until such time as the quality of the water in Roscommon is up to the type of standard we should have.  We will include this as part of our submission.<\/p><p>  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is the regulator in regard to drinking water quality.

That is my experience of the EPA.  Despite the best will in the world, it is very difficult for people to investigate themselves.  Let us imagine a member of the public makes a complaint to the EPA in the context of water quality.  People in this country do not like making complaints like this, although they should be proud to do it.  However, if and when they make a complaint about a council supply, they see that the council itself investigates the matter.

We expect that funding will also be a stimulus for private funding to be spent on estates like that referred to by Deputy Flanagan.  We expect that if the lenders and developers see there is money coming in from public funds, they will spend money on completing houses etc.  We attend to spend that money in 2014 to address the issues on some estates.

The banks regularly come before another committee to discuss the issue of mortgage resolution.  The vast majority of shared ownership mortgages are in arrears and the figures we are beginning to receive from local authorities show they are also in arrears on rent on the 50% owned by local authorities.  This is a huge distress factor for the individuals themselves because they are concerned they cannot meet their mortgage repayments and are not able to meet the rental element either.  There seems to be an unwillingness to resolve this issue.  There is no provision in the Estimate for a resolution to these mortgages.  These were all high-risk mortgages in the first instance because they had to have had two refusals from lending agencies.  It is a real drag on local authorities because they are making full repayments to the Housing Finance Agency.  The Housing Finance Agency has provision for bad debts or write down.  Is the write down on the mortgage the responsibility of the Department or the Housing Finance Agency?  A large number of families are in a very delicate situation.  It is also causing problems for local authority funding, but there seems to be no resolution for these individuals.

I am pleased to have this opportunity to outline the principal features of the 2014 Estimates for my Department.<\/p><p>  Members of the House will be aware that my Department oversees and has policy responsibility for the conservation, preservation, protection, development and presentation of Ireland's heritage and. culture.  My Department also seeks to promote the Irish language, to support the Gaeltacht and to assist the sustainable development of island communities.  A gross provision of almost &euro;264<b><\/b>million is available to my Department for these purposes in 2014.  A further &euro;10.5 million - some &euro;6.7 million in current funding and almost &euro;3.9 million in capital funding - is provided through Vote 34 for the National Gallery.<br \/><b><\/b>In broad terms, the 2014 allocations to my Vote group are as follows: over &euro;148 million<b><\/b>for arts, culture and film, including almost &euro;57 million<b><\/b>for the Arts Council; over &euro;45 million for the conservation and protection of Ireland's built and natural heritage; more than &euro;41 million for the Irish language, the Gaeltacht and the islands; and over &euro;39 million<b><\/b>for North-South co-operation, including support for two North-South implementation bodies, Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga.<\/p><p>  As members will appreciate, as a consequence of the need to meet challenging fiscal targets we have just not had the resources available in recent years to fund all the services that we would like to provide.  While the 2014 allocations again reflect the Government's commitment to restoring confidence in our public finances, I welcome in particular the provision of almost &euro;25 million to my Department in respect of economic stimulus measures announced on budget day.  My Department makes a significant contribution to supporting economic activity and employment across the country, both in the sectors that it directly supports and equally in the context of cultural tourism.  The new jobs rich initiatives being funded underline the importance of the role arts and heritage can play in both job creation and economic recovery and will make a considerable positive impact on the arts and heritage sectors throughout 2014.  These initiatives include &euro;10 million for the Cork civic event centre; &euro;6 million for the Limerick National City of Culture 2014; &euro;5 million for the traditional skills and buildings at risk jobs leverage scheme 2014; and &euro;3.7 million for projects relating to the decade of centenaries 1912-1922.<\/p><p>  I will now provide some further detail in respect of the key areas of expenditure under my direct responsibility.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Dinny McGinley, will speak about the relevant aspects of the Gaeltacht, Irish language and islands programmes.<\/p><p>  Some &euro;148.5<b><\/b>million has been allocated to the arts, culture and film subheads, including the National Gallery, this year.  This increased funding, which amounts to more than &euro;2.8 million per week, makes an important contribution to protecting jobs and stimulating creativity across the country.  Ireland's cultural and creative industries also play a major role in defining a positive image for Ireland abroad.  My Department continues to place emphasis on front-line services, as well as on prioritising supports to artists.<\/p><p>  With regard to film making activities, I was very pleased that the Minister for Finance, in his 2014 budget speech, confirmed his intention to bring forward the new regime for film tax reliefs to 2015 and also to extend the definition of &quot;eligible individual&quot; within the scheme to include non-EU talent.  This will significantly increase the attractiveness of Ireland as a destination for film investment.  The extension of the film tax relief scheme, section 481, until the end of 2020 represented a major vote of confidence in the audiovisual production sector by the Government.  It provides the sector with continuity and certainty for the future and allows projects to proceed in the knowledge that this important underpinning of the industry will be there for the next seven years.<\/p><p>  Given the significant investment in arts infrastructure in recent years, the focus now is to ensure that resources are made available to support the operation of those facilities.  Nevertheless, a number of significant projects will continue to be funded in 2014 including, for example, the Solas cinema project in Galway and the West Cork Arts Centre in Skibbereen, County Cork.  An additional &euro;10 million<b><\/b>in funding is being provided to fund the redevelopment of the National Gallery historic wings over the course of 2014 to 2016.  A provision of &euro;1 million is to be provided in 2014, with the remainder in 2015 and 2016.  This project will ensure that the gallery's important collections can be shown and protected in an appropriate forum.  It will also enable the gallery to host international exhibitions and, in the longer term, to increase its contribution towards the country's cultural tourism offering.<\/p><p>  The valuable work of the Arts Council in supporting the intrinsic cultural, tourism and economic value of the arts throughout the country has been recognised, and this is reflected in the 2014 current allocation of almost &euro;57 million which will allow the council to continue to support arts organisations of varying sizes, from national bodies such as the Abbey Theatre to small, locally-based groups, across a very broad range of individual art forms and arts practices.<\/p><p>  Culture Ireland, a division of the Department, will continue to promote Irish artists worldwide with the aim of showcasing our world-class strengths in culture and creativity and restoring Ireland's global reputation.  When I announced a new national city of culture initiative last year it was with the aim of delivering a programme of cultural events and engagement in a city for one year, but which also has a longer-term positive impact.  With &euro;6 million in capital funding available, this programme represents a highly significant investment in the arts in the mid-west.  The allocation offers Limerick a fantastic opportunity to unlock the tremendous creativity that has been associated with the city and to put on a programme of events of national importance.<\/p><p>  The funding of the decade of centenaries is also significant, as it allows us to move ahead with the planning and implementation of major building projects to mark the centenary of the 1916 Rising.  The Government is also providing &euro;10 million in funding for a multi-functional event centre in Cork city.  This project has the potential to provide a significant economic and employment boost to Cork city and county and my Department will work with the city council to progress the project as promptly as possible.<\/p><p>  Some &euro;10.5 million<b><\/b>is provided to the Vote of the National Gallery in addition to the &euro;138 million in funding provided for the arts, culture and film sector by my Department.  In 2014, the gallery will continue to focus on delivering the best service possible within the resources available.<\/p><p>  Funding of some &euro;45.3 million<b><\/b>has been made available for the Department's heritage programme<b>.  <\/b>This includes almost &euro;33 million allocated for current expenditure with a further &euro;12.5 million<b><\/b>in capital funding.  Funding will continue to be made available to support the work of the Heritage Council in its redefined role, the principal function of which will be in the areas of facilitating the grant-aiding of heritage from various sources and engaging with and supporting local government and communities in capacity building and support.  The Department will continue to provide support, protection and advisory services for Ireland's built and archaeological heritage.  This includes policy input in support of cross-governmental sustainability objectives.  With regard to natural heritage, the key outputs in 2014 will focus on the maintenance, development, management and operation of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and meeting obligations under EU directives.<\/p><p>  With regard to capital expenditure, the allocation of &euro;5 million on heritage buildings as part of my Department's stimulus measures is the most significant investment in heritage buildings in Ireland in recent times.  The built heritage job leverage scheme will allow for urgent repairs on protected heritage buildings to take place across the country, improving our heritage stock, adding to Ireland's attractiveness as a place to live and work, and generating employment in the construction and skilled crafts trades.<\/p><p>  I also welcome the decision to extend the living city initiative, introduced last year, to Cork, Galway, Kilkenny and Dublin, for all buildings built prior to 1915.  This incentive targets Ireland's historic building stock.  It is a tangible example of the Government's commitment to sustainable development, so we do not repeat the mistakes of the past, and it focuses on our existing urban core.  This scheme, which complements the new investment scheme in the built heritage jobs leverage scheme, will ensure that Ireland's major urban cities are enhanced, continue to have vibrant city centres, and encourage increased tourism and direct inward investment.<\/p><p>  Other capital expenditure in 2014 will focus on two main areas - peatland protection and national park investment.  The protection of Ireland's unique raised bog special areas of conservation is a key concern, as is the avoidance of major fines by the Court of Justice of the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22014012100003#B00100","speaker":"1046","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390313400,"counter":795,"content":"<p>Is m&oacute;r agam an deis seo a fh&aacute;il inniu Meastach&aacute;in 2014 sna r&eacute;ims&iacute; Gaeilge, Gaeltachta agus oile&aacute;n do mo Roinn a phl&eacute; leis an roghchoiste.

I will begin with the issue of heritage.  It is important to acknowledge that the Minister deserves to be commended.  While the arts and cultural heritage have an obvious intrinsic value - something of which we were conscious in the context of the recent controversy in Limerick - it is nonetheless worthwhile, valuable and important to emphasise the employment opportunities and economic activity that can flow from the proper development of arts, cultural and heritage resources.  To some extent, this is at play in the Estimates, in which there are two figures in respect of the stimulus package available.  The figure of &euro;18 million is mentioned in one location, while in his presentation the Minister mentioned a figure of &euro;25 million.  Will he give us some indication of how he sees this money being invested and leveraging other funds from the private sector to generate some sustainable employment in particular areas?<\/p><p>  On a number of occasions here we have welcomed the security the Government has brought to film production and the work of the Irish Film Board.  The investment being made is supported by the arts community and the public.  Given that we have had many years of public investment in film and television production, are we or when will we begin to see some return from that investment to the Exchequer?  I am astonished to read in the document circulated to us the number of films produced with State aid.  I commend all those involved and Bord Scann&aacute;n &Eacute;ireann for the work they have been doing.<\/p><p>  Expenditure in respect of the National Gallery of Ireland and the national museums is covered by the Estimates.  It is unfortunate that there has been a massive cutback of &euro;740,000 in the funding available for regional centres such as galleries, cultural centres and museums.  I know we are in difficult times, but the value of these centres is enormous.  They are greatly valued by the communities in which they are located.  To return to the point made by the Minister, there are also valuable economic outflows from investment in this area.  Are we, therefore, being penny wise and pound foolish in depriving these art centres of the funding they require?<\/p><p>  The allocation to the Arts Council has seen radical reductions in recent years.  The Minister now sets out where the focus will be in spending.  One element that has caught my eye is that funding will be concentrated on building based organisations.  What exactly does the Minister have in mind in that regard?  <\/p><p>  I welcome the provision of &euro;10 million, albeit spread over three years, for the work on the redevelopment of the historic wings of the National Gallery of Ireland.  When we see the numbers visiting the gallery, we know that work needs to be done.  We can appreciate what is being done in it.<\/p><p>  In regard to the national city of culture initiative, we will refrain from getting into a debate on the situation in Limerick and the unfortunate developments there.  The city of culture initiative is really worthwhile.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22014012100005#D00300","speaker":"1054","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390314600,"counter":800,"content":"<p>It is 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22014012100006#E00200","speaker":"1046"},{"type":"speech","time":1390314600,"counter":801,"content":"<p>That is even worse.  Could consideration be given to the nomination of city of culture on an annual or biannual basis?<\/p><p>  The investment in built heritage and the Living City initiative are really positive things.  Cork, Galway, Kilkenny and Dublin have been prioritised.  Is it intended that the living cities initiative will be extended?  How does the Minister envisage that the leverage system that he mentioned with regard to work on buildings of heritage or architectural value will work?  Does he plan to include other cities or large towns in the initiative?<\/p><p>  I would like to mention in passing the real tragedy that is befalling this country's heritage.  The loss of our thatched houses, which I have raised with the Minister previously, is certainly a reality in Leinster.  When one drives around the countryside, one notices that the last ten years were particularly devastating for this country's stock of thatched properties.  Sort sort of radical initiative will have to be taken if we are to sustain the small number of remaining thatched properties.  The relevant local authority, as the planning authority, might have to get involved directly.<\/p><p>  We are all conscious of the controversy surrounding the peatlands work that has been done.  Obviously, the Department has relocated turf cutters and tried to meet their needs.  Can the Minister give us details of the precise cost that has been incurred in all of that to date?<\/p><p>  The Minister referred to the possibility of adding Irish sites to the lost of world heritage sites.  I think Clonmacnoise has been mentioned in this context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22014012100006#E00300","speaker":"1054"},{"type":"speech","time":1390314600,"counter":802,"content":"<p>It was being suggested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22014012100006#E00400","speaker":"1046"},{"type":"speech","time":1390314600,"counter":803,"content":"<p>Has a shortlist of priority sites been drawn up?

He has raised a number of important questions.  The stimulus package can generally broken down as involving &euro;10 million for the centre in Cork, &euro;5 million for the employment leverage fund, &euro;6 million for Limerick and approximately &euro;3.8 million for the GPO project and the development of Teach an Phiarsaigh in Connemara.  That is a general breakdown of the &euro;25 million spend.  All of the projects are very worthwhile.  The contribution from the sale of the National Lottery has been welcomed in those areas.  We are fortunate to have it in our Estimates for this year.<\/p><p>  The film incentives that were published by the Minister in the recent budget have created broad interest in the film community.  They seem to be attracting a great deal of interest already.  It appears that we will do very well in the film festivals this year.  Films like \"Calvary\" and \"Frank\" are getting very good reviews.  We are doing very well in the Sundance Film Festival, which is taking place at present.  It is possible that a number of Irish actors will be in line for Oscars as well.  The film industry is very buoyant at the moment despite the cutbacks at the Irish Film Board.  I am encouraged that so much talent is emerging at production and other levels.  We have a number of young producers and some really exciting new male and female actors.  It is quite encouraging.  There is a very good technical base in this country in areas like cinematography, costume design and set-making.  I hope that this rich source of technical expertise will land some major films for us in the near future.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked about the return in this area.  It is generally estimated that the film and audiovisual industry is worth over &euro;500 million to Ireland.  A report on the creative industries that we produced over two years ago sets out objectives of increasing that figure to &euro;1 billion and of employing 10,000 people.  At the moment, over 6,500 people - full-time equivalents - are involved in the film industry.  There is a major payback on the small amount of money we are investing in the film industry.  The Irish Film Board is one of the most efficient boards in the country.  It employs approximately 18 people, including a chief executive.  This streamlined and focused organisation has been recognised in Cannes and at other film festivals for the good work it is doing.  The film industry is quite vibrant at present.  The animation industry, which turns over approximately &euro;60 million a year, is making major progress as well.  It is growing because it attracts younger people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22014012100006#E00800","speaker":"1046","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390315800,"counter":809,"content":"<p>Arda&iacute;odh ceist maidir le seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; iompar chuig na hoile&aacute;in.

This process has been going on for a considerable number of years, but it is not clear what the obstacles are in terms of advancing designation.  The Minister mentioned fears that have been communicated to him - I have heard similar concerns - from individuals concerned by the planning implications in terms of designation of a world heritage site.  To be frank, the value and richness of our cultural heritage should take priority over some of these concerns, some of which may not be entirely legitimate.  It would be helpful if we could alleviate those concerns in some way.  Are these concerns contributing to the delay in designation of these sites or to the delay in advancing these projects to the next phase?<\/p><p>  In page 29 of the document, the Minister referred to the decade of centenaries and stated that priority will be given to a limited number of capital projects acknowledging the Easter Rising and the birth of the Republic.

There is a change in governance, with the city and county areas amalgamating, which is seen as a seismic change.  The regeneration implementation group requested that it receive the designation this year to help with the process.  That was the reason.  I said Limerick city of culture would be treated more or less as a pilot project, but from now on there will be an open competition.  Originally, we thought we would hold it every two years.  This would have taken in 1916, which will be a major year of culture.  We thought people would need a longer run-in, but if the regeneration implementation group had sought to cover 2015 or 2016, we would have granted its request.  It is a coincidence that this is a major year for Limerick and the cultural sector was seen as another facilitator in the regeneration of Limerick.  In the future the city of culture designation will be based on an open competition which will be launched shortly.  I hope to announce the next city of culture at the closing event of the Limerick city of culture programme.  There is interest in other cities.<\/p><p>  In 2020 we will mark the European city of culture in Ireland and there will be a major competition for it.  This will help cities to focus on their applications for designation as European city of culture.  The last Irish city chosen was Cork in 2005.  Dublin has been chosen previously.  We hope the designation in Ireland will focus city on the strength of their applications.  The emphasis will very much be on arts and culture and the events planned for the year.  Community involvement will be very important, particularly among local arts practitioners.  When there were issues with the Limerick board, I requested members of the arts community to be brought on board and they have responded.<\/p><p>  Fostering creativity is important as one of the criteria set.  Limerick is promoting itself as a technology hub.  Those promoting it see culture as an intrinsic part of promoting Limerick as a technology hub and centre of creativity.  There will be an application system which will be put in place shortly.  We will announce it this year such that there will be a three year run-in to 2018 and it is already attracting attention.<\/p><p>  The Living City initiative has created much interest.  The Heritage Council carried out a review of how to make towns and population centres more attractive to live in.  The review which ties in with the Living City initiative was carried out by Mr. Peter Bacon.  I launched the report last week and it gives a very good insight into how effective the Living City initiative can be.  We will carry out an overview of its effectiveness and what it yields in terms of conservation, preservation, job creation and a return to the Exchequer.  If it meets these challenges and withstands the economic tests, I will promote its continuation and extension to other areas beyond those specified.<\/p><p>  A number of issues have arisen regarding Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne.  My Department met Louth County Council and the local community in considering an updated management plan for Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne.  The current plan is out of date and the most difficult issue concerns planning and how the needs of local communities can be met without putting the world heritage status at risk.  Engagement is ongoing on the new management plan for Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne and other areas.  Planning is the central issue.  Families living on the periphery are concerned that they may not receive planning permission in the future because the zone outside the site has been frozen.  If it could be loosened up, it would allay the fears of those who are concerned about the matter.  This applies particularly to Clonmacnoise and the C&eacute;ide Fields, but several more sites could be designated.  I have a particular interest in the issue on which I will continue to work.<\/p><p>  With regard to expenditure on the decade of commemoration, including the 1916 Rising, the capital projects that will progress will be completed by 2016.  They include the GPO which will have a major cultural and interpretive centre located within it.  There has been considerable planning and the artefacts are in place.  A vast number of artefacts remain from 1916.  Last week, at the launch of the military pensions archive, we saw the amount of information available that had not been made public before.  There is the capacity to have something exciting that will not only honour the people of 1916 but also provide a major boost for the GPO and O'Connell Street.  It will result in a high footfall and could rejuvenate that part of the city.<\/p><p>  Another ongoing development is the enhancement of Kilmainham Courthouse, a fine architectural building in Kilmainham Gaol.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22014012100009#H00200","speaker":"1046","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390317000,"counter":816,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, Minister of State and their officials for coming in this afternoon.  In regard to heritage, one of the best moves made was the appointment of heritage officers in each county council.  One of the disadvantages of the downturn is that they have had less money to distribute.<\/p><p>  I very much welcome the buildings at risk leverage scheme and the provision of &euro;5 million.  I know a number of people who own buildings at risk and, in many ways, they have been victims of the downturn.  One of the criteria attaching to the application for funding under the buildings at risk leverage scheme is that they must provide matching funding up to the maximum of &euro;15,000.  Will the Minister consider revising that because some of those people who are genuinely in possession of key structures may not be able to match funding to that level and yet they would need that level and possibly more?  Will the Minister consider that where people are able to prove they cannot match that funding?  Overall, I very much welcome that scheme.  <\/p><p>  The Arts Council has been under-funded for years, even at the height of the boom.  The developmental work it is doing in terms of the arts is second to none.  It should be commended on what it is doing.  I am a little worried that the reason for the reduction is that it is to focus its support on the clients' artistic rather than administrative needs.  Many of its clients, in particular smaller companies, would perhaps need the assistance of administrators to help with application forms and so on and I am a little worried that might have a negative impact on them.  I would very much appreciate it if the Minister explained the thinking around that.<\/p><p>  I refer to the funding of our national institutions.  I do not believe I have ever got in free to museums or to various other institutions abroad.  I have noticed that if a particular project is being developed, such institutions have a donations box.  Is this something at which we should consider in the National Gallery and the National Museum, which are outstanding resources for ourselves and for visitors.  Would it be possible to have a donations box discretely but visibly placed?  International travellers are used to paying for things, so a donations box could be a good way to raise some money.  I would like to know if that has been examined.<\/p><p>  I very much welcome developments in regard to Irish Film Board, the continued support for section 481 and the work the film board is doing in supporting film-making.  We have some very fine people involved in the film-making business and they are tremendous ambassadors for us internationally.  However, I would like to know if any consideration is being given to encouraging the Irish Film Board to focus on regional film-making.  I see the benefit of regional film commissions, one of which I am involved in, and those involved would like it to be developed throughout the country.  Has the Irish Film Board been requested to examine the potential of supporting regional film-making?  <\/p><p>  The philanthropy scheme was a great idea.  What has been the uptake?  It has been on the go for a year and half.<\/p><p>  Culture Night and the City of Culture are great initiatives.  The fact Culture Night has gone nationwide has really added something new to the calendar culturally and artistically in rural and urban areas.  It is a date in almost everybody's diary and I very much support it.  I also very much support the City of Culture initiative, which has great potential.  In the future, I suppose people will vie for it but I would like to see it extended to county towns as well as cities.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge the work done by the Peatlands Council and commend the two chairs, Mr. Conor Skehan and Mr. S&eacute;amus Boland, and all of the stakeholders on their very responsible and constructive approach to dealing with this matter.  The Minister mentioned the cost to date but does he have a total figure on what it will cost or is there a fixed budget for it in the short term to solve the problems throughout the country?  <\/p><p>  In regard to Waterways Ireland, a consultation process is underway to review regulations and costs.  I am a little concerned by some matters raised with me by users of the waterways, in particular the canals, for leisure and recreational purposes and whether these will cause more problems.  They are concerned about having to move their boats on a more regular basis and the costs involved.  Will that have a negative impact on tourists and indigenous users?  Is there a reason for doing this?  Is it to bring us into line with Northern Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22014012100010#J00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speech","time":1390317000,"counter":817,"content":"<p>I agree with what the Deputy said about the Heritage Council and the heritage officers.  This year we were able to slightly increase our funding to the Heritage Council, taking into consideration the very important work it is doing and to ensure it can continue to support heritage officers.  In regard to the whole area of matching funding for buildings at risk, we are trying to spread the &euro;5 million as far as possible.  The more generous the grant the less funding there is for distribution.  When one breaks it down based on population per county and the number of protected structures in each county, which we are doing, the amount is quite small when distributed to each local authority.  We are trying to leverage as much funding as we can for this scheme.  We will keep it under review.  The reason we have had such a short lead-in time was to encourage people to apply as soon as possible, so work could be carried out and we could evaluate the scheme at the end of the year and perhaps look for more funding next year to continue with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22014012100010#J00300","speaker":"1046","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390317600,"counter":819,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and now call Deputy Cowen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22014012100011#K00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1390317600,"counter":820,"content":"<p>I thank both the Minister and Minister for State for their presentations and for answering questions on various departmental programmes.  The Minister said that in the past year, over &euro;7 million was spent on relocation expenses, compensation and so forth.  In the context of the CAP, there was a hope or an expectation that there would be some funding that could be allocated to those landowners whose holdings include special areas of conservation, SACs, but who are paid very little to leave as is.  It was hoped that environmental funds within the CAP budget could be geared in their direction to address issues such as maintenance, flood control and other issues in those SACs.  That would then be more akin to the type of compensation deemed necessary or appropriate for those landowners who have many acres which are designated as SACs and from which they derive very little income.  Such landowners do not have the same options as those who have turf banks in the context of relocation expenses and compensation.  For example, if a landowner has four acres it has a certain value and to be compensated with a turf bank at another location is not adequate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22014012100011#K00300","speaker":"1101","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390318200,"counter":822,"content":"<p>I wish to address the targets set in the Estimates.  The target for 2013 was to end turf cutting on raised bogs.  That target was missed on what the Minister terms SSE raised bogs and what I call \"so-called SSEs\".  For how much longer will he continue to kid himself, given that there are 9,000 turbary rights land owners on the 53 so-called SSEs and that after 18 years of coercion or trying to convince people - a phenomenal level of scaremongering - only 796 landowners out of the total of 9,000 with turbary rights have followed what he has tried to get them to do?  When does he think he will have the issue resolved?<\/p><p>  The Minister mentions - in fairness to him, it has been very carefully worded - that he accepts that none of the 53 so-called SSEs has seen successful relocations.  This is borne out by the statement that three groups on three bogs have accepted relocation, but after all this time, since 1997 - some say as far back as 1992 - none of the issues has been resolved.  There is a variety of reasons for this, but the major reason is that people would like to have something similar to replace what they have; it is a case of it being like for like.  The reason this will not work, even in 1,000 years - the same reason applies to the 45 NHAs that the Minister is considering de-designating within three years and having everyone involved agree to relocation - is that the authorities must learn the lesson that until one offers like for like, one will not arrive at a solution.  Whether it be a house, bog or any piece of property or land, if one does not offer like for like, one will not get a deal.  If somebody was to come to the door of a city dweller to tell him or her that he or she had to get out of the house, he or she would be annoyed.  It might be easier to accept if a person was told he or she might be given another house, but if a person were to discover that after 65 years, he or she or his or her family had to leave the house, he or she would not accept it.  Unless the Minister offers like for like, the deal will never be accepted.  The Minister can keep trying to convince people it is working and set himself a target of 2014-16 to stop them cutting turf on the so-called SSEs, but until he plays ball and does things fairly, that will never happen.  <\/p><p>  On the issue of commemorating the 1916 Rising, I suggest the best way to do so would be to allow people to cut turf without dragging them through the courts and calling them bad citizens and criminals.  The best way to celebrate the centenary of the 1916 Rising is not with a load of fluff but a dose of reality.  Let me say one thing for sure: I will go and cut turf in 2016, as will many others.  The target date of 2013 was not achieved and the target date of 2014 will not be achieved until the Minister treats people fairly.  Otherwise, the memory of the 1916 Rising will only ever be a memory and we will have learned nothing of what those involved stood for - freedom.  There is no freedom to be gained in what the Minister is offering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EN22014012100012#L00300","speaker":"1084"},{"type":"speech","time":1390318200,"counter":823,"content":"<p>I did not have an opportunity to attend earlier as I was in the Chair.

As Members will be aware, the 2014 Revised Estimate was presented to the D&aacute;il in the new programme-based format.  This means that the Revised Estimate, as presented, contains the following information for each programme: how it is proposed to spend the money allocated to this programme and the previous year's outturn in each case; the number of staff assigned to work on the programme and how this compares with the previous year; performance-related information; departmental outputs, again with corresponding information for previous years; and what are termed \"performance\" and \"impact\" indicators with previous years' information.  Administrative expenditure for the Vote as a whole is summarised in more detail than was previously the case.  <\/p><p>  The Revised Estimate provides us with an opportunity to review whether targets set and the distribution of moneys across the Vote for 2014 are appropriate in all the circumstances and demonstrate best use of resources.

It allows for the Minister and all spokespersons to make a ten minute opening statement, which will be followed by a debate on the 2014 Revised Estimate, with questions on each programme listed therein.  As this is the Minister's first appearance before us this year, I take this opportunity to wish her and her officials a happy and prosperous new year and invite her to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22014012100003#B00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1390324500,"counter":837,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for this opportunity to discuss the 2014 Revised Estimates for Vote 40 of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p><p>  Under the Revised Estimates for 2014, my Department has been allocated funding of &euro;997 million, which includes more than &euro;955 million in current funding and &euro;42 million in capital funding.  When appropriation-in-aid receipts of just over &euro;22.8 million are taken into account, the net current funding allocated to my Department in 2014 is &euro;974.3 million.  This level of funding represents an increase of more than &euro;558 million on the 2013 Estimate of &euro;439 million.  I will explain the reason for this increase later, but it is due largely to the establishment of the Child and Family Agency.<\/p><p>  Under the new performance accounting arrangements introduced in 2012, the subhead structure of Vote 40 is based on three new major programme areas: programme A &ndash; children and family support programme; programme B &ndash; sectoral programmes for children and young people; and programme C &ndash; policy and legislation.  The largest single component of the increase in the Vote for this year is the establishment of the new Child and Family Agency which, I am glad to say, took effect on 1 January 2014.  This is a historic development and a significant milestone in the programme of this Government to fundamentally reform the delivery of services to vulnerable children and families.  The level of funding allocated to the agency is over &euro;602 million in current funding and &euro;6.8 million in capital spending.  As Deputies will be aware, the key tasks facing the agency include achieving a better management and consistency of approach so as to deliver a world-class Irish service model of child welfare and protection.  We all know the legacy.  The challenge now is to provide that word class services.  While this will not be provided overnight, we are well on the road to achieving it.  The establishment of the agency brings together key services relevant to children and families, including child protection and welfare and education services previously provided by the HSE, the Family Support Agency and the National Education Welfare Board.  The challenge now is implementation.  As I stated, reform of services for children and families will not be achieved overnight and requires a sustained effort to address weaknesses. <\/p><p>  The 2014 Estimates provision is for expenditure due for payment in the current year and will not go towards meeting any over-spending or deficits arising in previous years.  I acknowledge that there are significant demands on the services for which the Child and Family Agency is responsible.  These arise from demographic and social factors, such as alcohol and drugs, and from the fact that people are now more aware of how important it is to intervene and do the best for children.  In recognition of these demands, the Government made an additional provision in budget 2014 of &euro;6.7 million, rising to &euro;12 million in a full year, to support the major reform of child welfare and protection services, which is under way.  This additional investment will support ongoing reforms which are aimed at improving the quality and capacity of child protection welfare services in response to the historic legacy of failings highlighted in numerous reports and in response to increased demand in child protection referrals.  We all know that referrals increased by almost a third in 2012 and 2013 to more than 40,000.  It appears at this point that referrals will continue to increase going forward.  Our population has increased and the number of children going into care is reflective of that increase.  By international standards, we have relatively low numbers of children in care.<\/p><p>  I have issued a performance statement to the agency under the Child and Family Act 2013 setting out overall priorities for 2014, and specifically the priorities for the deployment of the additional resources provided.  The agency is currently finalising its business plan for 2014.  The plan was discussed by the agency's board last week and I expect to receive it shortly.  The business plan will detail the use the agency will make of the resources available to it and its plans to recruit key additional staff based on the additional funding provided in the budget.  I wish the board of the new agency, led by Ms Norah Gibbons, and all of the staff of the agency, led by the chief executive, Gordon Jeyes, well.  A huge amount of work, in terms of establishment of the agency, has been completed, not least by the staff of my own Department.  A HR programme has now been put in place following consultation with the trade unions, employers and staff.  The transition of the 4,000 staff has been completed and the budget has been separated out.<\/p><p>  The free preschool year is expected to cost &euro;175 million in 2014.  This is a universal programme and expenditure arising is a function of the number of children in the eligible age range.  I was pleased to learn recently from the latest published tranche of the Growing up in Ireland, GUI, study on children aged five in this country that their transition to primary school had in the main been very successful.  The researchers also commented on the value of the preschool year in terms of preparing children for school.  This information is very helpful.  This is the first time we have had a group of children studied in this detail who have made the transition to school having availed of the free preschool year.  Some 68,000 or 94% of children eligible for the free preschool year are benefiting from it.  Participating service providers are required to implement S&iacute;olta and Aistear as much as possible.  It is a fundamental principle of the programme that the preschool year is available free to parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22014012100003#B00400","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390325100,"counter":839,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and her officials.

It is a reform that was broadly supported by all sides of the House.<\/p><p>  I note from the Minister's statement that the deficit is not being carried forward.  However, last week at a committee meeting her colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, had a different view regarding the deficit.

He asked me to substitute for him this evening.<\/p><p>  The backdrop of the Estimates has been revealed, at least in part, by the latest \"What's Left\" tracker produced by the Irish League of Credit Unions and published today.  It showed that around 1.6 million people have &euro;100 or less at the end of the month once all of the bills have been paid.  The figure has dropped by more than 100,000 people when compared with last September's figure, which is welcome.  None the less it is a very large number.  The group includes people who have less than &euro;100 and simply cannot make ends meet.  Issues of income inequality and poverty, particularly child poverty, continue to play a significant role in determining the demand on services provided by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  There is a strong relationship between inequality levels and demand on services.  It would be remiss of me not to raise this broader point at the outset.  The mantra goes \"We are where we are\", but I must add that we are where we are for a reason.  Broader economic conditions have, in real terms, affected the Department's budget just it has for every other Department.  Vital supports and interventions that have a real and meaningful impact on the lives and outcomes for some of the most vulnerable people in our society will be diminished.  This is the reality.  However, we are expected to be grateful they have not diminished by more.<\/p><p>  I have some queries on individual subheads that I will raise under questions.  At this point I note that the 2014 gross funding allocation for the provision of services under Vote 40 is &euro;997.154 million and is up from &euro;439.106 million last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22014012100005#D00900","speaker":"981","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390326300,"counter":849,"content":"<p>The Minister will respond and then we will go through each subhead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22014012100006#E00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1390326300,"counter":850,"content":"<p>I am happy to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22014012100006#E00300","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1390326300,"counter":851,"content":"<p>We asked a few questions in our original contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22014012100006#E00400","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1390326300,"counter":852,"content":"<p>We will not go back and forth on this.

As I said, it is a historic development and there is a very strong team in place led by Mr. Gordon Jeyes and the management team.  A huge process has taken place already.  An implementation group has been running for well over a year and a half, chaired by the Secretary General who is with me today.  An outstanding job has been done in terms of the transition to the new agency but many challenges remain for it to meet, to which both Deputies referred.  It is the right direction in which to go.  <\/p><p>  There is a budget of &euro;602 million for current expenditure and &euro;7 million for capital expenditure.  I reiterate what I said earlier that we are not carrying over any deficit from the HSE.  There has been a separating out of the budget.  In fact, the departmental budget has increased overall by 3%.  The Deputies will agree that at a challenging time that is a recognition of the priority the Government gives to young people, children and the services which will be provided by the agency and our Department.  <\/p><p>  We have some additional funding in a range of areas and it is important I put that in context.  There has been increased funding and Deputies will see the figures have gone up for child care overall and for the youth programmes compared to what had been intended.  There is also the development of the area based childhood initiatives.  In regard to the point Deputy McLellan made on the overall economic situation, clearly job creation and lifting people out of poverty through the creation of jobs will impact on the very children we are talking about.  In particular, the area based childhood initiatives will make a qualitative difference to the lives of children and families having difficulties.  We have seen that from the work that has already gone on in the three areas where these programmes have been implemented.  That is why the voluntary organisations are so pleased and excited by this and why we have seen in the docklands area of Dublin, for example, 42 agencies coming together to work under the umbrella of the ABC initiatives.  We are seeing that in other areas also.   To take up Deputy Troy's point on voluntary organisations, the approach being taken by the ABC initiatives deals with one aspect of the point he made and I will deal with the other one on increased co-operation among the voluntary sector and accountability.  The umbrella approach being taken, asking agencies to work together, is very positive.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Troy raised a number of issues, which I will go through as quickly as I can.  He asked about the provision of public health nurses and the CAM service to families and the integration into the agency.  The task force made a broad series of recommendations.  A decision was taken to move ahead with the agencies currently under the umbrella but this year, I intend to start of process of discussion and examination of the best engagement with public health nurses, because that must go on whether they are inside or outside the agency, and with CAMs.  We have started this discussion in terms of making sure CAM services are available to the children and families being served by the agency.  That is very important, as is the question of precisely how that will develop.<\/p><p>  In the same way we had to have a lot of discussion about the integration of the National Education and Welfare Board, for example, into the agency, the same process will have to be gone through in regard to that engagement with public health nurses and we will begin to do that.  Deputy Troy spoke about discussions with the public health nurses.  Some public health nurses specialise in working with the children and families while others have caseloads which are mixed where they  work with the elderly and deal with a whole range of issues which arise in primary care.  In terms of precisely how that will develop and what the end point will be, the task force said they should be in the agency and we will certainly start that discussion in more detail this year in regard to CAM services and the public health nurses.  However, it is very important we give the agency an opportunity to begin the work from where it is currently and to integrate the agencies it started out with and to develop the services.  In advance of developments in that area, there must be very close co-operation between public health nurses, the CAM services and the agency.  <\/p><p>  Recently, I had a meeting with officials of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and some of the voluntary organisations to discuss how we can develop that close co-operation between mental health services and the kind of work that is being done by the Child and Family Agency.  It is very important that continues and, as I said, we will begin discussions with both groups with a view to teasing out the current relationship and future potential and how that can develop.<\/p><p>  Deputy Troy raised a point about the voluntary sector and clearly people are very concerned about governance in that sector.  Mr. Gordon Jeyes has issued a letter to all voluntary organisations which come under the remit of the agency and, more importantly, he met all of them last year and had discussions about the services provided.  The tradition has been to give money to agencies, perhaps without a detailed and specified contract.  I think he is very much moving in the direction of service level agreements with the voluntary organisations with whom the agency works.<\/p><p>  Some &euro;100 million is provided to voluntary organisations by the agency, in addition to the more than 100 family resource centres.  The establishment of the agency will lead to a greater alignment between the work of the voluntary organisations and the priorities of Government and the agency.  In fact, as recently as yesterday, I spoke to Mr. Jeyes about this issue.  As I said, he had meetings with all of the voluntary organisations last year and he is certainly moving in the direction of service level agreements in line with the priorities he has.  That is very important because there was a more distant relationship previously, as we have seen very clearly in recent discussions about voluntary organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22014012100006#E00600","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1390326300,"counter":854,"content":"<p>Is that in regard to moneys allocated and drawn down and compliance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22014012100006#E00700","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1390326300,"counter":855,"content":"<p>Yes.  As I said, Mr. Jeyes has been working on that since last year and has been very clear about accountability.<\/p><p>  The arrangements which need to be made with service providers is spelled out in section 56 of the legislation.  There are very detailed instructions for the agency and how it will carry out its business with the voluntary organisations.  If the Deputies read it, they will see they must submit a copy of the audited accounts and the auditor&rsquo;s certificate and report on the accounts to the agency within such period of time as may be specified by the agency.  The legislation has clarified the situation quite a bit in terms of what is expected from the voluntary organisations under the remit of the agency.<\/p><p>  Deputy Troy asked about additional staff.  That will become clear when we receive the business plan from the agency but clearly it will be in the areas identified where more staff are needed currently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22014012100006#E00800","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390326900,"counter":857,"content":"<p>Is it correct that the business plan must be published by 30 January?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22014012100007#F00200","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1390326900,"counter":858,"content":"<p>The plan must be submitted to me by 31 January 2014.  The board discussed it last week.<\/p><p>  In response to the Deputy's question, all services under the early childhood care and education, ECCE schemes have been required to adhere to the principles of S&iacute;olta and Aistear from the outset.  The local child care committees provide assistance for the services to do this and use the online tools developed for that framework.  In addition, we have piloted a mentoring programme.  In fact, I went to the presentation of that pilot programme, which was really impressive.  More than 20 mentors have been working in the service.  Obviously from next year onwards, I hope to have a new mentoring service in place which will see a further 30 or 40 mentors available to child care services to increase their implementation of S&iacute;olta and Aistear.  It takes training, supervision and mentoring for the services to achieve the standards envisaged in S&iacute;olta and Aistear.<\/p><p>  On the question of recruitment of inspectors, the posts have been advertised but to date they have been confined to public health nurses.  I will have discussions about broadening it out.  Five inspectors have been recruited and it is envisaged that a further ten will be.  They will cover the vacant postions in Louth, Dublin south, east Wicklow, Cavan, Monaghan, Sligo-Leitrim and west Cavan which will effectively mean that most areas will be covered.  It will bring the number of inspectors up to 50.  We were allocated money in the budget to do this.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, is addressing the issue of the transferability of vetting.  There are concerns about transferring vetting because if it was allowed to be transferred to every other agency, there is a worry that an offence committed in the meantime would not be picked up.  That is the reason there is such regular vetting.  I understand the Minister is examining the issue and will publish proposals on making the system more effective.  He is examining the issue of transferability to see what improvements could be made.  The Deputy is correct when he states it is very difficult for agencies and many have asked that if a person has been vetted by a child care service, whether it could simply be transferred if he or she was taking up another job in the child care service.  I do not think the proposals have been published yet, but in the meantime additional staff have been made available to the vetting service.<\/p><p>  There are places available in detention centres.  That is due in part to the recent court decision that young people in detention should have remission.  The provision of places has not been a problem in recent months.  The position varies considerably, as the Deputy is aware, and in the course of last year there were periods when no beds were available. <\/p><p>  We published the expert group's report on the early years strategy Right from the Start some weeks ago and it is the intention, as I have always said, that, first, we will have an overall framework document and that very quickly after this we will have the early years strategy and youth strategy published.  Intensive and extensive work is in progress on the framework document which will set the scene for these two other policies.  The framework should be published in the early part of this year and the early years study and strategy will follow from it.<\/p><p>  Progress has been made on the legislative programme.  We had a significant workload on the legislation to establish the agency and the emergency legislation which has been welcomed.  It placed major demands on the Department and, in addition, we had the child care legislation.  Last year the Department had to deal with three pieces of legislation.  I will not go back over the history of Children First, but in all probability it will be the subject of the next piece of legislation to be published and is very close to finalisation.  We have received legal advice on sanctions which has changed the approach we have been taking somewhat.  That is the reason we have needed more time to take account of it.  Let me assure the committee that work is ongoing on the Children First legislation.  The fact that the agency has been established and will have a number of months to get on with the work of implementation before publication of the Children First legislation will work well.  I do not accept the assertion that children are not being protected because the safeguards are not in place.  Obviously, we want to bring forward the Children First legislation to remove any ambivalence among professionals about reporting child protection concerns.  The evidence is that referrals are being made; there has been a significant increase in the number of referrals.  People are also contacting the agency if they have some concerns and are getting good advice from the agency.  The Bills dealing with Children First and adoption will be introduced in the next period.<\/p><p>  The Government recognises the points made on alcohol by the special rapporteur on child protection.  Many of the issues raised by the Deputy will be covered in the proposed public health Bill.  Just a few weeks ago the Government made a decision for the first time ever to publish a public health Bill dealing with alcohol.  It will take account of and deal with many of the issues that affect children such as advertising, cut-off times for certain advertisements and billboard advertising.  I agree with the Deputy that this is an issue that must be taken extremely seriously and I have expressed my view on it that we must have the strongest possible legislation because alcohol is such a key factor in terms of admissions to care and child protection concerns.  I think one third of children in care are there because of alcohol issues in the family of origin.  It is a very serious issue and the Government has shown that it takes it very seriously by its approach to the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22014012100007#F00300","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1390326900,"counter":859,"content":"<p>To the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22014012100007#F00400","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1390326900,"counter":860,"content":"<p>Yes; the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, is working on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22014012100007#F00500","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1390326900,"counter":861,"content":"<p>This is an issue that falls within his responsibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22014012100007#F00600","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1390326900,"counter":862,"content":"<p>Deputy Sandra McLellan also raised the issue of the budget reductions.

Mr. Gordon Jeyes has taken more control of the legal budget within the Child and Family Agency to ensure costs are contained as much as possible.

We got great assistance in this regard.  As Deputies can imagine, it is not the easiest thing in the world to disaggregate what was relevant to the Child and Family Agency from what was relevant to the other health budgets.  That has been done following a rigorous process.  A great deal of work was done by the team involved.  I have to say they received significant co-operation from the HSE.  A great deal of work was also done by my Department.  The budgets were examined.  The amounts that were used in the delivery of services for child protection were identified and separated out.  As I said in my opening speech, there is no reduction in those amounts which have come across to the agency.  That is the situation.<\/p><p>  The reality is that there are huge demands on the agency.  The same thing applies to the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills and all other bodies that are trying to deliver these services.  We also have to look at reforming how we deliver many of these services.  More co-operation between the voluntary and statutory sectors is needed.  Clearly, I will keep a close eye on those demands.  The board of the agency and the management team will do likewise.  I would expect to hear back from them on how the budget is meeting those demands.  We received some extra money for a range of services.  Clearly, there are more demands in this area because there are more children coming into care.  Expensive special care placements are necessary for a minority - 0.3% - of Irish children.  There a level of demand for these expensive services.  We need more foster placements, but they cost money.<\/p><p>  It must be accepted that &euro;609 million is a sizeable budget.  It has to be managed by the management team and the board.  Like everybody else, they are aware that substantial amounts of money cannot be found anywhere else in the current climate.  We are subject to the comprehensive review of expenditure.  Having said that, the budget shows an increase despite the current difficulties.  As I have said, it was separated very carefully from the HSE costs.  While there is no deficit, there are huge demands and costs, not least from a legal perspective.  These issues have to be managed and dealt with.  I do not doubt that the agency will come to me during the course of the year.

What we are doing is redirecting the funding to the area of greatest demand, namely, the community employment schemes.  This is the reason the allocation under subhead B4 has been reduced.  The amount in question remains within the child care allocation and will be used to provide the range of child care services to which I referred.  The allocation for child care has been increased by &euro;3 million, which should be welcomed, and our focus has shifted to the areas of greatest need.  This is the reason certain funding has been reallocated within the two subheads.<\/p><p>  Deputy Troy referred to mentoring and training support.  It is important to focus on FETAC levels 5 and 6 because we require that child care staff reach these standards.  Our objective is to improve standards and training for those currently employed in child care services, more than 3,000 of whom require basic training.  For this reason, we chose to focus on this group at this time.  Once staff have reached a certain standard and obtained a FETAC qualification, I do not rule out using the training fund for a broader range of training and qualifications.  At this point, it is important to achieve our objective of ensuring that child care workers obtain FETAC level 5 and 6 qualifications.  Many of those who require these qualifications find it very difficult to pay for the training.  Under this programme, they are subsidised to obtain the services they need. <\/p><p>  On the mentoring service, we have provided &euro;2.5 million for pre-school services.  This will involve the recruitment of graduates in early childhood care and education who will work directly with the services to improve quality, including assisting services in the implementation of S&iacute;olta and Aistear.  It is expected, although agreement has not yet been finalised, that the mentoring service will be administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department.

The Minister may recall a \"Prime Time Investigates\" expos&eacute; of certain child care practices which found serious management weaknesses in one of the offending service providers, notwithstanding that staff were fully trained to FETAC levels 5 and 6 standards.

Like the Deputy, I recognise the value of the youth services and want to support them.  In my discussions with City of Dublin Youth Services Board, CDYSB, and the local education and training boards, making sure the youth organisations can sustain their work, has been to the fore.  In the allocation of funding made at local level through the education and training boards and through the CDYSB, they are very conscious of protecting frontline services, and have been at pains to ensure those frontline services will continue, and have supported the organisations where there were some difficulties to ensure the services described by the Deputy will continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22014012100010#J01400","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1390328700,"counter":929,"content":"<p>Subhead B7 - area based childhood programme, early child care payment and early intervention programme for children.

In order to allow the State to intervene, we must get clearance from Europe in terms of State aids.  Very sophisticated technology and systems are required, for example, if one were to exploit the potential of e-health, but at the rate that new technologies are being introduced in health and the cost and expense of them, we will have to continue to adapt our capacity to avail of that technology more cheaply.

It is envisaged on foot of the national digital strategy that the switch-on workshops I mentioned, which are expressly designed to try to assist weaker schools, will take place.  The point that the standards in schools will vary is a fair one.  Our priority is to ensure schools have the technology.  The education sector will gradually have to take responsibility for how it is used.  Some of the examples we have seen are quite remarkable.  Some pupils are remotely studying subjects that their own schools are unable to provide.  For example, a small number of students are doing honours maths remotely from a different school because their own school will never be in a position to provide all the specialist courses that a particular cohort of students might be interested in.  The capacity of technology for better teaching and for more efficient use of resources is very far-reaching.  In fairness to the Department of Education and Skills - we were down there two or three weeks ago to discuss a different aspect of this matter - it has taken on board and is building on the possibilities presented by technology from a pedagogical point of view.

Maybe a change in focus towards economic work and economic generation would be useful.  The Minister has provided &euro;5 million for the online trading scheme under subhead A5.

The programme has been tweaked as a result of what we learned from that experience.  The programme will be mainlined throughout the country from June of this year.  We expect to get 1,000 small companies involved.  Approximately 23% of small companies do business online.  Our survey work tends to show that after the crash small companies felt besieged by other problems and that those difficulties continued during the recession.  At that stage, they were not as amenable as they might have been to exhortations to do business online.  We are trying to step up that level of engagement.  This country's e-commerce sector was worth &euro;3.7 billion in 2012, with 70% of the products or services in question being imported into this country from outside the jurisdiction.  The only way we can deal with such a big spend is to compete.  We are trying to persuade small and medium-sized companies that their capacity to grow employment and output would be significantly enhanced - there is literature to demonstrate this - if they were to transact business online.  There are a number of initiatives in this area.  The point the Deputy made about the interaction with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is not unrelated.  Obviously, we are addressing the related issue of the quality of broadband in rural Ireland.  Later this week, I will bring to the House a Bill that will allow the ESB to use its supply system if it engages with a partner on a joint venture to roll out fibre to parts of rural Ireland.  We are clearing the legislative way for it to become a reality.  If that happens, when taken with the very extensive programme of investment that has been laid out by Eircom, for example, it will certainly continue to improve the quality of broadband that is available to people outside the large population centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR62014012100006#E00700","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1390314600,"counter":1048,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to engage with the Minister.

The Minister has identified the savings RTE has already made.  It is my contention and certainly that of the chairman of the RTE authority that a reduction of &euro;5 million will hamstring RTE to an inordinate extent in terms of the development of the kind of home-grown content that is important to attract an Irish audience.  The documents that find their way into <i>The Irish Times<\/i> today under the by-line of Harry McGee and Arthur Beesley clearly identify that the Minister has already recognised that RTE has taken a hit of about &euro;11 million if one takes into account the reduced licence fee that social welfare provides for it.

This is the middle of January but the advices I have received are that RTE will break even.  I acknowledge it was aggrieved at the additional hit of &euro;5 million above and beyond that requirement.  On the question whether I think there will be a bigger pool of money, evasion is creeping up towards 20% which is a lot of money.  On the question of whether the household-based charge will address this shortfall, it depends on the efficacy of the collection system.

The last town admitted for connection is Nenagh.  The test applied was not met by Sligo.  I accept that it would be a boost to the town and region but the case made locally did not meet the criteria that are well established by the regulator.  It is a matter that might be looked at locally.<\/p><p>  The note I have on the matter states that the extension of the natural gas network to the town of Macroom, County Cork, was completed in 2012.  The regulator approved the extension of the gas network to Cootehill during 2012.  This project is currently under construction.  Contractual discussions with commercial customers to facilitate the connection of Tuam continued in 2012.  The connection of Wexford town to the gas network was approved by the regulator subject to Bord G&aacute;is networks securing contractual commitments from key energy users in the town.

The existing owners of Whitegate have indicated that they are in the market to dispose of the facility.  I met the American senior officials prior to Christmas, who informed me they have not yet secured a buyer.  It is not for me to make judgments in regard to whether a buyer will be secured but my impression is that the facility will continue as is and that the challenge to Government and the industry is to deal with the impending 2016 situation.<\/p><p>  The refining sector generally in Europe is in contraction.  Oil refineries are being closed on a consistent basis.  We commissioned a consultancy report approximately a year ago in relation to the then lie of land and how to proceed into the future.  That consultancy report is now available on the Department's website.  The Deputy might want to have a look at it in terms of its recommendations.  I met the group of unions at Whitegate last week and, as stated, I met with officials from the company prior to Christmas.  The position of the Irish Government, given we are an island nation, is that we would be more comfortable with the facility continuing as is for obvious reasons, not least the fact that there are people employed there and making a valuable contribution.  We do not have an indication this far out in regard to what will happen post-2016.  The view has always been that if there is a threat to the future of Whitegate continuing as a refinery, it would be maintained as a storage facility.  However, that would not be good news for the people employed there.  We still have a long way to go.
