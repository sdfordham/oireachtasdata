On a cumulative basis over the period 2013-2020, Ireland is projected to\u00a0have a deficit of between 3 and 12 Megatonnes Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (MtCO2e). <\/p>  <p>  The extent of this challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by the Government, as reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, published in April 2014, and now underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 which was enacted in December 2015.\u00a0 The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050.\u00a0 Statutory authority for the plans is set out in the\u00a0Act.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with Section 4 of the Act, and in line with responsibilities assigned to me as\u00a0Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I intend to make a draft\u00a0National Mitigation Plan available for public consultation by the end of the year followed by submission of a final plan\u00a0to Government for approval by June 2017.  Work is well underway on the development of the National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050.\u00a0 The first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020 but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The ultimate objective of successive National Mitigation Plans is to incrementally achieve the long-term vision of low carbon transition, set out in the National Policy Position, by 2050.  In that context, the National Mitigation Plan will have regard to Ireland's obligations under the current 2009 Effort Sharing Decision, the Paris Agreement and any likely future EU and international obligations that may arise, including new national targets to be agreed under the 2030 climate and energy package.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the efforts outlined above to address the challenge to comply with the 2020 targets, in the event that a gap to\u00a0target still exists in 2020, retirement of Annual Emissions Allocations and units from the Kyoto Protocol Flexible Mechanisms carried forward from\u00a02008-2012 can be offset against\u00a0the deficit. In the event that this would not fully address any potential deficit,\u00a0further\u00a0carbon units could be purchased.  It is not possible to\u00a0accurately quantify\u00a0the cost to purchase\u00a0notional carbon units at this stage\u00a0as the cost is dependent on\u00a0both the quantum and price of carbon units to be purchased at the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102600077#WRA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan Implementation","counter":36,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102600077#WRA03400"},{"type":"question","counter":37,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[32044\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102600077#WRA03500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when the procurement process for the national broadband plan will be complete; and the estimated ratio of public to private spending on the project.","asker":"1232","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":38,"content":"<p>The National Broadband Plan represents a very significant capital investment project for the State and\u00a0aims to deliver high speed services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland.\u00a0 The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the delivery of\u00a0the NBP\u00a0as a matter of priority.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network to the over 750,000 premises in Ireland, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland.\u00a0 Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.\u00a0\u00a0Householders and businesses may\u00a0get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but potentially 1,000 Megabits per second\u00a0with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP.

This funding was secured based on the expectation that a new scheme will become available in the latter half of 2017.  It is expected that this capital expenditure will need to increase in the coming years to meet our renewable heat target by 2020, and a multiannual budget commitment will be required in the years ahead to ensure certainty for investors in the sector.  This will obviously be subject to discussion and agreement with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">  The RHI is <\/font>aimed at supporting larger industrial and commercial installations outside of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources.  From a national policy perspective, the focus on the non-ETS sector is likely to accrue a double benefit for the Irish taxpayer, helping to meet our renewable energy target and reduce emissions in the non-ETS sector, simultaneously.<\/p><p>The analysis suggests that it would not be cost effective, at this stage, to include the domestic heating sector in the RHI.  This is due to a number of factors including the much higher support tariff per kilowatt hour of energy that would be required to incentivise households to change heating systems as well as the significantly greater costs associated with administering the scheme for a large number of households in what is an unregulated sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102600078#WRB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan Implementation","counter":91,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102600078#WRB01600"},{"type":"question","counter":92,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[31838\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102600078#WRB01700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when his Department first announced plans to introduce the national broadband plan; the dates on which various Ministers held press conferences to publicise it; the expected commencement and completion dates provided by Ministers at each of these press conferences; the current projected commencement and completion dates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":93,"content":"<p>The Government's National Broadband Plan (NBP), which was published in August 2012 by the then Minister,\u00a0outlined Government's commitment to deliver high speed broadband availability across the country and reflects Government and European objectives to deliver high speed services to all citizens.  Specifically it committed to a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.<\/p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, there have been\u00a0updates provided in respect of\u00a0progress.\u00a0\u00a0In April 2014,\u00a0the Government decided that it needed to scale up the ambition of the plan.  This was a consequence of the mapping process, which had been underway since 2013, and which demonstrated that there was a significant fibre-deficit across Ireland\u00a0which\u00a0would require a major network build to address.  It also recognised new State Aid Guidelines published in 2013, a significant ramp-up\u00a0in demand for data services nationally and internationally, and accelerated industry investment following regulatory and policy decisions, which included legislation to\u00a0allow ESB to enter the\u00a0telecoms market.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Facilitating commercial investment continues to be a critical element of the Plan and industry is now delivering to approximately 1.3m premises across Ireland, which represents an increase of at least 300,000 more homes and businesses than had originally been anticipated.\u00a0 Telecoms operators are also rolling out fibre-to-the-home services in Ireland - a technology which was not envisaged on any scale in 2012.\u00a0 At least two operators\u00a0have announced ambitious\u00a0fibre-to-the-home rollout plans, one\u00a0of which involves the use of the ESB network, which was facilitated by legislation introduced by my Department as part of the broader NBP policy. <\/p><p>Following the Government's decision to scale up the ambition of the plan, significant additional resources were brought to bear on the project.  Since then, my predecessor and I have held media briefings to flag key milestones in the development of the Plan.  These include:<\/p><p>- November 2014 - the publication of the High Speed Broadband Map and launch of a public consultation<font color=\"#1F497D\">;<\/font><\/p><p>- June 2015 - the publication of the draft Intervention Strategy along with 7 expert reports which are supporting the delivery of the procurement; <\/p><p>- December 2015 - the publication of the updated High Speed Broadband Map and formal launch of the procurement process, with the publication of a detailed Project Information Memorandum and Project Information Notice in the Official Journal of the EU;<\/p><p>- July 2016 - the decision by Government in relation to the ownership model for the\u00a0network to be built and the shortlisting of three companies to be brought forward as bidders in the procurement process;<\/p><p>- July 2016 - the\u00a0establishment of a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to consider immediate measures to address telecommunications deficits in rural Ireland.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>I am sure that the Deputy will agree that\u00a0regular progress reports on the development of the plan, at the key milestone stages outlined, is important in order to inform the public of progress.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll out a new high speed broadband network to over 750,000 premises in Ireland, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland. <\/p><p>Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP.  The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team, and bidders, during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.  It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further at this juncture, given that discussions are ongoing in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. <\/p><p>During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. \u00a0It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102600078#WRB01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Disposal Charges","counter":94,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102600078#WRB01900"},{"type":"question","counter":95,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[31834\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102600078#WRB02000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the progress being made with waste management companies to ensure that when the new proposed pay-by-weight charging system is introduced in July 2017, it will not result in the massive price increases that were seen in July 2016.; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":96,"content":"<p>The charges applied by waste management companies are a matter between those companies and their customers, subject to compliance with all applicable environmental and other relevant legislation, including contract and consumer legislation.<\/p><p>As the waste industry began releasing, in June 2016, its proposed prices under the introduction of a mandatory pay-by-weight charging structure, the Government relayed its concern to the industry regarding the reported escalation of waste bills for customers of certain companies.

Rent supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) appropriate to their family circumstances less a weekly minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  The weekly minimum contribution is &euro;30 for a single adult household and &euro;40 for coupled households.

It marks a point at which the Rockall Bank, part of the very large Hatton-Rockall area of continental shelf extending under the north-east Atlantic Ocean, protrudes 21 metres above sea level.  During the 1960s and 1970s the issue of Rockall was a source of legal and political controversy in both Ireland and the United Kingdom.  The UK claims sovereignty over Rockall and has sought to formally annex it under its 1972 Island of Rockall Act.<\/p>  <p>  While Ireland has not recognised British sovereignty over Rockall, it has never sought to claim sovereignty for itself.  The consistent position of successive Irish Governments has been that Rockall and similar rocks and skerries have no significance for establishing legal claims to mineral rights in the adjacent seabed or to fishing rights in the surrounding seas.<\/p>  <p>  During the course of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which took place from 1973 to 1982, Ireland worked hard to achieve agreement on this principle.  The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which was adopted at the conclusion of the Conference on 10 December 1982, provides at Article 121, paragraph 3 that: &ldquo;Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.&rdquo;  Rockall falls into precisely this category.  <\/p>  <p>  In 1988, Ireland and the UK reached agreement on the delimitation of areas of the continental shelf between the two countries, stretching out up to 500 nautical miles from their respective coastlines.  This included the division of the Hatton-Rockall area of continental shelf on which Rockall is situated, although under the terms of the Law of the Sea Convention the location of Rockall was irrelevant to the determination of the boundary.  According to that determination, Rockall is situated to the north of the boundary agreed with the UK in 1988 and lies outside the zone claimed by Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  As with any claim to continental shelf lying beyond 200 nautical miles from a state's coast, the UN Convention requires that Ireland and the UK submit their claims for examination by the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.  However, the claims to the Hatton-Rockall shelf agreed between Ireland and the UK are not accepted by Iceland or Denmark (on behalf of the Faroe Islands), which make their own claims.  <\/p>  <p>  The four countries have met regularly since 2001 in an effort to resolve the overlapping claims issue, but to date have been unable to reach agreement.  The 10-year deadline for the making of submissions to the UN Commission expired for Ireland in May 2009.  The Government therefore submitted the national claim for this area at the end of March 2009, as did the British Government in respect of the UK's claim.  Denmark submitted its claim on behalf of the Faroe Islands in 2010.

The NHSPWD has been affirmed in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness and has been extended to 2020 to deliver on its aims and will continue to guide and progress policy.<\/p>  <p>  At national level, my Department, DHPCLG, the HSE, the Housing Agency and the disability sector work together on an ongoing basis, in a structured framework, supported by the Housing Agency chaired Subgroup and Task Groups reporting to it.<\/p>  <p>  Under the NHSPWD, policy on decongregation of institutions is a matter for the Department of Health.  The HSE's report &ldquo;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings &ndash; A Strategy for Community Inclusion&rdquo;,(2011) proposes a new model of support in the community by moving people from institutional settings to the community.  The plan is being rolled out at a regional and local level and involves full consultation with stakeholders. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  Currently, 2725 people live in congregated settings and our objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE's 2016 National Service Plan has set a target of 165 people to move from institutions in 2016 into suitable accommodation.  Earlier this year, I announced that we are providing &euro;100 million in capital funding from now until 2021 in respect of acquiring and renovating properties in priority institutions identified by the HSE.  This will ensure that people are able to move out of congregated settings, and into their own homes in the community.  I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres. <\/p>  <p>  Further to this capital funding, the HSE's Service Reform Fund 2016-2019 will provide funding of &euro;45 million to support the phased transition to person-centred model of supports and services over the coming years.  This transitional funding of &euro;45 million represents a combined investment by the Department of Health (&euro;30 million) and Atlantic Philanthropies (&euro;15 million), with the support of the HSE and Genio.  The fund will focus on the reconfiguration of residential services and will assist in meeting the costs of migration to a person-centred model of services and supports<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I am pleased to note that the Department of the Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is providing &euro;10 million under the Capital Assistance Scheme to provide suitable accommodation for people transitioning from institutions in 2016.  The HSE estimate that a further 100 people could benefit from this initiative.  &euro;1 million in ring-fenced leasing funding is also being made available by the Department of the Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in 2016 to support people moving from institutions into suitable social housing in the community.

Gardasil is a fully tested vaccine which was licensed by the European Medicines Agency in 2006.<\/p>  <p>  While no medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised nationally and at EU level.<\/p>  <p>  In November 2015 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review, in which the Health Products Regulatory Authority participated, focused on two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.  The review found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions.  On 12 January 2016 the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the EMA stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information which is now binding in all member states.<\/p>  <p>  Healthcare professionals are advised to continue using HPV vaccines in accordance with the current product information and I would encourage all young women to receive this important cancer preventing vaccine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102600092#WRQ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Congregated Settings Report","counter":377,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102600092#WRQ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":378,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[32333\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016102600092#WRQ00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding congregated settings for persons with special needs and disabilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":379,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.  This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2011 the Report &ldquo;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings&rdquo; was published by the Health Service Executive (HSE), which identified that in 2008 approximately 4000 individuals with disabilities lived in congregated type settings.  These are places where ten or more people reside in a single living unit or are campus based.  It found that, notwithstanding the commitment and initiative of dedicated staff and management, there were a significant number of people still experiencing institutional living conditions where they lacked basic privacy and dignity, and lived their lives apart from any community and family.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, 2725 people live in congregated settings and our objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.<\/p>  <p>  St John of God Services in Kerry has been identified as one of the priority sites for de-congregation.  The HSE is committed to working with St John of God Services to transition 17 residents in ward style accommodation from the current unsuitable accommodation on campus to more appropriate settings in the local community.  Comprehensive transition plans will ensure that there is extensive engagement with the person themselves, their families, carers and advocates, as well as the service provider, to ensure successful and sustainable transitions into the community.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the existing residents will benefit from greater opportunities to participate in local communities and will, over time and with proper planning, move to living in the community.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of\u00a0the NBP\u00a0as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies\u00a0and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming. <\/p>  <p>  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services. Approximately 1.3m premises in Ireland can now get high speed broadband and at least one mobile operator is delivering 4G services to over 90% of the population. <\/p>  <p>  The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area comprising\u00a0over 750,000 premises, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. \u00a0Householders and businesses may potentially get speeds not just of 30Mbps but up to 1Gbps with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds. <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP. The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process. The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team, and bidders, during the procurement process. Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process. It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed. I do not propose to comment any further at this juncture, given that discussions are ongoing in the procurement process. I can assure the Deputy however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. <\/p>  <p>  In parallel, and in accordance with commitments in the\u00a0Programme for Government, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups\u00a0to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p>  <p>  In July,\u00a0I\u00a0established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague\u00a0Minister Humphreys\u00a0to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.

It will open access to public procurements opportunities, open up markets for services and offer predictable conditions for investors.  It is a matter of regret that one Member State was not in a position to approve the provisional application of this Agreement.  CETA has the potential to provide new market opportunities in many sectors for Irish firms.<\/p><p>The draft Council on the provisional application of CETA is publicly available through the website of the Council of the European Union .  The deputy will note from the draft decision that it is not proposed to provisionally apply investment protection or investment dispute resolution provisions.  Provisional application is a standard process in Free Trade Agreements which provides for the coming into effect of those areas over which the EU has competence.  Provisional application will not apply to those areas over which Member States have competence.
