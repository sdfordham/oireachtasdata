GMGY is a common programme suitable for pupils of all faiths and beliefs and none. <\/p>  <p>  In Junior Infants to 2nd Class, the children follow the GMGY programme together for the majority of the school year, exploring common themes.  There is a belief-specific aspect of the programme.  In the junior classes only, children have been grouped for a four week period during GMGY time according to their faith or belief tradition, in line with the wishes of their parents. Lesson content was designed specifically for each grouping.  In 3rd to 6th   class, children remain in their class groups throughout the year and learn about different faiths and religions together. Belief-specific teaching is integrated into GMGY for these classes. <\/p>  <p>  The manner in which schools deliver belief-specific teaching in Junior Infants to 2nd   class has evolved.  The majority of CNS schools no longer group children according to their beliefs for the four week period.  Instead, these schools have integrated belief-specific teaching so that all children learn about different religions and beliefs together and all class groups remain together throughout.  However, they continue to follow the GMGY programme.  I have previously indicated that I see merit in this approach. <\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is to commence a review of the GMGY programme for Junior Infants to 2nd   class, starting in September 2017.

In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas.  The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is included among the prescribed bodies to whom local authorities are statutorily obliged to send draft development and local area plans or proposed\u00a0variations to development plans for comment and observations.  This enables local authorities to reserve future school sites in areas designated for proposed housing development.<\/p>  <p>  My Department's 6 Year Capital Programme prioritises building projects for areas where significant additional school places are required.  The Capital Programme\u00a0also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, if required, for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2017 sets out the teaching resources available for schools for the 2017\/18 school year.  This budget represents the start of a major reinvestment in education and the first phase of implementation of the Action Plan for Education, aimed at becoming the best education system in Europe within a decade.  The\u00a0budget provides for over 2,400 additional teaching posts for our primary and post-primary schools next year.  This includes additional teaching posts to meet demographic need, curriculum reform, additional guidance posts, additional resource teaching posts, addition teaching support for DEIS schools and the strengthening of school leadership.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department's policy\u00a0is that children with special educational needs should be included in mainstream placements with additional supports provided, unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or in the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated.  Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school.  Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.  My Department, therefore, provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools, which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs, in order to ensure that wherever a child is enrolled, (s)he will have access to an appropriate education.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special\u00a0Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in\u00a0consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently 1,152 special classes nationally, which is an increase of over 100% on the number available in 2011.

This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.<\/p><p>Enrolment in an ASD special class should only be considered where it has been demonstrated that a student requires the support of a special class because he\/she is unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day even with appropriate supports. <\/p><p>Students enrolling in ASD Special Classes must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals (for example, psychologist, speech and language therapist, psychiatrist) stating that: <\/p><p>- S\/he has ASD <\/p><p>- S\/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.<\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.<\/p><p>Since 2011 the NCSE has increased the number of such classes by over 100% from 548 in 2011 to 1153 at present.

This is a natural consequence of the earlier growth in primary ASD special class numbers. <\/p><p>However, it should not be assumed that the same levels of growth in post primary class numbers should apply.  This is because, for children with Autism, transferring from a special class in a primary school to a special class in a post primary school may not always be the optimal choice.  Many children can progress to mainstream post primary with support of SNA and Resource Teaching hours, while more may transfer from primary to a special school depending on their presentation and needs.<\/p><p>It should also be noted that there is a proportionally larger enrolment at Primary level due to the higher number of standard years.<\/p><p>The NCSE continues to establish additional special classes to support children with Special Educational Needs including Autism as required. <\/p><p>Parents\/guardians who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement should contact their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) who can assist in identifying an appropriate educational placement for their child.

Recruitment to apprenticeship is therefore driven by employers rather than by SOLAS or by education and training providers. <\/p>  <p>  The 2014 Review of Apprenticeship in Ireland acknowledged the number of\u00a0women employed in craft apprenticeships has been low as these programmes operate in sectors that have traditionally low levels of female employment. While SOLAS offers a bursary to employers to encourage them to employ female apprentices, the number remains low.<\/p>  <p>  Currently the Apprenticeship Council is overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system into a range of new areas, following a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers.\u00a0 The first of these new apprenticeships were launched in 2016, with the Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship launching in September and the Industrial Electrical Engineer Apprenticeship getting underway in November. We have already seen an increase in female participation in these new programmes with almost 40% of the initial intake on the Insurance Practitioner programme being female. 13 further new apprenticeships will get underway in 2017, many of which\u00a0are in sectors where there is a different gender balance in the workplace and I am confident, as these new apprenticeships are rolled out, that this will lead to a continued increase in female participation. <\/p>  <p>  As set out in the recently published Action Plan to Extend Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020, my Department will, in conjunction with SOLAS, review the pathways to participation in apprenticeship in a range of diverse groups, including female participation, in light of the broadening of the apprenticeship system into new areas. The review will be completed in 2018 and any recommendations made will be implemented immediately.<\/p>  <p>  Recently, a digital campaign to promote apprenticeship got underway with a dedicated Twitter feed #Generation Apprenticeship, a new apprenticeship website www.apprenticeship.ie, an Apprenticeship Ireland Facebook page and a LinkedIn page.\u00a0In all aspects of the digital campaign women feature prominently and as the campaign rolls out, there will be a specific focus on\u00a0encouraging women and girls to consider apprenticeship as a means of launching or developing their careers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400071#WRC01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts in Education Charter","counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400071#WRC02000"},{"type":"question","counter":101,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[24465\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400071#WRC02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the actions his Department has taken to co-operate with the Department Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to fast track and resource the Arts in Education Charter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":102,"content":"<p>The Arts in Education Charter, launched in 2013, has been a landmark development.

Many schools already make their premises available to the local community outside of school hours; and schools profit from\u00a0an improved relationship with the wider community as a result.

These guidelines suggest that the relationship between the school and the wider community should form one of the self-evaluation criteria for schools.

I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers. The agreement reached with TUI and INTO will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers. \u00a0The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The agreements have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.\u00a0 This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;85 million.\u00a0 Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.<\/p>  <p>  However there are other types of equality that we must also bear in mind, for example equality between public servants and people who work elsewhere or don&rsquo;t work at all.\u00a0 It would also not be equal or fair for us to do unaffordable deals with particular groups of public servants that mean that we do not have the money left in the public purse to provide increases in social welfare payments for vulnerable groups, tax reductions for people at work, or investments in improvements in public services that people rely on.<\/p>  <p>  In education, there is a well-established increment system. Teachers are not paid equally. For example, the pay scale for teachers appointed prior to 2011 ranges from &euro;32,009 to &euro;60,155 depending on the date that the individual began teaching. Part of the negotiation to date has secured a convergence of the scales of recruits at different periods. Any further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector. A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay will be informed by the recently published analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission. <\/p>  <p>  The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve. However, it does represent significant progress, and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of public service pay talks.\u00a0 My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, invited the Public Services Committee of ICTU to discussions on public service pay and a continued approach to the unwinding of the FEMPI legislation and these discussions are now underway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400071#WRC06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":148,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400071#WRC06800"},{"type":"question","counter":149,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[24656\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400071#WRC06900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on whether unemployed teachers should be prioritised in the selection of suitable candidates for superintending State exams.","asker":"1321","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":150,"content":"<p>The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations. <\/p><p>In view of this I have forwarded your query to the State Examinations Commission for direct reply to you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400071#WRC07000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Process","counter":151,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400071#WRC07100"},{"type":"question","counter":152,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[24661\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400071#WRC07200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the Equal Status (Admissions to School) Bill 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":153,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, last June, the Government proposed and the D&aacute;il agreed that the Labour Party&rsquo;s Equal Status (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 would come before the D&aacute;il for a second stage hearing no earlier than 28th June 2017 to allow for scrutiny by the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills and for the Committee to consider submissions and hold hearings. <\/p>  <p>As the Deputy will be aware I ran a public consultation process from 24th January to 20th   March 2017 on the role of denominational religion in the school admission process and possible approaches for making changes.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division. The Commissioner has advised that all Garda&iacute;, not simply designated Community Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises and, in that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Commissioner that, as of the 31 March 2017, there were 323 Garda including 4 Community Garda together with 22 Garda Reserves  attached to the Kildare Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p>  <p>  Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations. In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security. Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. <\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p>  <p>  This plan is progressing apace. I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that just under 1,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide 50 of whom have been assigned to the Kildare Division.  I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end -  an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; including Community Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division in the coming years. To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates a new recruitment drive was launched by the Commissioner earlier this month with a closing date of 1 June. The competition is being undertaken by the Public Appointment Service on behalf of the Commissioner and applications should be made to www.publicjobs.ie.<\/p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400072#WRD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Equipment","counter":161,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400072#WRD00800"},{"type":"question","counter":162,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[24836\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400072#WRD00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide the necessary funding to replace the osprey rigid inflatable boat for the Garda water unit, in view of the fact it is over 20 years old.","asker":"1362","askee":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":163,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[24837\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400072#WRD01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide the necessary funding to replace one of the zodiac inflatable boats for the Garda water unit which is over 17 years old.","asker":"1362","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":164,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 85 together.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources among the various Garda Divisions, including the Garda water unit and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 provides that free legal aid may be granted in certain circumstances for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.  Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal representation themselves.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the \"gravity of the charge\" or \"exceptional circumstances\", it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion for access to legal aid under the Act.  I have no function in these matters which are determined by the judiciary.<\/p>  <p>These provisions must have regard to the right to a fair trial, including the provision of legal aid where appropriate, which is a Constitutional right upheld by the courts in a number of judgments.  The Supreme Court ruling in the case of State (Healy) v Donoghue [1976]I.R. 325 effectively determined that the right to criminal legal aid is, in circumstances which are quite wide in practice, a Constitutional right.  Article 6(3)(c) of the European Convention on Human Rights states that \"Everyone charged with a criminal offence has [the right] to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require\".<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, an accused person is entitled to a presumption of innocence and legal representation and any obstacles to obtaining necessary legal aid which were found to be unreasonable could give a defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  The overriding concern is to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts.<\/p>  <p>Work on the preparation of a draft General Scheme of a Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Bill is at an advanced stage in my Department.  The key purpose of the legislation is to transfer the administration of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme to the Legal Aid Board and to give effect to Government Programme commitments in respect of criminal legal aid, including introducing a more rigorous and objective means testing system for criminal legal aid, provision for contributions, and new sanctions.   It is my intention to seek approval of Government for the General Scheme of the Bill and submit it to the Oireachtas for pre-legislative scrutiny as early as is practicable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400072#WRD03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Data","counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400072#WRD03100"},{"type":"question","counter":181,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[24989\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400072#WRD03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of long-stay join family single entry D visas issued in 2015 and 2016 and to date in 2017; the number of refusals for same; the average processing time; the process involved in processing this category; the number issued on a country basis; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":182,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the tables below set out the position in relation to the ten highest number of applications by nationality and a combined figure for all other nationalities (up to 90) for the years requested by the Deputy. <\/p><p>I am further advised by INIS that the time taken to complete &quot;join family&quot; visa applications in the Dublin Visa office where all necessary information is available to the Visa Officer is currently 5 months.

Recommendation 6 of the Report, in particular, aims to address the problems faced by returning emigrants regarding the recognition of no claims bonuses through the introduction of a standard protocol for insurance providers, to ensure a greater consistency of treatment for returning emigrants.

My Department is not in a position to allocate space in any of its premises in Dublin city centre to Caranua.   I understand that the Caranua Board and executive have considered various alternative accommodations and have agreed to a new solution involving a rental payment on the basis that it meets the organisation&rsquo;s business needs and represents value for money having regard to current market conditions.  It is important also that the accommodation available to its staff members is of an appropriate standard.<\/p>  <p>  Caranua currently shares accommodation in a property in central Dublin assigned to my Department by the Office of Public Works (OPW).   The OPW is leasing this property from the landlord.   I understand that the lease on the property is due to expire at the end of this month &ndash; the lease having been extended at the request of OPW from its original expiry date of May 2016.   The OPW has secured alternative office accommodation in central Dublin for the occupiers of the current premises and I understand that the move to this new accommodation will take place in the near future.   OPW has informed my officials that Caranua will not be a party to the lease on the new premises but that there will be a side letter between it and OPW dealing with any relevant issues.   I understand that that is OPW&rsquo;s normal practice in such matters.   I am advised that Caranua&rsquo;s contribution to the rental cost of the premises will be in the region of &euro;220,000 per annum (plus VAT), together with some &euro;9,000 per annum for parking.

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.  <\/p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.  <\/p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for\u00a0public servants\u00a0to start.  I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreement reached with TUI and INTO will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers.  \u00a0The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The agreements have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.\u00a0 This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;85 million.\u00a0 Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.<\/p>  <p>  However there are other types of equality that we must also bear in mind, for example equality between public servants and people who work elsewhere or don&rsquo;t work at all.\u00a0 It would also not be equal or fair for us to do unaffordable deals with particular groups of public servants that mean that we do not have the money left in the public purse to provide increases in social welfare payments for vulnerable groups, tax reductions for people at work, or investments in improvements in public services that people rely on.<\/p>  <p>  In education, there is a well-established increment system.  Teachers are not paid equally.  For example, the pay scale for teachers appointed prior to 2011 ranges from &euro;32,009 to &euro;60,155 depending on the date that the individual began teaching.  Part of the negotiation to date has secured a convergence of the scales of recruits at different periods.  <\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.  A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay will be informed by the recently published analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission.  The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve.

There will then be discussions between individual ETBs and the existing patrons\/landowners concerning the possible transfer of schools to accommodate this demonstrated demand for diversity.<\/p>  <p>  Each ETB will then prepare a report for the Department outlining the levels of demand within their functional areas and the responses of the existing patrons as to how this might be accommodated through the reconfiguration of existing school provision.<\/p>  <p>  In the subsequent implementation phase, where the level of demand for multidenominational schools is sufficient to justify transfer of a school from denominational to multi-denominational patronage, a process will commence to give effect to that.

Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. <\/p>  <p>  No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model. In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016\/17 school year. No allocation made for such pupils\u00a0by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. <\/p>  <p>  An\u00a0additional 900 teaching posts\u00a0have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model. The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional\u00a0teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools. This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011. <\/p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1200 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model. Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government. The new funding will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation\u00a0of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils, including pupils who have yet to enrol in their school, who require such support.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model, schools\u00a0will be\u00a0provided with a total allocation which includes\u00a0a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school&rsquo;s profile. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school. <\/p>  <p>  Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.\u00a0This will\u00a0reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours\u00a0may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis,\u00a0as schools will now receive\u00a0a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.<\/p>  <p>  The new allocations to schools will include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including\u00a0where\u00a0a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or\u00a0where there are\u00a0newly\u00a0enrolling pupils\u00a0to the school. <\/p>  <p>  All allocations to schools include a supplementary provision, which has been referred to as the &lsquo;baseline allocation&rsquo; which is allocated over and above the profiled allocation. <\/p>  <p>  For students who start school from September 2017, with a specific diagnosis, either in junior infants or transferring from another school, the resources they need will already be in the school under the new model. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model. By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.\u00a0 Each year, some students\u00a0with additional teaching needs will\u00a0leave and others will\u00a0enrol, broadly balancing the school profile. Resources allocated under this model will not normally\u00a0be adjusted between allocations. <\/p>  <p>  DES Circulars 0013\/2017 and 0014\/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The model\u00a0will\u00a0allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances\u00a0or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very\u00a0substantially prior to the next review of the model. The National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance. Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very\u00a0significantly since the allocation was made to the school,\u00a0may\u00a0an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. <\/p>  <p>  Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs are now published and available on the Departments website.<\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs. The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400074#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Information and Communications Technology","counter":274,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400074#WRF00800"},{"type":"question","counter":275,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[24932\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400074#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of information and communication technology grants his Department has paid to primary and secondary schools in the past 12 months; the details of the grants given to schools, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":276,"content":"<p>The Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020 Enhancing Teaching Learning and Assessment, sets out the Department's vision for embedding ICT in teaching learning and assessment in primary and post-primary schools.

The central vision of the Plan is that the Irish Education and Training System should become the best in Europe over the next decade. The Plan&rsquo;s high-level goals are based on the five policy areas which I believe will help us to achieve this ambition. The goals are:<\/p>  <p>  1. Improve the learning experience and the success of learners<\/p>  <p>  2. Improve the progress of learners at risk of educational\u00a0disadvantage or learners with special educational needs<\/p>  <p>  3. Help those delivering education services to continuously improve<\/p>  <p>  4. Build stronger bridges between education and wider community<\/p>  <p>  5. Improve national planning and support services.<\/p>  <p>  The basic aim of this Government is to sustain our economic progress and use it to build a fair and compassionate society. Education is the best means of delivering a fairer society, breaking down cycles of disadvantage and ensuring that all our people, in particular those with special educational needs, are able to participate in that progress and fulfil their potential. Excellent and innovative education and training are the pivot around which personal fulfilment, a fair society and a successful nation should revolve.\u00a0 It is central to sustaining economic success and in converting economic success into building a strong community. Having the best education and training service in Europe will allow us to provide better opportunities for more people from disadvantaged groups, as well as ensuring that we create more sustainable well-paying jobs.<\/p>  <p>  Our approach to special education has undergone a huge transformation with a growing proportion of children with special educational needs being educated with their peers in mainstream schools.\u00a0\u00a0The participation and progress of learners with special educational needs across the whole education system remains a key focus with an emphasis on improving whole-school and whole system approaches. The Action Plan 2017 sets out a range of measures which will be undertaken during this year. These include allocating teachers to schools under the new allocation model to support children with special educational needs, publishing the outcomes of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme, and consult with partners on the implementation of sections of the EPSEN Act and on the provision of services to children with Down Syndrome. <\/p>  <p>  Quality of provision is the cornerstone to the success of the education and training system.\u00a0 We recognise the fundamental roles that leaders, teachers and support staff play and we want to strengthen the system&rsquo;s capacity to continuously improve and to deliver the highest quality education and training services for learners. The Action Plan 2017 details actions which will ensure that leadership, management, quality frameworks, teaching methods, and initial and continuing training are all operating to the highest standards across the continuum of education and training provision. These actions include expanding the range of supports available through the Centre for School Leadership, providing dedicated professional support to teachers to support the implementation of curricular and policy change, and developing and introducing a new postgraduate qualification for aspiring school leaders.<\/p>  <p>  To become an innovation leader and to build a strong talent base, we as a nation must effectively engage with enterprise. We must work to address identified skills needs in critical areas, and recognise the shifting global economic and political climate in which services are delivered and jobs are created.\u00a0 Successful enterprise engagement is the foundation of much of the planned activity detailed in the Action Plan 2017. This includes driving the growth of traineeships and apprenticeships, ensuring the relevance of work placements and work-based projects, and increasing the diversity of opportunity in learning beyond school.\u00a0To advance this agenda, together with Minister Halligan, I launched the National Skills Council and the Regional Skills Fora last month. The Council&rsquo;s members are from senior levels within the public and private sectors, and they will oversee research, advise on the prioritisation of identified skills needs and on addressing those needs, and have a key role in promoting and reporting on the responses of education and training providers to the identified needs.\u00a0The nine Regional Skills Fora will provide a cohesive education-led structure for employers and the further and higher education system to work together in addressing the skills needs of their regions, help employers to better understand and access the full range of services available across the system, enhance links between education and training providers in planning and delivering programmes, reduce duplication and inform national funding decisions.<\/p>  <p>  In order to ensure that progress is made in all of these areas, updated annual Action Plans will be published each year, detailing the actions that will be implemented during that year. As part of this process, actions will be monitored against published timelines and progress reports will be published on a quarterly basis. Recently, the 2016 End of Year Review and the 2017 Quarter 1 Progress Report were published. They are both available on the Department&rsquo;s website (www.education.ie), with full details of the actions already achieved in these three important areas. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400074#WRF04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"DEIS Scheme","counter":309,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400074#WRF04300"},{"type":"question","counter":310,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[24944\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400074#WRF04400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the stage the review of the school support programme through the DEIS initiative is at; when this review will be completed and published; if he envisages changes to the funding or delivery model of the DEIS programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":311,"content":"<p>As I previously advised the Deputy on 28th February last,\u00a0the review of DEIS has been completed and is available on my Department's website at the following link:<\/p><p>.<\/p><p>On 13th February, I published DEIS Plan 2017, which sets out my Department&rsquo;s renewed policy\u00a0statement on \u00a0educational disadvantage.<\/p><p>Building on the five key goals set out in the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019, the Key Goals we have set ourselves in this DEIS Plan are:<\/p><p>1.

The designation of any performance in the certificate examinations as a 'fail' ceased in 1968. <\/p>  <p>  The nature of curricular examinations such as the Leaving Certificate and the procedures currently in place for awarding grades are such that a certain amount of fluctuation in the grade distribution from year to year is to be expected. Grade distributions are also affected significantly by the proportion of candidates who opt to take the examination at each level. In particular, if the proportion of candidates opting for Higher level increases, the candidates making this move will tend to be those who were towards the higher achieving end of the Ordinary level distribution and will tend to fall at the lower achieving end of the Higher level distribution. This will obviously affect the grade distribution at both levels. Influenced by the combined effect of syllabus change in mathematics,\u00a0 known as Project Maths, and the introduction by the Higher Education Institutions of 'bonus points' for Higher level mathematics, the number of students in recent years presenting for Higher level in Leaving Certificate Mathematics examinations has increased significantly, from 15.8% in 2011 to 28% in 2016. <\/p>  <p>  During the standard-setting process that happens as part of the marking process each year, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) takes account of these and any other relevant factors in the course of satisfying itself that the distribution of grades awarded is appropriate and that it accurately reflects the performance of the candidates in comparison to the achievement standards envisaged when the syllabus was designed.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of a significant migration of mathematics candidates from Ordinary to Higher level, it may be noted that a similar absolute number of candidates awarded E, F or no grade at Ordinary level will inevitably be manifested as a higher percentage, since the total number of candidates at this level has reduced.<\/p>  <p>  The number of candidates who failed to achieve at least a D3 grade at any level of the mathematics examination in 2016, while marginally higher than in the last three or four years, is very similar to the number in the years before that (2009 to 2011, for example). In the context of the factors mentioned above, there is nothing especially unusual about the grade distribution in mathematics for 2016.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of the current syllabus change in mathematics, there has been a deliberate attempt to increase the emphasis on higher-order thinking skills, including interpretation, problem solving, and dealing with the unfamiliar. These are skills that students find difficult to master and teachers find difficult to instil in students. The syllabus expectations are ambitious at all levels. <\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) will be undertaking a review of the Project Maths initiative, now that the full implementation of all phases of the curricular change is complete. By this time, students will have been through the new mathematics cycle a few times and the NCCA will have good information on which to base the assessment of its impact, especially on the learning of under-achievers. I have asked the SEC to ensure that any lessons that can be learned from candidate performance in recent examinations, and the 2016 examination in particular, be fed into that review process. The Project Maths Implementation Support Group, an industry-education partnership set up by my Department, including third level bodies, Engineers Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, will also be able to provide their considered opinions to this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400075#WRG01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Retention Rates","counter":341,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400075#WRG01500"},{"type":"question","counter":342,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[24956\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400075#WRG01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on the drop-out rate in third level institute of technology courses; his plans to remedy the situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":343,"content":"<p>The Higher Education Authority has recently published (April 2017) it's latest Study of Progression in Irish Higher Education, which provides an analysis of data relating to non-progression of 2013\/14 full-time undergraduate new entrants to HEA funded institutions.\u00a0 The study shows that the proportion of new entrants in 2013\/14 who did not progress is 15% across all sectors and NFQ levels.

Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. <\/p>  <p>  No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model. In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016\/17 school year. No allocation made for such pupils\u00a0by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. <\/p>  <p>  An\u00a0additional 900 teaching posts\u00a0have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model. The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional\u00a0teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools. This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011. <\/p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1200 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model. Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government. The new funding will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation\u00a0of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils, including pupils who have yet to enrol in their school, who require such support.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model, schools\u00a0will be\u00a0provided with a total allocation which includes\u00a0a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school&rsquo;s profile. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school. <\/p>  <p>  Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.\u00a0This will\u00a0reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours\u00a0may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis,\u00a0as schools will now receive\u00a0a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.<\/p>  <p>  The new allocations to schools will include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including\u00a0where\u00a0a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or\u00a0where there are\u00a0newly\u00a0enrolling pupils\u00a0to the school. <\/p>  <p>  All allocations to schools include a supplementary provision, which has been referred to as the &lsquo;baseline allocation&rsquo; which is allocated over and above the profiled allocation. <\/p>  <p>  For students who start school from September 2017, with a specific diagnosis, either in junior infants or transferring from another school, the resources they need will already be in the school under the new model. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model. By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.\u00a0 Each year, some students\u00a0with additional teaching needs will\u00a0leave and others will\u00a0enrol, broadly balancing the school profile. Resources allocated under this model will not normally\u00a0be adjusted between allocations. <\/p>  <p>  DES Circulars 0013\/2017 and 0014\/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The model\u00a0will\u00a0allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances\u00a0or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very\u00a0substantially prior to the next review of the model.

The demand for 2017\/18 will not be known until the NCSE application process is complete.<\/p><p>There are currently over 12,500 learning support and resource teacher posts in mainstream primary and post primary schools. An additional 900 teaching posts have also been provided to support the introduction of the new model for allocating Special Education Teaching Resources to mainstream primary and post primary schools from September 2017.  <\/p><p>My Department considers it essential that, in assessing the need for special class placements, the individual needs of children should be properly assessed to determine the appropriateness of special class provision for them.<\/p><p>Some students, although academically able to access the curriculum in mainstream, may find it too difficult to manage full-time placement there. This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.<\/p><p>Enrolment in an ASD special class should only be considered where it has been demonstrated that a student requires the support of a special class because he\/she is unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day even with appropriate supports. <\/p><p>Students enrolling in ASD Special Classes must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals (for example, psychologist, speech and language therapist, psychiatrist) stating that:<\/p><p>-  S\/he has ASD <\/p><p>-  S\/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.<\/p><p>125 special schools also provide specialist education for those pupils who need it.<\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.<\/p><p>The NCSE continues to establish additional special classes to support children with Special Educational Needs including Autism as required. Since 2011 the NCSE has increased the number of such classes by over 100% from 548 in 2011 to 1153 across the country in 2016\/17, of which 888 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes.<\/p><p>The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned. The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  <\/p><p>With regard to Kildare, in particular, there are 942 students with ASD attending schools in the County. Of these, 520 students attend mainstream schools and are accessing in-school supports including Resource teaching and SNA support. 322 students are attending 59 ASD special classes, including 6 Early Intervention classes, 41 primary ASD classes and 12 post primary ASD classes. A further 100 students with ASD are placed in 4 special schools in the county. The number of ASD classes has increased in the area by 24% since the 2013\/14 school year.<\/p><p>The NCSE has informed my Department that it intends to establish 1 new ASD class at primary level and 2 new ASD classes at post-primary level in Co. Kildare for the 2017\/18 school year.<\/p><p>Parents\/Guardians who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement should contact their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) who can assist in identifying an appropriate educational placement for their child. Contact details are available on www.ncse.ie.<\/p><p>In recent years, the NCSE has provided my Department with a number of policy advice papers on the provision of supports for children with special needs, all of which are available on the NCSE&rsquo;s website.  It is intended to bring into effect many improvements to the provision of special educational needs support, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.<\/p><p>As committed to in the Programme for a Partnership Government, the adequacy of the present policies and provision and their scope for improvement is being examined. The NCSE are currently undertaking a comprehensive review of the SNA Scheme to ensure better outcomes for children with special educational needs. Following its pilot, the new model for allocating special needs teachers has been introduced in schools. <\/p><p>I can confirm that this Government will continue to ensure that the supports required, to ensure that all children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education, will be provided. <\/p><p>Further details on special classes, resource teaching and SNA allocations are available on the NCSE's website at <i>www.ncse.ie<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400075#WRG04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Playgrounds","counter":371,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400075#WRG04500"},{"type":"question","counter":372,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[25004\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400075#WRG04600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if financial assistance will be provided towards the resurfacing of a playground in the case of a school (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":373,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department is in receipt of\u00a0a Category 10 application from the school in question to upgrade its play area under the Summer Works Scheme (SWS) (2016-2017).<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I announced details of the successful applicants under round two of the\u00a0SWS (2016-2017)\u00a0for Categories 3 - 6, on the 3rd May last, details of which are published on my Department's website, www.education.ie.<\/p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;47 million is being made available for vital school projects in school buildings; 438 schools nationwide will benefit from this announcement.

In general this would have been 20%-25% of total costs depending on the ratio of domestic to non-domestic demand driving the need for investment. <table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Water Services Investment Programme - Capital Investment in waste water infrastructure for 2000-2013    (&euro;m)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2000<\/td><td>295<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2001<\/td><td>376<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2002<\/td><td>351<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2003<\/td><td>285<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2004<\/td><td>230<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2005<\/td><td>209<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2006<\/td><td>239<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2007<\/td><td>255<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>240<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>255<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>284<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>220<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>150<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>124<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>3,513<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>In addition, local authorities spent in the region of\u00a0 &euro;4m to &euro;10m per annum on smaller sewerage schemes, but these were largely for reasons of economic development.<\/p><p>The information requested with regard to the levels of capital investment each year in relevant agglomerations is not readily available.

The Department has contracts in place with in excess of 60 companies for the provision of these services.  This includes two contracts for the provision of the JobPath service and 22 contracts for the provision of the Local Employment Service (LES).<\/p>  <p>  The JobPath Request for Tender set out the percentage of clients referred to the service that the Department expected the service providers to place into employment, based on historic progression to employment rates of each of the referral groups in respect of each contract area (i.e. the &lsquo;counterfactual rate&rsquo;). The expected performance, known as the reference performance rate, set out in the RFT was set at between 60% and 70% above the counterfactual rate, depending on the client group&rsquo;s duration of unemployment. The Department also set a minimum performance rate, below which the Department would not accept bids. This was set at 30% above the counterfactual rate. <\/p>  <p>  Based on this information, tenderers were invited to submit performance offers as part of their bids. The performance offers made in the bids form part of the JobPath service providers&rsquo; contracts with the department and as such it is not intended to publish same.<\/p>  <p>  I can however confirm that no JobPath providers bid below the reference performance level i.e. below the 60% - 70% above the counterfactual rate as set out in the JobPath request for tender.  Full details of the approach taken are contained in the request for tender which is available on the department&rsquo;s website.<\/p>  <p>  The JobPath service has been designed to support the long term unemployed (and those most at risk of becoming long term unemployed) to obtain and sustain employment in the open labour market. The service is being delivered on a payment by results model with all upfront costs of the service being borne by the companies themselves.  Jobseekers engage with the JobPath service for 12 months, but can expect to receive in employment support and assistance from the service for a minimum of three months (and up to a maximum of 12 months) when they enter employment.   <\/p>  <p>  Payments to contractors are geared towards sustained employment outcomes achieved; contractors are paid for each 13 week period of full time employment (of 30 hours per week) that former Jobseekers successfully complete, up to a maximum of four such payments.  In addition a payment is only made were the former jobseeker was not in receipt of a Jobseeker related income support payment from the department during the 13 week period.  <\/p>  <p>  The contracts for the provision of the local employment service (LES) set out the requirements of the service to be delivered and the capacity required from the contractors. Jobseekers engage with the LES service for 12 months and may receive in employment support and assistance from the service when they enter employment. Contractors aim to place 30% of those jobseekers who complete their engagement period with the service into employment (of 30 hours per week).  <\/p>  <p>  The clients with whom the local employment service engage fall into two broad groupings  - those clients activated\/referred by the department for support and assistance and jobseekers who engage directly with the service themselves (this group may include people with a disability, lone parents, early school leavers, qualified adults, ex-offenders, members of the travelling community and refugees). <\/p>  <p>  Payments to contractors are made based on this contract for services model, with the department fully funding the cost of the service in any given location.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400077#WRJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Data","counter":449,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400077#WRJ01100"},{"type":"question","counter":450,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[24865\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400077#WRJ01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of applications for social welfare assistance successfully appealed in each of the past three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":451,"content":"<p>The number of social welfare appeals determined with a favourable outcome for appellants from 2014 to date in 2017 is outlined in the table below.  <\/p><p>Overall, 56.5% of the 31,211 appeals which were finalised in 2014 had a favourable outcome for the appellant, i.e. were either allowed in full or in part, or resolved by way of a revised decision by a Deciding Officer\/Designated Person.58.8% of the 25,406 appeals finalised in 2015 had a favourable outcome for the appellant, as did 59.2% of the 23,220 appeals finalised in 2016 and 57.2% of the 6,346 appeals finalised to date in 2017.<\/p><p>There are a number of reasons why a decision which was refused at first instance might be successful on appeal and it is not necessarily the case that the first decision was wrong. <\/p><p>Where additional evidence is provided in support of an appeal, the original decision may be revised by the Deciding Officer or Designated Person.

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition), which had been available from 65 for those who satisfied the qualifying conditions, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  This is the current State pension age.  It will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.  <\/p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to the new State pension age.  In such cases, they will not be eligible to claim Jobseekers payments, as they will be in employment.  Where this is not possible, but they are still jobseekers, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday, provided they are entitled to that payment.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.  The requirement to be genuinely seeking work remains, however, and if someone has voluntarily retired aged 65, or at a younger age, and is not seeking work, they are not entitled to Jobseekers benefits.<\/p>  <p>  Reversing the abolition of State pension (transition) would have a significant Exchequer cost.  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  Its abolition was not expected to save that amount of expenditure in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit (albeit at a lower rate than the rate of the State pension), or may claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult in respect of their spouse&rsquo;s pension.  However, it is estimated that well over half of the gross cost has been saved each year as a result of this measure, and this would be expected to increase as (a) the number of 65 year olds increases, (b) the change results in a higher percentage of people working while aged 65, and (c) there have been two Budget increases in the rate of the State pension since then.  It is estimated that the net saving in 2018 is likely to be in the region of &euro;84 million, and this is expected to increase over time.  The cost of reversing this decision would depend, therefore, on the effective date of such a measure, and also on any resultant changes in behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  Each year more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision, and demographic change alone is expected to increase spending on pensions by over &euro;220 million this year, not including the impact of rate increases.  <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital if current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI on a Pay-As-You-Go basis, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.  Rowing back on these changes, which have already been legislated for, would undermine that sustainability to the detriment of current workers.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be borne in mind that these changes are modest in the context of increasing longevity among older people, and the duration of the average pension is still expected to increase based on current trends.  <\/p>  <p>  There is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.  <\/p>  <p>  Of course workers who do not wish to continue working may retire before they reach the State pension age.  However, they will not be entitled to a State pension until they reach state pension age, and if they are not genuinely available for work, they will not be eligible for Jobseekers benefit.  This is the case whether they are aged 65 or younger.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400077#WRJ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Payments","counter":455,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400077#WRJ01700"},{"type":"question","counter":456,"qnumday":188,"qnumall":"[24911\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400077#WRJ01800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when disability allowance payment will commence for a person (details supplied) who has been approved on appeal from April 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1348","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":457,"content":"<p>Following a successful appeal, the person concerned has been awarded disability allowance with effect from 15 June 2016.

The scheme allows a period of up to 20 years (from 1994) spent caring for children under 12 years of age or an incapacitated person(s) to be disregarded when state pension (contributory) eligibility is being assessed.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, and making it easier for them to qualify for pension, or where qualified, to receive a higher rate of entitlement.  In the case of the person concerned, it is not possible to apply the homemakers disregard as the period spent caring preceded 1994. <\/p>  <p>  It is open to the person concerned to apply for state pension (non-contributory).

Consequently, the efficient management of parking spaces and traffic flow on hospital campuses is of crucial importance. This is to ensure on-going availability of parking spaces; free flow of traffic on campus; unobstructed access for emergency vehicles at all times; proper use of spaces designated for drivers with disabled permits; and proper use of spaces designated as drop off points near the hospital entrance.<\/p>  <p>   The HSE (Health Service Executive) has advised that it does not have one single contract to provide parking services at all hospitals.  Instead each hospital has a unique arrangement which reflects its specific circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  Arrangements for car parking generally is an operational matter for the HSE. The HSE has advised that it does not provide guidelines on hospital parking and each hospital\/hospital group implements their own guidelines. <\/p>  <p>  Hospitals which charge parking fees are very cognisant of the financial implications of parking costs for patients and their families particularly those with long-term illnesses. Consequently, a maximum daily fixed parking charge has been introduced in some hospitals, thus capping this expense. I understand that some hospitals also provide reduced rate parking rates for long-term patients and visitors for whom the payment of the full rate would cause hardship.

Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.\u00a0 <\/p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.

Eir\u00a0has committed to doing this work over\u00a0a 90 week period, with an average of 500 premises passed per day.\u00a0 My Department will be monitoring this rollout to ensure that eir\u00a0meets its\u00a0obligations under the Agreement.\u00a0 A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my website www.dccae.gov.ie.<\/p><p>In total, over 192,500 of the 267,361 premises in County Cork will be able to access a high speed broadband service through commercial providers by the end of 2018.

I understand that both RACO and PDFORRA have been invited to the discussions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400081#WRN01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Personnel","counter":686,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400081#WRN02000"},{"type":"question","counter":687,"qnumday":269,"qnumall":"[24900\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400081#WRN02100","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if he will address the findings of the Public Service Pay Commission's report published in May 2017 which found that there are issues surrounding the recruitment and retention of members of the Defence Forces especially among aviation personnel; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","counter":688,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[24904\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400081#WRN02200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"his plans to counter the discharge rates among Defence Forces personnel which have risen due to better remuneration rates within the private sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","counter":689,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[24905\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400081#WRN02300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"his plans to enhance career progression, job satisfaction and professional development within the Defence Forces which may be linked to current exit levels; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","counter":690,"qnumday":272,"qnumall":"[24906\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400081#WRN02400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the way in which he plans to address working conditions within public services which the pay commission recommended should be addressed by the provision of an appropriate mechanism; with specific reference to the Defence Forces and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":691,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 269 to 272, inclusive together.  <\/p><p>As you will be aware the Pay Commission Report was published on 9 May last and contains a very comprehensive and detailed analysis of pay and pensions issues in the public sector and notably addresses issues surrounding recruitment and retention. My Department made a detailed submission to the Commission setting out these very matters and this is specifically referenced by the Commission in paragraph 6.13 of their Report. In the context of the Defence Forces, I note that the Commission in paragraph 6.29 accepts that there are challenges surrounding the recruitment and retention of personnel in specialist streams such as ICT, pilots, Air Traffic Controllers and avionic technicians. The Commission also go on to state that while remuneration is important in this regard there are other significant factors at play such as working environment, career advancement etc. These matters will be addressed as part of the framework which facilitates the Representative Associations engaging with the official side in talks parallel to those taking place between ICTU and the official side at National level. This process has begun this week.<\/p><p>In relation to staffing, the manpower requirements of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) are monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services. Personnel are posted on the basis of operational needs across the Defence organisation, both at home and abroad. As there is a significant turnover of personnel in the Defence Forces, targeted recruitment takes place on a regular basis so as to maintain the personnel numbers at or near the agreed strength levels. In terms of overall strength, the Government remains committed to maintaining the stabilised strength of the PDF at 9,500 personnel. <\/p><p>With regard to recruitment, I am advised by the military authorities that their planned target is to induct approximately 850 new entrants to the Defence Forces across all services and competition streams in 2017. <\/p><p>  A new General Service Recruitment campaign was launched on 23 February 2017 and the 2017 Cadetship competition was launched in March 2017. Direct Entry Competitions are also held as required from which specialist appointments are filled. An Air Corps apprentice class was also inducted in March 2017. <\/p><p>Promotions are ongoing within Officer ranks in order to fill rank vacancies. A new NCO promotions competition to fill vacancies to the ranks of Sergeants and above has been launched from which promotions will commence in Q3 2017. <\/p><p>  With regard to job satisfaction, career prospects and related issues, a Climate Survey completed in the Defence Forces in 2015\/16 as part of the Independent Monitoring Group process has provided valuable feedback for military and civilian management. The Climate Survey, while clearly indicating the challenges facing the Defence Forces, particularly in the areas of leadership, communication, organisational culture, the working environment and active management of personal expectations, also points out the many positives, especially in relation to the commitment of personnel to the values and mission of the Organisation, the high levels of work satisfaction, pride in the Organisation and positive views on culture and work support.<\/p><p>In response to the issues raised in the Climate Survey, an Action Plan was formulated involving engagement with all levels of management within the Organisation. The initiatives in this Action plan included conducting additional Focus Group Surveys in order to provide further Data on conditions within the Defence Forces; the implementation of White Paper projects relating to HR issues; the continuation and improvement of Exit surveys; the improvement of the Defence Forces internal communications plan and the adoption of an Integrated Competency Framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017052400081#WRN02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"}]
