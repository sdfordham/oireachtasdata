The <i>National Inspection Plan 2013: Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems<\/i> was adopted and published by the EPA in February 2013.<\/p><p>  The Local Authority Services National Training Group, in consultation with my Department, the EPA and the water services authorities, has overseen the development and delivery of a training course for the inspectors who will carry out inspections under the 2012 Act . Over the past six weeks t he training course has been rolled out to over 100 water services authority personnel in the Training Group's regional training centres in Ballincollig, Roscrea, Castlebar, Ballycoolin and Stranorlar. Further courses are being scheduled. <\/p><p>  The EPA is responsible for appointing as inspectors those who have satisfactorily completed the training course and meet other qualification criteria regarding professional or technical qualifications and indemnity insurance cover. Full details of the criteria are set out in the Water Services Act 2007 (Registration and Inspections) Regulations, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library. I understand that the Agency will commence processing applications for appointment as inspectors later this month. The number of appointments to be made is a matter the Agency and I have no role in such matters. <\/p><p>  The Plan provides for a minimum of 1,000 inspections to be carried out during the twelve-month period commencing in July 2013; therefore, no inspections under the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012 have been carried out to date. Details of the minimum number of inspections for each county are included in the Plan and it is a function of the water services authorities to implement the EPA's Inspection Plan in their functional areas. <\/p><p>  In December 2012 I announced my intention to introduce a grant scheme to provide financial assistance to households whose septic tanks and other domestic wastewater treatment systems are deemed to require remediation following an inspection under the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012. The grants scheme will not be a universal one - it will only apply to works arising from an inspection and subsequent issue of an advisory notice under the Water Services (Amendment) Act, 2012 and only householders who have complied with the obligation to register their systems by 1 February 2013 will be eligible to apply for grant aid. Full details of the scheme will be set out in regulations which I will make shortly.<\/p><p>  As the grant scheme will only apply to owners of domestic waste water treatment systems which are the subject of an Advisory Notice issued by a water services authority following an inspection carried out under the 2012 Act, no grants will be distributed before inspections commence in July. The number of grants to be distributed in 2013 will depend on the number of treatment systems which fail inspection. It will also depend on the number of owners of such systems who meet the eligibility criteria under the grant scheme and the costs incurred by them in remediating the problems with their systems. Provision for the scheme is being made from my Department's Vote in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200064#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Staff Numbers","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200064#WRA00850"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[28065\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200064#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"in view of the fact that the local authorities have reduced their staff from 37,243 in 2008 to 28,268, if he will outline in tabular the local authorities from which these reductions took place; and the grade of employment of these staff and the salary scale of these staff.","asker":"1037","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>The moratorium on Public Service posts was introduced 2009 and my Department operates a delegated sanction for its implementation in relation to local authorities.

The Commission led by its Chair, Mr Pat Spillane, has been engaging in an extensive schedule of meetings with stakeholder groups and the public over recent months looking at the many issues that affect life in rural Ireland at present. The Commission is also conducting a parallel research process and has invited interested parties to make submissions directly to it via its website at <font color=\"#1F497D\">.<\/font><\/p><p>  There is also an option to complete an online questionnaire.

The figures show that some 4,356 dwellings were vacant, accounting for 3.33% of the total national social housing stock of around 130,800 units.<\/p><p>The length of time taken to re-let units varies considerably between authorities and ranges from 8.4 weeks in Offaly County Council to a high of 65.1 weeks in Sligo County Council, with the average time taken to complete repairs just under 21 weeks. I propose to circulate with the Official Report a tabular statement based on the information set out in the Report, outlining the time taken to re-let dwellings in all local authority areas.<\/p><p>It is a matter for each local authority, as an integral part of the management and maintenance of their social housing stock, to carry out any necessary pre-letting repairs and maintenance works to dwellings which are vacated by tenants in order to re-let the units to new tenants within the shortest possible timeframe.<\/p><p>Under my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Investment Programme, local authorities are allocated capital funding each year in respect of a range of measures to improve the standard and overall quality of their social housing stock. These measures include large-scale regeneration projects, estate-wide remedial works and retrofitting works to individual properties.<\/p><p>Given the constraints on new local authority housing supply, it is important that the existing stock of local authority housing is available and in fit condition to meet housing need. Houses requiring significant pre-letting improvement works can quickly deteriorate if left vacant for an extended period. Over the course of 2011 and 2012 my Department placed a particular focus on refurbishing vacant properties in order to bring as many as possible back into productive use. In 2011, local authorities prioritised the most seriously deficient properties and funding of up to &euro;35,000 per house was provided to refurbish 2,659 of these at an overall cost of &euro;32.7 million. Last year, the focus on retrofitting vacant properties was maintained and a further &euro;20 million was provided for the retrofitting of around 2,115 vacant properties. I am confident that the figures in the LGMA Report for 2012 will show a considerable improvement on those for 2011.<\/p><p>Given the concentration on vacant properties in recent years, and considering that over 7,600 properties were improved in the last four years, it is timely to focus attention on those occupied and older dwellings which lack adequate insulation and draught-proofing. My Department estimates that there may be as many as 25,000 such properties. I am determined that we enhance the energy efficiency of these properties, improve living conditions and enable tenants to make real and substantial savings on fuel costs. Earlier this year, I put in place a new &euro;10 million energy retrofitting measure for tenanted houses, largely based around roof and wall insulation, with the potential to reduce energy bills by over &euro;400 per year. I&rsquo;m pleased that last week the Government committed to providing an additional &euro;50 million to accelerate this programme and ensure that up to 25,000 homes are fully insulated and draught-proofed over the next two years.<\/p><p><b>Table 1 &ndash; Average time taken for Repairs.<\/b><\/p><p>Average time taken (in weeks)from the date of vacation of dwelling to the date when all necessary repairs are carried out and which are deemed necessary to re-let the dwelling in 2011<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Local Authority<\/th><th>Time Taken for repairs<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow County Council <\/td><td>18.6 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan County Council <\/td><td>32.5 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare County Council <\/td><td>20.2 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork City Council <\/td><td>57.8 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork County Council <\/td><td>10.2 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal County Council <\/td><td>19.0 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council <\/td><td>26.4 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council <\/td><td>10.9 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council <\/td><td>21.5 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway City Council <\/td><td>N\/A <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway County Council <\/td><td>39.3 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry County Council <\/td><td>28.5 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare County Council <\/td><td>13.8 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County Council <\/td><td>21.3 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois County Council <\/td><td>10.0 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim County Council <\/td><td>22.9 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick City Council <\/td><td>9.0 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick County Council <\/td><td>57.0 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford County Council <\/td><td>14.4 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth County Council <\/td><td>11.0 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo County Council <\/td><td>29.0 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath County Council <\/td><td>12.0 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan County Council <\/td><td>24.2 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>North Tipperary County Council <\/td><td>30.1 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly County Council <\/td><td>8.4 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon County Council <\/td><td>37.0 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo County Council <\/td><td>65.1 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South Dublin County Council <\/td><td>14.2 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South Tipperary County Council <\/td><td>42.6 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford City Council <\/td><td>16.4 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford County Council <\/td><td>24.3 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath County Council <\/td><td>9.0 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford County Council <\/td><td>8.9 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow County Council <\/td><td>21.5 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p><b>Table 2 &ndash; Total number of Dwelling in LA stock 2011<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th>Local Authority <\/th><th>Total number of Dwellings in LA stock 2011 <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow <\/td><td>1,612 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan <\/td><td>1,933 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare <\/td><td>2,330 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork City Council. <\/td><td>8,743 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork County Council <\/td><td>7,108 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal <\/td><td>4,604 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council <\/td><td>26,679 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire\/Rathdown <\/td><td>4,377 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council <\/td><td>4,508 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway City Council <\/td><td>2,242 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway County Council <\/td><td>2,366 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry <\/td><td>4,112 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare <\/td><td>3,576 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny <\/td><td>2,148 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois <\/td><td>2,043 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim <\/td><td>994 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick City Council <\/td><td>3,134 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick County Council <\/td><td>2,141 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford <\/td><td>1,910 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth <\/td><td>3,664 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo <\/td><td>2,176 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath <\/td><td>2,983 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan <\/td><td>1,379 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>North Tipperary <\/td><td>1,820 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly <\/td><td>1,751 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon <\/td><td>1,351 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo <\/td><td>2,038 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South Dublin CO.

General Purpose Grant allocations, predominantly financed by Motor Tax revenues, have been structured so that each authority has sufficient resources, either from central grants or from its local income base, to provide a reasonable level of day to day services to its customers. There has been an unavoidable reduction in Local Government Fund General Purpose Grant allocations to local authorities, from &euro;832.7 million in 2009 to &euro;640.9million in 2013, a reduction which has obviously occurred in the context of reduced spending across the public sector. <\/p><p>  The Household Charge, introduced in 2012, has made an important contribution to the Local Government Fund. The &euro;131m revenue raised by the Charge so far has funded vital local services and has been a valuable precursor to the introduction of the Local Property Tax.   <\/p><p>  The local government funding model will change considerably in 2014. Under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, commencing in 2014 the nister for Finance will pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this revenue will be allocated to local authorities from the Fund. In addition, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a significant impact on local authority financing. <\/p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision making concerning service provision - in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and, a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates.

I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested.  To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs. In terms of addressing the demand for social housing, the social housing capital budget has been reduced from &euro;1.535 billion in 2008 to &euro;287m in 2013 and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing. I am monitoring expenditure under my Department's housing programme for 2013, together with the level of contractual commitments extending into 2014, with a view to a decision later this year on approving some limited new construction and house purchases over the period to end 2014. <\/p><p>  Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.  There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government's objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). My Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure delivery of housing units for social purposes. <\/p><p>  In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities must operate the final outcome for 2012 is expected to be in the region of 5,000 housing units.  Given the current volatility of the market and different challenges to the channels of supply it is difficult to estimate the likely output of new units for social housing this year.  However, it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200066#WRC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Provision","counter":76,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200066#WRC01150"},{"type":"question","counter":77,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[28050\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200066#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the new initiatives taken by him to tackle the problems in areas of high deprivation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":78,"content":"<p>While a number of Government Departments have initiatives to tackle problems in areas of high deprivation, my Department focuses in particular on community and housing issues.

allocation to qualifying projects up to the end of 2013. There are 35 Local Action Groups (LAGs) contracted, on my Department&rsquo;s behalf, to deliver the RDP throughout the country and these groups are the principal decision-makers in relation to the allocation of project funding. Such decisions are made in the context of the local development strategy of the individual groups and in line with Departmental operating rules and EU regulations.<\/p><p>Projects that request funding of &euro;150,000 or more are required to seek final approval from my Department. The assessment of these higher value projects usually involves detailed consultations between my Department and the relevant local development company. It frequently necessitates the provision of further documentation or clarifications. It may also, in some instances, result in modifications to the project proposed to ensure best value for money and compliance with all the necessary regulations, both national and European, governing the activities funded under the programme.<\/p><p>The policy in my Department is to work with the LAGs to ensure that the projects submitted are fully compliant and can be approved rather than to refuse approval for funding; it can therefore take some time to come to a final conclusion. My Department will continue to work with the relevant LAGs to make a full assessment of the eligibility of these projects and will advise the LAGs once all queries have been addressed satisfactorily. My Department currently has 44 projects at various stages of assessment to the value of &euro;11. 5 million.<\/p><p><table><tr><th><div><b>LAG<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>Date

Strategy<\/i> , which is published on my Department's website, is focused on ensuring that appropriate policy and legal frameworks are put in place for Irish Water and the water sector. A key objective is to rationalise the cost of the current service delivery and ensure more efficient operation of water services by moving from 34 water services authorities to a single body; following enactment of comprehensive legislation later this year, Irish Water will, therefore, become the water services authority from 1 January 2014.<\/p><p>  The implementation strategy is being rolled out under a range of work streams which involve local authority, Departmental and Bord G&aacute;is personnel and using the range of skills and experience in these organisations. Bord G&aacute;is are also engaged in an on-going process of seconding staff from local authorities and the Department to support work on the Irish Water programme. A process of direct recruitment has also commenced.

To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.

Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.  My Department is actively engaged with various interested parties in this respect. <\/p><p>  There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government's objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).  My Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA in identifying suitable housing units for social purposes and this process is on-going.  These deliberations have also identified suitably located sites which require substantial works to finish out and NAMA is investing accordingly thus bringing about obvious benefits in terms of job creation. <\/p><p>  Earlier this year, I introduced a new &euro;10 million energy retrofitting measure for older local authority dwellings, based around roof and wall insulation and with the potential to reduce energy bills by around &euro;400 per year.  Last week the Government committed to providing an additional &euro;50 million to accelerate this programme and ensure that up to 25,000 homes are fully insulated and draught-proofed by mid-2015.  In addition to providing immediate benefits to the families concerned, this new investment package has the capacity to create approximately 1,000 new jobs and reduce carbon emissions by some 30,000 tonnes per year - an important contribution to Ireland's climate change strategy.   <\/p><p>  The Housing Policy Statement specifically identifies approved housing bodies (AHBs), such as those represented by ICSH and NABCO, as key partners in the delivery of social housing. This recognises both the constrained funding levels available for local authority construction programmes and the capacity and track-record of the voluntary and cooperative housing sector. <\/p><p>AHBs are uniquely placed to help drive the achievement of the housing supply responses set out in the policy statement.  However, the move from capital funded programmes of construction and acquisition by approved housing bodies to more revenue funded options present s challenges for them.  As such, I am developing an enabling regulatory framework for the sector that will provide support and assurance both to the sector itself and to its external partners as it takes on the expanded role envisaged for it in the policy statement.   <\/p><p>  The development of a regulatory framework will take time. In the meantime, I am engaging with the sector on the development of a voluntary regulation code which, I would hope, most approved housing bodies will sign up to over time and I expect to publish a final version of this code in the coming weeks. <\/p><p>  My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is also exploring a range of options for external investment in social housing including, <i>inter alia<\/i>, social housing bonds and social impact bonds.  Such options are still in development.  In some instances, this could potentially enable sizeable lending by the European Investment Bank and others to the AHB sector.   <\/p><p>  Taken together, this package of direct Exchequer investment, new funding models and the creation of an environment that will encourage new external lending to the sector is a flexible response to the challenge of meeting social housing need in the most trying of economic circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200070#WRG00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electoral Divisions Report","counter":152,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200070#WRG00350"},{"type":"question","counter":153,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[26847\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200070#WRG00400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the status of the report on the Constituency Commission produced in June 2012 recommending no changes to electoral boundaries for European Parliament elections; in view of a decision taken at European level to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s number of MEPs from 12 to 11 at the next European Parliament elections in 2014, the implications it has on the report; if he is considering forming a new Commission to report on electoral boundaries for next year&rsquo;s European Parliament elections in view of the number of constituencies needing to be revised; if the new report will be taking submissions from the public in a suitable timeframe as per all previous Constituency Commission reports on D&aacute;il and European Parliament boundaries; when submissions will be taken from the public regarding the boundaries; when the Commission will be reporting to the D&aacute;il; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":154,"content":"<p>Constituencies for European Parliament elections were most recently reported on in the 2012 Constituency Commission Report, where no change to the existing arrangement of European Parliament constituencies was recommended.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine contributed to the report's formulation.  The report concludes that the local context is a crucial determinant of the suitability of any agricultural investment model in the developing world.  I strongly share the view that a differentiated approach is necessary in working with development partners, taking account of local conditions.  Combating global hunger and under-nutrition is a key pillar of Ireland's overseas development assistance programme, as re-confirmed in the Government's new policy for international development,<i><font color=\"#4F4F4F\"> '<\/font><\/i><i>One World, One Future'.  <\/i>Support for poor agricultural smallholders is a core element of our strategy, which is guided by the 2008 Hunger Task Force Report.  This report highlighted in particular the need to support smallholder farmers in Africa, and in particular women farmers, to increase their productivity.  Through our aid programme, Ireland supports international agricultural research for development, primarily through the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).  Ireland advocates to ensure that CGIAR research programmes are climate-smart, gender-sensitive and nutrition-sensitive.  We also support a range of smallholder support activities in our Key Partner Countries, and we prioritise the implementation of beneficial research outcomes.<\/p><p>  The D&oacute;chas report contains a number of recommendations.  One is that evidence-based assessment is necessary for effective evaluation of the impact of work carried out by NGOs supported by the Government.  I am in full agreement.  Irish Aid funding decisions are based on a strong results-based management system.  As a condition of funding, all NGO partners must set out clearly defined results and demonstrate strong monitoring and evaluation procedures to track those results.<\/p><p>  The report also recommends support for the implementation of the UN Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land.  As Presidency of the EU, Ireland worked to ensure that the guidelines were included in the new EU Food and Nutrition Security Implementation Plan which was adopted by EU Development Ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council on 28 May 2013.   <\/p><p>  I look forward to continuing dialogue with D&oacute;chas on our approach to agriculture in the fight to end extreme hunger and poverty in the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200072#WRJ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Statistics","counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200072#WRJ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":194,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[28251\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200072#WRJ01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide a list, in tabular form, in order of the highest to lowest of all of Ireland's trading partners, with the amount or trade valued, the amount our exports are to that country and the value of the imports from that country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1076","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":195,"content":"<p>In 2012, Ireland&rsquo;s total bilateral trade (imports to and exports from Ireland) increased by 4.7% to &euro;318.5 billion, despite a difficult global economic environment.

However, the following information may be of relevance, depending on the circumstances. While there is no overall exemption from the Local Property Tax (LPT) for a person with a disability, or for houses which have been specially adapted to cater for a resident with a disability, in certain limited circumstances an exemption may apply.  Section 10B of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that an exemption from the charge to LPT may apply to a residential property purchased, built or adapted to make it suitable for occupation by a permanently and totally incapacitated individual as their sole or main residence, where an award has been made by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board or a court, or where a trust has been established, specifically for the benefit of such individuals.  <\/p><p>  I am advised that section 189A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (as amended), defines 'incapacitated individual' as an individual who is permanently and totally incapacitated, by reason of mental or physical infirmity, from being able to maintain himself or herself.  Entitlement to the exemption provided for in section 10B will depend on whether the extent of a person&rsquo;s disability is such that they are permanently and totally incapacitated from being able to maintain himself or herself.<\/p><p>  Where an exemption cannot be claimed under section 10B of the Act, an incapacitated person may qualify for a reduction in the market value of their property under section 15A of the 2012 Act.  This section provides for a reduction in the market value of a residential property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person where the adaptation has been grant-aided or approved for grant aid, by a local authority.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that this relief only applies where the adaptation work increases the market value of the property.  Furthermore, the person with the disability must occupy the property as his or her sole or main residence after the adaptation is completed.  The reduction in value is limited to the lesser of the market value attributable to the adaptation work carried out on the property and the maximum grant payable under the relevant local authority scheme.  <\/p><p>  The LPT relief for adaptations for the disabled has been linked to the grant scheme for adaptations to ensure the relief is targeted at cases where necessary adaptations are made.  It also ensures consistency of approach to the issue of adapting homes to assist disabled persons to live in the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200073#WRK00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget 2014 Issues","counter":211,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200073#WRK00750"},{"type":"question","counter":212,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[28310\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200073#WRK00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide a list of all publications of forecast accounts from his Department which have been released to date this year, and which will be released for the rest of the year, which provide financial information relevant to Budget 2014, and the timing of their release (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1107","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":213,"content":"<p>In the past, the Department of Finance has generally released three separate publications containing macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts.<\/p><p>1.

Procurement of supplies and services accounts for around &euro;9 billion of current spending by the State per annum. This represents a very significant portion of overall spending and it is, therefore, essential that the Public Service achieves maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement.<\/p><p>  In this regard, the National Procurement Service (NPS), which will be transferring into the new Office of Government Procurement (OGP), has put in place a number of national arrangements designed to secure better value for money from leveraging the public service&rsquo;s buying power in relation to a range of goods and services that are commonly purchased across the public service. These national arrangements have benefits that include: <\/p><p>  - cash savings; <\/p><p>  - administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; <\/p><p>  - greater purchasing expertise; <\/p><p>  - improved consistency; and,<\/p><p>  - enhanced service levels. <\/p><p>  In some instances the take up of the NPS arrangements has been low. In order to increase the usage of the NPS arrangements and thereby secure best value for money, the Government decided that it should be mandatory for public service bodies to use specified national procurement arrangements. Last year my Department issued Circular 06\/12 which implements the Government decision by making it a mandatory requirement that public service bodies avail of specified national arrangements put in place by the NPS. <\/p><p>  While the key purpose of Circular 6\/12 is to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money, it is worth noting that such aggregation arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money with a minimal negative impact, or indeed a positive impact, on SMEs. While a number of the categories of goods and services mandated under the Circular are suited to single supplier national arrangements, these need not be accepted as the norm. The greater use, where appropriate, of multi-supplier frameworks can address local supplier issues while also ensuring on-going cost competitiveness of the framework itself. Such multi-supplier frameworks may also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions.  <\/p><p>  In relation to plans for further reform of public procurement, an external review of the central procurement function was commissioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The report of the review, which was published late last year, found that significant savings can be achieved through the implementation of a transformational change to the central procurement model. In December 2012, arising out of recommendations in the report I announced the appointment of a Chief Procurement Officer (CPO) to lead a key element of the Government&rsquo;s Public Service Reform agenda. The new approach to public procurement will involve:<\/p><p>-   integrating procurement policy, strategy and sourcing in one office;<\/p><p>-   strengthening spend analytics and data management;<\/p><p>-   much greater aggregation of purchasing across public bodies to achieve better value for money;<\/p><p>-   examining the specifications set out for goods and services;<\/p><p>-   evaluating demand levels to assess how demand and volume can be reduced; and<\/p><p>-   strengthening supplier and category management.<\/p><p>  Since the appointment of Mr Paul Quinn, CPO, on 28 January 2013, he has initiated and completed a series of engagements (workshops and one-to-one meetings) with key stakeholders within the public sector and their representatives in relation to the development of the proposed governance structures, implementation plan, transition arrangements and savings targets for the procurement function. The following sectors were engaged in workshops \/ meetings: Health, Education, Local Government, Defence, Justice, and other Central Government Departments.<\/p><p>  To summarise: the government wants better value for money for our substantial procurement spend and we want Irish SMEs, where necessary, to form alliances and networks to ensure they can tender on a competitive basis for this work. To ensure the reform process takes account of the needs of stakeholders further consultations will be undertaken with employees and workers&rsquo; representatives as the new Office for Government Procurement is established.  We are committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged in the process and will be encouraged, where necessary, to form alliances and networks to ensure they can tender on a competitive basis for this work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200076#WRN01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Programme Expenditure","counter":281,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200076#WRN01150"},{"type":"question","counter":282,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[28377\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200076#WRN01200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"further to his recent announcement of funding of &euro;150 million for capital projects such as new schools, roads, refurbishment of public buildings and so on, the amount of this money that has already been committed to or spent on projects; the date on which it was spent; the amount of money in real terms, out of this pool of &euro;150 million that will now be spent were the project listed already committed to and identified in the past 24 months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":283,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, last Wednesday I announced the allocation of an additional &euro;150m for new capital projects in three sectors, education, transport and social housing.

This involves the systematic evaluation of about 70 programmes. An evaluations framework was developed to ensure a consistency of approach that facilitates comparison (where appropriate) and that is cognisant of the common challenges facing enterprise evaluation. The Framework was informed by international best practice regarding the core principles and methodologies required for the evaluation of enterprise support programmes. It provides a common basis for the evaluation of all enterprise support interventions and is cognisant of common challenges and issues facing enterprise evaluation. <\/p><p>  The aim of the evaluations is to assess the appropriateness, efficiency and effectiveness of this package of supports for enterprises in Ireland. Programmes will be evaluated in terms of: <\/p><p>  - Individual programme performance;<\/p><p>  - Programme performance in relation to other interventions in the enterprise support system;<\/p><p>  - Programme performance in relation to the enterprise policy context that applied during the time period under review.<\/p><p>  The evaluations involve an extensive programme of work involving both internal and external resources. A Steering Group, chaired by Forf&aacute;s and including representatives from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the relevant Enterprise Development Agencies and an external adviser, oversaw the work.<\/p><p>  To structure the evaluations, the agency programmes were categorised by thematic area: <\/p><p>  - Entrepreneurship\/Start-up Programmes;<\/p><p>  - Research, Development and Innovation Programmes; and<\/p><p>  - Business Development Programmes.<\/p><p>  The evaluation of programmes under the first two thematic areas above has been completed and will shortly be published.  Even in advance of their publication, many of the recommendations are being implemented by my Department and relevant Agencies, both through the Action Plan for Jobs process and as part of Agency on-going redesign of programmes, as schemes are identified as the most likely to impact positively on enterprise, growth and job creation.<\/p><p>  Work on the third thematic area i.e. Business Development Programmes (BDPs) provided by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland has recently commenced.<\/p><p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is also in the process of finalising a separate Focused Policy Assessment on Enterprise Ireland supports to indigenous companies.<\/p><p>  In addition, there were general expenditure reviews of capital and current spending undertaken across my Department in mid-2011, of which a significant element related to STI (Science, Technology and Innovation) expenditure.<\/p><p>  Further, a PA Consulting report was undertaken on behalf of the Higher Education Authority (HEA) regarding a review of Cycles 1 - 3 of the Programme for Research in Third-Level Institutions (PRTLI) in 2011.

I believe that supporting lone parents to participate in education, training, and the workforce, once their children have reached an appropriate age, will improve both their own and their families' economic and social circumstances.As a result of these reforms, once an OFP recipient&rsquo;s youngest child reaches the relevant age threshold, they will no longer be entitled to the OFP payment.  These changes will be gradually phased in during the period between July 2013 and 2015. Once a customer is no longer entitled to the OFP payment and if they   still have an income support need, they can apply for another social welfare payment.  Individuals working 19 hours or more each week may be entitled to apply for FIS or to have their existing FIS claim re-rated as appropriate. It is expected, however, that the majority of individuals will apply for the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) scheme.<\/p><p>  Some of these former OFP recipients will still have caring responsibilities for young children and, as such, may not be able to meet all of the conditionality provisions that apply to the JA scheme &ndash; which requires all JA recipients to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work.<\/p><p>  That is why I have in the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013, included legislative provisions to introduce transitional arrangements into the JA scheme. These arrangements will assist former OFP customers who&rsquo;s youngest child is under 14, make the transition to JA.  These customers will be exempt from the JA conditionality that requires them to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work, until their youngest child reaches the age of 14 years. In addition, these individuals will not have to satisfy the JA rule, which requires an individual to be unemployed for at least 4 out of any 7 consecutive days. This means that lone parents under the JA transitional arrangements will be able to work a few hours each day subject to them satisfying the JA means test.<\/p><p>  The legislative amendments I am proposing to the JA scheme take account of the caring responsibilities of lone parents with young children. They also enable lone parents with young children who are working part-time &ndash; for example, mornings only &ndash; to remain in work and to receive income and activation supports as appropriate.<\/p><p>  The availability of these JA transitional arrangements to lone parents reduces the need for childcare support.  However, if a lone parent in this situation wishes to avail of an employment opportunity or engage on a Community Employment scheme, they are eligible to apply for the Subsidised After-school Child Care scheme. This scheme is available to JA customers who were former OFP recipients, who avail of an employment opportunity and who have children of primary school age (i.e. 4 to 13 years). The scheme is designed to provide subsidised afterschool childcare during the school term and full time childcare provision during school holidays.<\/p><p>  In addition to this scheme there are other child care supports available from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (D\/CYA). The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, funds some 1,000 community-based non-profit child care facilities nationwide to enable them to charge reduced child care fees to disadvantaged and low-income families who avail of their services.  The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) scheme provides subsidised childcare places for parents who engage in eligible education and training programmes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200079#WRQ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Payments","counter":344,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200079#WRQ01800"},{"type":"question","counter":345,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200079#WRQ01900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will clarify for those who come off lone parents allowance early and therefore cannot avail of jobseeker's transition due to employment but still struggle with the costs of childcare, the reason they cannot avail of the pilot after school childcare supports as part of the jobseeker's transition and the reason more childcare supports are not in place for lone parents already engaging in labour activation but are living with existing family requirements such as increased childcare costs during the summer months; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":346,"content":"<p>The person concerned is in receipt of Rent Supplement of &euro;970 per month.

The Department also used publicly available data sources including the Central Statistics Office rental indices, the Daft.ie Rental Report and leading websites advertising rental properties to ascertain both the market trends and the current asking prices for rental of one, two and three-bedroom properties.<\/p><p>The Department engaged with a number of stakeholders as part of the review process, including staff with responsibility for the administration of the rent supplement scheme.<\/p><p>In relation to the new maximum rent limits for South Tipperary I regret there was an error in the rates quoted in the list circulated to Oireachtas members. The correct limits for South Tipperary are set out in the attached table. There is no change to the single rate.<\/p><p>Department officials administering the scheme will continue to ensure that the accommodation needs of rent supplement recipients are met. The necessary regulations to give effect to the revised limits will be finalised within the coming week, and the full report of the Rent Limit Review will be published at that time.<\/p><p><b>Tabular Statement<\/b><\/p><p><b>South Tipperary Maximum Rent Limits from 17<\/b><b>th<\/b>  <b> June 2013<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th>County:<\/th><th>Single Shared<\/th><th>Couple Shared<\/th><th>Single<\/th><th>Couple<\/th><th>Couple\/One Parent Family - 1 Child<\/th><th>Couple\/One Parent Family - 2 Children<\/th><th>Couple\/One Parent Family - 3 Children<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>South Tipperary<\/td><td>&euro;195<\/td><td>&euro;220<\/td><td>&euro;370<\/td><td>&euro;400<\/td><td>&euro;485<\/td><td>&euro;500<\/td><td>&euro;525<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200080#WRR00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"One-Parent Family Payment Application Numbers","counter":360,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200080#WRR00850"},{"type":"question","counter":361,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[28391\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200080#WRR00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her plans to address the needs of those who are in receipt of one parent family payment and will be affected by the changeover to the transition payment who are working as little as an hour a day for five days; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that if these recipients change over to jobseeker's payments they will lose income and many will be left with no option but to give up employment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1028","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":362,"content":"<p>The reforms to the one-parent family payment (OFP) scheme aim to provide the necessary supports to lone parents to help them to escape poverty and social exclusion. I believe that supporting lone parents to participate in education, training, and the workforce, once their children have reached an appropriate age, will improve both their own and their families&rsquo; economic and social circumstances.As a result of these reforms once an OFP recipient&rsquo;s youngest child reaches the relevant age threshold, they will no longer be entitled to the OFP payment.  These changes will be gradually phased in during the period between July 2013 and 2015.    Should former OFP recipients still have an income support need they will be required to apply for another social welfare payment.  It is expected that the majority of individuals in these circumstances will apply for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA). They may also apply for the family income supplement (FIS) if they are working at least 19 hours per week.<\/p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013 contains legislative provisions to introduce transitional arrangements into the JA scheme to assist former OFP recipients whose youngest child is under 14 make the transition to JA.  These customers will be exempt from the JA conditionality that requires them to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work until their youngest child reaches the age of 14 years. In addition, these individuals will not have to satisfy the JA rule, which requires an individual to be unemployed for at least 4 out of any 7 consecutive days. This means that lone parents under the JA transitional arrangements will be able to work a few hours each day subject to them satisfying the JA means test.   <\/p><p>  Former OFP recipients who have a youngest child aged 14 years or over can apply for the JA payment, with the full conditionality of that scheme applied. This includes satisfying the scheme rule whereby JA is payable only where a person is fully unemployed for 4 out of any 7 days. In situations where the working patterns of former OFP recipients do not conform to this rule a number of options are available to the customer.<\/p><p>  They may be able to reorganise their current hours of employment to satisfy JA scheme conditionality or secure an increase in their hours in order to qualify for FIS. If they are unable to meet either JA or FIS scheme rules and they have an income need, they may have recourse to Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA).<\/p><p>  Persons due to exit the OFP scheme in the coming period are being engaged with at local level by Social Welfare Local \/ Intreo Offices.

The document was prepared by the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management in my Department through a collaborative process, which included consultation with stakeholders.  The intention is to ensure that Ireland continues to manage its fire risk effectively in accordance with current international best practice and that the successful approaches to fire safety, under which the level of fire fatalities recorded in 2012 was the lowest for four decades, are extended and consolidated. <\/p><p>  With a view to developing a common understanding in relation to terminology in risk management, relevant definitions are set out in KCS.  In particular, the term &quot;&#8220;Risk Assessment&quot; as used in KCS is one stage of the risk management process.  The National Directorate prepared a series of Task Analyses to show how the initial fire crew, including the incident commander, would work to safely undertake tasks normally associated with the range of fire scenarios set out in Appendix A to the document.<\/p><p>  Under Section 19 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work legislation, the phrase 'risk assessment' has a particular meaning, and requires employers to carry out risk assessments of their work activities.  Guidance on relevant aspects of risk assessment for fire services, and meeting this legislative requirement, is provided in the Fire Services Ancillary Safety Statement (generic risk assessments), in the Fire Service National Incident Command System (dynamic risk assessments) and Fire Service Standard Operational Guidance (SOGs) (specific situational risk assessments).  Individual fire services will prepare any additional risk assessments, guided by the Task Analyses referred to above, which may be necessary to comply with their statutory responsibilities as employers on foot of changes arising from implementation of KCS.  Specifically on firefighter safety, KCS recognises the importance of the twin duties on fire authorities under the Fire Services and Safety, Health and Welfare at Work legislation.  An updated Fire Services Safety Management System (SMS) support document is being developed as part of the KCS implementation process (a draft is currently out with stakeholders as part of the consultation process) to ensure that occupational health and safety in fire services is fully aligned with international best practice and the recently adopted local government SMS policy.<\/p><p>  The Keeping Communities Safe development process also considered the structures appropriate for delivering effective and efficient fire services to communities. Ultimately, it was considered that it is appropriate that fire services remain a local government service, with appropriate local political accountability.  However, while fire authorities based on the principal local authorities remain, KCS provides for a move to a &quot;shared services&quot; structure, involving a reduction in the number of actual fire services from 30 to 21.  This solution will provide for efficiencies and consistency, and evolved from a detailed consideration of options.  It was noted that there is a very good fit between the roles provided currently by local authority fire services and the local government system.<\/p><p>  The new structures provide for service delivery units based mainly around population groups between 120,000 to 200,000 persons.  There will be fourteen single authority and seven multi-authority shared services arrangements. The policy also includes a strong regional dimension based on the current eight major emergency regions to achieve\/ co-ordinate efficient service provision and &quot;mutual assistance&quot; and support among fire services.

In terms of addressing that need, the Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support requirements through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.

The recommendations from this Value for Money Review and the current position in relation to these recommendations are set out in the Table attached.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Key Recommendation<\/th><th>Current Position<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>The relative efficiency of law centres and the scope for improving efficiency through increasing throughput of cases within the existing level of resources; <\/td><td>The Board has updated efficiency indicators used in the review (the total direct cost of cases cleared and the solicitor days per case cleared for 2011 which demonstrates a continued improvement in the Legal Aid Board's productivity.  These indicators now form an important element of the Board's procedures for managing risk and performance across the law centre network. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The cost of providing services through private practitioners compared to the current model which involves mainly direct service provision through law centres<\/td><td>The Board continues to operate a mixed model of service delivery and uses private practitioners where resources allow. However, due to resource constraints, private practitioners are now mainly used for District Court cases only which attract a significantly lower fee than cases before the higher courts. The main focus of effort in the law centre network is to continue to improve work practices and procedures to increase the throughput of cases within existing resources.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The scope for co-location of services with other agencies (Family Mediation Services (FMS) now within the Board and the Courts Service), to encourage ADR (alternative dispute resolution) along the lines of the Integrated Mediation Initiative in Dolphin House.<\/td><td>This initiative has been extended following a review of its operation that clearly demonstrated efficiency savings (in terms of costs avoided). A similar integrated approach has recently been introduced in Cork and Naas in cooperation with the Courts Service;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The issue of how the current operation of the Courts (listing of cases, etc) imposes inefficiencies and costs on the Board (and indeed other Court users) - suggestion is that both the Department and the Board approach the Courts Service jointly about this matter (Key issue is the independence and wide discretion of judiciary in this regard).  <\/td><td>There is a review group in place in the Department currently examining how the efficiency of the Courts might be improved on which the Board is represented;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Seeking legislative change to enable the Board to save approx &euro;250k on practising certificates for solicitors (seek to have just one certificate for the Board in line with Chief State Solicitors Office practice rather than individual practising certificates for all solicitors employed in the Board). This is also consistent with &#8220;An Bord Snip Nua&#8221; recommendations to reduce non-pay overheads in the Board. <\/td><td>Briefing material on the suggested legislative amendment required has been supplied by the Board to the Department and it is now being considered in the context of the draft legislation covering the future regulation of the legal profession. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Reviewing locations of law centres and identification of possibilities for mergers\/consolidation (the results of the analysis undertaken illustrates that costs and throughput of cases in the smaller law centres compare favourably to the larger centres - so the case for possible merger of smaller law centres is not generally supported by the analysis). <\/td><td>The Board has reviewed the structures for service delivery in Cork, Galway and Dublin and has consolidated its previously separate Refugee Legal Services operations in those 3 locations into the law centre network. Further work on consolidation of services in the Dublin area is also underway to improve efficiency and effectiveness in that location; <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Reviewing HQ costs on an ongoing basis to seek efficiencies (&euro;500 cost per case figure is used, but this reduces if productivity in law centres rises). <\/td><td>The impact of the moratorium on recruitment has resulted in reduced numbers of staff in HQ while taking over responsibility for the corporate support functions of the FMS has increased the workload in support areas as only front-line FMS staff were transferred to the Board. A further review of support service structures is currently underway to identify how best to deploy resources in these areas of the Board to:<br \/><br \/>- better support front line service delivery; and<br \/><br \/>- meet corporate governance obligations in the most cost effective and efficient manner possible (this includes measures for the more active management of the Board's property portfolio and procurement of supplies and services).<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200085#WRW01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Vetting of Personnel","counter":465,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200086#WRX00150"},{"type":"question","counter":466,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[28186\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200086#WRX00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plan to tackle the waiting list in Garda vetting, which is currently at 16 weeks, and is unnecessarily delaying the time to process employment checks and is preventing persons from taking up employment in vital industries such as home care; the reason Garda checks are not transferable for employees between different companies operating in the same sector; the reason a new Garda check must be completed upon entering a new employment, regardless of the date of the previous check; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":467,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current average processing time for applications is approximately 14 weeks from date of receipt. However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  All organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.<\/p><p>  A vetting disclosure is made in response to a written request and with the permission of the person who is the subject of that request. Garda vetting disclosures are issued to specified organisations registered with GCVU for that purpose in respect of a particular post or employment.  The Unit processed approximately 328,000 vetting applications on behalf of these organisations in 2012.  The disclosure is made to the requesting, registered organisation of the position at the time when it is issued.  Each time a new vetting application is received, a full vetting check is conducted to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account. The non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the certificate protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service. It also affords the registered organisation the facility to assess suitability based on the most up to date information available on the applicant.<\/p><p>  I remain in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner as to how best the service can continue to be delivered and improved upon, while at all times protecting the integrity of the process. Clearly, the protection of children and vulnerable adults is the primary objective of the Garda Central Vetting Unit and this must remain the case.  The possibility of introducing an e-vetting system has been assessed and the Garda authorities are now in the process of developing a system which will enable vetting applications to be submitted electronically through a secure web service.  In addition, the system will facilitate the checking and monitoring of applications.  The relevant work is being pursued on a priority basis and it will be completed as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>  The Garda Commissioner has informed me that there are currently 1 Superintendent, 2 Sergeants and approximately 113 civilian personnel assigned to the Garda Central Vetting Unit.

A further 9 personnel were allocated to the GCVU on 13th May 2013 and an additional 6 took up positions on the 31st May 2013.  When these staff have been fully trained on the vetting process I expect there will be a positive effect on vetting times.

The objectives of this programme of reviews are to analyse Exchequer spending in a systematic manner and to provide a basis on which more informed decisions can be made within and between programmes.  Value for Money Reviews are organised in three year cycles.  As part of the 2009 &ndash; 2011 round of reviews, my Department published two reviews in January, 2012.  The publication of these reviews meant that the Department had met in full its obligations under the 2009-2011 round.  <\/p><p>  The first of these reviews was the Review of the Fisheries Decommissioning Scheme.  In terms of implementation, the key recommendations in the report were presented in the form of observations based on lessons learned from the decommissioning schemes in the 2005-2008 period.  It is intended that the findings of the review would feed into the design of any future fleet restructuring initiative.<\/p><p>  The second review completed under the 2009-2011 round was the Review of the Animal Welfare, Recording and Breeding Scheme for Suckler Herds (the Suckler Cow Scheme).  This review examined a scheme intended to have a five year life-span with its final year in 2012. In summary the review concluded that the Scheme has largely met its original objectives and brought about improvements in animal welfare, collection of breeding data and ultimately achieving improved competitiveness in the beef sector.  The review also noted that the position at the end of 2012 was different to that which prevailed at the time the Scheme was designed and recommended that neither continuation of the Scheme in its current format nor its full cessation were the preferred policy options.<\/p><p>  Bearing these findings in mind, I introduced a new Beef Data Programme in Budget 2013 to build on the progress achieved in the Suckler Cow Scheme over the previous 5 years.  The new Beef Data Programme will assist farmers in further improving the genetic quality of Irish cattle and will maintain the data flow into ICBF in order to build further knowledge and more rapid progress in breeding and ultimately in profitability for farmers.<\/p><p>  Under the 2012-2014 round of reviews, my Department is due to undertake three further Value for Money Reviews.  In 2012 work was undertaken on the Review of the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.  This review will be published shortly.  Work is currently under way on the Review of the Organic Farming Scheme.  Work on the third review in this round is scheduled to take place in 2014.

What is required is a multifaceted approach, and since this Government came to office we have been working to ensure issues relating to child protection and welfare are put front and centre. The establishment of a Department of Children and Youth Affairs was recognition of the huge body of work which needs to be done in this area.<\/p><p>  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, driving the early childhood care and education quality agenda is one of my key objectives.  I believe we can achieve this objective by taking a number of steps in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills, including the adaptation of the existing preschool inspection system to provide a more comprehensive and broader-based inspection regime for preschools, moving to a greater focus on outcomes for children.<\/p><p>  In support of this, a Joint Pilot Inspection of Early Years Services was carried out by Inspectors from the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills between September 2011 and May 2012.  This pilot will inform the proactive approach being taken.<\/p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to improve the quality of the free Preschool Year and, by extension, the quality of all early childhood care and education, through the implementation of standards and by reviewing training options for the workforce. <\/p><p>  This commitment has always been a key priority for me.<\/p><p>This is why my Department and I have been progressing work on Ireland's first-ever Early Years Strategy and this why we have been working on a comprehensive<b><\/b>  Preschool Quality Agenda. <\/p><p>  We have identified a number of key areas of action which I believe need to be considered and addressed as a matter of urgency.  These include introducing a registration system for all preschool services; taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust; publishing inspection reports on-line as soon as possible; ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance; increasing and widening the sanctions which can be taken for non-compliance. <\/p><p><b>Registration of all childcare providers<\/b><\/p><p>  Work is already underway in the Child and Family Services area of the Health Service Executive (HSE) to introduce a registration system for preschool services.  I understand this system will be in place for new services from the end of this year and will be phased in for existing services thereafter.  This is an important development because it will move services from the current position, where they are required to notify the Preschool Inspectorate of their intention to open, to a requirement to be inspected and found satisfactory, before being permitted to open.  All preschool services are currently required to pay an annual fee to the HSE of between &euro;40 and &euro;80.  I am looking at increasing this fee.  The additional funds raised will assist in improving inspection and supports for quality improvement. <\/p><p><b>Publication of Inspection Reports<\/b><\/p><p>Parents will rightly demand and expect the highest standards and this will be a key factor in driving change in the sector.  Publishing inspection reports is an essential step in ensuring high standards and accountability. All <i>new<\/i> inspection reports will be made available on-line from the HSE as a matter of urgency.  All <i>current<\/i>   inspection reports will be made available on-line in 2014.  <\/p><p><b>Taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust<\/b><\/p><p>  We are working on developing a more robust, consistent and regular inspection system  There has been a significant programme of work underway in the HSE over the past year to develop a single, consistent national inspection service (as opposed to 37 different local systems).  <\/p><p>  We propose moving to a position where there is consistent and assured national target rate for the frequency of inspection of preschool services, while ensuring capacity for prioritisation based on risk assessment.   The HSE is currently reviewing the regional spread of inspectors with a view to identifying whether either additional resources or redeployment of existing inspectors is required to achieve this. <\/p><p>  Building on this work, officials of my Department and the Department of Education and Skills have been examining options to incrementally develop a more comprehensive and broader-based inspection regime for preschools; moving away from a narrow focus on compliance, and leading to a greater focus on children's outcomes, including educational development and child well-being.  This work is being informed by the findings of the recent Joint Pilot Inspection carried out in a small number of settings by Inspectors from the Health Service Executive and the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p><b>Ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance<\/b><\/p><p>  We are working to ensure consistent action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance. There must be a follow-through on inspections.  Clearly, services which are found to be in serious breach of the Regulations will face closure and prosecution.   It is proposed to develop a protocol with the Preschool Inspectorate which will take a calibrated approach and which will enable more decisive action to be taken in response to non-compliance.<\/p><p><b>Increased Sanctions for non-compliance<\/b><\/p><p>  My Department will also be undertaking a review of the penalties currently in place for breach of the Child Care (No. 2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under the Child Care Act 1991.  The review will look at increasing the range and severity of the existing penalties including the actions which can be taken by Inspectors without recourse to court prosecution, as is currently the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200091#WRCC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Protection Issues","counter":573,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200091#WRCC00550"},{"type":"question","counter":574,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[28393\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200091#WRCC00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the fact that the Reception and Integration Agency&rsquo;s child protection policy is based on centre staff who are not RIA employees relaying a concern to the designated child protection staff member rather than the families communicating their concerns directly to the Health Service Executive or an independent body; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1093","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":575,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[28394\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061200091#WRCC00700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if her attention has be drawn to the circumstances whereby the vast majority of parents in direct provision do not know their children&rsquo;s rights and therefore do not know when their rights are violated in accordance with Children First guidelines and that they are afraid to make referrals because they may face repercussions such as transfers from one accommodation centre to another that is equally child unfriendly; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1093","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":576,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 202 and 203 together.<\/p><p>In the first instance, I would like to clarify that the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) is a functional unit of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), a division of the Department of Justice and Equality.  RIA is charged with providing accommodation and ancillary services to asylum seekers, that is, adults and their children, under the Direct Provision system while their applications for asylum are processed.  I am advised that Direct Provision centres are monitored three times a year, twice by Department of Justice staff and once by an external company.  <\/p><p>  The revised Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children was published in July, 2011. The Guidance deals with the recognition, reporting and management of child welfare and safety concerns.  It sets out a number of key messages relating to the duty to protect children and support their welfare.  The scope of Children First extends beyond the reporting of suspected neglect,  abuse and welfare concerns.  It emphasises the importance of multidisciplinary, inter-agency working in the management of such concerns.  Key to this is the sharing of information between agencies and disciplines in the best interests of children and the need for full co-operation to ensure better outcomes. It is important to stress that Children First was never intended to set out standards for care or enumerate the rights of children in Direct Provision facilities.<\/p><p>  The HSE has advised me that concerns about the welfare, safety or well-being of a child in Direct Provision are reported to the HSE Children and Family Services, in line with Children First. Referrals include welfare concerns such as a parent being hospitalised, parental illness, a child being left unsupervised by an adult or mental health concerns regarding the parent, while a smaller number would relate to child protection concerns.  <\/p><p>  There is a specific unit within RIA -the Child and Family Services Unit - whose role is to manage, deliver, co-ordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all asylum seekers residing in the direct provision system.
