In tandem with the Action Plan for Jobs, Pathways is intended to address the challenge posed by the dramatic rise in the level of unemployment during the recession.  Put simply, the purpose of the Action Plan for Jobs is to stimulate growth in employment, while the purpose of Pathways is to direct this growth towards people on the live register.  To this end the Government, under Pathways, committed to a number of ambitious process, organisation and policy reforms designed to deliver on a number of aggressive targets.  These included, for example, a target to move 75,000 people who were long-term unemployed at the start of 2012 into employment by the end of 2015 and a target to achieve a 50% increase in the progression rate of people who are more than two years unemployed.<\/p><p>  To date, the Pathways programme has delivered on a number of significant reforms.  I will not list them all here, but will mention a few.  They include the integration of three previously separate organisations &ndash; the Community Welfare Service, F&Aacute;S employment services, and Department of Social Protection income support services - into the one-stop-shop Intreo service provided by the Department of Social Protection; the re-organisation of State&rsquo;s further education and training services through the creation of education and training boards, ETBs, and SOLAS; the development of a new operating model as part of Intreo that has yielded significant reductions in claim processing times and faster and more systematic provision of employment services; the provision or refurbishment of 44 new Intreo offices around the country, with a further 16 to be completed over the coming months; the introduction of a social contract of rights and responsibilities between jobseekers and the State, through the record of mutual commitment; the formation of a labour market council of industry leaders and labour market specialists to monitor and advise on the implementation of Pathways; the establishment of employer services division within the Department - this division works closely with employers, both on a one-to-one basis and through events such as JobsWeek or agencies such as Skillnets, to promote recruitment from the live register; the introduction and-or roll-out of new services such as JobsPlus, T&Uacute;S, Gateway, JobBridge and Momentum; and the design and the procurement of a new contracted model of employment service delivery - JobPath<\/p><p>  There are definite signs that these changes are having an impact in improving the employment prospects of people who are unemployed.  At a macro level official figures from the CSO show that.  The unemployment rate has fallen to 11.1%, the lowest rate in five years and down from a peak of just over 15% in 2011.  The long-term unemployment rate fell to 6.8% in mid-2014, down from 9.2% in mid-2012.  The number of long-term unemployed people has fallen from over 200,000 in early 2012 to under 150,000 at present.  The youth unemployment rate has fallen to 27%, down from a peak of 33% in mid-2012, while in absolute terms the number of young people unemployed was down by 21,400 from 74,000 to 52,600 over the same period.<\/p> <p>Members will be aware that there is a wide consensus among forecasters that these positive trends are set to continue with the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, for example, forecasting that unemployment will fall to 9.6% on average next year.  With regard to the specific targets identified in Pathways to Work, over 55,000 people who were long-term unemployed at the start of 2012 have now moved into employment while the progression rate of people who were more than two years unemployed has already reached the target level of 40%.  This level of performance is attributable at least in part to the measures taken under the Pathways programme, for example, we know that over 60% of people who find employment under the JobsPlus scheme were more than two years unemployed; similarly, progression rates under JobBridge are some 60% and under Momentum they are approximately 40%.  These reflect the impact these services can make on the prospects of people who have had prolonged periods of unemployment.  In addition, we know our engagement with employers has resulted in the successful placement into employment of people from the live register into companies such as Eishtec, PayPal, and HP, to name but a few. <\/p><p> The purpose of Pathways to Work 2015, published last week, is to set out those actions that it is intended to take over the next 15 months to maintain the momentum and complete the programme of reforms set out in 2012.  This updated Pathways statement takes particular account of input and advice from the Labour Market Council and places a focus on the development and implementation of an account management approach to help enhance the provision of services to employers, as a means of securing employment opportunities for unemployed jobseekers; the full implementation of Youth Guarantee initiatives including the developmental internship, which is an enhanced JobsPlus offer for young people and reserved places on training programmes; the introduction of a back to work family dividend, to improve the financial benefit of employment for unemployed people with families; the measurement and publication of performance statistics for each individual Intreo office; the implementation and roll-out of JobPath as a means of augmenting the resources available to provide services to unemployed jobseekers; and the commissioning of a robust evaluation of the various Pathways initiatives to inform future policy direction.<\/p><p> In addition, in anticipation of continued employment growth and reductions in unemployment, Pathways 2015 commits to the development and evaluation of options to extend the range of activation services available to people who, although not in employment, are not on the live register.<\/p><p> I understand that the committee has expressed an interest in receiving additional information on JobPath and accordingly  my colleague, Mr. John McKeon, will present this subject.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014101500004#E00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Vaughan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413375300,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The State provides services to unemployed jobseekers using a mix of direct provision by staff employed in its own Departments and agencies and via contracted provision under commercial contracts with local development companies, LDCs, and other providers, including, for example, providers of Momentum services.  In general, and with specific reference to services provided by the Department of Social Protection, staff directly employed by the Department provide services to short-term unemployed and \"job ready\" jobseekers, whereas services to support long-term unemployed jobseekers and jobseekers with significant barriers to employment are provided by third parties under contract.<\/p><p>  It has been clear for some time that the combination of the Department&rsquo;s direct and contracted resource capacity is insufficient to provide a high level of service to all of the people currently on the live register.  In this regard, it is estimated that a total resource capacity of approximately 1,800 case workers is required to provide a systematic case management service to all of the jobseekers on the live register.  This compares with the combined capacity of our contracted and our directly provided service in 2012 which consisted of approximately 450 case workers.  As part of the process of rolling out Pathways reforms, the Department realised efficiency gains that enabled it to increase capacity by deploying a further 300 staff on employment service activities and to maximise client referrals under the existing contract arrangements with other providers.  The purpose of JobPath is to further augment our capacity in a cost-effective manner to cope with a cyclical but diminishing peak in caseload.  Towards this end, JobPath is a time limited payment by results contract model under which the cost to the Exchequer is directly linked to employment outcomes and welfare savings.<\/p> <p>It will operate alongside and complement our existing in-house and contracted resources; it will not substitute for, or displace, any existing capacity.<\/p><p> Internationally, contracted models similar to JobPath were first developed in the 1980s and are now commonplace in many OECD countries.  Accordingly, the Department drew on international experience in developing JobPath.  In addition, the Department commissioned and took advice from experts who advised and prepared reports for the EU, the OECD, the UK Government, the UK House of Parliament select committees, the National Audit Office in the UK, the Northern Ireland Executive and the Trade Union Council, TUC, in the UK.  The Department also took informal advice and input from the former Director General of Employment Policy and Services in the OECD, canvassed the opinion of Irish labour market experts in the NESC, the ESRI, the Geary Institute and the National University of Ireland in Maynooth and took input from members of the Labour Market Council.  Finally, the Department held a number of public briefing events which involved participants from advocacy groups, local development companies and trade unions among others and sought feedback from participants.<\/p><p> Taking account of the advice and feedback received and our own analysis of the performance, benefits and risks associated with contracting models in other countries, we designed JobPath over the period 2012 to 2013.  The key elements of the design are that JobPath will support people who are long-term unemployed and those newly unemployed people who are profiled as being most distant from the labour market; the Department of Social Protection will select all of the clients to be referred and will ensure that the clients referred will be a representative mix of all long-term unemployed clients on the live register; JobPath contractors will have no say in the selection of clients; the period of engagement on the programme for any individual client will be up to 52 weeks, compared to 104 weeks in Great Britain; and client referrals will be made for a period of four years with a further two year workout period giving a maximum contract duration of six years.<\/p><p> On average, it is expected that some 100,000 jobseekers per annum will be referred to JobPath over the four year referral period.  Unlike in Great Britain, jobseekers can be referred to, and will have access to, further education and training opportunities while on JobPath and every participant on the programme is guaranteed a baseline level of service &ndash; a service guarantee.  The service guarantee will ensure that all participants receive support to develop a personal progression plan, regular one-to-one and face-to-face meetings with personal advisers at a frequency of at least once per month, assistance with CV and job interview preparation, job search assistance, and in work support.  Providers have flexibility in addressing whatever barriers a jobseeker may have in securing employment, for example, child care support, travel expenses, training on basic literacy skills, computer skills and other work specific skills.<\/p><p> JobPath is a &ldquo;payment by results&rdquo; model.  An initial fee will be paid on the production of a personal progression plan for each client; subsequent \"sustainment\" payments, which will make up about 90% of the total fees for any individual client, will only be made where a person completes 13, 26, 39 and 52  weeks of sustained employment.  The fees paid to contractors are tiered based on unemployment durations such that contractors are incentivised to provide an equal level of service to all clients rather than focus their attentions on the clients who are easier to place.  In addition, contractors will be required, under contract, to commit to a specific level of progression to employment across all clients.  Fees paid to contractors are also subject to a number of controls, including retention fees and automatic price discounts.  Retention fees, which reduce the level of payments to contractors, apply if contractors fail to meet contractual performance commitments and-or if they do not deliver a satisfactory level of customer service as measured by the Department in independent customer surveys.  Price discounts will be applied automatically if employment growth in the economy exceeds those levels set out in A Strategy for Growth medium-term economic strategy 2014 -2020, published in 2013.<\/p><p> A request for tenders, setting out these conditions and requirements, was issued in December of last year and following a detailed evaluation of tenders received two preferred bidders have been selected and contracts are currently being finalised.  The two preferred bidders are Turas Nua Ltd. and Seetec Business Technology Company Ltd.  Turas Nua is a new business and is a joint venture between FRS Recruitment, a large Irish co-operative recruitment company based in Roscrea. and Working Links, an established, UK based, non-profit provider of employment services to long-term unemployed people.  Seetec Business Technology is a private company delivering a wide range of employability and skills programmes across both urban and rural areas of England.  Turas Nua Limited will operate in the southern half of the country, including towns and cities such as Cork, Limerick, and Waterford.<\/p> <p>Seetec will operate in the northern half of the country, including in towns and cities such as Dublin, Galway, Sligo and Dundalk.  Between them the two preferred bidders envisage providing services from approximately 100 outlets, employing approximately 1,000 staff around the country.  The preferred bidders have accepted all the conditions and requirements and have proposed to exceed our service and performance requirements.  If successful, they will provide service from 100 outlines and employ 1,000 staff.  Most importantly, they will help approximately 89,000 more long-term unemployed people move into employment than would be expected in the absence of JobPath.  <\/p><p> The total projected cost to the State, assuming progression to employment performance commitments are met, is approximately &euro;338 million over a six year period,  These costs will be matched by gross welfare savings of approximately &euro;505 million over the course of the contract.<\/p><p> It is important to note that JobPath is not replacing any existing service provision, either that provided directly by staff within the Department or that provided under existing contract arrangements.  JobPath does not involve the outsourcing of any existing work, nor does it require departmental staff to transfer to external providers or to cease existing work.  Its purpose is to complement and augment our core capacity and to enable the Department to adapt the total level of resourcing in a flexible manner in line with variations in demand for employment services.  The use of contracting in such circumstances is provided for under Towards 2016 and the Croke Park and Haddington Road agreements, as confirmed by the findings of the independent arbitration board established under these arrangements.<\/p><p> It is also important to note that JobPath will not have any negative impact on the existing local employment services and job clubs.  The Department intends to continue its contractual arrangements with the local employment service and job club providers following the introduction of JobPath.  In fact, Job Path offers an opportunity for these providers to expand their services and increase their revenues as they are free to participate as subcontractors  in JobPath.  Many of the providers have already indicated their intention to do so.  <\/p><p> Committee members may be familiar with criticisms of the model of contacting that has evolved in Great Britain.  It should be noted that the JobPath contract model differs significantly from the Great Britain model and the Department is satisfied, based on the inputs and advice received, that the JobPath design addresses the perceived deficiencies of Great Britain model, in particular with regard to issues such as \"cream skimming\" and \"parking\", in other words where hard-to-place jobseekers are \"parked\" and contractors focus their efforts on easy-to-place clients, and also with regard to customer service obligations, employment sustainability and profiteering.<\/p><p> A 14-day standstill period was required under EU procurement rules to provide under-bidders with an opportunity to appeal the outcome of the procurement process; this expired on 12 October.  The Department will now proceed to finalise contracts with the preferred bidders.  Subject to the successful conclusion of contracts, it is expected that JobPath will go live in mid-2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014101500005#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413376200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I hope Mr. John McKeon and I have given the committee a flavour of the progress made to date and the new initiatives contained in the Pathways document.

The intention in Pathways is to make sure that this time economic recovery benefits all of our people earlier.  In particular, it will bring a sharper focus on actions to help tackle long-term and youth joblessness.  The roll of JobPath in 2015 will be a cornerstone of this strategy, an initiative that confirms the Department's commitment to fresh and innovative approaches to the delivery of employment services.<\/p><p>  We are very happy to take any questions and provide the committee with any additional information that it may require. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014101500007#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Vaughan"},{"type":"speech","time":1413376200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I will take questions from members starting with Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014101500007#H00300","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1413376200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I will return to the JobPath scheme in respect of which I have a number of questions.  One of the key planks of the Pathways to Work strategy has been the roll-out of the Intreo offices, which I welcome.  It is a good initiative.  I have attended one, if not two, of the openings.  It is a logical approach and one that should be taken in dole offices for many years but regrettably it was not.<\/p><p>  Mr. McKeon announced another 14 Intreo offices are to open this year.  How many more such Intreo offices have not been redesigned and the necessary staff upgraded to provide the services required in such an office?  These services include some of the measures covered in the JobPath document, namely, group engagement, a case management approach and the proper focusing of jobseekers towards the services they need, be it education, if required, or jobs that are available.<\/p> <p> Turning to a different issue, people will be aware of my criticism of JobBridge so I am not going to go into that in detail because there is a full committee here.  However, I have problems with it, as do others.  This morning Subway advertised for a sandwich artist under the JobBridge programme.  Whether you agree or disagree with the JobBridge programme, these advertisements undermine and demean those who are working.  There is no such thing as a sandwich artist. Someone putting a sandwich together in Subway will require a day or two of training - maybe a week.  It does not take six months.  This shows the need for a proper internship programme.  This is free labour for companies and that is how they are using it in many instances.  How can that be prevented?  <\/p><p> In terms of the JobPath document itself, I have major concerns about this and I have raised them before.  In the document, it states it is expected that some 100 job seekers per annum will be referred to this privatised system of ensuring that job seekers look for work.  This is despite the fact that the Intreo office and the Department itself have been upgrading and retraining staff to ensure they can deliver virtually the exact same system.  The JobPath programme is mainly aimed at the long-term unemployed.  There was a problem there.  In the introduction, it is stated that the number of long-term unemployed people had fallen to 200,000 in 2012 and is currently 150,000.  If the trend continues - hopefully it will continue and jobs are being created - the need for the JobPath programme starts to disappear.  There is within the Department at this stage - according to its own figures -  750 people who are capable of doing the case-working and so forth.  Some 1,800 people were apparently needed in 2012.  We might end up with a situation similar to Dublin City Council's contract concerning the incinerator.  We might end up with the Department having to undermine its own service to provide the JobPath programme while the companies that will be running it with people who would be better served by Department officials cost-free, as these officials are already being paid .<\/p><p> My final question concerns cream-skimming and parking and so forth.  When the British were preparing their equivalent to the JobPath programme,  the exact same commitments were given to Westminster.  Major fraud has been exposed in Britain.  Reviews there have confirmed that despite representations that these practices could not and would not happen, they have happened.  This criticism exists.  How can we be sure that the same level of fraud - fabricating jobs that did not exist and getting money for placing people in employment or education which never happened - does not occur here?  Also, most of the placements in Britain were for low paid and non-sustainable work.  I welcome the fact that this programme has staged payments.  I have severe concerns about the trend towards the privatisation of service rather than continuing the role of Intreo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014101500007#H00400","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413376800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>We have heard that a further 60 Intreo offices are being rolled out in the next couple of months.

Can staffing levels and such information also be included?<\/p> <p>We are waiting for those offices to be opened in several areas where offices were closed because it is quite difficult for people to access services.<\/p><p> I am not in favour of outsourcing the JobBridge type of work to private companies.  The witnesses say that over six years it would cost &euro;338 million and they hope to save &euro;505 million.  Is that correlated with the fact that every person employed will be off the register and no longer receiving jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance?  What sort of mechanism will the Department put in place to ensure this sort of skimming does not happen?  The witnesses said there will be checks.  How transparent will they be?  If they give more than 100 people to these companies and 20 are not placed through job activation, how will we know why those people are not being given job placements?<\/p><p> According to a recent report, Ireland has the third highest number of part-time workers or workers seeking extra hours among OECD countries.

We need to keep an eye on that to ensure employers do not avail of JobsPlus and then let the people go.  I am concerned about part-time workers who receive unemployment assistance, sign off to work part-time and then sign on again.  It is a nightmare to get back into the system.  The witnesses will tell me this should not happen in the Intreo offices but it is happening.  These people are asked for all their documents when they sign on again.<\/p><p>  The family income supplement for people trying to get back to work cannot be changed for 12 months, regardless of whether their circumstances change.  That is positive but I know someone who is expecting twins and has one child already but will not apply for the family income supplement until the twins are born because it cannot be increased if an extra child is born into the family within the 12 months.  It should be possible for the family to put that into the application form.<\/p><p>  I have looked through this document and have not seen one reference to people with disabilities.  The Disability Federation of Ireland came before this committee a couple of weeks ago.  It told us that people with disabilities have problems accessing these schemes and courses.  They are not even mentioned in this document.  I would like the witnesses&rsquo; comments on that and to hear what the Department will do for people with disabilities.  Just because one has a disability does not mean one cannot work.  These schemes should be open and accessible to people with disabilities, just as they are to those without disabilities.<\/p><p>  There are 6,500 places on the MOMENTUM programme, one third for under 25 year olds.

I do not know which one is working and which one is not working, or which one is more effective and which one is less effective.  Is there one programme with which more progress needs to be made?  Is there one programme from which we need to learn?  I would like the officials to speak about the effectiveness of these programmes.  We are not getting any concrete information.  I welcome the extraordinary pathway the Department has created.  It has been an extraordinary development for the long-term unemployed and those furthest from the live register.  I say that with no churlishness.  I want to find a bit more effectiveness.  I am looking for statistics about outcomes.  How does the Department intend to move forward?  The officials might be able to answer some of my generalised questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014101500010#L00200","speaker":"1170"},{"type":"speech","time":1413377400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I welcome the officials and thank them for the presentation.  I welcome the roll-out of the Intreo offices and the slow but steady reduction in our unemployment rates.  We are definitely going in a very positive direction.  I would like to hear the views of officials on whether case officers should be able to impose reduced welfare payments on those who fail to engage with the process.  Would it be possible for them to give us some targets and timelines with regard to where the Youth Guarantee is going?  That would give us a clearer picture of the vision ahead.  The National Economic and Social Council has found that the longer someone is on the live register, the more disincentivised they are go back into employment.  We can all agree with that.  Do the officials think it would be a good idea to link jobseeker's benefit to the unemployment rate, for example by giving extra supports at the beginning and providing in some cases for decreases in those supports the longer the unemployment spell continues?  I would like to hear the witnesses' views on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014101500010#L00300","speaker":"1187"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413377700,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank the members.  In case they think I am avoiding questions, I will go through as many as I can deal with, Mr. McKeon will look after JobPath and Mr. Corcoran will look after questions relating to the Youth Guarantee and employment-unemployment trends.  If we have not reached any of the questions, members can come back to us.  I will reply in the order questions were asked and I hope I will not repeat myself.<\/p><p>  I thank members for their comments about our Intreo service.  Intreo is a catch-all name for the entire revised service to deliver payments, supports and services.  It is a service but the setting up of the Intreo offices involves three aspects, the first of which is the physical works in an office.  Ideally, where we can, we do an office over one site, but we have had to use two sites in some locations.  One hopes they are not far from each other.  Second, there is an IT infrastructure and then there is the issue of the amalgamation of staff and the kitting out of offices.  It is quite logistical.  I ask people to bear with us while we do all the offices.<\/p><p>  We have more than 60 offices and we still have 16 to do.  We hope to complete them in the coming months.  We will not have them all done by the end of the year because it is not physically possible.  It may sound a little odd but I cannot say which ones will and will not be done.  It is a joint effort between us and the Office of Public Works and sometimes when we think we are almost there and we are ready to go, something happens.  It could be something to do with planning, the bank or a landlord.  I do not want to say for definite, therefore, that any office that has not been done yet will be done.  They will be big achievements when we land them.  For example, we hope to have completed Cork by the end of the year.  Our largest office is in Cork and we are splitting that in two, north and south of the River Lee.  That will give us two Intreo centres and it is hoped that will happen before the end of the year.  The position is similar in Galway.  It may trip over into January.  They will be two big achievements.  I can supply the list of what is done and what is to come.  People will be aware of the offices that have been done.  The OPW and I are reasonably confident we will have them all done and dusted bar one or two by the end of the first quarter next year.  I emphasise that services are being delivered, although not in the Intreo setting.  The group engagements and the one-on-ones and other services are being provided.  We also have plans in train to deliver the same Intreo service in as many of our branch offices as we can, and that is important for members in more rural areas where we deliver a contract service through these offices.<\/p><p>  I take Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's point regarding JobBridge and we will investigate it.  We are trying in all cases to ensure internships that are advertised meet the strict criteria we have set down.  We follow up with inspections.  We have done approximately 8,000 inspections but we will investigate.  Mr. McKeon can say a little more about what we did in a particular area related to cleaning that came to our attention recently.<\/p> <p>If we get it wrong in certain areas, we get it wrong and we apologise.  However, as a whole, the JobBridge initiative is highly successful and very useful to people at all levels of educational attainment.  We may have to agree to differ on some of this but we certainly will take up the matter the Deputy has brought to our attention.  Deputy Joan Collins asked me about Intreo and I believe I have answered that.  Yes, the staffing levels will be commensurate with what is required.  They are tight in certain areas where we perhaps find it more difficult to get staff purely because of geography.<\/p><p> To be clear on this point, Senator Moloney of course is right that the new back-to-work family dividend the T&aacute;naiste has announced will not be taken into account in the calculation of family income supplement, FIS.  I confirm the Senator's observation is correct.  Its purpose is to increase the incentive to people with families to take up employment.  While I must talk to the Senator separately in this regard, to my knowledge it is not difficult to re-sign.  The Senator must tell me which Intreo office she considers to be difficult.  She can do that off-line with me and I will follow that up.  It used to be the case but is no longer.  I have come before this joint committee numerous times and have assured members that we have sorted that out.  However, if we have not done so in a particular area, the Senator might talk to me afterwards about it.  I thank her.<\/p><p> Was the Senator's issue with FIS to do with the application form or that one cannot add on a child?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014101500011#M00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Vaughan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413378000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>It was that one cannot add on a child.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014101500012#N00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413378000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Okay.

Again, people with disabilities should be able to access employability services locally and this is something on which one of my departmental colleagues is very strong.  We have sent out instructions or circulars to our offices and my understanding was that it was fine.

However, we are working with our colleagues in SOLAS and in the education and training boards, ETBs.<\/p> <p> There is a review of MOMENTUM about which my colleagues might wish to speak, and we learned from the review.  We had a meeting recently with my colleagues in SOLAS to see how we will proceed for this year's MOMENTUM.  The MOMENTUM training courses are focused on what is available in the labour market and what employers want.  Of those courses we also try to determine what suits best people who are long-term unemployed.  It is a two-way process.  My understanding is that it is working reasonably well on the ground, but some courses are about to start shortly.  I will give the Senator a list of the location of the offices.  <\/p><p> The Senator asked about performance data.  There is a reference to that in Pathways to Work.  Our main performance data, which is available and which we provide in parliamentary questions, is to do with pending rates in terms of how long it takes for somebody across all our payment schemes to receive payment.  Obviously, that should be as short a time as possible.  One of the areas Intreo in particular has delivered on is paying people more quickly and having a quicker assessment process.  The basic SWA weekly payments that used to be administered by the community welfare service when it was part of the Health Service Executive have just dropped.  The Department has integrated and we pay people within a week, which means there are usually some reasons to go to the community welfare side of the house.  That is an obvious statistic in terms of the way Intreo has improved the situation and the amalgamation of the staff.<\/p><p> There is more to do in that regard, and that is being signalled in Pathways to Work.  When I am before the committee I always speak about the Department having three functions in the payments space, namely, delivery of payments, activation, which is what Pathways is all about, and making sure we pay the right people, which would be something on the control side.  We have set out macro-metrics in Pathways to Work.  We will now drop those into the individual Intreo offices and decide on that.  We have to develop them but it will be in the area of progression to employment.  That is the obvious metric.  Most people would agree that the fewer metrics for people to understand, the better, and that is what we will be aiming for.<\/p><p> Gateway has a target of 3,000 places across all of the local authorities.  I will have to check the figure but we will certainly have 1,000 or more by the end of the year.  As with many arrangements that are brought in, there are teething problems.  This is a scheme operated between ourselves in the Department of Social Protection and the local authorities.  There was an effort on both sides to get it to work on the ground.  Some local authorities have met or are about to meet their targets.  Others are well behind but are now catching up.  There were various issues to be addressed.  Some of the city authorities had issues that some of the other authorities did not have.  It was a slow burner but it is getting there.  The Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, is confident that the 3,000 places will be got as a steady State position next year.  It will not be this year.<\/p> <p> I take the Senator's point that we must know in the case of the individual schemes which is more effective but we must also be clear about the reason we set up schemes, the target groups for them and what would signify they are working well.  The T&aacute;naiste would be clear and strong on the various objectives and purposes of, say, community employment schemes.  Certain schemes would have a strong professional element and training element and other schemes have a social services dimension and that may be all they can do.  We must be clear on this.  I take that point on board.  We have done reviews and more reviews are in train.  I would not disagree with any of what was said in that respect.<\/p><p> Senator Naughten asked about case officers.  I am not sure if she was asking specifically about people who are case officers or officers in general.  To be clear about penalty rates or where payment is suspended for a period, the whole purpose of having penalties is not to impose them, rather it is to make people engage.  A success would be the imposition of fewer penalties because people would be engaging.  There may be some discussion as to whether a case officer dealing with a person and advising him or her on activation training, jobs and so on would also have the power to impose a penalty.  I am not sure if that is the point the Senator is getting at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014101500012#N01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Vaughan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413378600,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Yes, that was my question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014101500014#P00200","speaker":"1187"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413378600,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I personally would not have a problem with that, although I am aware that perhaps not all of those in my organisation would agree with me.

We take it seriously.  We have carried out 8,000 inspections and have blacklisted 44 firms we believed were not honouring or respecting the terms and conditions of the scheme.  It is important to remember where JobBridge came from five years ago.  At that time there were many criticisms of the Department and many calls to address the situation in which someone who was unemployed and was offered work experience could not take up that offer without losing entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  Even when there was a work placement programme, which had a limited range, if those people took up a place on that scheme they received no contribution towards the cost of going to work.  The purpose of JobBridge was to remove the possibility that someone who was unemployed and received a legitimate work experience opportunity was unable to take it up.  It paid a little more in order that they could cover the expense of going to work.  It has been very successful.

For people who are long-term unemployed and cannot even get an interview, an internship or work experience is a better term for this opportunity.  Although a job might not be considered to be a traditional internship, it is just as valuable a way of getting back to work.  Our case officers tell me they can use it very successfully to persuade employers to give a person a chance whom they would not have let through the door for an interview.  If they ask employers to take these people on JobBridge, give them a chance, with the promise that they will work out, inevitably they do.  The employers might not have given those individuals the benefit of an interview.  We need to be careful not to have inverted snobbery about the type of job that is worthy of an internship.  I qualify that by saying there are obvious examples, and the committee members have mentioned them, where we need to be very careful.<\/p><p>  In developing the scheme, there have been calls on the Department to take a much more aggressive approach to reviewing advertisements and host organisations putting jobs up on the system.  We have to get the balance right between making it easy for jobseekers and employers to use the scheme and preventing abuse.  We have tried, pretty much successfully, to have a compliance and inspection regime rather than a verification at point of order regime.  It is entirely voluntary.  No jobseeker has to take up an internship.  We are all aware of the case of 17 or 18 schools that put up jobs on the system which we took down as soon as they were brought to our attention.  We are now working with the Department of Education and Skills to put in place a set of guidelines for schools telling them how to behave in future.  We expect to finalise that in the next week or two.<\/p><p>  We still need JobPath, even though employment performance is improving and unemployment numbers are falling.  At the moment there are between 540 and 550 people on our live register for every case worker in the Department.  That is notwithstanding the reduction in unemployment and the increase in the number of case workers.  The upper limit recommended by the OECD is 200:1.  We still have a long way to go before we would have sufficient resources to deal with what is still a peak, albeit a declining one, in unemployment.  We need the capacity.  We have built in several protections into the scheme in the event that this employment situation continues.  We have not committed in our tender and will not commit in our contract to refer the estimated 100,000.<\/p> <p>We will have to give a commitment, and what we said is 60%.  We can vary that by location and by jobseeker type, so we are only committing to sending 60% of what we think we will actually need.  That gives us some scope.  We also built in price discounts.  If the economy improves and the contractors find it easier to get people into work, we can reduce our prices by up to 16% to take account of that fact.  We have built in protections against that.  The other point to bear in mind is that when we talk about people on the live register, there is a whole cohort of people to whom we should start extending our services as the situation improves.  People with disabilities have been mentioned and there are qualified adults who are not counted on the live register and so on.  Every bit of capacity we can get, we will use.<\/p><p> With regard to the issues of cream-skimming and parking, it is correct that there have been a lot of criticisms of the British model.  I think they have had five or six different versions since the new deal in the 1990s and with each version there have been criticism and difficulties.  They thought they had got it right with their last version, but they had not quite done so.  They built in a tiered payment structure, which we copied.  They thought that would work because if providers were paid more money for dealing with somebody who was really distant from the labour market, they would not just park them.  They would spend as much time and effort on them as they spent on others.  We have copied that but have actually gone beyond it by specifying a service guarantee that is not a feature of the UK model.  In the UK they call it a \"black box\" where a jobseeker is sent to a contractor and, again, not to put too fine a point on it, to a certain extent the state says it does not care what the contractor does with him or her.  The contractor has to provide services to the jobseeker but can pick whatever services it wants to provide, whatever clients it wants and can do things its own way.  The state then comes back in two years time and hopefully the jobseeker will no longer be unemployed.  That provided flexibility for providers to pick and choose who they would deal with.  We have specified a minimum guarantee that every person we refer has to get at least a minimum of a personal progression plan, some basic training in CV writing, job searches and interview techniques and a face-to-face meeting with an employment adviser at least once a month.  The contractors cannot just park somebody, and if they do not fulfil the minimum requirements, they do not get paid.  That is very clear in our tender.  We have built in those protections.<\/p><p> The duration of our referral period is one year, while in the UK it is two years.  That is really creating scope in the UK for people, perhaps almost unconsciously, to park individuals and say, \"I will get back to them in a couple of months, I have two years to deal with them\".  In Ireland, the contractors have to deal with the people we refer to them within a year.  They cannot get away from that.  We have also built in customer satisfaction surveys.  The contractors have to hit minimum levels of customer satisfaction across all client groups or they do not get paid.  They have a minimum performance level.  They do not get paid on an individual client basis unless they get that client a job, and unless they hit a minimum performance level which we have set, we will hold back payments across all clients.  We will not hold back 100% of the payment, but we will hold back a good proportion of it.  These are all things that will help address that issue.<\/p><p> On the issue of low-paid work and more precarious employment, which some of the contractors in the UK have been accused of promoting, under the UK Department of Work and Pensions's contract, employment is defined as 16 hours of work per week.  The sustainment payment is paid every four weeks.  We have defined work as 30 hours work per week, and the sustainment payment is made every 13 weeks, so the contractors have to get the jobseeker 30 hours of work a week for 13 weeks sustainment before they get a payment.  In the UK, they could get the client 16 hours of work for four weeks and get a payment.  We have made those changes and we are also encouraging providers to send people on training programmes.  We have said we will stop the clock while somebody is on a training programme, so we will extend the referral period by the period of the training programme, up to a maximum of 26 weeks.  In the UK, there was no training allowed.  Under the work programme in the UK, contractors are not allowed send jobseekers to training.  <\/p><p> There was a question about the saving mechanism and how we can be sure that the contractor has got somebody into work and that we are paying them.  That was a problem in the UK.  We will have a number of checks.  The first is that the person for whom the contractor is claiming a job placement is no longer in receipt of a jobseeker's payment or any other welfare payment, for example, illness benefit or disability.  However, we will also confirm through a commencement of employment notice and P35 returns that we get from the Revenue Commissioners that people are actually in work.

I hope that deals with the issue.<\/p><p>  Ms Vaughan answered the question that was asked about people with disabilities.  I would like to make two further points in this regard, the first of which relates to Pathways to Work.  I have mentioned the Department's resource and capacity difficulties.  We have a group of people - jobseekers getting jobseeker's payments - on whom we impose the condition that they must be genuinely available for and seeking work.  We have inspectors who inspect that.  They have to come in and sign.  They have to swear to it every four weeks.  I think our first obligation has to be to those workers on whom we impose this condition.  We must help them to meet that conditionality.  People on disability and illness payments, etc., are not obliged to look for work.  In fact, they will probably resist very strongly any such obligation.  That is not to say we should not support them.  Notwithstanding what I have said, and Mr. Corcoran might want to comment further on the matter, I would argue that the supports given to people with disabilities exceed the supports given to jobseekers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014101500017#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1413379800,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I appreciate that, but when representatives of the Disability Federation of Ireland attended a committee meeting a couple of weeks ago, they said that people with disabilities were having difficulty accessing these schemes.

Ms Vaughan has mentioned that the second phase of the programme is just starting.  I would be pretty confident that the 6,500 places will be filled.

It is necessary to isolate the impact of one initiative from all other initiatives and everything else that might have been going on in an individual's life that might have impacted on the progression to employment or otherwise.  Having said that, one of the actions in the Pathways to Work 2015 strategy is the set-up of a robust evaluation mechanism to try to do that, to identify which schemes work and to what extent.  Often, it is easy to say which schemes do not work.  However, it can be very difficult to say which ones are really working.  We have done evaluations on JobBridge and that shows, for example, a 61% progression to employment rate which, standing alone, looks very good.  The rate for the MOMENTUM programme is about 40% and, standing alone, that looks very good.<br\/>To be precise about it, it is necessary to set up control groups and compare in a scientific way how it compares with other people in the same location with similar skills-sets and so forth.  We are working on this in the Labour Market Council.  This includes the participation of Professor John Martin, who was a professor in economics in Oxford and then became head of the OECD employment services.  Mr. Corcoran is involved.  Philip O'Connell, a professor from UCD, is involved as is Alan Gray from Indecon and Marie Sherlock from SIPTU.  These are eminent economists actively looking at how we can do this.  We would hope to have some of that insightful information next year.  <i>Prima facie<\/i>, JobsPlus is working with 61% of people on JobsPlus being more than two years unemployed.  That is a remarkable outcome.  Progression to employment rates of people who are more than two years unemployed are well below 10%.  They are typically in the order of 4% to 5%.  JobBridge, with a 61% progression to employment rate, is doing very well by international standards.  We do need more robust evaluations.

Deputy Collins asked about the extent of part-time work and under-employed part-time workers and how high the levels of this have become.  It is true that there was great growth in this during the recession.  It has, however, been coming back down over the last year or two.  Virtually all of the growth in employment in the last year was, in fact, in full-time employment, and the number of people reporting themselves as part-time under-employed, which had grown a lot, has been falling.  Many people in that position show up on the live register as casual and part-time workers because they are not getting enough hours to make up their income.  The number of such people rose from below 20,000 to close to 100,000 during the recession.  It has fallen back towards 70,000 and is still falling.  We hope that the growth in employment over the next number of years is also reflected in a continuing decline in under-employment.<\/p><p>  Senator Moloney asked about people leaving unemployment and where they go.  Exits to emigration are a very small part of all exits from our administrative statistics.  About 2% of those leaving unemployment each month report themselves as signing off because they are going abroad.  Over a third of those leaving are known to enter employment and there is about a third of people who just do not tell us why they are leaving.  Survey work in the past has indicated that the vast bulk of them do find work.  The CSO started publishing data in their annual emigration and immigration estimates on what people had been doing before they emigrated, and most emigrants are either employed or students just before they leave, rather than emigrating from unemployment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014101500019#U00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terry Corcoran"},{"type":"speech","time":1413381000,"counter":75,"content":"<p>How would Mr. Corcoran consider the non-nationals who have been living in Ireland and then return to their own country, are they classified as emigrating from Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014101500020#V00100","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413381000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>They would be counted in the emigration numbers.

The medium-term objective of the European recommendation is that as far as possible young people should be offered something within four months of becoming unemployed.  The measure we will use for that - we have set up the data systems to capture it - are that last year about 60% of young people who entered our register remained unemployed after four months.  That is the number we will be reporting on quarterly from now on and the target is to get that number down as much as possible over time.<\/p><p>  In our implementation plan published earlier this year, we published a range of measures as general metrics for progress with the youth guarantee.  There is a number of programme steps that were to be taken in the implementation plan.  These include extending the current process of engaging with the unemployed and this will happen to all young people immediately rather than only to those who are most disadvantaged as is the case for older jobseekers.  That process is now being put in place as we speak.  A number of changes have also been made already this year to programmes such as the JobsPlus subsidy, which is available only for people who have been unemployed for more than one year, if they are over 25 years, and that has been extended to young people who have been unemployed in excess of four months.  That and a number of other changes required changes to the legislation to allow us to discriminate in favour of younger people.  That was done in mid-year so those programme changes are taking place now.<\/p><p>  In the context of the Youth Guarantee and on the issue of people with disabilities, as Mr. McKeon mentioned, it is true that they are not specifically mentioned in the Youth Guarantee implementation plan.  The reason is that the main innovation in the Youth Guarantee implementation plan is that young people on jobseeker's payments will be referred to a case worker very early in their unemployment spell.  The protocol already is that any person presenting at an employment office who has a disability is allocated to a case worker immediately, either one of our own or through the local employment service or thorough the employability services that is specific to people with disabilities and operates in each county.  Those case workers working with young people with disabilities have access to the entire range of programmes that are available to other young people under the Youth Guarantee and, as Mr. McKeon mentioned, have a number of additional supports that can be given to young people with disabilities.  Specifically, there is a range of training programmes by specialist training providers that are specific to people with disabilities, delivered by SOLAS and our people can refer young people with disabilities to those.<\/p><p>  In addition, on top of any other recruitment subsidies that exist, there is a specific long-term recruitment subsidy for people with disabilities which does not just last for one or two years, as is the case with JobsPlus, but can continue indefinitely.  The employability service itself, which has a ratio of staff to clients of the order of 1:40 as opposed to the ratio of 1:500 that Mr. McKeon mentioned elsewhere, allows for provision of mentoring while in employment once people are placed and so on.<\/p> <p>It was in the context of the additional provisions that were being made in the Youth Guarantee implementation plan - it was not felt that specific additional provision needed to be made for this group - that these supports were not mentioned.  That is not to say that some advocacy groups have not raised the question of why they were not mentioned.  I think we will include a section outlining all these things in the next iteration of the plan next year.  As Mr. McKeon said, if there are any actual cases of difficulty in accessing supports, we want to hear about them.  We think this is a communications issue rather than fact.  We speak to these groups in pre-budget and post-budget forums.  We have not been hearing of specific cases.  Obviously, we would act if there were such cases.

I look forward to working closely with the committee during my time in office.  I welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee to brief it on issues that arose at the recent EU Transport Council, to update it on my priorities as Minister and give it a perspective on yesterday's budget announcement in respect of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.<\/p><p>  Within a few days of my appointment as Minister I was asked by way of parliamentary question to outline my priorities for the remainder of my term in office.  I replied on the basis that I would take stock over the coming days and weeks of all aspects of the Department's functions and work before identifying any priorities over and above those in place before I took office.  I said I would do so taking account of the Government's stated priorities, the general economic situation and my own consideration.  I also stated that I looked forward to discussing these priorities with this committee first.  With the permission of the Chairman, I will make a brief reference to them during my contribution.<\/p><p>  Before doing so I will briefly summarise the outcomes of the EU Council of transport ministers.  The Council met in Luxembourg on Wednesday, 8 October 2014, under the Italian Presidency of the European Union.<\/p> <p>Vice President Siim Kallas, responsible for transport and mobility, represented the European Commission.  Unfortunately, neither the Secretary General of the Department nor I were able to attend as the Council took place during the pre-budget negotiations on the Department&rsquo;s Estimates for 2015.  On the same day I was also required to be in the Seanad to present the Vehicle Clamping Bill 2014.  For those reasons I decided to attend to Oireachtas duties and represent the Department on the negotiations on the budget.  The Department was represented on that day by Mr. Ray O'Leary, assistant secretary, who accompanies me this morning.<br\/>In relation to the meeting itself, Members will have seen the agenda already.  The Council adopted a general approach<b><\/b>on a draft regulation on market access to port services and financial transparency of ports.  The new rules are expected to promote fairer competition and reduce legal uncertainties, thereby encouraging efficient port services and investment in ports.  Ireland welcomed the legislative basis being proposed, which is already in place in Ireland, but expressed regret that the proposal was not more ambitious while none the less supporting the compromise document.<br\/>The Council held a policy debate<b><\/b>on two proposals under what is termed the 4th railway package to improve rail services in the European Union by opening the market for domestic passenger services and introducing proposals for stronger governance.  Despite the Presidency and Commission ambition, most of the interventions from member states, including Ireland, either called for flexibility on the Commission proposals to take account of the specific characteristics in different member state markets or accepted the Commission objectives but expressed significant reservations on one or more major elements of the Commission proposals.  In its conclusion, the Presidency said there is a lot of work to be done during the coming months towards the adoption of political guidelines on the package.<br\/>The Transport Council also considered proposals for what the European Commission calls remotely piloted aircraft systems, RPAS, or what we would call drones, and their future use in a civilian context in an airspace open to general traffic.  These are defined as &ldquo;any aircraft and its associated elements, other than a balloon, kite or small aircraft which is intended to be operated with no pilot on board&rdquo;.  Ireland supports the Commission&rsquo;s communication published in April 2014 on opening the aviation market to the civil use of RPAS.  Given developments in recent years in the technology of RPAS, the Commission considers it timely that consideration be given on how RPAS operations should be addressed in a policy framework which will enable the development of a commercial RPAS market.<br\/>In Ireland, the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, has statutory responsibility for regulating safety standards in civil aviation, including RPAS.  The IAA published its policy and national legislation on the use of RPAS in October 2012.  RPAS are used for a variety of tasks in Ireland, including aerial photography and aerial survey.  Additionally, the IAA has issued registered training facility approval to four organisations seeking to become involved in the commercial use of RPAS in Ireland.<br\/>In the discussion at Transport Council, most member states referenced concerns on safety, security and privacy issues, with many countries claiming that any regulations should be kept simple and risk-based with no need for specific data protection legislation required for drones. <br\/>The Council took note of a progress report on a proposed revision of the Single European Sky<b><\/b>rules, aimed at speeding up the modernisation of EU air traffic management.<\/p> <p>The Council also adopted a general approach on a draft directive on the cross-border exchange of information on road traffic offences.  The Council considered the outcome of the informal ministerial meeting in Milan last month regarding the mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy.  The Council focused on how TEN-T and infrastructural investment could help economic development and how investment could help growth and boost economies and employment.<\/p><p> Having reviewed the functions and ongoing work of the Department, the ministerial management board within the Department - this body comprises my Secretary General and assistant secretaries general as well as the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, and I - last month agreed a number of priorities for the Department over the remaining term of the Government.  I will briefly set out what they are.  In doing so, it does not take away from the importance of the many other necessary tasks that are ongoing within my Department as part of its statutory, regulatory, governance and other functions.  The identified priorities will also be identified within the new departmental statement of strategy that is being developed and for which the views of the public and other interested parties have been invited.<\/p><p> The statement of Government priorities agreed in July 2014 has two priorities for which my Department has a lead role.  These are the cross-city Luas project and the publication of a new tourism strategy.  Regarding the former, I am pleased to report that the project is on target and within budget.  The Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, is reviewing the tenders for the main infrastructure contract and I expect and look forward to being in a position to authorise the signature of the contract early in the new year.  As members are aware, this is an important transport project for the city.  When operational, it will deliver a further 10 million passenger journeys for the city each year, an incredible development on an already high level of use.  Following testing, commissioning and trial runs, the line is expected to be operational by the end of 2017.  The European Investment Bank, EIB, has shown its endorsement of the project by approving a loan of &euro;150 million for it.<\/p><p> The second Government priority relevant to my Department is the publication of a new tourism policy.  The purpose of the review is to develop a policy statement setting out the Government's priorities in terms of the contribution tourism is to make to national economic and social goals, how that contribution will be measured and in what manner tourism can make the best contribution.  The policy will also support tourism in rural areas and, therefore, address and make a contribution to the sustainability of rural communities.  A point that I often make in much of the necessary discussion that takes place about balanced economic development and regional development is that the tourism industry touches on every part of our country.  I have long believed that it can make a powerful contribution to the objectives of balanced regional development.  I am happy to report that, following a consultation process, the new policy is on target for publication by the end of the year.<\/p><p> I should mention one other priority contained in the Government's statement of priorities that the Ministers of State, Deputies Ann Phelan and Ring, and I regard as critical to the tourism strategy and sustainable jobs in rural communities, namely, the need to ensure that the new model of 21st century apprenticeships is implemented during 2015.  This priority is important to the future sustainability of the tourism sector in particular.  As a nation, we need to have structures in place to ensure the continuing availability of the right mix of skills and job opportunities to contribute to the growth and quality of our tourism services.<\/p><p> In addition to the Government priorities, I have identified a number of other priorities.  There has been considerable progress in the development of the National Sports Campus at Abbotstown in recent years.  New facilities opened in the past year include a national horse sport arena, a national modern pentathlon centre and a national diving training centre.  A multi-sport synthetic pitch facility was also completed and opened to the public last December.  On-site accommodation has been developed to allow athletes to live and train on campus.<\/p> <p>In addition, the FAI and the GAA commenced work during the year on developing pitches for their sports at the campus.<\/p><p> Work is continuing on site, with further significant developments under way.  I am pleased to say that stimulus funding was provided by Government this year to develop a headquarters for Special Olympics Ireland at the national sports campus.  Planning permission has been sought and I look forward to seeing work commence on this project next year.<\/p><p> As members will be aware, a new national ports policy was published in March 2013.  The core objective of the policy is to facilitate a competitive and effective market for maritime transport services.  The national ports policy categorises the State commercial ports sector into ports of national significance tier 1; ports of national significance tier 2; and ports of regional significance.<\/p><p> The ports of national significance are Ireland's key international maritime gateways handling approximately 90% of all tonnage and are of significant importance in terms of our national competitiveness.  The continued commercial development of the three ports of national significance is a key objective of national ports policy, and all three ports have master plans in place setting out their development plans over the next 30 years.  Both Dublin and Cork have planning applications with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p><p> Last Friday at 5 a.m. I was very pleased to visit Dublin Port for more than four hours and to see at first hand the extraordinary work taking place there to meet the needs of our country and to hear an explanation of the impact of its planning application and development plans for the Alexandra Basin and beyond.  Some members may already have done so but I urge all members to go to Dublin Port some day early in the morning to see the scale of activity under way.  It brings home to one how vital it is to our city and country.<\/p><p> Some weeks ago I had the opportunity to see Cork Port in action.  I visited Ringaskiddy port to see the plans under way there and the impact its development plan would have on the port and beyond.  I look forward to visiting Shannon-Foynes and as many other ports as possible in the coming months because an important lesson I have learned in this role is that when we think of connectivity, the part of our national infrastructure that is key to our ability to get goods into and out of our country is our ports.  To see how much of our petroleum needs are serviced out of Dublin Port alone brought home to me the importance of this piece of national infrastructure.<\/p><p> Members will also be aware that in line with national ports policy I am bringing forward a new harbours (amendment) Bill to allow for the transfer of control of Drogheda, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Galway, New Ross and Wicklow ports to local authority control.  The Bill will also improve the board appointment process to the ports through, for example, introducing mandatory skill sets.  The committee recently returned its report on the general scheme of the Bill, which was very useful in highlighting a number of issues for consideration as we develop the Bill.  In recent days my Department has received the members' observations with regard to the Bill.  I look forward to considering them and engaging with members.  I hope to publish the Bill by the end of the first quarter of 2015.  I should make the point that the Vehicle Clamping Bill that is before the Seanad today, Committee Stage of which will be taken at 11.30 a.m., reflects and tries to take on board the input of the committee following its consideration of the heads of the Bill.<\/p><p> The Department embarked on the development of a new national aviation policy in December 2012. The last formal civil aviation policy was in 1994.  Members will be aware of the huge changes that have taken place in the aviation sector since then.  It is considered necessary to map out a policy framework to facilitate the continued growth and development of the sector in the medium term.  There has been substantial public consultation to date that has informed the development of a new policy.  It is intended to adopt and publish the new national aviation policy before the end of this year.<\/p> <p><b><\/b>The next key priority for me is the broad theme of how we pay for transport services and infrastructure now and in the future.  I accord equal weight to services and infrastructure and acknowledge the differing roles of the public and private sectors regarding each of them.  A major example of this is the development of a strategic framework for investment in land transport.  This  work is<b><\/b>being<b><\/b>undertaken by my Department and is led by a  high level steering group.  It has drawn on national and international data and research, evidence from key stakeholders, and analysis and research both commissioned and carried out within the Department and its agencies.This work is wide-ranging and includes considering the link between economic growth and investment, establishing the cost of maintaining, managing and renewing land transport infrastructure and assets over time, and identifying future needs and where that demand will arise.<br\/>The evidence from these three key areas of work, along with an understanding of key transport and travel needs, consideration of the impact on travel demand of structural changes to the economy and how to manage demand, has provided the basis for a set of overall principles, proposed by the steering group, to guide investment decisions in transport over the longer term.  This is intended to ensure that future investment decisions in the transport sector will prioritise the projects which will offer the greatest economic and social return for the resources that we can provide.  A significant gap still exists between the funding allocation for land transport and the funding levels required to maintain the existing system in adequate condition, even if all of the available funding is spent only on the current steady state of affairs. <br\/>Road safety, as Members will be aware, is also one of my main priorities, along with a concentration on a significant reduction in the number of fatal collisions.  On my first or second day in office I met a family who had lost their child in a road accident and collision.  We have all been touched by the issue in our constituencies and personal lives.  My meeting with the family brought home to me the impact of road collisions in terms of injuries and death.  The meeting reinforced for me, at a human level, the tragedy involved and the need for us to continue to focus in on the implementation of the Road Safety Strategy 2013-2020.  It was launched last year and contains 144 actions to improve on where things stand at present.<br\/>From a legislative perspective, we have published the Road Traffic Act 2014, passed earlier this year.  It includes provision for further graduated driver licensing measures and increased sanctions for the most dangerous offences such as speeding and operating a mobile telephone while driving.  In the coming weeks I shall chair a ministerial meeting to look at the implementation of the road safety strategy and all of the 144 actions.  As important as new legislation is, I am always aware that we must focus on the implementation of existing legislation.  <br\/>I shall conclude with some very brief observations on budget 2015 because I shall speak on this point in the D&aacute;il later today.  The most significant measures, from my perspective, are the retention of the 9% VAT rate, which has been welcomed by the domestic and international tourism section here in Ireland; the safeguarding of the public service obligation funding for public transport; the delivery of local, regional and national roads maintenance; and the new round of sports capital funding.  The retention of the 9% rate has been welcomed by those who work in tourism.  It is estimated that the employment in the 9% VAT category has increased by around 30,000 since the tax was first introduced.  Three years later it is the contribution whose measure is still being felt and is constantly analysed by my Department.<br\/>I wish to emphasise that the tax code is replete with measures that were introduced to deliver specific objectives.  One thing my Department has constantly done is evaluate the ongoing impact of the tax.  The two measures that we will look at are as follows.  First is the number of people who have been employed in the sector.<\/p> <p>Second, we will constantly scrutinise the value for money perception among tourists to ensure all is being done to feed that lower VAT rate into competitive and sustainable pricing for the sector.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, touched on this point in his budget contribution yesterday.<\/p><p> We are seeing continued success in the sector this year.  We have seen overseas visitor numbers increase by 9.4% in the first eight months of the year and the allocation for overseas tourism marketing in 2015 will allow the tourism agencies to undertake substantial marketing activities and help to ensure the upward momentum is maintained.<\/p><p> Investment in our public transport system is essential to keep pace with our growing economy.  Targeted investment in our national, regional and local roads, the development of projects, such as the Luas cross-city, the maintenance of our roads network and the upgrading of our bus fleet are all central to this.  In line with a commitment given to me in recent months, I am happy to say that in contrast to a trend of reducing PSO allocations in recent years, the level of PSO obligations for bus and rail services is being maintained at current levels, and next year at a level of &euro;210 million.  <\/p><p> In addition to public transport, we are also continuing to invest in our roads network.  The overall capital allocation of &euro;893 million for land transport in 2015 is broadly unchanged compared with 2014, with &euro;50 million which was provided in 2014 in once-off stimulus funding being maintained in the budget for next year.  A total of&euro;598 million has been allocated for the maintenance and improvement of our national, regional and local roads, which is broadly unchanged compared with last year.  <\/p><p> I am also pleased with the allocation of a further round of sports capital programme funding this year.  This is the third round of funding under this Government and by my Department and it will provide opportunities for clubs and organisations around the country to apply for funds.  I want to emphasise the value of this.  I am aware, both personally and from my constituency, of the extraordinary contributions voluntary organisations make to our social life.  I also want to praise the amazing contribution our professional athletes make, as it is important to do so, especially this morning.  In the deployment of a third round of sports capital funding for next year, I want to give small organisations, in particular, the opportunity to ensure they have the right equipment and facilities for all of their members.  Every Saturday morning throughout the country, we see young boys and girls having the opportunity to participate in sporting clubs which are, by and large, run on a voluntary basis.  I want to ensure they have the opportunity give the very best of services they can to the young boys and girls participating in those clubs and in those matches at weekends and during the week.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for affording me the time to report on the outcome of the Transport Council and to set out my priorities for the transport, tourism and sport sectors.  Since being appointed Minister in this Department, I have found the role to be very enjoyable.  It is varied, interesting and very demanding.  I am very privileged to have the opportunity to serve our country in this role and I will do my very best to ensure I can deliver.  I enjoy all the challenges the role brings each day.  The sectors are very different but they all play a crucial role in the daily lives of all the people we are privileged to represent while, at the same time, they contribute to employment and economic growth.  <\/p><p> I look forward to answering any questions members may wish to ask.  I have to be in the Seanad later this morning but I will do my best to respond to questions asked and I look forward to appearing before the committee again in the near future in regard to legislation or any matters members may wish to raise with me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014101500003#B00300","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413363300,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his overview of the Transport Council and his priorities going forward.  This committee looks forward to working closely with him and welcomes his input at all times.<\/p> <p>In respect of a couple of priorities, I welcome the Minister's statement that tourism is right throughout the country and that it can be a vehicle for providing balanced regional development.  The Wild Atlantic Way was an example of that this year.  I am aware there are plans for other targeted areas in the coming years.  Recently, a couple of issues arose at the committee in respect of balanced regional development.  We had a presentation from Galway Port in recent weeks which indicated that due to tiering of the ports, it may be disadvantaged because as a tier 3 port it is being handed over to the local authority.  I am not sure if the Minister has met representatives of Galway Port.<\/p><p> The other issue concerns aviation policy and regional airports.  In my area, Ireland West Airport Knock is a lifeline for getting tourists into the region from Donegal to Galway.  I welcome the extension of funding for capital and operational expenditure but I understand that in some ways it will be more restrictive than the previous support.  It is vital that support be continued for regional airports as a vehicle for delivering balanced regional development.  Perhaps the Minister would address those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014101500008#G00200","speaker":"1073","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413363600,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I will respond to the Chairman's two specific points, one of which was whether I had met representatives of Galway Port.  I am planning to meet them in the first half of November and to visit the port and to discuss its project.  As the Chairman will be aware, the project is currently the subject of the planning process.  Galway Port has submitted its plan for the development of the port.  As it is now subject to the planning process and the scrutiny involved, I will not say anything further about the project because I have to respect what is currently under way.<\/p><p>  In respect of the Chairman's further question regarding the classification of ports, I am aware of the views expressed by different ports.  Much of the classification that is being used arises from a classification that has been developed by the European Commission which, in turn, relates to our ability to access funding.  The criteria are being developed consistently across the European Union.  In order for us to have the best opportunity to access the funding that is needed, the criteria must reflect that classification.  I look forward to discussing with all ports how we will roll out, develop and deploy our national port policy.  I am fully committed to the policy as it stands.  I believe it is the right policy for a country of our size and that it offers the best chance for different ports to develop, given their importance in allowing goods and people to enter and leave our country.  <\/p><p>  I acknowledge the Chairman's comments on aviation policy and regional airports.  I have made a decision to continue a new four year plan to support airports across the country.<\/p> <p>The Chairman has already mentioned the different levels and layers of funding that our airports can access consisting of funding for capital and operational expenditure together with the funding for the PSO obligation that is made avail for different services.<\/p><p> Our proposals for our regional airports, which is part of the four year plan, is currently in with the European Commission.  We are awaiting a decision to sanction it and when that decision has been made I will look at the level of support that I can make available and how that can be delivered to different airports.

In effect the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has taken a cut this year.  Would the cut have been greater had the Minister attended the Transport Council meeting?  I believe he made the correct decision to stay at home and try to fight the case for his Department.<\/p><p>  In the course of his speech, referring to infrastructure the Minister states, \"A significant gap still exists between the funding allocation for land transport and the funding levels required to maintain the existing system in adequate condition\".  I have raised my concern about this with the Minister and his predecessor on a number of occasions.  When we see the limited amount of information that emanates from the Budget Statement as it relates to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, it is clear that further saving must be made in terms of road maintenance and under other headings, including Tourism Ireland and the Road Safety Authority.  The Minister will not be surprised that among the e-mails I received yesterday, one was from Tourism Ireland complimenting the Government on the budget.  I wonder if the person who sent it was aware that Tourism Ireland was in line for a cut in funding from the State.  Perhaps not.<\/p><p>  In the past number of years we have developed policy on road safety on a cross-party basis and this has been done to a large extent without the normal political rancour.  I want to continue to do that but it would be remiss of me not to identify that there appears to be an upward trend in road accidents in the past two years.  I remained silent on it last year because one cannot take the figures for a month or a number of months out of sequence, but it is a recurring issue.  It appears to be a problem and any reduction in the spending on road safety is a real issue.  I caution against that, particularly at the level of the Road Safety Authority.<\/p><p>  Turning to return to the comments made by the chairman of the RSA and the previous chief executive, the issue has probably greater significance in terms of enforcement.  In this regard perhaps I have missed something in the Vote for the Department of Justice and Equality, but if I have I will be happy to correct the record.  I am deeply concerned about the increase in the number of deaths and injuries on the road.  If something serious is not done to address it, we have a problem.  The strategy has worked to date because the appropriate investment was put in place in the detection and enforcement side.  The eye has been taken off the ball because of the cuts in budgets, in particular the Garda budget.  These are the two issues I am most concerned about.<\/p> <p> The State is unable to meet the funding requirements that are necessary to maintain our roads, never mind to plan for the roads that a growing economy will need.  What is often forgotten in the rush to spend the spoils of a minor level of recovery is the fact that one still needs to plan for the future.  With 4.7% growth this year and 3.9% projected for next year, activity on our roads and in the public transport system generally will increase.  Our strategy is ill-equipped to address this.  In whatever time the Minister has left in his Ministry, I would like to see a clear plan of action that is, to some extent, measured or regulated in tandem with growth rates.  If he can set out that plan and achieve funding, he will receive any support I can give.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014101500010#J00300","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413364200,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Dooley for his questions.  I will begin with his last point on road safety.  I welcome his approach to the matter, as it is something that has always been the subject of a high level of bipartisanship from Oireachtas Members.  I acknowledge the recognition given to this issue by the former Fianna F&aacute;il Minister, Mr. Noel Dempsey, and the role that he played in introducing important legislation.<\/p><p>  Most days, the first thing I look at is what has happened on our roads the previous night.  We all remember hearing about the terrible deaths of five people last weekend.  I do not have the figure for the trend as of today but, as of earlier this week, the number of deaths so far this year was unchanged compared with last year or represented an improvement of one, that is, one fewer person had lost his or her life on the road.  However, I must be clear - I see little cause to rejoice about this.  While we all heartily welcome the fact that fewer families have to deal with the loss of life or serious injury on our roads, far too many people are still the victims of road accidents, losing their lives or receiving serious injuries.  We must redouble our efforts and ensure that we deal with the issue constantly, given that it is such an important priority.<\/p><p>  Regarding the Deputy's particular point on funding, the Road Safety Authority, RSA, is in transition.  Over the next year or so, it will become entirely or almost entirely self-funding due to the level of revenue it raises from the services that it is involved in delivering.  As this happens, there will be a decrease in the current funding that my Department makes available to it.  I am certain that the organisation has the people and funding to do the work that is necessary.<\/p><p>  As to my two priorities, I will first deal with the issue of driving while intoxicated by drugs.  I will address this matter through a further road traffic Bill.  It is a major issue, particularly in terms of polydrug use, that is, where alcohol and drugs are combined.  Polydrug use is leading to behaviour on our roads that is contributing to the number of lives lost.  Second, and to answer a further question of the Deputy's, I will chair a meeting in the coming weeks of Ministers from other Departments as well as the acting Garda Commissioner with a view to examining the implementation of measures that have already been agreed.<\/p><p>  Regarding the Deputy's point about my Department's overall funding, total capital spending will be &euro;950 million in 2015.<\/p> <p>When we strip out one-off sources of funding that went in, such as stimulus funding and funding for storm relief, we can see that the baseline figure has increased by &euro;50 million since the start of the budgetary cycle this time last year.<\/p><p> Deputy Dooley made an important point about the funding that is available for national, local and regional roads.  Some &euro;598 million will be available next year.  This figure is broadly unchanged by comparison with the figure a year ago.  I agree with the Deputy's broader point about the need for funding to be put in place for national infrastructure as our economy grows.  My Department recently made a public statement on the strategic framework for investment in land transport.  This report shows that our investment in land transport is now below the European norm.  It is below the norm in many of the countries with which we compete.  My job over time will be to increase our average level of funding towards the average we believe is necessary to fund a growing economy and a safe infrastructure.  While we have taken a step in that direction by bringing some of the one-off funding into our base funding for this year, much more remains to be done.<\/p><p> I was also asked about the funding that has been made available to Tourism Ireland.  Both F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland have managed to find savings within their own organisations.  I would expect any State body to do this standard efficiency work.  I am confident that both bodies have the funding needed to advertise our tourist attractions here in Ireland.  I saw an example of their work - the advertising campaign they are running for the Wild Atlantic Way - when I was at the Flavours of Ireland event in London two weeks ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014101500011#K00200","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413364500,"counter":119,"content":"<p>As we have another major item on the agenda today, I ask members to confine their contributions to questions, where possible.

I welcome the Minister to the committee and wish him every success as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  He spoke about the investment in public transport.  Will he provide additional capital to Dublin Bus to replace some of its older buses?  As the average age of the fleet increases, maintenance costs mount up and safety problems arise.<\/p><p>  While I agree with the Minister that the new Luas construction project is very welcome, I am aware that it is leading to severe disruption.  I ask that priority be given to this problem.  It is difficult to travel down Dawson Street at the moment.  There is serious disruption on College Green and Nassau Street.  I expect that the disruption on Marlborough Street, which is to the north of the Liffey, will extend to Eden Quay as well.  An effort should be made to minimise the impact of these works.  Perhaps more work should be done on weekends, rather than between Monday and Friday.  The current activity means it takes longer to cross the city by bus or by car.  A greater effort should be made to minimise such disruption.<\/p><p>  I take the Minister's point that the number of fatal accidents has decreased even though traffic levels on the roads have increased noticeably in the last year or so.  As more people go back to work, more people are using public transport and their cars to travel around.  I welcome the fact that we have had one fewer road fatality so far this year.  Nevertheless, as the Minister said, we cannot get complacent.<\/p><p>  There is a particular safety issue with the Luas network.  A number of accidents in the last year, caused by the mix of pedestrians, Luas lines and vehicular traffic, have resulted in injuries and fatalities.  There was a fatal accident involving a constituent of mine on Abbey Street earlier this year.<\/p> <p>A greater effort must be put into ensuring there is safety where the Luas uses the same space as pedestrians and other traffic.  The issue also needs to be given a greater priority. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014101500012#L00300","speaker":"1021","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413364800,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I agree entirely with the Deputy about Luas safety.  I, along with the Rail Procurement Agency, launched a campaign last week to make pedestrians more aware of the presence of the Luas when walking and going about their business in the city.  The centrepiece of the advertising campaign is videos, provided by the RPA, of people walking in or near a Luas when moving.  The agency has informed me that it has had 70 reported instances of near or actual contact with a Luas carriage over the past year.  It has an advertising campaign under way to address the issue.<\/p><p>  In regard to the Luas cross-city project, I am very much aware of the disruption caused and I thank the business community and Dublin Bus for all that is being done to minimise it .  Further changes will be under way in early 2016.  I chair the Luas cross-city group at the moment.  I have asked it to look at how we can minimise disruption and communicate clearly to Dubliners what is under way in order they can adjust their plans accordingly.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked a question on the age of buses.  The average age of the Dublin Bus fleet is seven to eight years which is well inside the industry norm.  We have an objective in place to reduce the average age.  The average age of buses in Bus &Eacute;ireann is between five and a half years and just over six years.  I will provide funding to maintain the fleet and ensure it is as modern as possible and delivers on the needs of passengers.

In some cases people deliberately drive into walls or otherwise but it is reported as a road traffic accident.  Has the matter been examined a bit more?  This is a European issue as much as our own.

It provides a very good service, which I use five days a week.  Also, I was delighted to hear the Minister's remarks on the subsidy for next year, which is welcome.<\/p><p> I have two questions, one of which the Minister alluded to, as did the Minister for Finance in yesterday's budget announcement, namely, the issue of the 9% tourism VAT rate.  In principle I am in favour of that but all of us would agree that this summer for different reasons, including the weather factor, was probably one of the longest summers in history.  Hotels in cities and outside the cities have done very well.  There is no dispute about that, although hotel owners will always argue otherwise.  However, the hotel industry should not take us, as legislators, for granted in terms of preserving the 9% rate unless there is a return for customers, something to which the Minister referred.  Constituents have told me of their experiences holidaying in Ireland and in Northern Ireland, and have made comparisons, some of which were striking in terms of value.  The hotel industry should not take it for granted that every time we come in here to debate a budget they will get away with that.<\/p><p> The second point in this connection, which I accept does not come into the Minister's domain, concerns wage levels in the industry.  Many jobs have been created but there are questions to be answered about the wage levels in some hotels and, unfortunately, not all hotel workers are unionised.  I am saying to the Minister that those in the industry should not take it for granted that he will approve the request from those in the industry for a retention of the 9% rate every year.<\/p><p> On the road safety factor about which all of us are concerned, I heard what I presume was a Road Safety Authority advertisement this morning and one aspect struck me, which Deputy Ellis mentioned also.  It referred to 140 people involved in drunk driving in the past month.  The Minister has the power to do what no other Minister previously had the courage to do.  Can he take the decision to ban for life drivers who have been convicted of taking alcohol, the national drug, or other illegal drugs while driving?

We look forward and welcome the new legislation, Sport Ireland Bill 2014 to merge the Irish Sports Council and the National Sports Campus Development Authority.  We welcome the third round of sports capital grants.  The Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring overwhelmingly recognise the role of volunteers in sports.  The Minister states that when allocating funds for the next round, he will look at funding for the smaller organisation in particular.  I do not believe that smaller organisations will be catered for because they must compete for funding with the GAA, the FAI, Rugby, the mainline sports that attract the larger numbers, have the sporting facilities  and who continuously get repeat grants, not just in the first and second round but going over many years.  <\/p><p>  I took photographs last Sunday, which I can show the Minister now, of an event in which 300 children participated in a field with shared changing facilities provided for both boys and girls in a 40 ft container.  There were no showers or anything like that provided.  I have estimated that volunteer coaches in this organisation put in an estimated 5,000 hours a year coaching four times a week in some disadvantaged areas in west Dublin yet their application for the sport grants have been rejected over a number of years because they did not meet the criteria.  In order for this sports organisation to meet the criteria the club would have to spend thousands of euro on architects and engineers to try to get their case across the line, yet it comes down to the whim of one individual in the country council who does not like it.  In my view this is because he is more in favour of a sport in which he is involved.<\/p><p>  I have a question concerning the new round of funding.  If the Minister is serious about helping the smaller organisations, can he change the criteria for grants so that the decision on an application for funding is not just based on what is filled out in a form but might be based on a visual inspection together with the history of the organisation and the contribution it is making to the local area?<\/p> <p>Many of these volunteer coaches are getting somewhat disenchanted and discouraged.  If they walked away, hundreds if not thousands of children would be lost to sport, now and in the future, and would not be able to avail of the social benefits enjoyed by those who participate in sport.

We need to be proactive in taking the precautions that are needed to ensure we will not be affected by this crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014101500017#Q00200","speaker":"1050"},{"type":"speech","time":1413366000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I would like to pick up on what Senator Eamonn Coghlan had to say.  I missed the beginning of it, unfortunately, because I had to take a phone call.  The first of my two questions relates to sports capital grants.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, on the manner in which he has dispersed these grants since they were reintroduced.  I welcomed the Government's decision to reintroduce them in difficult times.  I am hopeful that the amount of money available for sports capital grants will be increased.  I understand the current allocation is between &euro;29 million and &euro;30 million.  I am not sure whether that figure is written in stone.  I saw a reference to it in the Minister's speech yesterday.  Has that been factored into the current Estimates?  In light of the improving economic situation, is there any flexibility to increase that figure?<\/p><p>  I share Senator Coghlan's views in relation to smaller organisations.  I know there is a tendency to go for the larger critical mass in cities and towns.  Perhaps that can be attributed to the limited amount of money that is available.  I would like to put the figure of &euro;29 million that I have mentioned in context by referring to two major projects in my home county of Leitrim.  I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, represented the Minister two weeks ago at the opening of an international-standard canoeing facility at Lough Rynn.  This project was funded substantially at a cost of &euro;900,000.  My understanding is that a further capital allocation of another couple of hundred thousand euro is needed so the facility in question can be completed to the highest international standards.  Over the past couple of years, the Leitrim GAA county board has embarked on the completion of a centre of excellence at Annaduff on the N4 outside Carrick-on-Shannon.  That project has been held up because of a lack of money.<\/p> <p>It is a &euro;1.5 million facility for the county.  It is probable a funding application will be made for approximately &euro;100,000.  I am taking those two examples for a small county like Leitrim.  In national terms it would be the equivalent of approximately &euro;29 million.  That is the reason why there is a need to consider the matter along the lines that Senator Coghlan was describing and to also hopefully increase the budget.<\/p><p> My final question relates to tourism, and here I am wearing my hat as a former chairman of F&aacute;ilte Ireland North-West.  I became aware that despite the fact that there is a North-South dimension and that Tourism Ireland represents the island of Ireland abroad, there was internal tension between the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, such as it is, and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Has the Minister become aware of this and is he concerned about ongoing suggestions that Northern Ireland should opt out of the traditional marketing of the island of Ireland abroad, or that more resources should be given to focus on Northern Ireland?  Were that to happen it would be a detrimental step.  It is a politically sensitive issue and tourism will be one of the major topics of debate at the next North-South parliamentary meeting in November.  I am curious to explore the Minster's own attitude towards the North-South dimension. Would he support a continuation of the marketing of the island of Ireland abroad?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014101500017#Q00300","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413366300,"counter":144,"content":"<p>A number of questions have been raised dealing with issues at national, international and regional level.

I agree completely with what he said about Dublin Bus in terms of the route review it has put in place and the way it has delivered that.  Dublin Bus has informed me that the review is believed to be the largest of its kind in Europe.  I look at the roll out of real-time passenger information, the availability of Wi-Fi, and while I will always make the point that these are developments that the taxpayer funds, nonetheless the drivers, staff and management of Dublin Bus have done a very good job in responding to a market that went through a very challenging time.<\/p><p>  In regard to the 9% VAT rate, I completely agree with the Deputy.  I do not believe that the sector or its representatives take the maintenance of this 9% rate as a given, and they are correct in that judgement.  Along with every other Minister, I have to put forward the case and the evidence for our support of this.  This evidence is crucial; the rate must feed into competitive pricing and it must be creating jobs.  When it stops doing those things, my ability to champion it within Government will be weakened too.  <\/p><p>  The Deputy raised the issue of a ban for life for people who are caught driving with alcohol in their systems.  I have to respect the role and scope of the courts to make decisions.  When Deputy Halligan raised a similar issue with me, I got the information regarding the level of sanction that is and has been in place, the number of people currently disqualified from driving due to having points on their licence, and the length of these disqualifications.  A large number of people have been sanctioned and there are different levels of sanction depending on the penalty received.  I will write to the committee with that information so that it can look at it and see how our current legislation is being implemented.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Colreavy made a point about freight.  That business ceased in some areas because sufficient levels of demand were no longer there to sustain it.  If the Deputy feels this has changed, I can raise the issue with David Franks and the management of Irish Rail to see whether the level of demand has changed.  Irish Rail is trying to put services in place that meet the level of market demand for freight within the resources it has available.<\/p> <p> In respect of the two roads mentioned, I confirmed earlier the funding for national, local and regional roads of &euro;598 million, which is broadly unchanged for that of a year ago.  The National Roads Authority and the local authorities will receive notification of this funding and will then make decisions regarding how it can be best spent.  I will certainly convey the Deputy's comments regarding the state of them at present. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014101500018#R00300","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413366600,"counter":147,"content":"<p>May I make one point?

Deputies and Senators from many parts of the country are raising their concerns regarding road safety on particular routes.  With the funding that we have secured, which was the first part of my job in this process, I will raise these issues with the NRA and local authorities.<\/p><p>  In regard to the point raised by Senator Eamonn Coghlan in respect of application forms by smaller clubs, I take his point and I know where he is coming from in the sense that the smaller the club the more reliance it has on voluntary participation.  In my own experience it tends to be a few people who do all the work and provide amazing training facilities to many young people.  The challenge in regard to the application process - the Senator will be aware of this as will Senator Paschal Mooney -  is that we have a duty to ensure the funding we deploy is spent well.  In order for that to be done we have to know the objective of the club in terms of how the money would be spent and whether it has a good plan to do it.  If an organisation fills in the form successfully and sets out how it plans to use funding, most organisations access a degree of funding.  I will take on board the point the Senator made as to whether there is any way in which we could make it easier or more efficient for smaller clubs to access funding.  I will look at this but I know it is an issue about which the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, feels strongly.  He said this in the House in response to a question from Deputy Eoghan Murphy last Wednesday.  We will look at the issue.  Alongside that we have a duty to ensure the money we have is well spent.<\/p> <p>Scrutiny is needed to do that.<\/p><p> I thank Deputy Fleming for raising the Ebola issue because it is a concern not only for tourists, as he said, but also for the broader public.  Earlier in the summer, we made available to airport staff extensive information regarding what they need to do and what they need to be aware of and advertising campaigns have been run in our airports in this regard.  However, I should make clear that there is only one direct route between Ireland and Africa, which is Dublin to Morocco.  Clear information has been available to all our staff regarding what they should do but the level of risk for Ireland, as the Minister for Health has stated, is low.  However, that does not mean people will be complacent in their duties in this regard.  I am a member of the Cabinet sub-committee which is examining the issue, as is the chief health officer of the HSE.  We have the correct protocols in our airports.<\/p><p> Where there is direct traffic between our ports and Africa, we have a system in place, which was agreed with the HSE and which meets the protocols of the World Health Organization, whereby any ship or container vessel approaching our ports must provide information regarding the health of the staff and sailors on board and where they have been within four and 24 hours of docking.  That document must be provided before the ship attempts to dock.  This screening is in place not just for Ebola, but for other hazards.  I am confident that is being well used in our ports because the staff understand its importance.<\/p><p> With regard to Kerry Airport and other regional airports, the four year plan is with the Commission regarding operational and capital expenditure.  When I receive the Commission's views and decision on this, I will then examine the support that can be made available to these airports.  Deputy Fleming asked specifically about Kerry Airport.  The PSO tenders have been shared with my Department and I am awaiting an adjudication on them from my officials.  I will make the decision as soon as I can because I am aware of its importance to our regional airports.<\/p><p> I thank Senator Mooney for his comments in respect of the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ring, because he put significant work into allocating that money fairly and efficiently.  On the issue of increased funding, I assure him that we put a massive effort into securing agreement for a third round of funding, which we will announce in the coming weeks.  We will do all we can to make sure the funding provided makes a difference to people.  The Senator referred to the centre for excellence in County Leitrim.  I have not attended the centre but I visited the county during the summer with my family and I saw much of the great work that has been done by GAA clubs and tourism bodies.  I am aware of the importance of the funding to them and others.  The Minister of State and I will do all we can to make sure a good level of funding is in place and to make sure it is allocated in the way outlined by the Senator and Senator Coghlan.  However, we need information from clubs and bodies first before we can do that.<\/p><p> Senator Mooney also raised an important issue regarding North-South co-operation.<\/p> <p>I am absolutely committed to the role of Tourism Ireland.  As a North-South body, it offers the most efficient and best way possible of marketing us as an island.  I was in Boston a few weeks ago to support Tourism Ireland's event, \"jump into Ireland\", which was trying to get more American tourists and journalists to come to and write about Ireland.  When they are deciding where to go and what to write about they look at an island; they do not decide what county to go to, they decide what they want to do while they are here.  An excellent example of this is golf tourism, which is a high priority for us in the coming twelve months.  We all know that two of the top ten golf clubs in the world are located in the North and I would strongly argue that the best way of marketing that across all parts of our island, North and South, is by a cohesive campaign from Tourism Ireland.  I am committed, as is our Government, to the role of Tourism Ireland, whose team does an excellent job.  When I was at the event in Boston, and at another event in London called \"Flavours of Ireland\"' a couple of weeks ago, I saw Northern businesses and tourism centres do an excellent job marketing themselves alongside businesses that are located in the South, all really well supported by Tourism Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014101500019#S01600","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413367500,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for engaging with the members in such a frank and forthright way and fielding all the questions.

We are happy to be here to answer any questions the members might have about the proposed decision.  I am joined by Mr. JP Coakley, director of operations, RTE Radio and Mr. Tom McGuire, head of RTE Radio 1.<\/p><p>  On 23 September, RTE announced that it would be ceasing its service from the Clarkstown long wave transmitter from 27 October.  Yesterday, in an interview with Sean O'Rourke, I said we were willing to reconsider the window we had set in place for the decision and were in the process of doing so.  We have had many engagements, online and over the phone, with people in the UK and Ireland about this decision.  It is evident from these communications that more time is probably needed to consult with people and communities in the UK.  Therefore, we have decided to extend the closure date to 19 January 2015 to more fully engage with people and community groups and assist them in the transition.<\/p><p>  The decision to cease any public service is not something RTE takes lightly or without serious consideration.  We know such decisions affect audiences who enjoy and rely on RTE&rsquo;s services.  However, we also know the public expects us to manage our operations and services efficiently and evolve our services as technology changes and audiences adapt.  In balancing these broad considerations we have come to the decision that now is the right time to cease our long wave Radio 1 service after ten years on air.  The decision is part of a process of continuous enhancements and development of RTE services through the adoption of new digital technologies.  For example, in 2012, RTE led the switch off of analogue and the switch over to Saorview.  The introduction of Saorview greatly improved reception across the country and allowed everyone, regardless of age, means and geographic location, to avail of television services in HD quality.<\/p> <p>We have experience in managing switch-overs like this.  The launch of SAORVIEW also enabled the State to generate an &euro;875 million dividend from the sale of spectrum and gave a significant boost to electrical retail trade.<\/p><p> This summer RTE and GAA launched GAAGO, a new digital service bringing live championship games to Irish people in over a 120 countries.  The final was viewed in 120 countries around the world.  It is a partnership with the GAA that has worked well.  Later this year RTE will launch an international player which will greatly expand our range of services to the United Kingdom.  These are only some of the recent innovations that we are bringing to our audiences.  It is fair to say in regard to the Irish Diaspora that RTE has never offered as many services as it does currently.<\/p><p> The decision to cease the long-wave service will result in an annual saving of &euro;250,000.  This is an important saving in the context of what we are going through in RTE.  I am aware that the committee has had members of RTE discussing the financial restrictions under which we operate and some of the difficult decisions that we have to take.  This decision will impact most on listeners in Britain and Northern Ireland.  We will set out some of the points surrounding the decision and we might debate those here.<\/p><p> RTE&rsquo;s long-wave service began in 2004 following the closure of the previous Atlantic 252, a music radio station which Senator Mooney would remember well, and Teamtalk, which filled the interregnum before RTE put Radio 1 on long wave.<\/p><p> With the closure of medium wave, Radio 1 extended its coverage on FM in the North.  Up until then, our coverage in the North was not good.  We now have 85% coverage in the North of Ireland.  We are looking at ways that we might be able to boost that.  There are gaps in areas, such as the Glens of Antrim, that are difficult to get into, although anybody who travels in Donegal will note that the RHE signal there is stronger than the Radio 1 signal.  Therefore, I think there is something that could be done with that signal, and Mr. Coakley is looking at that.<\/p><p> The Ofcom report noted that listeners have more flexibility and choice than ever before in access to media, and this is due in part to the expansion in the range of devices available, and I suppose the expansion of the Internet and Internet access devices.  Digital alternatives to FM radio signals have grown considerably.  Television, computers, smartphones and tablets all are, in essence, radios for those who wish to listen.<\/p><p> The Ofcom report also notes that 67% of homes in Northern Ireland have pay television services.  Of these services, Sky is the most popular, at 49%.  As the committee will be aware, RT&Eacute; Radio 1 is available on channel 0160 on Sky.  Radio 1 is also available on Virgin Media, on channel 917, and in 56% of Northern Ireland where SAORVIEW, the free DTT service, is available.  In Great Britain, the service is available on Virgin, on Sky, and on FreeSat which has 98% coverage.<\/p><p> In the world of online and mobile, Radio 1 has a host of free services and apps, that are now available but that were not available in 2004.  Our popularity among listeners overseas is evidenced by the fact that, monthly, we are now getting 1.5 million live-streams of Radio 1 through our player app.  Some 150,000 of those monthly are in the UK.  Of course, these figures do not prove that all listeners have the equipment or ability to tune to RT&Eacute; Radio 1 long wave in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, however they show that access to the service has grown since 2004.<\/p><p> While we acknowledge there is differences among the generations in their use of these new technologies, a tipping point has been reached in terms of the use of new technologies on all media.  That is not only RTE's view.  It is broadcasters' view throughout Europe.<\/p> <p>A total of 97% have made the move to digital television over the past two years and the number of people with tablets has increased hugely from 2% to 25%.  It is difficult to say with authority how many people in the UK listen to long wave because it is not measured there even by RAJAR or the BBC.  We do not measure and it would be prohibitive to engage in a survey of the UK to find out how many people are listening to long wave.  The BBC has made the decision to switch off long wave transmitters even though it has Radio 4 on long wave in the UK.  The number of long wave enabled radios sold is relatively low in this day and age.  The most common way to tune into radio both here and in Europe is through FM.  Broadcasters are generally moving away from short and medium wave to digital platforms.  For example, of the existing 74 long wave transmission facilities in Europe, 47 have been shut down.  That extends from the UK to Russia. <\/p><p> All other platforms provide greater reliability, better quality sound and are less prone to interference.  Senator Mooney will be aware that long wave transmissions in the UK are significantly interfered with by Algerian radio, particularly late at night, because they are on the same frequency, 252.  That is an issue we cannot address.  In summary, we believe long wave to be a relatively expensive, unreliable, poor quality and unpopular platform.<\/p><p> Just as we have a responsibility to constantly evolve and enhance our services, we also have a responsibility to clearly communicate these decisions.  We announced this on 23 September and we set a deadline similar to the launch of Saorview.  Sometimes a deadline is the best way to find out the number of people who will be impacted.  We found with Saorview that the majority of people switched over in the final two weeks leading up to the deadline.  However, we recognise that we may not have fully scoped out the alternatives available in the UK.  More alternatives have come to light even in the past week and we need more time to investigate them, particularly with BT in the UK..<\/p><p> The RTE information office has set up a helpline.  We also have a website to advise people on how to stay tuned and switch services.  We are doing a great deal to communicate with people and to find out the impact on a one to one level.

Given the context of where the company is financially, as previous RTE delegations have outlined to the committee, all the easy decisions have been made in terms of where we can find cuts.  The cuts we need to make have not ceased.  There is more work to be done to ensure RTE breaks even in 2014 and into 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014101500022#W00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Jennings","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413368400,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Jennings.  All of us were taken by surprise, as were the people affected, by the fact that it was announced in September that the broadcasts would cease in October.  Mr. Jennings mentioned that might have been done to concentrate minds and gauge the reaction.  The reaction, from our perspective, has increased significantly in recent days, as the public has become aware of it.<\/p> <p>Members, through their involvement in the community and meeting people in Britain over the years, know that keeping the connection with Ireland is hugely important and RTE has been the lifeline for many people, especially those who might not be technologically aware or otherwise.<\/p><p> I welcome Mr. Jennings's opening remarks that RTE will delay this until January because more consultation needs to take place.  The Irish in Britain organisation, in particular, has been in contact with us with us with signatures and so on.  This is gaining momentum.  There needs to be a clear way in which that element, which might be small but it is important, can be further consulted and their views can be taken on board.  If it is possible to accommodate keeping that connection with RTE, the national broadcaster, that is fine but from what we are hearing and from talking to other Members, that is not possible at the moment.  <\/p><p> Is there any alternative?  Mr. Jennings spoke about the cost.  I understand it transmits 24-hours per day currently.  Could a compromise be reached in that it could continue to transmit but from 7 a.m. to sometime in the evening when, I presume, the largest tranche of people would be listening?  <\/p><p> Mr. Jennings mentioned that the BBC is going to get rid of long wave.  I do not think it has made any announcements in that area so far.  Again, some of the people who have been in contact with us would say that it is doing it in a more planned way than has happened here.<\/p><p> I am not the most advanced technologically but digital radio coverage in Ireland seems to cover only 52% of the country whereas in Britain, it is something like 97%.

I should declare my interest.  I know it is stating the obvious, but I spent all of my broadcasting career i the public service.  I have a very strong empathy with RTE.  I know most of their representatives here.  It does not give me any great pleasure to be in a situation where I am effectively attempting to reflect and respond to what the Chairman referred to in his own remarks, to a huge upsurge of reaction, much of it emotional as well as practical, about the decision that RTE has taken.<br\/>The core of the decision goes to the relationship between the Irish establishment, such as it is - and that includes RTE - and the Irish diaspora in Britain.  Those who represent this community see it as an insult, as a slap in the face, as a shutting of the door.  It is full of symbolism, apart from the practicalities.  Earlier this morning I took a call from Ms Sally Mulready, who was appointed by the President, Mr. Michael D. Higgins, to the Council of State.  She is a voice for the Irish in Britain and has been long involved, particularly, in helping the aged in Britain.  I understand that she will probably be meeting with Mr. Coakley's delegation when it visits the UK shortly, which I welcome.  It is very important that RTE consult as widely as possible with the Irish community in Britain when it sends a delegation abroad.<br\/>To give an indication to the members of the committee of the depth of feeling there is, the two major newspapers that service the Irish diaspora in Britain are the<i>Irish Post <\/i>and the <i>Irish World<\/i>.  The<i>Irish Post<\/i>ran a headline last week stating that &quot;RTE [is] accused of 'ignoring diaspora' with longwave axe&quot;.<\/p> <p>It quotes people such as the author of \"A Hidden History - Irish in Liverpool\", Tony Birtill, who stated long wave plays a big part in elderly people's lives in the Irish community.  Mr. Birtill stated, \"If you go around to a lot of houses in Liverpool, they&rsquo;ll have it on permanently to 252\", and that, \"Many such people live alone and RTE 1 on long wave is a very important means for them to stay in touch with Ireland, and the outside world generally\".  This encapsulates the general view all of us have seen in the e-mails and phone calls we have received.  An individual known to all the witnesses, and in particular Mr. Coakley because he has communicated for years on digital, is Enda O'Kane, who worked as an engineer with RTE.  His view is that embracing digital audio broadcasting has not come about primarily because it is not seen as a viable option.  It has not developed.  I ask Mr. Coakley to correct me if I am wrong because I am not a technical person like the Chairman.  I do not believe the BBC has embraced DAB.  It is a controversial option and I am not at all surprised that independent radio in Ireland has not embraced it because of the question marks surrounding it.<\/p><p> There is symbolism attached to this, and it is very important that RTE as the national broadcaster addresses these issues because they will arise, as reflected in what has already been stated publicly.  This is how Irish people see it.  One man who wrote to me stated he thought it was a disgraceful decision.  Another man stated it made him very angry and that it was a smack in the face for the Irish in Britain and made a nonsense of President Higgins's remarks during his State visit in May about how much modern Ireland appreciates its emigrants.  He stated the Irish establishment likes to pick their pockets as tourists and investors but is unwilling to provide them with an adequate radio link.  This is very emotional but is reflective of what people think and say and cannot be ignored.  This is what the witnesses will get when they visit England.<\/p><p> Approximately two weeks ago, the committee received a letter from the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment of the Northern Ireland Assembly about this issue, such is its concern.  I had not factored in the Northern Ireland dimension.  The witnesses stated there is 85% coverage, but one man stated RTE FM reception in the North is only good within 25 miles of the Border, and that when one drives up the A1 the FM signal goes by the time one reaches Sprucefield, so to listen to RTE radio in Belfast in the car, one needs the long wave service.  Will the witnesses address this in particular?  He spoke about it being a short-sighted penny-pinching decision.  Obviously it is having an impact in Northern Ireland given that the Northern Ireland Assembly committee saw fit to write to this committee.  The witnesses need to address this issue with regard to long wave.<\/p><p> Mr. Maguire made a very interesting point.  When Mr. Jennings was on the radio yesterday with Se&aacute;n O'Rourke, he spoke about the 252 service being off the air for a couple of days.  Mr. Maguire is quoted as stating that due to technical problems earlier this year, long wave RTE was off the air for an entire Sunday and only seven complaints were received.  I thought about this as a former emigrant.  Emigrants are somewhat disconnected from mainstream Ireland.  The chances are that many people were probably very upset about the fact it went off the air but they did not know how to complain or to where to make a complaint, especially given the demographics.  They did not know how one complains to RTE.  Perhaps they thought something was wrong with the radio because it was off for a few hours.  The demographic listening are not people who are into satellite dishes, DAB or other digital platforms.<\/p><p> I suggest the overwhelming majority of people who listen to long wave in the UK do so in their cars.  There is huge trade between Britain and Ireland, and anyone who travels over and back to Britain, such as truck drivers, people on holidays or commercial traffic, listens.  The first thing I do when I use the ferry after medium wave goes is to switch to long wave to pick up RTE.<\/p> <p>One will get it as far away as London.  London generally has been a difficult transmission area.  I am sorry to go on about this but it is so important for the Irish in Britain that I want to try to marshal as much strong feeling as possible about it.  We are here to try to reflect their views.  I welcome the fact that RTE has deferred the decision and that it is going to embark on a consultative process with the Irish communities in Britain or those who represent them.  Why does it cost &euro;250,000 for what is effectively a re-broadcast of an existing service?  There is no new programming on 252.<\/p><p> This is not just an operational matter.  This is a policy issue for the Government.  I may sound partisan but the Government appointed a Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora.  He is aware of this.  If RTE has a financial difficulty in this regard, the Government should step in, as the British Government does in funding the BBC overseas service, which offsets any reduction in its long wave service because it will continue to operate a service to its diaspora.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014101500026#AA00700","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413369600,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I take on board everything Senator Mooney has said.

Prior to 2004 RTE radio&rsquo;s transmission ended at Birmingham.  Since then and more recently one can get RTE radio globally.  We have seen very strong growth in those platforms and we are reaching people in a way we have not done previously.  The long wave service reception is unreliable.<\/p> <p>It dies at night because of the large transmitter in Tipaza, Algeria.  It is prone to interference from a host of electrical signals, as anybody who has ever fried a hair dryer near a long wave radio will know.  I would say that in terms of every other option available to people it has a higher quality and opens up a wider world of choice.  This is a transition we are all making in terms of digital technologies, and to a certain extent this transition is resonant with that.<\/p><p> In terms of the gentleman the Senator mentioned and a particular view on DAB, I have been following the development of DAB since 2004 when the acronym was dead and buried, so to speak, and I am pleased to see that there is a resurgence of development and interest in DAB throughout Europe.  The reason for that is the need for a digital terrestrial version of radio, similar to the need for a digital terrestrial television service, and to ensure these things are sovereign, efficient, offer more choice and are of better quality.<\/p><p> I take issue with the idea that DAB is failing in the United Kingdom.  I mentioned earlier the listenership figure for DAB, which is two thirds of all digital listening.  Also, in recent months the UK regulator, Ofcom, has announced the competition for a second commercial DAB multiplex throughout the country.  That is not an indicator of a failing proposition.<\/p><p> In terms of FM coverage in Northern Ireland, I disagree that FM dies at Springfield.  I have driven to Belfast with an interest in hearing our reception.  As Mr. Jennings stated, we believe we are available in 85% of the region.  No network is perfect, and our FM network in Northern Ireland is not perfect.  As the Senator knows, we are constrained to our own jurisdiction in respect of transmission so that is something we should continue to try to develop.  We should also look at the DAB network in Northern Ireland to see if there is something we can do from the Radio 1 point of view.<\/p><p> The vast majority of our calls and contacts are from Great Britain rather than from Northern Ireland.  Approximately 75% of total calls are from our listeners in Great Britain.<\/p><p> With regard to the cost, this structure is almost 1,000 feet high.  The requirement is that this entire structure would be fed sufficient electricity that it would radiate as a structure.

A man in Berkshire wrote to me yesterday and as I read the letter, I realised this man had Freesat, and we spoke with him.  That is part of the transition that has to happen.  We need to engage with community groups and the GAA in the UK because in terms of the community we are talking about, and as someone who has connections to a fifth generation growing up in Cheshire, we need to be able to liaise with those people and show them that this service is available but in a different way.<\/p><p>  It is interesting that the majority of the notes we got were sent by e-mail so one could say we already have a connection, but we need to explore that and connect properly.

I am an RTE radio listener.  By and large I compliment the delegation on the improvements made particularly in the area of documentaries and music.  It is not the only radio station I listen to.  I listen to a good deal of radio because television is rather boring and has gone tabloid.  One can hide in one's radio much better.  I am a great admirer of the BBC in terms of the quality of its programmes and in many respects RTE has managed to match it and exceed it.  I am not so sure about some of its current affairs programmes during the period of the collapse of our little country.  At times, some of those who were broadcasting current affairs threw most of our children out of the country as it was so morbid but sin sc&eacute;al eile.<\/p><p>  Like Senator Paschal Mooney I took the boat to England in the 1980s.  I was fascinated that the generation ahead of me had their radios welded on one station.  In the beginning I thought it was sad that people would be that fixed.  These were people, aunts and uncles, who left Ireland during the 1930s and 1940s, and who raised British children but still had their radio welded on this one station.  That was remarkable.  The music they listened to was music that my generation did not listen to; we were trying to get something louder.  It is a fact of life, that is the way people were.  That applied not only in London but elsewhere.  I met friends in Glasgow and Edinburgh who have a huge Donegal connection and the fixation with the one station was an exact replica.  I used to wonder why people, British citizens, would listen to the \"News at One\" and current affairs on what was going in Ireland.  I came to the conclusion, given that these people would not move the dial to other stations, which I will not mention, that the older the person the more precious RTE was to them, especially at weekends. <\/p><p>  In various workplaces I met Irish people who, on a Monday morning - I am not sure if they talked about Senator Paschal Mooney's programme -  certainly talked about other programmes, many of the names of which I did not know.  In the 1980s people in the workplace talked about what was on RTE and I am sure that continued into the 1990s and it was precious to them.  I have no doubt that in time the long wave transmitter will eventually fade out.  I am not here to argue that point with the delegation but what is being missed is that there is this generation of a particular age cohort that no matter what one does, they do not send e-mails, etc.   That is the reality.<\/p><p>  I think all of us know that there are many Irish people who live independently and, maybe, in isolated conditions and the one connection they have with the home base is the RTE station, which happens to be on long wave transmitter.  We are debating something that is pretty much for a generation behind us and which treats this station as very precious.  It will eventually fade out but like others I welcome the fact that it will continue into next year.<\/p> <p>I am quite sure there is sufficient talent within the financial sector of RTE to find some ways to make the necessary saving.  I could suggest some but I do not want to be on the \"Six One News\".  I will leave that to my esteemed colleague who set the house on fire the last time RTE was here.  I am sure it can find other ways to do this.<\/p><p> It goes back to the generational aspect and the preciousness of the connection between this country and those who had to leave it.  To repeat, it will fade itself out, so perhaps RTE should reconsider this.

I will not repeat what has been said.  We have all received the e-mails and we all understand the level of hurt among Irish people abroad who cherish that connection they have with this country.  Some of them feel we pay them lip-service.  We talk about how precious the diaspora is and yet we make a decision like this which cuts off an important communication link they have with home.  I will not go into the details.<\/p><p>  A good point was made that many of these messages have been sent by e-mail but not all of them have been sent by the person making the complaint because I match the sender's name with the e-mailer's address.  Obviously, some of these messages are going to people who use e-mail to get their point across.  I would not like anyone to think that they are sitting there with laptops sending e-mails about long wave 252.  <\/p><p>  I am glad RTE accepts there was inadequate analysis of the impact of the decision it made.  It has accepted that by virtue of the fact it has now announced that the end date is being extended to 19 January 2015 in order to allow time for discussions with individuals and organisations in Northern Ireland and in Britain.  If there was a flawed analysis of the impact analysis, was there also a flawed analysis of the possible technical solution?  <\/p><p>  RTE states that it costs &euro;250,000 per annum to operate this service.  I share Senator Mooney's dismay that it costs &euro;250,000 to run a different platform.  It seems extraordinary.  I am not a technician or an electronics or a broadcasting engineer.  I do not know whether long wave can co-exist on the same mast as FM.  I do not know the answer to that question but I assume somebody in RTE does.  I also assume these issues have been considered.  <\/p><p>  I do not know whether long wave and FM can share the same power or whether there is a way to dramatically reduce the &euro;250,000 per annum operational cost, whether it continues at Clarkstown or relocates to an existing mast somewhere else.  I understand RTE must cut costs and that it is doing so.  It provides a good service.<\/p> <p>However, we all complain about individual aspects of the service.<\/p><p> I was disappointed that this decision was made and that the first I knew about it was when I started getting e-mails from residents in the Six Counties and in Britain.  It was hastily done on flawed analysis.  While I welcome that there are to be further discussions, it is clear that it is not consultation as to whether this was a good or a bad proposal, but simply a discussion on possible alternatives.  I hope that the possible alternatives will not turn away many who value this connection with the country so much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014101500031#FF00300","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413370800,"counter":204,"content":"<p>There are a couple of points.  I can ask my colleagues to respond to a couple of others.<\/p><p>  On the finances in RTE, we are in a position where, by and large, every decision that we make has an impact in terms of cuts.  I would not say it is death by 1,000 cuts but we are cutting a lot of things around the organisation.  Whether it is television programmes not returning or restrictions in certain areas in radio, no matter the cuts they impact on somebody and some part of our service.  I would love to be managing director of RTE radio in a period where we have enough money to do what we want to do but I am not alone in the country in struggling with that issue.  Probably, in terms of their constituents and the sort of representations that they receive, those in this room would be more aware of it than I am.<\/p><p>  We do not pretend that any cuts that we make do not have an impact.  What we do is try to find the best possible solution to any cuts or look to see is there an alternative way to offer a programme or service.  In some cases, we do not have an alternative to some of the cuts that we have made.<\/p><p>  My colleagues in other parts of the organisation, whether in digital, in television or in news, could bore the members to tears with the impact the imposition of the cuts and the lack of funding for RTE is having in terms of our services.  Before my time, RTE presented a document to the Government and the committee on a long-term strategy for RTE in terms of its funding and looking forward in terms of the services it could provide.  That document, which was our strategy, contained a base-case scenario and what we could do if we had more funding.  RTE is currently operating at &euro;14 million less than the base case that we presented to the committee.  That is a difficulty for us, and the proposed broadcasting charge is not on the immediate horizon.<\/p><p>  We are in a period where we will have to contract to do our business.  That is the way it is.  It would not be proper for RTE to operate a business knowing that it will have huge losses.  That is not the way we are set up.  We cannot operate like that.<\/p><p>  Last year, we broke even.  Given the impositions that I mentioned earlier, we are struggling to break even this year.  It will be a consistent struggle for RTE until it is decided what is the adequate funding for the public service broadcaster in this country.<\/p><p>  There has been a number of independent reports.  We are up to five now from various different sources, including Oliver &amp;amp; Ohlbaum, NewERA and the BAI, all of which recommended that RTE is underfunded, and we agreed with that.<\/p><p>  None of us wants to make cuts.  None of us wants to have to make these decisions.  We would much rather be in a position where we are not doing this.  That said, we must ensure that the cuts that we make are the right cuts for our listeners, our viewers and those who use our services.<\/p><p>  Deputy Colreavy, in his point on the e-mail correspondence, is correct.  In fact, the e-mail correspondences are the easiest ones to resolve because sometimes, as Mr. McGuire stated, they do not know that there is an easy solution for them, there and then.  The queries that are not easy to resolve are from those who do not have e-mail, do not have a mobile telephone or do not have FreeSat, Virgin or Sky.  That is the purpose of this exercise in respect of consulting with listeners.<\/p> <p>It is to identify what is that number, who they are and whether this can be resolved to everyone's satisfaction.  In a sense, the Deputy's point is correct but the easy bit to resolve actually concerns those who contact us via e-mail.<\/p><p> When the Deputy mentioned the Northern Ireland issue, I realised I had not addressed an issue raised in the last question concerning the correspondence from the Northern Ireland committee.  We have been engaging with it and have sent to it a detailed response.  I note that committee has asked this joint committee to pick up this issue with us but we are also quite prepared to engage with them, if they wish, and to visit them on the issue.  As for the technical issues regarding the mast and whether long wave could be put on to it, I will defer to my colleague, Mr. Coakley, in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014101500032#GG00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Jennings","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413371100,"counter":206,"content":"<p>The quick answer to the question is unfortunately, it cannot.

From the point of view of the Irish in Britain, this is the second botched announcement from RTE within two years, the first being the closure of the London office.  I understand it has been advertised this morning that RTE now wishes to reopen it and to base a person in ITN.  There is a press release on RTE's website to the effect that it intends to recruit somebody, which probably is an acknowledgement that the closure should not have happened in the first place.  I note that considerable disappointment was expressed at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly that alternatives were not considered when that office was closed and that alternative savings were not made.<\/p><p>  I agree with Deputy Maloney that a sledgehammer was used to crack a nut because this probably would have gone away naturally, for want of a better expression, in any event.  I am aware it was a huge connection, having worked in the United Kingdom over summer holidays and having stayed with an uncle who had emigrated in the 1950s, in whose home the radio was never turned off and the television was never turned on.  Regardless of whether it was Munster championships or even weather or sea area forecasts, these were huge things in the lives of those people.  They are of a generation in which the only tablets they get come from a pharmacy and as for asking them to go online or do anything like that, it simply is an absolute foreign language.<\/p><p>  In respect of the cost of &euro;250,000 associated with this service, one point that has not been mentioned heretofore concerns RTE's advertising stream, through which it is co-financed.  I imagine that those who advertise with RTE do so in the knowledge that their advertising is also going out to a wider community of people outside this jurisdiction, including Northern Ireland and Britain and that there is a potential return for RTE's advertisers from the money they pay RTE for advertising.  It is not simply advertising within the Twenty-six Counties but is a much wider remit.  The amount of money involved is relatively small when one considers RTE's total revenue or its total income.  I have stated here previously that when one considers some of the salaries RTE is paying, getting a position within RTE on a prime-time television or radio slot is like winning the lotto because it does not get any better than that.  No other broadcasters in Britain or Ireland are paying as much as RTE still does, relative to the size of the country.  The population of Britain is 20 times that of Ireland and one should consider the salary base there.<\/p><p>  One should then consider the service that is provided to what is, by and large, an elderly cohort of people in Britain and Northern Ireland, who are not technologically adept and who do not have the skills set to change.  I do not dispute the figure of &euro;250,000 that is required to provide the service, because it probably represents a fair assessment.  However, that sum will be taken and RTE proposes to get rid of this service without any consideration of the damage it might do to the advertising base, for instance, for those who no longer will have the wherewithal to listen.  Regardless of whether Barry's tea or Lyon's tea is being advertised on the radio in the United Kingdom, this is a cohort of people who buy such products and who always will and they are being sold to over the system RTE now proposes to close down.  As I stated at the outset, RTE made a botched job of the announcement of the closure of the London office.<\/p> <p>That was evident when President Higgins visited the UK and not only did RTE not have a London office, but the whole of Montrose was transposed to Windsor.  Even the weather forecast was broadcast from there during the few days of the visit.  Everybody was dispatched there, highlighting the fact that the office should never have closed in the first instance.  RTE is being penny mean and pound foolish and it is not seeing the bigger picture.  If &euro;250,000 cannot be sourced in the organisation without discommoding a significant group of people who have been loyal to the station for a long number of years and to its advertisers, who, in turn, have been loyal to the station, it needs to look at this again before making another bags of an announcement when it comes to the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014101500033#HH00400","speaker":"1058","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413371700,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I presume all advertisers advertise with RTE radio for all our services in the knowledge that they are broadcast in the UK.

The funeral took place on 24 August.  He is from Ballina and his family is friends with mine.  On 23 September - I know this is a matter of contention - the family was informed by the garda&iacute; that there was to be a \"Late Late Show\" on the circumstances surrounding what happened at their home on 16 August.  We have a mother grieving the loss of her son, worrying about the health of her only other son, trying to keep her family together, who is forced into sending a letter on 1 October, less than two months after her son was murdered, to the then Director General of RTE to try and stop this episode from going ahead.  As the executive producer, Mr. Jennings wrote to Nuala Creane in response to the letter she wrote to Cathal Goan.  He emphasised that it was not his intention to add to the immense hurt and distress visited upon her family.  I hope none of us in this room ever has to walk the road that the Creane family is walking.<\/p><p>  With the utmost respect to Mr. Jennings, how could he have imagined that putting this out in front of 500,000 people would not add to the distress and trauma of the family at the time?  This is a public service broadcaster - and, as Deputy Maloney said, it is precious to this nation - and Mr. Jennings decided that the trauma and distress of one family would be highlighted with no regard for the trauma and distress of the other family involved in this.  He said he was acutely aware of the sensitivities involved, but insisted on proceeding with the programme that night.  He did not at any stage acknowledge the grief caused by that decision to the Creane family.  He said that he wanted to give the members of the other family the opportunity to tell their story and raise the issues they wished to raise.  He at no stage has actually acknowledged the distressed he has caused and is continuing to cause to the Creane family.<\/p><p>  There is an inquest under way.  Approximately 500,000 people would have watched that programme and the immediate coverage which came on the back of that programme and of the interview done that night focused on one specific aspect of the case, which then became the narrative of the case.  One specific aspect of a very complex case became the accepted public narrative of the case as a direct consequence of the \"Late Late Show\" that night.  One family's story was highlighted.<\/p><p>  I have been struggling to understand the decision of Mr. Jennings and his team to go ahead with that interview when they knew that the mother of a young man who had been murdered was not able to do that.  They forced her into trying to park her grief so as that she could take on RTE.  As well as having to take on this mountain of grief, because of their decision Mrs. Creane also had to deal with RTE.  Yes, the public service broadcaster is precious to this country, but when it tramples over people in the way it has done to Nuala Creane, Jay Creane, Dylan Creane and the memory of Seb Creane, that is when we begin to lose respect for it.<\/p><p>  I want to acknowledge the work of the Chairman in trying to pursue this matter.  We are only able to pursue it because of the work of the independent broadcaster TV3.

A compliment is being paid to RTE in that the service is so important to so many people across the water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014101500036#LL01200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1413372600,"counter":239,"content":"<p>The joint committee went into private session at 12.30 p.m. and adjourned at 12.55 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 22 October 2014.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
