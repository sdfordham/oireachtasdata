In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security. Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. <\/p><p>The implementation of these initiatives will be supported by the Government's commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country.

Ireland's allocation under this mechanism was 272 persons displaced by the Syrian conflict to be resettled in Ireland over a two year period up to mid 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Taking account of the situation in the Middle East, and the plight of the refugees, the T&aacute;naiste announced that Ireland would go further and would accept 520 persons for resettlement over an 18 month period - up to the end of 2016. This was far in excess, almost double the figure proposed by the Commission.  As of today, 486 persons displaced by the Syrian conflict have arrived in Ireland. I have since announced that a further 260 refugees will be taken in by Ireland in 2017 bringing the total number of refugees to 780.  Hence, at least 780 of the 4,000 that Ireland has agreed to accept under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme will come purely from the refugee cohort. The possibility of an additional refugee pledge in 2017 is under active consideration. Other mechanisms to fill the gap are also under review and will be contingent on further developments at EU level. <\/p>  <p>  I also wish to inform the Deputy that the refugee pledges focus on the most vulnerable families and I am satisfied with the progress being made in regard to the refugee resettlement portion of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800068#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sentencing Policy","counter":35,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800068#WRB01700"},{"type":"question","counter":36,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[27377\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800068#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will consider updating and strengthening the sentences that can be imposed on persons convicted of possession of firearms with intent to injure and or kill; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":37,"content":"<p>As previously stated, there are severe penalties in place for firearm offences under the Firearms Acts 1925 to 2009.  A person possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life is liable to a minimum of 10 years imprisonment and up to a maximum of life imprisonment and a fine at the discretion of the Court.  The Court has some discretion in applying these minimum sentences in the case of a first offence, depending on the circumstances concerned, but not in the case of a second or subsequent offence.  This, and other mandatory minimum sentences for firearms offences, were introduced on foot of concerns regarding the impact these type of offences had on society and individual communities.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of the introduction of these penalties in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 much progress has made in tackling gun crime in Ireland.  The number of offences relating to the possession and discharge of a firearm fell by 52% from 745 in 2005 to 356 in 2015; while incidents of assault, burglary, robbery and murder involving a firearm are down 28% from 455 to 329.  Given the severe sentences in place with the potential for a maximum of life imprisonment, I am not sure there is scope for any further strengthening of sentences.  However, I will be more than happy to consider any specific suggestions which the Deputy may have.  <\/p>  <p>  Gun crime is and must be tackled aggressively by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by means of a range of targeted and intelligence based operations, disrupting and preventing incidents before harm is caused, as well as detecting and prosecuting those involved.

These include the recent changes to the Proceeds of Crime Acts, the allocation of an additional &euro;55 million to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na this year, and the establishment of a Special Crime Task Force.

But just as is the case right now, the Irish border will be geographically isolated from the rest of the European Union and in particular it will be outside the Schengen area so the integrity of the border controls of the Schengen area will not be affected in any way by the UK's exit.

Under the programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 migrants into the State by the end of 2017, through a combination of the EU relocation mechanism established in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece (opted into by Ireland voluntarily) and the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focused on resettling refugees from camps in Jordan and Lebanon.  <\/p>  <p>  This is made up of approximately 2,622 persons to be relocated to Ireland from other EU Member States (Italy and Greece) under the two EU relocation decisions and 520 programme refugees which Ireland pledged to resettle under the voluntary EU resettlement programme. Persons admitted here under these programmes will also have an entitlement to family reunification, if they wish to do so, thereby further increasing the numbers accepted by Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Resettlement programme, 520 programme refugees are to resettled in Ireland under the UNHCR-led programme by December 2016.  To date, some 486 refugees have been admitted from Lebanon.  Sufficient candidates were selected during a selection mission to Lebanon earlier this year to fill the rest of the quota of 520 refugees.  These have been security screened and health screened and are scheduled to arrive in groups between now and the end of October.  As we will have fulfilled our commitments under the EU Resettlement programme ahead of target, the Government recently announced that we are extending the resettlement programme to take in a further 260 refugees from Lebanon in 2017. <\/p>  <p>  As regards the EU relocation programme, it is well documented that the pace of arrivals under this programme to date has been slower than expected.  This has been a subject of concern for me.  The Government is wholly committed to ensuring that Ireland meets its obligations under the programme in a timely fashion.  I am pleased to report, therefore, that following a highly productive visit by Irish officials to Greece earlier this year, the frequency and numbers of arrivals has increased and is continuing to improve.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has to date taken in 69 Syrian people, mostly families.  It is estimated that by the end of 2016 Ireland will have accepted over 360 people under relocation.  A further 40 people have been assessed and cleared for arrival and arrangements for their travel to the State are currently being made and IRPP officials interviewed a group of 63 people in Athens who, once cleared for travel, are expected to arrive in October.  The intention thereafter is to sustain the pace and size of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meet its commitments within the timeframes envisaged under the EU Relocation Decisions.     <\/p>  <p>  As regards relocations from Italy, some technical issues have arisen with regard to the programme in Italy.  More recently, I spoke directly with relevant EU Ministerial colleagues, and a Departmental official travelled to Italy in order to address the delays.  Following this work a solution to the technical issues preventing relocations from Italy is in train. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800069#WRC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"UK Referendum on EU Membership","counter":60,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800069#WRC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":61,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[19223\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800069#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the measures British citizens living here will have to take in relation to Irish citizenship given that the British electorate has voted to leave the European Union; if British citizens living here can apply for dual citizenship or a passport; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1342","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":62,"content":"<p>The entitlement to Irish citizenship, as well as the conditions pertaining to a grant of citizenship through naturalisation, are governed by the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.

In addition to this 520, the Government recently announced that it is extending the resettlement programme to take in a further 260 refugees from Lebanon in 2017. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has to date taken in 69 Syrian asylum seekers, mostly families under the relocation programme.  A further 40 Syrian asylum seekers have been assessed and cleared for arrival and arrangements for their travel to the State are currently being made.  IRPP officials interviewed a group of 63 people in Athens who, once cleared for travel, are expected to arrive in October.  It is estimated that by the end of 2016, Ireland will have accepted over 360 people under relocation.<\/p>  <p>  However, as indicated in previous responses to parliamentary questions, the pace of the relocation programme in Ireland and across the European Union had been hampered by significant operational delays and technical issues due to the sheer numbers involved and other logistical difficulties that have arisen at the 'hotspot' locations in Italy and Greece.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the EU relocation mechanism, it is well documented that the pace of arrivals under this programme to date has been slower than expected.  The Government is wholly committed to ensuring that Ireland meets its obligations under the EU Relocation mechanism in a timely fashion.<\/p>  <p>  A team of officials from my Department, including the Director of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, travelled to Greece in June to meet with Irish embassy officials and relevant Greek authorities both to signal Ireland's tangible willingness to assist and to identify ways of addressing the obstacles that have arisen.  The outcome of that visit has been very positive and the Greek authorities have now confirmed that, within the coming months, they will be able to increase significantly the overall numbers available to Ireland.   The frequency and numbers of arrivals have increased and will continue to improve over the coming months. <\/p>  <p>  As regards relocations from Italy, some technical issues have arisen with regard to the programme in Italy.  I recently spoke directly with relevant EU Ministerial colleagues, and a Departmental official travelled to Italy in order to address the delays.  Following this work a solution to the technical issues preventing relocations from Italy is in train.<\/p>  <p>  The intention thereafter is to accelerate the pace and size of intakes throughout 2017 to achieve the levels required to allow Ireland to meet its commitments within the time frames envisaged under the EU Relocation Decisions.<\/p>  <p>  Both the T&aacute;naiste and I continue to work proactively with our colleagues in Europe to ensure that Ireland and the European Union responds comprehensively to all aspects of the ongoing migration and refugee crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800070#WRD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Vetting Applications","counter":85,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800070#WRD00750"},{"type":"question","counter":86,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[27425\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800070#WRD00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the location for processing of Garda vetting applications; the number of persons employed to manage this process; if there is a backlog, and if so, the numbers and reasons for same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":87,"content":"<p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that there is no undue delay or backlog in the Garda employment vetting process.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that at present 80 percent of vetting applications are processed by the Garda Central Vetting Bureau in under five days.  I do not consider that this is an unreasonable timeframe.  This represents a dramatic improvement in turnaround times for the processing of vetting applications in recent years, falling from an average of 14 weeks in mid-2013.<\/p>  <p>  This improvement is the result of an unprecedented investment by the Government and the Garda Authorities in this area of Garda activity, including an increase of over 80 per cent in staffing levels - the number of staff assigned at present stands at 173 - and the roll out earlier this year of the e-Vetting system. The Garda National Vetting Bureau is located in Thurles, Co. Tipperary.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na launched an e-Vetting system in tandem with the commencement by me in April this year of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016.  E-Vetting facilitates the processing of applications in an on-line format and this has significantly streamlined the vetting process and contributed to a sustained reduction in processing times for vetting applications.  I am informed that, currently, 85 per cent of organisations registered for vetting are operating the e-Vetting system and the Garda Authorities are working to encourage all other organisations to do so.  For those vetting applications that continue to be submitted in paper format, the average turnaround time is in the order of four weeks.<\/p>  <p>  One very important feature of the e-Vetting system is that the individual applicant can track the progress of their own vetting application on line and can, therefore, see when their application has been processed and returned to the relevant registered organisation.<\/p>  <p>  In some individual cases processing times for applications can be longer when, for example, additional enquiries may be necessary, which may involve seeking information from abroad, or where errors have been made in the application.  Delays can also occur in other aspects of the application process which are outside of the control of the Garda Authorities, for example, in the submission or return of applications by the registered organisations.<\/p>  <p>  The primary purpose of the Garda employment vetting service is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults.  Accordingly, the vetting process demands rigorous procedures to safeguard its integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of the service.  Any vetting process will take a certain minimum amount of time to complete and, taking into account the importance of protecting children and vulnerable adults while providing an effective and efficient service, the current processing period is not unreasonable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800070#WRD00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Strength","counter":88,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800070#WRD00950"},{"type":"question","counter":89,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[27408\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800070#WRD01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to increase the number of community garda&iacute; in the Wexford Garda division.","asker":"1354","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":90,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including Community Garda&iacute;, among the various Garda Divisions and Districts and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute;  from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. <\/p><p>The implementation of these initiatives will be supported by the Government's commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country.

In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p><p>Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.

Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute;  from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. <\/p><p>The implementation of these initiatives will be supported by the Government's commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country.

I do not consider that this is an unreasonable timeframe.  This represents a dramatic improvement in turnaround times for the processing of vetting applications in recent years, falling from an average of 14 weeks in mid-2013.  This improvement has come about as a result of an unprecedented investment by the Government and the Garda Authorities in this area of Garda activity, including an increase of over 80% in staffing levels and the roll out earlier this year of the e-Vetting system.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na launched an e-Vetting system in tandem with the commencement by me in April this year of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016.  E-Vetting facilitates the processing of applications in an on-line format and this has significantly streamlined the vetting process and contributed to a sustained reduction in processing times for vetting applications.  I am informed that, currently, 85% of organisations registered for vetting are operating the e-Vetting system and the Garda Authorities are working to encourage all other organisations to do so.  For those vetting applications that continue to be submitted in paper format, the average turnaround time is in the order of four weeks.<\/p>  <p>  One very important feature of the e-Vetting system is that the individual applicant can track the progress of their own vetting application on line and can, therefore, see when their application has been processed and returned to the relevant registered organisation.<\/p>  <p>  In some individual cases processing times for applications can be longer when, for example, additional enquiries may be necessary, which may involve seeking information from abroad, or where errors have been made in the application.

Accordingly, the vetting process demands rigorous procedures to safeguard its integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of the service.

Under the programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons overall under the EU Relocation and Resettlement programmes.  This is made up of approximately 2,622 persons to be relocated to Ireland from other EU Member States (Italy and Greece) under the two EU relocation decisions and 520 programme refugees which Ireland pledged to resettle under the voluntary EU resettlement programme.  Persons admitted here under these programmes will also have an entitlement to family reunification, if they wish to do so,  thereby further increasing the numbers accepted by Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Resettlement programme, the 520 programme refugees are to be resettled in Ireland under the UNHCR-led programme by December 2017.  To date, some 486 of these 520 have been admitted from Lebanon.  Sufficient cases  were selected during a selection mission to Lebanon earlier this year to fill the rest of the quota of 520.

As we will have fulfilled our commitments under the EU Resettlement programme ahead of target, the Government and I recently announced that we are extending the resettlement programme to take in a further 260 refugees from Lebanon in 2017.  <\/p>  <p>As regards the EU relocation programme, it is well documented that the pace of arrivals under this programme to date has been slower than expected.  The Government is wholly committed to ensuring that Ireland meets its obligations under the programme in a timely fashion.  I am pleased to report, therefore, that following a highly productive visit by Irish officials to Greece earlier this year, the frequency and numbers of arrivals has increased and is continuing to improve.  Ireland has to date taken in 69 Syrian people, mostly families.  It is estimated that by the end of 2016 Ireland will have accepted up to 360 people under relocation.  The intention thereafter is to sustain the pace and size of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meet its commitments within the timeframes envisaged under the EU Relocation Decisions.  As regards relocations from Italy, some technical issues have arisen with regard to the programme in Italy.  More recently, I spoke directly with relevant EU Ministerial colleagues, and a Departmental official travelled to Italy in order to address the delays.  Following this work a solution to the technical issues preventing relocations from Italy is in train.<\/p>  <p>  In announcing the IRPP, the Government recognised the importance of prioritising family groups and in addressing the position of unaccompanied children.  A significant number of those who have arrived to date are children with one or two parents.  With regard to unaccompanied minors Ireland has formally indicated to Greece its desire to accept unaccompanied minors under the relocation mechanism and we now have a commitment from the Greek authorities that Ireland will be receiving the first group of unaccompanied minors later this year.  Tusla - the Child and Family Agency with responsibility for the care of unaccompanied minors in the State - will travel to Greece to assess the needs of those minors and plan for their care and accommodation upon arrival.  It is not possible at this juncture to determine the overall number of unaccompanied minors that will be accepted during the lifetime of the programme as it will depend on the number of cases referred by Greece and the level of resources that each individual case will require upon arrival.  Ireland will continue to prioritise its commitment to offer protection to this vulnerable group.<\/p>  <p>  As part of our humanitarian response to the crisis you will be aware that our naval vessels have also been performing vital search and rescue missions in the Mediterranean Sea. Irish naval vessels have rescued more than 12,000 people at risk of drowning since the operation commenced in May of last year.<\/p>  <p>Equally important is the support we provide to countries hosting large numbers of refugees and migrants.

Under the Act, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) is now the prescribed body authorised to receive protected disclosures on Garda matters.  <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may communicate their concerns to the Garda Commissioner, as their employer if they so choose, or they may make a disclosure directly to GSOC.  Where a protected disclosure is made to GSOC the Act provides that GSOC may, if it appears to it desirable in the public interest to do so, investigate the disclosure. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise the very significant fact that a member of the Garda&iacute; who makes a disclosure in accordance with the Act is entitled to all the protections provided for whistleblowers in the Act.  These protections include protection from having their identity revealed, protection from dismissal and protection from being penalised in their employment as a result of having made a protected disclosure.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the public interest in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na having robust policies and procedures in place to support and protect whistleblowers and to ensure that their complaints\/allegations are fully investigated, I signalled during the D&aacute;il debate on the O'Higgins Report that I would refer certain matters to the independent Policing Authority. To that end, I wrote to the Authority on 2 June 2016 requesting that in accordance with section 62O(6) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended) they submit a report on the policies and procedures in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with whistleblowers\/whistleblowing.

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have published their Protected Disclosures Policy and all Garda Members and civilians have been informed of this policy. In addition the Garda Commissioner has appointed a Protected Disclosures Manager who will be supported with a dedicated and properly trained team. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been working with Transparency International Ireland and other external providers to create an environment to ensure that whistleblowers are protected and supported.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner is committed to providing a positive and supportive working environment for all Garda personnel.  An  Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Dignity at Work Policy, entitled &ldquo;Working Together to Create a Positive Working Environment, outlines the policy and procedures for dealing with Harassment, Sexual Harassment and Bullying in the Workplace.  The main objective of the policy is to achieve a safe and harmonious working environment that encourages and supports the right to dignity at work.  I am informed that the Commissioner has established  an internal Garda Working Group to review the current practice and policies in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  and this work is currently ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  While all of this points to significant changes in the regime for making protected disclosures by members of the Garda&iacute; and the significant protections afforded to those who make protected disclosures, the House will appreciate that I will consider very carefully the report from the Policing Authority when it is available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800074#WRH01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Station Opening Hours","counter":197,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800074#WRH01100"},{"type":"question","counter":198,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[27383\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800074#WRH01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to review Garda stations in the DMR Northern, specifically in regard to the reopening of Rush Garda station; the hours at which Garda stations in the area are open to the public; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

With the implementation of this strategy I am glad  to say that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has made huge progress, leading to a reduction of one third in burglaries nationwide following the launch of Operation Thor last year. The figures for the first three months of the year show a decrease for burglary offences in Meath. In fact, in the first three months of 2016 there were 40% less burglaries than in the first three months of 2015.<\/p><p>Operation Thor has involved concentrated Garda activity with more than 30,000 crime prevention patrols and in the order of 38,500 targeted checkpoints nationwide. There have also been in the region of 2,500 arrests and 2,900 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences. Further resources have also been put in place to support Garda operations in 2016, including provision for ongoing implementation of Operation Thor.  An additional &euro;50 million is to be provided, doubling the overtime available for intensive and targeted policing and crime prevention activities.  So there will be no let-up on the pressure which the Gardai are bringing to bear on the organised gangs engaged in burglary in all areas of the country.  <\/p><p>I have also made it a particular priority to strengthen our legislative provisions through the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b><\/b>2015 which is targeted at repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary.

Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute;  from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. <\/p><p>The implementation of these initiatives will be supported by the Government's commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country. This will be achieved though continuing the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000, as well as doubling the Garda Reserve and increasing the number of civilian staff so as to free-up Garda&iacute; for front-line policing. Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 members will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. So far 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide. Community policing, and all other Garda activities, will undoubtedly benefit from these resources now coming on stream. <\/p><p>In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment I was very pleased to announce the commencement of a new recruitment campaign on 8 September.  The campaign is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner. Applications must be made through www.publicjobs.ie.The existing recruitment campaign (launched last November) is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year. It is expected that successful candidates from the new campaign will enter the Garda College from mid-2017.<\/p><p>The Government is also committed to prioritising community crime prevention schemes. My announcement last week at the National Ploughing Championships of a doubling of the funding for the Community Alert Programme to &euro;350,000 which will go directly to local groups is a tangible expression of this commitment to supporting a partnership approach to crime prevention between local communities and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800074#WRH02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Traffic Offences","counter":216,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800075#WRJ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":217,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[27221\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800075#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the current status of section 22 of the Road Traffic Act 2002 regarding the offence of not producing a driving licence in court and the wording of summonses to inform persons of this offence; if she has rectified this; if she can provide a timeframe for the matter to be resolved given her response dated 29 August 2016 stating that matters require clarification; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":218,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, a number of arrangements are in place in relation to the production of driver licences in Court.

In addition, from an Exchequer perspective, putting in place an unlimited refund scheme would be a risk due to\u00a0an unpredictable\u00a0levels of refund claims and the limited fiscal space available. Introducing a VAT refund scheme for charities would also most likely lead to similar claims from other VAT exempt\u00a0organisations, most notably sporting organisations.<\/p><p>However, the Programme for Partnership Government recognises the difficulties faced by community groups and charities in relation to VAT rates on certain products and commits to raising the issue at EU level. The European Commission's Action Plan on VAT was adopted on 7<sup>th<\/sup>April 2016 and contains a proposal to look at VAT rate policy across the EU in 2017. The Action Plan's proposal on rates will provide an opportunity to discuss VAT rates\u00a0and may offer Member States more flexibility in the future in determining VAT rates applicable to goods and services.\u00a0However, the Deputy will be aware that any proposed changes to the current EU VAT Directive would require unanimous agreement from all Member States.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800078#WRM01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Portfolio","counter":315,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800078#WRM01150"},{"type":"question","counter":316,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[27663\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800078#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding the sale of the NAMA loans associated with the Whitfield Clinic in Waterford; the originating financial institutions associated with the Whitfield Clinic loans; the original financial institutions book value of the loans associated with the Whitfield Clinic; the NAMA sale valuation achieved for the loans associated with the Whitfield Clinic; the completion date of NAMA&rsquo;s sale of the loans associated with the Whitfield Clinic; the name and beneficial owner of the successful purchaser of the NAMA loans associated with the Whitfield Clinic; details of other bids from interested parties to NAMA associated with NAMA&rsquo;s sale of the loan&rsquo;s associated the Whitfield Clinic in Waterford and their respective valuations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"1346","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":320,"content":"<p>Where a couple is cohabiting, rather than married or in a civil partnership, each partner is treated for the purposes of income tax as a separate and unconnected individual. Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law.<\/p>  <p>  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980). This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.<\/p>  <p>  From a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners. Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status. It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting. It would also be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  There would also be legal issues with regard to 'connected persons'. To counter tax avoidance, 'connected persons' are frequently defined throughout the various Tax Acts. The definitions extend to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners. This would be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition. There may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits. However, their legal status has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them.<\/p>  <p>  The treatment of cohabiting couples for the purposes of social welfare is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Mr. Leo Varadkar TD. However, it is also based on the principle that married couples should not be treated less favourably than cohabiting couples. This was given a constitutional underpinning following the Supreme Court decision in Hyland v Minister for Social Welfare (1989) which ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800078#WRM01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Budget Contribution","counter":321,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800078#WRM01550"},{"type":"question","counter":322,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[27730\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800078#WRM01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 225 of 19 July 2016, if there has been any change in the method of calculating Ireland's contribution to the EU budget; if there has been any change to his estimate in that reply of the impact the CSO revision of the National Income and Expenditure Accounts for 2015 will have on Ireland's EU budget contribution for 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This improvement of 0.3 in PTR allocation is a restoration of 50% of the teaching resources that were removed when the allocation of guidance posts was brought within quota. <\/p>  <p>  The delivery of the 50% restoration through a change in the staffing schedule allows each school to determine how best to allocate the additional resources to meet the guidance needs of the school.

These fora allow for open and frank discussions on human rights and related citizen security issues in Mexico and the EU. <\/p>  <p>  The sixth session of the High-Level Dialogue on Human Rights between the EU and Mexico was held in June 2016 in Brussels.  Both sides agreed on the importance of continued cooperation to effectively address challenges in the area of human rights, particularly on issues such as the rule of law and the fight against impunity, missing and disappeared persons, torture, discrimination, migration, and the protection of vulnerable groups, human rights defenders and journalists. <\/p>  <p>  EU member states are to the fore in funding projects led by national and international NGOs aimed at tackling impunity and improving the protection of human rights in Mexico.

A revised Code of Practice on Alcohol Marketing, Communications and Sponsorship has been in place since July 2008.  Following a Departmental review of the Codes in 2010 it was agreed that the existing Codes would remain while the Department examined the possibility of the providing a legislative basis for the Codes.  The Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy, 2012 recommended the development of a statutory framework with respect to the volume, content, and placement of all alcohol advertising in all media in Ireland.  Regulation of the advertising of alcohol products and sponsorship by alcohol companies is provided for in the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill remains a priority for this Government.  The Bill has been restored to the Seanad Order Paper and I expect that it will commence Committee Stage in October.<\/p>  <p>  The AMCMB is comprised of representatives my Department and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, the advertising industry, and the drinks industry.  The current members are: Mr Peter Cassells (Chair), Ms Alessandra Fantini, Dr Sean Denyer, Mr Michael O'Keeffe, Mr Ciaran Cunningham and Mr Ross McMathuna.  The group meets on a quarterly basis and the last meeting was held on 23 August 2016.  The AMCMB has submitted nine annual reports to the Minister for Health.  The 7th Annual Report was the last annual report to be published on the Department of Health website.<\/p>  <p>  The AMCMB monitors compliance with the Codes through a review of quarterly reports submitted by the advertising industry, review of complaints received examined by the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland and commissioned research.  A number of companies have been commissioned by AMCMB to assess adherence to the Codes including Havas Media, BBN and Poster Audit Bureau.  Companies have been commissioned to produce reports to allow the AMCMB to, inter alia,  check compliance with the Code by televisions broadcasters, to survey sample films to assess compliance with the Code's provisions and to check compliance with outdoor media advertisers.

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis.  Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded.<\/p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying  for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to an emergency situation for persons with a serious medical condition in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and persons in palliative care, who are terminally ill.

In line with EU State Aid rules, the process must be &quot;technology neutral&quot; and it is not therefore possible to specify what technology should be used to build the network.  As part of the procurement process bidders will be asked to propose solutions which meet the NBP service requirements.  It is recognised however, that a significant fibre build will be required, regardless of what technology is used to provide services to individual premises.  Once the successful bidder or bidders is chosen the technology(ies) to be deployed will become clear.<\/p><p>As part of the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country.<\/p><p>In line with commitments in the Programme for Government I\u00a0established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague\u00a0Minister Humphreys in July 2016.  The Taskforce\u00a0will recommend practical actions that can be taken in the short-term to improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland, working with Government Departments, Local Authorities, ComReg, State Agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The work of the taskforce will also assist Local Authorities in preparing for the rollout of the new NBP network once contract(s) are in place.

The two schemes will not be mutually exclusive, in that it will be possible for a child to be simultaneously supported via the ECCE programme and the proposed Single Affordable Scheme, once they meet the qualifying criteria for each.<\/p>  <p>  Government will shortly consider when it may be possible to introduce the new scheme. Introduction in September 2017 is the current objective of the DCYA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800095#WRDD00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Childcare Subvention Programme ","counter":718,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800095#WRDD00950"},{"type":"question","counter":719,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[27603\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800095#WRDD01000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of parents in each individual band, that is A, AJ, B, availing of the community childcare subvention programme reduced weekly fees for child care; and the number of parents receiving rates for full-time services, a part-time service, sessional service or a shorter hours service in each band.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":720,"content":"<p>The detailed information sought by the Deputy is not currently available in my Department in the format requested.

Similar to many other voluntary organisations, members of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve undertake unpaid activities on a voluntary basis and are to be commended for their commitment. While members of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve are also afforded the opportunity to avail of paid training, there are no plans to restore gratuity payments to members of the Reserve Defence Force.<\/p>  <p>  The Steering Committee which undertook the Value For Money (VFM) Review of the Reserve Defence Force recognised the importance of retaining an effective Reserve capacity that can augment the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) in times of need. In order to ensure appropriate training within the existing resource envelope, the VFM Review recommended the withdrawal of gratuities from members of the Reserve and the reallocation of this money to paid training. This recommendation was accepted and implemented.  In the intervening years since publication of the VFM Review in 2012, the reallocation of funding to paid training has ensured that all members of the Reserve have been afforded the opportunity to participate in annual collective training and other specialised training and are financially supported whilst doing so.   <\/p>  <p>  The overall budget available in Subhead A5 in 2016 is set at &euro;2.150 million, of which &euro;2.068 million is allocated to paid training of Reserve members. This budget provides for 30,000 training man days. This allocation provides a minimum of 7 days annual paid training for all effective members of the Reserve. It also provides for 14 days paid training for all additional personnel recruited to the Reserve Defence Force in 2016 and for career and specialist courses for selected members of the Reserve. The allocation also includes provision for RDF participation in 2016 commemoration ceremonial parades and events. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied with the current financial provision for the Reserve in terms of man days allowance. This allowance ensures that there are sufficient paid training opportunities available to members of the Reserve. These training opportunities, in turn, allows Reserve personnel to fulfil the roles allocated to them, which remain as set out in the 2015 White Paper on Defence, to augment the PDF in times of crisis and to participate in ceremonial events.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016092800095#WRDD01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"}]
