People whom I know and others who are involved in the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland have advised me that the drug has a positive effect on a significant number of people with multiple sclerosis because it allows them to remain independent and to continue working.<\/p> <p>I know that the Leader has already raised this matter with the Minister for Health, as Senator Michael D'Arcy and I have also.  This drug costs a mere &euro;270 per month but from July it will be gone from the GMS scheme.  A number of people will not be able to afford it so they will end up in hospital and unable to work, at a further cost to the State.  This should not be about cost, however.  <\/p><p>Since my dealings with a number of people on Fampyra, I have learned that there is another MS drug called Lemtrada.  A number of people have reacted very well to the latter drug which has assisted many people in continuing and improving their quality of life.  I have also learned that within the next three weeks Lemtrada will not be funded by the HSE.  <\/p><p>I have written to the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and the HSE on numerous occasions but I have received only a bog-standard response.  Within three weeks, many of these people will not be able to access these life-changing drugs.  This is something that should concern all Members of this House.<\/p><p>Multiple Sclerosis Ireland has a specific concern about these two drugs that relates to its own members.  Does the HSE and the Department of Health have a specific view on multiple sclerosis?  I would have thought that such medical advances, including the provision of these drugs, would be crucially important.  I thought the Minister would get personally involved in the matter, but he has not done so up to now.  <\/p><p>I know that, like myself, the Minister for Health will attend the House later for the debate on the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2014.  However, it is not necessarily appropriate for me to ask him about these drugs, nor does he have to answer such questions, when he attends this House to deal with a specific Bill.  <\/p><p>We should have a debate not just on MS treatment but other drugs, as well as the process of how a drug gets into the GMS and the drugs payment scheme.  We should also debate the impact of withdrawing drugs from those schemes.  I appreciate the Leader's assistance on this issue up to now.  I ask him again, however, in the strongest possible terms, to request the Minister to intervene with the HSE on this matter.<\/p><p>I will move a motion in the House next week seeking cross-party support from the Seanad on this point.  It will be a non-political motion requesting that both the aforementioned drugs should remain in the drugs payment scheme.  The Seanad should stand up for people who need our help but who cannot obtain answers from the Department of Health or the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014062400003#B00400","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403620500,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I am sure that others will wish to join with me in paying tribute to Gerry Conlon whose death occurred last Saturday, 21 June.  He was one of the Guildford Four, released from imprisonment in Britain in 1989, and spent the rest of his life campaigning for other victims of miscarriages of justice.  Many of us were impressed by his work over the years.  I wish to express my sympathy to his family on his untimely death at the age of 60.<\/p><p>I ask the Leader for a debate on yesterday's report by the Inspectorate of Mental Health Services.  Such a debate could examine the numbers of people in some form of institutional care under the auspices of the mental health services.  The report describes those services as a series of mini hostels around the State.  The report also expresses concern about standards in some of the hostels, including an inconsistency of standards and a lack of available data.  An estimated 1,500 people are in this sort of care following the closure of larger psychiatric units.  There are still concerns about standards in some of the smaller units. <\/p><p>It would be worth having a debate here on detention in psychiatric institutions generally.  The spotlight on the mother and baby homes in Tuam and elsewhere has told us a lot about detention and confinement, but there remains a great deal to be said about psychiatric institutions.  <\/p><p>My colleague, Dr. Damien Brennan of the School of Nursing and Midwifery in Trinity College, has done a ground-breaking study on the numbers of people incarcerated in psychiatric institutions in Ireland throughout most of the 20th century.  These were all State-run institutions.  This does not raise the same issues in terms of religious orders, but we should certainly examine the matter in this House.  Therefore, I would like to have a debate on that at some point.<\/p> <p>I very much welcome the announcement of the release of Meriam Ibrahim, the Christian woman sentenced to death for apostasy in Sudan.  I am delighted she is being released.  There was an international campaign for her release but I am very saddened to see that prison sentences have been pronounced on ten al-Jazeera journalists in Egypt.  We, in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, have been asked by the National Union of Journalists in Ireland to raise the issue of these arrests and sentences in the House today.  I would like to join with the NUJ in urging the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to condemn the abuse of human rights in Egypt and to work with governments in the EU to oppose the criminalisation and imprisonment of journalists.  These al-Jazeera journalists were doing their job but some really long prison sentences have been handed down, some of them <i>in absentia<\/i>.  However, immediate custodial sentences have been handed down to at least two journalists in Egypt and we should all condemn that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014062400004#C00200","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403620800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The Central Statistics Office will issue the national accounts for the first quarter of 2014 in the coming weeks and we hope and expect to see a rise in the estimated GDP levels.  This will be very positive news for the Government but I hope also for the thousands of Irish families who have been struggling to make ends meet and who face daily hardship, poverty and even homelessness due to successive austerity budgets which have hit the poorest hardest.  As the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, said last Friday in his response to Thomas Piketty's key note address at the Tasc conference, those at the bottom have been pushed into very negative positions.<\/p><p>However, what I want to do today is to alert this House to the fact that some of the expected increase in GDP will be due to changes in the rules in how GDP is measured.  The guesstimates reported by the media put this increase at more than 1%.  The new rules set out by ESA 2010 aim to unify the procedures of calculating GDP in different EU member states as this is used in the calculation of members states' contribution to the EU budget.  The major difference to the previous regulations used include recognition of research and development and illegal activities, such as prostitution, in the measurement of GDP.  <\/p><p>I understand we need to measure the economy as accurately as possible but when we are calculating a measurement which will have a profound impact on budgetary matters and policy decisions, my concern is that including activities which we may wish to remove from our economy - it was one of the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality approximately a year ago - into a measurement of economic output is counterproductive.  By including underground industries, such as the illegal drug trade and prostitution, are we in any way condoning or even normalising these sectors of our society?  <\/p><p>How will prostitution earnings or productivity be measured?  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality produced a report  reviewing legislation on prostitution and we noted that research evidence estimates the indoor prostitution industry to be worth at least &euro;180 million.  How will the CSO measure it?  The report also found that, on average, 1,000 people are offered for sex daily in Ireland, some 97% of them are migrant women and some are children, and between 2009 and 2011 up to 34 minors were trafficked into the State for sexual exploitation.  <\/p><p>Will the Leader contact the Minister for Finance to request he investigate the issues I have raised and to come back to the House to present how the prostitution industry will be measured for GDP in Ireland and state whether he thinks this is acceptable?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014062400005#D00200","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speech","time":1403620800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, was in Leitrim on Friday.

This news comes shortly after the House, including the Leader, expressed concern about the slow rate of turnover in tenancies in local authority housing.

Lord Denning could not even contemplate the possibility that the Guildford Four case was a miscarriage of justice, stating that if such were the case, it would represent \"an appalling vista\".

Following the multiplicity of reports and findings on this issue, one might have assumed we were beyond being shocked by new findings.  However, the numbers in this report are astounding.  It shows, for example, that 75% of all alcohol consumption occurs in the context of binge drinking sessions, with one fifth of us engaging in binge drinking at least once a week.  I have no doubt that many people would not consider three drinks to be a binge drinking session, but that threshold has been scientifically proven by the European Commission.  Whether we like it or not, as a general populace we have a particular mindset in regard to alcohol consumption and it is a problem that needs to be addressed.  A figure that is perhaps under-reported in regard to alcohol consumption is the number of people who regularly drink at home as opposed to in pubs.  It is a case of out of sight, out of mind.  We spend in excess of &euro;50 million per week on alcohol and more than 175,000 people are dependent drinkers.<\/p><p>Some of us were fortunate last week to attend a presentation on alcohol abuse by, among others, the former Leinster and Ireland rugby winger, Denis Hickie, who gave a very strong speech on the link between sport and alcohol, with particular reference to drinks industry sponsorship.

This was a cry for help from nine doctors who have written to the HSE management and raised it directly with the Minister of State, and obviously their concerns have not been addressed.  It is a very serious issue.  We have debated the issue of suicide with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, several times in this House.<\/p> <p>Given the seriousness of this situation, I ask the Leader to arrange a further debate so that we can discuss with her the concerns of not just the psychiatrists in the Carlow-Kilkenny-south Tipperary area, but the many psychiatrists across the State who are very concerned about mental health services in the State.

The Points for Life initiative, which has been piloted in a number of schools, is about improving physical literacy.  This is defined as the foundation of characteristics, attributes, behaviour, skills, awareness and knowledge and understanding related to healthy active living and the promotion of physical recreation opportunities and positive healthy choices.  The project, which has been managed by the professional development services for teachers, seeks to increase the frequency of opportunities for children to engage in physical activity and by targeting this critical stage of childhood development, where the seeds of life long practice are laid, the goal is to promote physical fitness, good health and healthy lifestyle practices across the lifespan.  The mid-term report which was produced by PEPAYS, the Physical Education Physical Activity and Youth Sports, team headed up by Dr. Ann McPhail from the University of Limerick was quite alarming.

It was recently revealed at the Joint Committee on Health and Children that there are 253 vacant consultant posts.  In one of the medical newspapers this weekend it was suggested that as many as 20% of all consultant posts might be vacant.  That is a serious issue because we are losing senior medical personnel.  I signalled three years ago that the problem would arise and it is time we started to deal with the issue.  The MacCraith report and another report have already been produced.  I read in a report over the weekend that certain targets had been set for each of the four quarters of 2014.  I am not convinced any of the targets have been reached.  If that is the case then questions must be asked because we are now facing into a changeover of junior doctors on 7 July and many of the posts will remain vacant.<\/p><p>Another issue that must be highlighted and on which there is a need for a debate is the cost of professional indemnity insurance for doctors and in particular those in the private health care sector, which is increasing by more than 100%.  For instance, an orthopaedic consultant will now pay approximately &euro;97,000 per annum for professional indemnity insurance.  People might not be concerned because it is the private sector but 41% of all elective surgery is currently carried out in the private sector.  If some of the private facilities close then the public sector will not be able to absorb it.  Very good offers are being made to people who have experience from New Zealand, Australia and Canada and they are accepting them.  The matter requires to be dealt with urgently.

I utterly accept what is being attempted here.  While one cannot make the product safer, one can certainly provide more advice concerning its use.  Any doctor prescribing, and any patient using, medication will be well used to the fact that there is an insert with the tablets that they can read.  However, I would like to point out a few things about this matter.  Each pack will have a general warning which will state either \"Smoking kills.  Quit now\" or, simply, \"Smoking kills\".  In addition, each pack should carry an information message stating \"Tobacco smoke contains over 70 substances known to cause cancer\".<\/p><p>As Senators are aware, a pictorial or combined warning will also cover 65% of the front and back of cigarette packets.  These are simple but effective methods of visibly getting the message across to smokers and non-smokers alike.  The inclusion of additional information on a sheet may not, in my view, be as effective in achieving the same.  Indeed, it is likely that the consumer may open the pack - let us call a spade a spade - and discard the sheet immediately on the side of the street.  This would add to the litter caused by cigarette packs, which astonishingly enough represents 53% of all litter.  Furthermore, the smoker would quickly become desensitised or immune to a long list of ingredients and additives.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that in drafting these amendments, the Senator's aim is to make information about the toxic ingredients contained in cigarettes and other tobacco products available to the public.  The tobacco products directive will make it mandatory for manufacturers of tobacco products to submit a list of ingredients contained in their products.  This list, and details of the remission levels, are to be submitted to a State authority.  The list is to be accompanied with information as to why these ingredients were included.  Toxicological data regarding the ingredients are also to be submitted, referring in particular to their effects on the health of consumers.  Member states are then obliged to make this information available to the public on a website.  <\/p><p>The new proposed warnings and the mandatory obligations regarding reporting ingredients, are important initiatives in educating the public about tobacco.

I have no problem with additional information being there because as I told the Senator before, as a practising GP, I used to insist that those with diabetes put a little cardboard note I had printed in their cigarette packs.  It had a simple message on it that smoking plus diabetes equals amputation just to remind them every time they took out fag, they were imperilling their foot.  Some people might read the long list the Senator has suggested once but thereafter, I do not think it would have any net effect.<br \/>However, if there is no problem from a legal point of view or if there is no imperilling of our situation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the inevitable challenge to our standardised packaging, I would not necessarily have a problem with it at all but I need further time to investigate it.  I am not in a position to give the Senator an undertaking to do it now.  Like the last point, if I have not fully investigated it, I have to go back, otherwise I will have committed myself legally to something which will be problematic from a legal point of view.  I am trying to make myself clear and I hope I am getting the message across.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014062400020#T00200","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1403626800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Please forgive my relative unfamiliarity with some of the more arcane aspects of parliamentary procedure but is there a mechanism where we can delay the vote on this for a few minutes while I take some advice on it?

I do not doubt the Minister is approaching this matter in the interests of consumers.  I hope this measure will deter people from smoking and encourage them to quit.  As I said on Second Stage, this evil industry will do its damnedest to encourage future Ministers to make changes.  It will look for any possible amelioration in the position, from their perspective, that will benefit it in the sale of cigarettes.  I am worried that future Ministers might not have the same degree of commitment to the thrust of what the Minister, Deputy Reilly, is doing.  My colleague said this could lead to challenges but my concern - leaving that aside - is that by leaving this open to ministerial discretion and thereby giving options to future Ministers, the cigarette companies might be encouraged to influence future office holders to make changes.  As I understand it, a change to the statutory instrument will be all that will be required.  The Minister might correct me in that regard.  In that context, it worries me that these Houses have no proper record of diligence in debating or monitoring statutory instruments.  I would be far happier to see the Oireachtas determining exactly what should be prescribed in legislation.  I suggest that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, is the best person to do that in light of his commitment to this issue.

My concern is that things happen under the radar and if someone does not share the Minister's disposition on the issue, I would be concerned that regulations could be made under the legislation which might not be conducive to the objective of the Bill.<\/p><p>I wish to raise one other matter in that regard.<\/p> <p>I received, as I am sure did the other Members present, representations from the tobacco industry.  I had not received them when I raised the issue of trying to counterfeit-proof the packages on the last day we discussed the Bill.  They expressed concern and referred to what has happened in Australia and the number engaged in such activity increasing.  My only concern, which is probably shared by everybody who has spoken here, is that we reduce the number of people who smoke.  That must be the objective and target.  Obviously, part of that is to try to kill off the illicit trade, which operates through the sale of cheaper packages of cigarettes and, as a consequence, people buy them and the younger age group in particular are more inclined to get in on the habit.  On the last day we debated the Bill, I thought the Minister was a bit dismissive of this suggestion or at least he said that the packages, as they will be done now, were sufficient and could not be counterfeited.  The industry claims there was a 20% increase in such activity in Australia.  I do not know if that is the case but I am sure the Department officials, and probably the Minister, will know exactly if there was any increase whatsoever.  Even if there was not, it behoves us to ensure that the packaging is as counterfeit-proof as we can possibly achieve.  What specific measures are being included in the legislation to ensure that happens?  It is a problem.  <\/p><p>We met people from the retail oil industry in Belfast only last week who spoke about what goes on in the Border area and peripheral to that is cigarette smuggling.  There were other issues also.  We should be conscious of that issue, which also feeds in to the wealth generation of the criminal breed and we can all see the consequences of that.  There are good reasons for doing this, but I do not have any gems of wisdom as to how it might be done.  I believe it should be done and the Minister will probably have good ideas and experts to guide him as to what can done in that regard, but it is important that we make it more difficult for people to counterfeit the packages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014062400027#BB00400","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403629500,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising that issue because it gives me an opportunity to debunk a myth that is put out by the tobacco industry that there has been an increase in smuggling and illicit sales in Australia.  There is no evidence to support that.  There are studies, which the Senator's colleague, Senator van Turnhout, pointed out on the last day,  sponsored by the tobacco industry purporting that this is the case based on four other studies which were sponsored by the tobacco industry to support its case.  The reality is that 13% of cigarettes are thought to be illegal in this country.  Only 1% of that 13% is counterfeit, the rest is contraband, bought legally in other countries, produced by the said same tobacco companies with profit and then brought in here to be sold cheaper by people who are engaged in illicit activity.  That is an enforcement issue.<\/p><p>I wish I had brought the packs with me again today to demonstrate the huge difference between the plain, standardised packaging that we are talking about with the graphic illustration of what cigarettes do to one versus what is on the market today, and the Members would see that with us being the first country in Europe to do this, smuggling would be extremely difficult because they are different from everything else that is available in Europe.  That is the first point.<\/p><p>The second point, and it is a really important one that we all need to remind ourselves of continually, is that this is about a product that kills 5,200 people in this country every single year and 700,000 people across Europe.  That is the core argument here.  Those in the tobacco industry are past masters at pivoting away from the real issue, which is the death and destruction, consequent to their product, of families and lives, to talk about smuggling, counterfeit, contraband, retailers or anything else except the issue, which is allowing them advertise a product in a way that is particularly targeted at children - survey after survey shows that 78% of smokers start smoking under the age of 18 - to replace the smokers their product has killed or others who had the good fortune to be able to give it up.  It is a highly addictive habit and very difficult for people to quit, even to the point that, as I have said previously, my own brother a doctor, an epidemiologist, could not quit them even though they were killing him.<\/p> <p>We must never forget that this is about protecting our children above all else, because we have a duty of care to them.  We can talk about all those other issues but we must never forget the core one, which the tobacco companies would dearly love us to forget about and take us up culs-de-sac elsewhere.  That has been their <i>modus operandi<\/i>for decades and will continue to be.  Any Member who had the opportunity to watch Peter Taylor&rsquo;s recent programme on BBC, &ldquo;Burning Desire: The Seduction of Smoking&rdquo;, would have seen what the tobacco industry did in the West over the past 30 years, it is now doing in developing countries, namely, making children addicted to cigarettes.<br \/>The Revenue Commissioners will now have a highly sophisticated stamp on packets, which will be extraordinarily difficult to tamper with and which will help distinguish between legal and illegal products.  It is quite happy this measure will not lead to any increase in the illicit cigarette trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014062400028#CC00200","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403630100,"counter":203,"content":"<p>The Minister&rsquo;s central point is about the number of deaths caused by tobacco.

While the Minister&rsquo;s efforts are an excellent step in the right direction, we need to bolster it.

It is often alleged that it is far less harmful to health than smoking cigarettes.  Former cigarette smokers, when they smoke cigars, tend to inhale them which makes a cigar a particularly large, dangerous and poisonous cigarette.<\/p> <p>Even in people who have never smoked cigarettes and who smoked cigars in the more traditional non-inhalational way, there is exactly zero doubt that it increases the risk of several cancers and there is still a systemic absorption of the cancer causing toxins.  Therefore, it is not just a question of inhaling them into one's lungs.<br \/>I believe the industry, over the years, has indulged in a number of subtle attempts to market cigars as somehow tobacco light, as something which is less harmful, and as a vice which, perhaps, not only is less harmful but has a certain social cache.  There are whole magazines in parts of the world, cigar bars and also a magazine called <i>Cigar Aficionado<\/i>.  We also have people who would never ever let themselves be seen as supportive of cigarette smoking allowing their good name and celebrity brand to be associated with the smoking of cigars.  For this reason, in addition to the general description of other tobacco products that the Minister put in the Bill, this would be an excellent opportunity to hammer home the message about cigars by making a simple amendment which basically and explicitly extends what the Minister has said about manufactured cigarettes, and the products used for roll-your-own tobacco, to cigars as well.  It is for that reason that I ask him to consider this amendment carefully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014062400029#DD00700","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403630700,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator again for his concern and the amendment which aims to include specific provisions in the Bill for the packaging of cigars.

I have given the question of electronic cigarettes a lot of discussion and thought over the past year.  I wish to state a couple of facts.<br \/>There is no doubt that electronic cigarettes are less harmful.  They do not give a person a great big high intensity or concentration belt of the same cancer causing products that one sees in inhalational tobacco.  However, there is no doubt that they are not harmless.  Nicotine, itself, we know to be a harmful drug, in addition to the fact that it is addictive, even if it only acts as a gateway to other more harmful ways of accessing tobacco, of accessing nicotine, which is of itself a neuro toxin and a cardiovascular toxin.  It can cause peripheral vascular disease, abnormalities of the heart rate, including sudden cardiac death, alterations in seizure threshold and other physiological disturbances so it is dangerous.  I believe the only reason it looks somewhat attractive in any sense is that it appears to be, possibly, less dangerous than inhaled smoke-derived nicotine.<br \/>We also do not know what the long-term effects of electronic cigarettes are.  I have patients, colleagues, friends who have asked me whether it is better for them to give up smoking and use electronic cigarettes.  To which I say, &quot;Yes, if the alternative is smoking or using electronic cigarettes it is probably safer to use electronic cigarettes.  However, you are far better giving them up altogether&quot;.  <br \/>My great fear is that somehow some kind of a mixed message will go out that electronic cigarettes are something which current non-smokers, or children who are considering the alleged cosmetic effects of the coolness of smoking, may decide this is a way of smoking without incurring the health risks.  Of course, as we know, there may be health risks from the use of these products but there is a colossal risk of becoming a tobacco addict and nicotine addict in circumstances where one may find that there are other ways of accessing it.  I believe that we should explicitly make the provisions of this Bill apply to all of these inhalational nicotine products.  Go raibh maith agat, a Aire.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014062400030#EE00500","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1403630700,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I share the Senator's concerns.  There are great concerns around this matter, particularly the idea that they would be marketed as a lifestyle choice and act as a gateway to smoking.  If one asked most smokers why they started smoking one will find it was because they thought it looked cool and were intrigued by the imagery of it all.<\/p> <p>In most cases, the first cigarette a person smokes will make him or her ill.  What is being argued is that electronic cigarettes are somehow harmless products, which is not the case.  As Senator Crown noted, they have a wide range of effects and while they are certainly less harmful than tobacco, why should we replace one harm with another?  If they were an aid for people to stop smoking, that would be welcome.  However, the jury is out on that issue also as they are not any more effective than nicotine patches.  Notwithstanding this, it has not been our intention to include electronic cigarettes in this legislation.  The Department is preparing another Bill on electronic cigarettes and the exigencies that will apply to them.<\/p><p>The reason I will not accept the amendment is not that I do not share the Senator's concerns but because I have a separate Bill being prepared on the issue that will go before Cabinet shortly.  Some of its provisions have already been seen by the Cabinet.  With respect, therefore, I will not accept the amendment, although I assure the Senator that I share his concerns, particularly on the practice of smoking electronic cigarettes in any environment, whether a restaurant, bar or other area.  A couple of years ago, one of our major airlines promoted the sale of these products during flights.  <\/p><p>The Senator's views will help us in respect of the Bill we are preparing on electronic cigarettes.

Unfortunately, I am precluded from providing financial incentives in legislation to encourage ethical shops, retailers and hoteliers to cease selling tobacco products on their premises in return for being offered a preferential VAT rate on all other products they sell on their premises.

I am particularly pleased there were no dissenting voices regarding the Bill.  This demonstrates in practice what has been concluded in an EU study, that is, the Irish public have a strong willingness to adopt public health measures which will reduce the numbers of people who smoke in this country.<br \/>There is a wealth of evidence indicating that standardised packaging will have a positive impact.  However, no matter what evidence we produce, the tobacco industry will produce evidence to contradict this.  A recent article in <i>The Lancet<\/i>re-iterated this when it stated the following: &quot;Tobacco industry misrepresentation of the evidence in order to try to block public health interventions by manipulating policy making and public opinion is well documented.&quot;<i><\/i>The article went on to say that &quot;it is essential to guard against continued misrepresentation of the evidence&quot;<i>.  <\/i>One only has to look at the programme I alluded to, &quot;Burning Desire: The Seduction of Smoking&quot;, in which they show a Senate hearing where one representative after another across a straight line of gentlemen got up to say that they did not believe tobacco was addictive.  I am confident that the Irish public, including our Deputies and Senators, have not and will not allow themselves to be manipulated.  Arguments put out there by the tobacco industry regarding increased illicit trade and supposed job losses from the retail sector do not deflect us from introducing public health measures which will ultimately save lives.  This legislation will save lives long after we have passed on from this House and passed on from this life.<br \/>As I have stated before, standardised packaging is the latest strand to the comprehensive range of tobacco control legislation already in place in Ireland.  It is just one of the many recommendations for implementation set out in Tobacco Free Ireland.  What we mean by Tobacco Free Ireland is a prevalence of less than 5% of people smoking by 2025 in the country.  Ireland is adopting an approach recommended by the World Health Organization.  Guidelines devised in 2008 under the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control state the following: <blockquote>Parties should consider adopting measures to restrict or prohibit the use of logos, colours, brand images or promotional information on packaging other than brand names and product names displayed in a standard colour and font style (plain packaging).  This may increase the noticeability and effectiveness of health warnings and messages, prevent the package from detracting attention from them and address industry package design techniques that may suggest that some products are less harmful than others.<\/blockquote>Standardised packaging is not a new concept and as we know Australia acted upon this recommendation.  A year on from the introduction of plain packaging in Australia, we have some research on the effects of the policy.  One study found that following the introduction of plain packaging and larger pictorial warnings on packs, smoking in outdoor areas declined by 23%.  It also found that personal pack display, that is, where packs are clearly visible on tables, declined by 15%, particularly in venues where children were present.  Flashing out a nice packet in front of one's friends that one is going to have a cigarette may seem like a cool thing to do, but flashing a very disturbing picture of a gangrenous foot, a rotting lung or a dying man will not be cool.  They also found a 78% increase in the number of calls to the smoking cessation helpline.  This increase was due to the introduction of plain packaging.  The researchers found it was not attributable to other causes, such as anti-tobacco advertising or cigarette price increases.<br \/>As I said earlier, the misrepresentation of evidence by the tobacco industry is a well-recognised tactic.  Another is the threat of legal challenges.  While a legal challenge by the tobacco industry cannot be ruled out - I say that tongue in cheek because one can be absolutely sure it will happen - I am confident that the research available to us demonstrates that standardised packaging will have a positive impact on health and is a proportionate and justified measure.  The threat of legal challenges should not be an obstacle to progressing public health policies.  We must press on with our mission to make Ireland tobacco free by 2025.  We owe that to our children.  We can never allow multinationals focused on profit to interfere in any way with our public health policy, which is designed for the benefit of our people.<br \/>Again, I thank all the Senators who participated in these debates.  I also thank the Senators who are members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children for their work on this Bill.  Before I commend the Bill to the House, I remind Members that the battle is only really beginning.  The real fight will start now.  Today, I was advised by a senior Cabinet colleague that our actions in this regard, and mine as Minister for Health, have not gone unnoticed in certain states of the USA.  I, together with Senator Crown, would love to see a situation where in both Europe and the United States a way was found to subsidise farmers to produce a crop other than tobacco.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014062400032#GG00900","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1403631900,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for bringing forward this legislation and all the staff in the Department of Health and in the Office of the Attorney General for their work in this area.

Law firms with deep pockets in Dublin should not rally round to attack this Minister because he is trying to improve the health of the nation by running cases in the courts on intellectual property grounds, using money which we in this House do not have to spend on court cases but which tobacco companies do have.  According to Wikipedia:<blockquote>Intellectual property (IP) rights are the legally recognized exclusive rights to creations of the mind. Under intellectual property law, owners are granted certain exclusive rights to a variety of intangible assets, such as musical, literary, and artistic works; discoveries and inventions; and words, phrases, symbols, and designs.<\/blockquote>How can one use intellectual property rights to defend the tobacco industry and its distinctive packages?  We are allowing them to continue to market products of which many of us disapprove but with a plain label.  They can still trade internationally.  They accuse this Minister of disrupting trade and so on.  We are not doing that; they are simply conducting it under conditions of plain wrapping.<br \/>I hope members of the Law Library and the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland will not rush to oppose this legislation.  The private enterprise sector, through banking and accounting firms, did itself immense damage in the relatively recent past.  I am disappointed that the American Chamber of Commerce in Ireland appears to oppose the Minister.  I would be very disappointed if a sector which badly needs to re-establish confidence after the damage it has done to the country now condemns, and hires PR companies to oppose, this legislation and the Minister, who is slightly curtailing a toxic industry, much less than Senator Crown and I would wish.  Parliament is entitled to take measures to promote public health.  I am delighted this Minister has done so.  His opponents should seriously consider their position before they rush to serve legal writs on him.  I congratulate him.  May this legislation fare well because it is doing exactly what is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014062400033#HH00500","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1403632500,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I sat through nearly all of this debate and commend the Minister again on his initiative, bravery and courage because he and the staff in the Department of Health know better than most that this is a very powerful industry.

That indicates the depths to which this industry will go.  The Minister has resisted this and that is highly commendable.  As he said, the war has just commenced.  I think the lawyers will have great difficulty driving a coach and horses through it, to quote Daniel O'Connell.  The coach and the horse will be well stalled before they hit the steps of the Four Courts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014062400033#HH00600","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1403632500,"counter":244,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1403632500,"counter":245,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014062400033#HH00700","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1403632500,"counter":246,"content":"<p>At 10.30 a.m. tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014062400033#HH00800","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Adjournment Matters","time":1403633100,"counter":247,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014062400034#JJ00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Care of the Elderly","time":1403633100,"counter":248,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014062400034#JJ00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1403633100,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014062400034#JJ00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1403633100,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I apologise to the Minister of State because I did not realise this matter would be taken so soon after I raised another issue with her last Thursday.  On this occasion, I am seeking clarification with regard to changes that are being made in the area of elderly care.  I have raised this subject with the Minister of State previously.  It is back on the table now.  I am proposing the establishment of a task force that would involve all the parties involved in this sector in a consultation process.  It would not be a statutory committee or anything else.  I should declare an interest by mentioning that Nursing Homes Ireland, which has raised this issue with me, was the body that nominated me to run for the Seanad on the industrial and commercial panel.  While the members of the association are very appreciative of the fact the Minister of State has met them regularly, they feel there is a gap in this regard.  This issue has been raised with me by a number of other organisations as well.  The association has suggested that a task force could be established to meet, perhaps every six months at the initial stage, and go through the issue of the long-term planning of elderly care.  I am not talking about elderly care in nursing homes.  I am talking about home care packages and all the support services that will be needed by a growing number of people as time goes by.  We need to work in conjunction with all the other players in this area to develop the services that give people support.  That is why I requested this Adjournment debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014062400034#JJ00400","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1403633100,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  I do not think this debate on how we should plan for the future has come too soon after our last debate.<\/p><p>The population of Ireland, like that of many other countries in Europe, is ageing rapidly.  It is estimated that the number of people over the age of 65 will increase by nearly 220,000 over the next decade.  This means that by 2024, there will be approximately 800,000 people over the age of 65.  It is estimated that the number of people in the oldest cohort, those over the age of 80, will increase even more significantly, by approximately 42%, or 60,000, during the same period.  These changes will have significant social and economic implications at individual, family and societal levels.  The challenges arising from the ageing of our population can be met if we plan effectively to ensure the necessary adjustments are made over time to services, mindsets and the structure of our society as a whole.  We have done a lot of work in this respect to prepare for the future.  We have published the carers strategy and the national positive ageing strategy.  The national dementia strategy is at an advanced stage of preparation.  These strategies have been informed by extensive consultations with stakeholders, including the bodies mentioned by the Senator.  The positive ageing strategy contains a large number of action areas relating to older people's participation in society, health and social care provision, financial and physical security and the need for an evidence-based approach to making policy.  Preparations are in train for the implementation of the strategy.<\/p><p>Of course there are some areas in which more work is needed to decide how best we can meet the real challenges that face us.  As we address these areas, we will be happy to hear the views of all concerned.  The views that are expressed and the proposals that are made will be carefully considered on their own merits.  As always, our priority will be to ensure the best outcomes for older people and taxpayers.  We are pursuing an ambitious programme of reform for our health sector, for example, by developing and reforming how we provide social care and care for older people.  The priority for 2014 is the development of an integrated model of care, with a strong emphasis on home care and community care.  It is in that context that, at a policy level, we are looking at how well our current model of provision meets the needs and wishes of older people.  Accordingly, the review of the nursing home support scheme, which was the subject of an extensive and structured public consultation process, will consider how we balance residential care with care in the community and whether this needs to be adjusted to better reflect what older people want and to deliver better outcomes for all.  The review will be published in the coming months.<\/p><p>I assure the Senator that planning for future services will continue.  It will be fully informed by the views and concerns of all stakeholders.  All positions will be considered in a balanced and objective way to achieve the optimal outcome.  I recently met representatives of Nursing Homes Ireland.  It was a successful, open and frank meeting.  Everyone agreed that there will be a deficit in the number of beds that will be necessary in the future.  We discussed the type of community-based care structure that will need to be in place.  We agreed at the meeting to develop an overarching plan to cater for the needs of the population as we age.  This will involve elements of the various strategies we have already developed.  It was also agreed that all the stakeholders - nursing home providers and other public and private service providers in community and long-stay care - will talk to one another with everyone's views being taken on board.  This is a very positive development.  It is within that type of planning that we will be able to consider what type of interaction will be necessary into the future.  I hope my comments have been of some help to the Senator.  I thank him again for raising the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014062400034#JJ00500","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1403633100,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive reply.

I do not think I have had an opportunity to do so publicly before now.  Last Thursday evening, I attended a meeting with the dedicated people who are involved in school completion programmes in the Dundalk and Drogheda areas of County Louth.  We all know about the fantastic service these vital programmes give to children who would otherwise be at risk of dropping out of education.  As a former teacher, I have actively witnessed the huge benefit of school completion programmes.  Indeed, I attended a summer literacy course that was offered at a national school in the Dundalk area and witnessed the valuable work that was being done there.  I commend all involved.  The attendance at last Thursday's meeting, which took place at the same time as a huge World Cup match, demonstrated the dedication of the people and how deeply they feel about the whole idea of school completion programmes.<\/p> <p>I wish to ask the Minister about the letter they received signalling a proposed cut of 6.5%.  In the past five years there have been immense cuts to the school completion programme.  We see the importance of DEIS schooling, which is apparent from the recent press statement from the Minister on how DEIS is working and how school completion programmes are helping to assist young people to stay at school.  Approximately 1,136 pupils are targeted in the Louth area for the school completion programme, which is vital for them.<\/p><p>I understand the Child and Family Agency has not yet finalised its proposals for funding of school completion programmes.  The co-ordinators and educational partners are right to push the issue before it is too late and the proposals are finalised.  I contacted the Minister&rsquo;s office last week, following receipt of the invitation to the meeting, as that was one of the proposals signalled.<\/p><p>If we deal with the situation early and examine the effect of the proposed cuts, the matter can be addressed.  I am aware that once the proposal for funding is finalised by the Child and Family Agency, the school completion programmes will then formulate their retention plan or service plan.  We have time to address the issue before programmes will be asked to further scale back their services and children are adversely affected, which is what will happen.  The valuable after-school, in-school and holiday work that is done will all be affected.<\/p><p>I understand the ESRI is undertaking a review of the entire school completion programme.  Will the Minister provide an update on it and when it is expected to be published?  I would also appreciate if he would please outline the future policy for school completion programmes and the engagement he had to date with the providers on the issue.<\/p><p>I appreciate there are many considerations and decisions.  Those who work in the school completion programme fully understand that cuts had to be made but they must be weighed.  I wish to highlight the matter at an early stage when we have time to address the issue before it becomes a much larger problem.  We must ensure that we protect DEIS initiatives to provide the best outcomes for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children.<\/p><p>One point made at the meeting last week is that it costs an average of &euro;90,000 to keep someone in prison.  It has been proven that school completion programmes assist in keeping people out of prison.  One must take into account the money that we will save in the long run if we invest the money in children and education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014062400034#JJ01000","speaker":"1174","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403633700,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Moran for raising this important issue, with particular reference to her area of Dundalk.  I acknowledge the points she made about the importance of the scheme to children in her area.<\/p><p>The school completion programme aims to retain young people in the formal education system to completion of senior cycle and to generally improve the school attendance, participation and retention of its target cohort.  It is a targeted intervention aimed at those school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills' DEIS action plan for educational inclusion.  It involves 124 locally-managed projects and related initiatives operating across 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools to provide targeted supports to approximately 36,000 children and young people.  There are five school completion programme projects in County Louth with a combined allocation of just over &euro;l million this year.<\/p><p>The programme's project model approach gives local communities the autonomy to devise innovative approaches to address the needs of young people most at risk of early school leaving.  The programme is one of three service strands within the continuum of the educational welfare service being implemented by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, to support children, their families and schools.  The other service strands are the home-school-community liaison scheme and the educational welfare service.  The objective is to deliver a strategic integrated approach to school attendance, participation and retention to enhance the support available to children, their families and schools.  Local projects work in an integrated way with the agency's educational welfare service strands, and with voluntary and statutory agencies.<\/p><p>School completion programme projects typically provide a range of supports which are delivered at a targeted, whole school or whole class level.  They include initiatives where appropriate - in-school, after-school, out-of-school and during holiday periods.  The supports include initiatives such as breakfast clubs, homework clubs, after-school supports, mentoring programmes and therapeutic interventions.  Projects seek to ensure that schools have in place the appropriate procedures to monitor, identify and respond to attendance, participation and retention issues.  They also provide transfer programmes to support young people transitioning from primary to post-primary school.<\/p><p>Since its establishment earlier this year the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the school completion programme, including the allocation of funds to projects within the programme.  In 2014, &euro;26.456 million has been made available to the agency for the programme.  Individual school completion programme projects are funded in accordance with the academic year, which runs from 1 September to 31 August, thus crossing two financial years.  Funding is currently issued in three allocations, typically in September and December with a final drawdown in May.  I recognise the importance of the scheme in the Dundalk area, as has been outlined by Senator Moran.<\/p><p>As with all major spending programmes, the school completion programme budget was subject to examination under the terms of the 2011 comprehensive review of expenditure.  The process identified a requirement for savings of 6.5% per annum across the programme over the period 2012 to 2014.  I am advised that proposals have yet to be formulated by the agency on the funding for school completion programme projects in the coming 2014 to 2015 academic year.  As an initial step the agency invited all school completion programme projects to commence planning for the next cycle of the programme within the available funding parameters.  The agency has commenced the detailed process of evaluating and approving the 2014-15 school retention plans for individual projects.  It is anticipated that the agency will advise projects of the outcome of the process and of their allocations in time for the start of the new school year on 1 September.  The agency will continue to work closely with local management committees, schools and local school completion programme co-ordinators to assist projects through the process.  The potential for any changes in the funding allocated to the programme in future years is a matter to be considered in the Estimates and budgetary process having regard to the resources available to Government.<\/p><p>The Senator will wish to note that an operational review of the school completion programme has commenced.  The objectives of the review are to identify best practice in supporting school retention, to clarify roles and responsibilities and to build upon the valuable learning and experience to date across the programme.  It is anticipated that the review will assist in identifying the reforms necessary to consolidate the programme on a sustainable footing for the future and ensure that available funds are targeted to those services which provide the greatest contribution to educational outcomes for young people at risk of educational disadvantage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014062400035#KK00200","speaker":"1055"},{"type":"speech","time":1403633700,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

I do not just speak about Dundalk; I speak about County Louth as a whole, where last week it was reported that between 2010 and 2015 a total of &euro;785,804 has been cumulatively lost to projects.  The Tusla mission statement refers to putting the child first.  We must put the child first.  I plead with the Minister not to proceed with the proposed cut.

We should be aware of the position in June to know what plans can be made in September and not have to wait until the end of August to find out exactly what will happen.
