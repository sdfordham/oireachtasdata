As my colleague Deputy Thomas Byrne mentioned the other day, it is not in keeping with the programme for Government to have Committee Stage of this most important Bill two days after Second Stage.  Fundamental changes and reform to pension law are proposed as part of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill.  In the referendum the people voted to keep what they hoped would be a reflective thoughtful Chamber which would give appropriate consideration to important legislation such as the Bill.  The Bill will not get the consideration it deserves and requires.  We have had an opportunity to table amendments, but by no means have we had an opportunity to assess the impact of the Bill to the extent we should between Second and Committee Stages to table the optimum number of amendments.  As Senator Byrne stated on Tuesday, we will oppose the Order of Business in this regard.<\/p><p>  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, comes to the House later to discuss the Central Bank report to be announced at 11 a.m.  As seems to be so often the case the media is better informed than the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In the <i>Irish Independent<\/i> today, Charlie Weston highlights what he believes to be part of the report, which is that the number of people throughout the country in arrears for more than three months is almost as high as 100,000.  This is despite the Taoiseach and the Minister stating the 30% target for work-outs with people in arrears is being reached by most of the banks.  The fox is still in charge of the henhouse and nobody is looking after the people.  I have anecdotal evidence from people coming to my clinics that banks, particularly those which have chosen to exit the Irish market, are honing in on people with additional equity in their properties to ensure they sell them to give the bank the quickest exit.  This does not give the consumer the best outcome.  The forbearance options put on the table are those which suit the bank and not the people.  Since 2008 we have sat late hours to deal with bank guarantees and the provision of funds from parties on both sides of the House.  Rather than taking on board the spirit with which this was done the banks are showing contempt for consumers.  The forbearance options put forward are for the banks and are not in the best interests of the consumers or the struggling coping classes.<\/p><p>  Yesterday, several days in advance of the Labour Party conference, the T&aacute;naiste spoke quite cynically about potential tax cuts for the coping classes.  The biggest challenge we have had in recent years is the mortgage crisis and all we have done is put the fox in charge of the henhouse and nobody is looking after the people.  We used to talk about getting guarantees for banks and money for them and their systemic importance.  What about the systemic importance of the real people on the streets in Ireland who are struggling with this?  Rhetoric from the T&aacute;naiste several days in advance of the party conference on cutting taxes is disingenuous in the extreme when the people yearn and need real and tangible solutions for their mortgage difficulties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800003#B00500","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1385634600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>It is quite amusing to hear Senator MacSharry call the comments of the T&aacute;naiste on potential future tax reform cynical given his performance in this House on a number of occasions.<\/p><p>I welcome the fact the Garda has cancelled an urgent alert regarding a Roscommon woman and her three children, which was raised after the family had been last seen at approximately 3 p.m. yesterday.

Such an alert is only launched where a child is under the age of 18, where there is a reasonable belief there is an immediate risk to the health and welfare of the child and there is sufficient information to enable the public to help in locating the child.  I congratulate the Garda and the PSNI on the successful outcome in this instance.<\/p><p>I also welcome the Revenue extension of the filing deadline for property tax.  There has been a bit of a steep learning curve for the Revenue Commissioners in this particular instance but they have shown themselves willing to listen to the public.

It is the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013, for which we have been waiting for quite some time.  It will be extremely important in ensuring greater equality and support for people with disabilities.  I have invited some of the top technical experts in the country to provide a briefing for Members on this long-awaited Bill.  When it is passed, my understanding is that it will enable us to be ready to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; therefore, it is very important that we get it right.  My question is about the use of the AV room for the briefing.  I requested use of the AV room to allow these experts to brief Members on this very significant law.  I received a note back from the proper channels stating the D&aacute;il Committee on Procedure and Privileges had agreed that only school groups could use the AV room up to 2 p.m. and, therefore, my request would have to be refused but that I could use certain other rooms.  I am not happy with that answer.  My group leader, Senator Jillian van Turnhout, has written a letter to the Cathaoirleach requesting that the briefing take place in the AV room.  We have not yet received a response.  If there is a problem with the overuse of the AV room, so be it.  Let us have a meeting and set up guidelines, but let us use that space to brief Members on important items such as law making.  During the recent referendum debate there was much touting on the importance of engaging experts for law makers to help us to do the right thing.  Can the decision be amended and guidelines written?

The changes will be made incrementally and the first subject to be affected is English, with the first assessment in 2018.  The Minister has acknowledged that teachers have concerns that will be addressed.  That is welcome.  I recall that when the primary school curriculum was being overhauled, for each subject there were three days of in-service training; two outside and one inside the school.  There will be one day's in-service training in the case of the new junior cycle programme.  The new English curriculum is quite complex and will need much discussion.

I hail somebody whom I think is one of the greatest leaders of the last millennium.  I refer to Pope Francis, even though I am not a Roman Catholic.  He has a thing called an apostolic exhortation which is not an encyclical but a most fascinating document.   Since the Vatican is both a state and a church, we should discuss it in this House because he goes straight to the heart of matters dealing with the church.  He addresses the document to all baptised people to express the joy of the Gospels.  He talks about narrowness within the churches and the many who feel superior to others because they remain intransigently faithful to a particular Catholic style from the past.  He talks about excessive clericalism and democratising and decentralising the Vatican.  He talks most significantly about the injustice of the current financial system and the tyranny of market capitalism and the fact that the economy kills people, as we know it does.  It has killed people in this country, where it is survival of the fittest and the law of the jungle prevails.  He talks about the unemployed across the European Union and claims the rate is up to 40%, while in Spain it is 60% for those under 25 years.  A man with this vision who also speaks about the homeless is somebody to whom we really should listen.  This is a very significant document.  We have a situation across the world where there is no moral leadership among political or religious leaders.  Here is somebody who is showing us the way and giving us an opportunity and I hope we can discuss this very important document, either before or immediately after Christmas.  I also salute the Muslim Minister from Britain who, transcending her own religious views, spoke about the discrimination against and the ethnic cleansing of Christian communities in the Middle East.  I am very pleased to learn from the Irish Genealogical Society that it has helped in the restoration of one of the world's great libraries, the National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Sarajevo.  In the past few days pallets of books donated from Ireland, a very significant proportion of which were donated by Professor Geraldine Smith of the School of Ecumenics in Trinity College, Dublin, have made their way to Sarajevo to help to repair the gap created during the bombardment of that city when remarkable, beautiful and irreplaceable manuscripts from the Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Muslim and Jewish traditions were destroyed.  That is very important.  My main plea is that we take this important document from such a significant world figure and examine it, not just in its religious context, although I do not see why this House should not discuss that aspect, but particularly in the light of its concern for democratisation and the poor and the worry about the ruthlessness and callousness of the financial system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800004#C00900","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1385635800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>In light of the terrible burglary in County Tipperary last weekend and the brutality of the gang's actions towards the Corcoran family, I request that the Minister for Justice and Equality come into the House to debate the possibility of amending the criminal law to prevent similar attacks happening in the future.  We must send a message to those living in rural Ireland that they are safe in their homes.  The closure of some rural Garda stations and the ever improving road network has only served to give these gurriers the confidence to rob, pilfer and maim those people who are living in rural areas.  The human cost is such that the victims and their families are likely to be traumatised for the rest of their lives.  It is up to us as legislators to ensure the inviolability of the dwelling is upheld and that people feel safe in their homes.<\/p><p>We must look at the statistics.  Only one fifth of sentences for burglary convictions lead to jail terms of more than five years, while almost half of all convictions for burglary attract sentences of three years or less.  To add insult to injury for those affected by the actions of these thugs, many robberies are carried out by repeat offenders.  There is no minimum or mandatory sentences for burglars.

One day's in-service training for teachers to come to terms with the whole new system will not be adequate.  The success of the system is predicated entirely on the full co-operation and understanding of the teaching cohort.<\/p><p>I have said before that the reason many young people find history unpalatable is because of the way it is being taught.  The students are being fed a load of facts without ever trying to find out why things happened.  History can be an enthralling subject.  The Chinese communist leader Deng Xiaoping when asked for his assessment of the French Revolution said: &quot;It is too early to say&quot;.  That might be one extreme but during the time I was teaching, the teaching of history was not fit for purpose.<\/p><p>May I ask the Acting Leader to invite the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton to the House to discuss the manner in which medical investigations are conducted for those who apply for benefits based on disability, such as the invalidity pension?  It is clearly important that the medical regime is strict to ensure only people who are entitled to these pensions would get them.  In my view there is a lack of transparency in the process.  A person may have to wait for months to see a doctor and then faces a further waiting period to get a result and yet receives a letter stating in one line that he or she is suitable or unsuitable for the grant.  I do not think that is good enough in this day and age.  People should receive a comprehensive answer as they are entitled to know the reason they have been deemed unsuitable.  I am not casting any aspersions on the medical corps in the Department of Social Protection, but the system must be transparent.  There is a valid suspicion in the community that the medical process is often used to save money by delaying and dragging out the process.  How many medical opinions are overturned on appeal?  I have seen a number of cases , in which it seemed clear to me that the applicant was entitled to an invalidity pension but was refused in the first instances, but some 12 or 18 months later following an appeal process is adjudicated to be entitled to the benefit.  That person's condition may not have changed one whit in the meantime.  The reason I raise this issue is as a result of a case I am involved in.  An individual with profound Parkinson's disease has had to wait for two years for his invalidity benefit to be granted.  This former self-employed man has been living on his savings and I think it is very unfair that it has taken such a long period to be granted an invalidity payment.

They deserve the thanks of the House for that.<\/p><p>I also thank the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Sean Sherlock.  Yesterday, when responding to amendments during our discussions on the regulation of accountants, he agreed to talk to Senator Quinn and us on the delays in procedure, the lack of penalties, restrictions on the authority of the regulatory body and the fact that bodies such as the EBS, the INBS and credit unions which, because they are not listed on the Stock Exchange, are not subject to the same regulation.<\/p> <p>It was an important gesture by the Minister.  The regulation of accountants has been let slip.<\/p><p>Later this morning we will debate pensions and will make additional provision for the restructuring of certain occupational pension schemes for the purpose of reducing benefits paid to certain person under such schemes.  A most interesting debate on pension fees is happening in the UK today.  The UK Government plans to cap pension management fees at 0.75% but Legal &amp;amp; General claims it should be 0.5%.  A 1% increase in administration fees adds &euro;120,000 to an average pension so we need to debate pensions in the House.  We are bailing out some pensions from a welfare point of view but we do not want to bail out high cost and inefficient companies.  I seek a debate, particularly apropos of the developments in the UK today and on the costs of maladministration.  The failure to properly take demographic developments into account and so on costs people on pensions because each 1% increase in administration costs &euro;120,000.

The idea that we would be unable or hindered in our own understanding of it, particularly following her efforts to organise a briefing, and somehow we could not conduct it, seems to me to be down to a lack of common sense.  I trust that common sense will prevail.<\/p><p>Last week I raised a matter and I remind the Leader again that we seek a debate with the Minister for Education and Skills on the chief inspector's report.  Today, I welcome the Minister's report on nine new schools and their ethos.  It is the first time for us to see clear evidence of parents having their say on the choice of ethos for the schools.  The variation in ethos shows the diversity that he hopes to introduce and the range of teaching and ethos that would be available in those schools which reflects the children living in those communities.  The initiative gives parents strength and provides them with a say and stake in the running of the schools which is welcome.  <\/p><p>In the absence of Senator Bacik I welcome an additional 950 bicycles to the streets of Dublin as part of the Dublin Bikes scheme.  I know that she would welcome the scheme's extension if she were present.  The additional bikes mean that she may have to fight harder for her space on the roads that she cycles along.  I welcome the statement made by the Lord Mayor of Dublin, O&iacute;sin Quinn, that he will not accept sponsorship from drink companies for the bike system.  Obviously the council needs sponsorship but he said that is important not to link alcohol near the good work done by the National Roads Authority to promote Dublin as a city that welcomes and promotes cycling. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800006#E00200","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1385636400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.

Yesterday I discussed the problem with the Minister.  Clearly, her heart is in the right place but, as Senator White has said, that is not enough.  We must encourage the Minister to find a solution.  I gather that the matter is in the hands of the Attorney General and that is where the matter is being held up.  I know that the Minister understands the problem.  Only four or five families are involved so it should not be an insurmountable issue.  There is a difficulty with the Russian adoption on that basis.  I hope that the Minister will solve the matter because time is short.<\/p><p>Two years ago we had a very good debate here on food waste which acted as a reminder to us all of the amount of food that is wasted.  In the western world we produce about 300% more food than we need yet 1 billion people per day go hungry and suffer malnutrition in the rest of the world.  The main cause is that people in the western world waste food.  The figure for Ireland is quite startling with each family throwing out &euro;700 worth of food per year, with some families throwing out food to the value of &euro;1,000.  The solution is in our hands.  We must stop producing too much food and leaving it on our plates or in saucepans.  There is another thing that we can do and it concerns expiry dates.  Producers still print &quot;best before&quot; dates on their products.    <\/p> <p>\"Best before\" just does not make sense.  It is not a question of \"best before\".  I can remember looking at \"best before\" when I was in the business of potatoes.  I spoke to the supplier and reminded him that he was supplying potatoes on a Thursday which had a \"best before\" date of Monday.  He said, \"Yes, they are new potatoes, they are the best.  If you really want to taste them well, they are best if one cooks and eats them before Sunday.\"  That does not mean there is anything wrong with them on Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday.  I mention it because it is sinful to think that 1 billion people are going hungry in the world while we are throwing out so much food on that basis.  A new organisation, FoodCloud, set up by two women, aims to get the waste food that in the past we fed to animals but since BSE and the foot and mouth scares we do not feed waste food to animals any more.  As such a system is in place in different parts of the world, FoodCloud deserves attention.  I ask the Leader for a debate on the issue in the near future.  It is worth bringing the issue to the attention of the rest of the country and as it is in our own hands we can actually do something about it.  We could refer to the debate we had about two years ago to see the basis of that.  It is clear that 60% of the food that is binned is edible and yet we do not eat it, either because we are concerned about it or have produced too much or are lazy or are interested in the \"best before\" date rather than in our health. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800006#E00700","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385637000,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I support Senator White in her call once again in regard to Russian adoptions.

Given that the health budget is significant there are huge savings to be made by people addressing potential health issues at an early stage.

The comments of Senators this morning will be passed to her.<\/p><p>Senator Terry Brennan referred to the threatened action in the ESB.  I hope it will not come to this.  Management and the unions are meeting today and we should give them space, as it is important that they are meeting and sitting down together.  I hope there will be a resolution to the issue.  I wish them well and hope for a positive outcome.<\/p><p>In response to Senator Feargal Quinn, I remember well the interesting debate on food waste that took place two years ago.  It is probably a debate we should continue.  Perhaps the Senator might do so in the form of a Private Members' motion.  I will bring back his comments to the Leader who I am sure will be in discussions with the Senator on how we should proceed.  It is one thing recognising that there is waste, finding a solution to the problem is another.  As the Senator mentioned, we cannot feed much of the waste to animals because of changing regulations.  I had heard about the food cloud.  It is innovative and I wish those involved well with it.  It is an important issue.<\/p><p>Senator C&aacute;it Keane was concerned about the level of homelessness.  I hope we will have a debate on that issue.<\/p><p>Senator Michael Mullins sought a debate on the issue of health promotion and quoted the findings of a survey.  The level of obesity is a significant issue.  The Senator was speaking about adults, but the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, launched a report, Growing up in Ireland, in which the level of obesity among children was highlighted.  The cure is prevention.  This is an important month, &quot;Movember&quot;, and I note Senator Diarmuid Wilson is supporting the initiative which is also about prevention and raising awareness.<\/p><p>Senator Mary Ann O'Brien was concerned about the charity sector.  I will bring her comments back to the relevant Minister and hope we will have a debate on it.<\/p><p>On Senator David Cullinane's comments on job creation, this has been a positive week.  In fact, 58,000 new jobs have been created in the past year.  Like the Senator, I am a member of the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation which has looked at the problems being encountered in the south east, about which he is particularly concerned.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, will shortly produce the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 which, no doubt, he will be willing to come here to discuss at some stage and hear the views of Senators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800008#G00500","speaker":"1114","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385638200,"counter":60,"content":"<p>Senator Marc MacSharry has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business, \"That a debate with the Minister for Finance on the report of the Central Bank on mortgage arrears be taken today.\"  Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800009#H00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1385638200,"counter":61,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800009#H00300","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"vote","time":1385638200,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 19; N\u00edl, 26.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Ned O'Sullivan and Diarmuid Wilson; N\u00edl, Senators Aideen Hayden and Michael Mullins.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800009#H00350","aye":["1157","1116","1147","1133","1159","1140","1149","1128","1136","1122","1123","1169","1142","1145","1155","1171","1156","1164","1176"],"nay":["1148","1121","1138","1150","1114","1165","1124","1158","1130","1166","1160","1117","1172","1152","1173","1135","1161","1162","1132","1134","1118","1187","1170","1129","1125","1163"]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1385638200,"counter":63,"content":"<p>Question, &quot;That the Order of Business be agreed to&quot;, put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Bill 2013: Report and Final Stages","time":1385638800,"counter":64,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800010#K00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1385638800,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, to the House.

This is the fourth time he has come before us to discuss this Bill.  I do not believe he has climbed a high mountain or discovered new thinking in the Himalayan air in the meantime.  It is inappropriate that approximately &euro;500,000 will be handed over to the political parties in the coming three years based on calculations that are no longer valid.  Previously, when making this point, I referred to former members of parliamentary parties and the Minister was disinclined to accept my argument.

This is an example of improper practice and it sends out the wrong signal about politics, politicians and political funding.  <\/p><p>  In the period leading up to the next general election, which we are informed will be held in March or April 2016, political parties will receive approximately &euro;500,000 from taxpayers to which they are not entitled.

We strongly believe that an allowance of &euro;21,045 that has been allocated to us should no longer be paid to Fine Gael, a party from which both of us have been expelled.  This money is made available to fund the political system.  As parliamentarians who work on behalf of their constituents, Senator Bradford and I are still members of that system.  As a mark of honour, we do not ask that the money be paid to us or the reform alliance.  Instead, it should be returned to the Exchequer as there is no basis for paying it to the Fine Gael Party.  If it is not returned, the Minister, as the occupant of the key reforming financial Department, will have elected to endorse the <i>status quo<\/i> and an insider job.  <\/p><p>  People have repeatedly stated they want reform of the political system and accepting this amendment would be a small step in that direction.  The Bill is not about funding elections or saving staff.

The purpose of the payment of this allowance to the political parties is to fill party coffers in a disingenuous manner.  I ask the Minister to support us and allow the amendment to be a mark of change.  He has shown great intent as a reforming Minister in many other areas.

I remind the Minister that there is a precedent in this regard.  When an Independent Deputy joined the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in the previous Government, she was advised legally, as I am sure Fine Gael and the Labour Party are currently being advised, that she was entitled to keep the money under the legislation.  Incidentally, the Minister has not made any changes in this regard in the Bill.  Considerable political pressure was applied on the Independent Deputy in question, both by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Brian Cowen, and Opposition parties, to give up her independent allowance.  She subsequently and properly decided to give it up, notwithstanding the absence of any legal obligation on her to do so.  Similarly, the Fine Gael Party and Labour Party will not be legally required to give up the relevant allowances if the amendment is not accepted.  The parties should be consistent with the arguments they made at the time.  The then Taoiseach clearly stated that the Independent Deputy in question should give up her allowance.  The legal advice from the Oireachtas, however, was to the contrary as the position was very clear in the legislation.  It is essential that the Minister accept the amendment.

While the amendment tabled by my two colleagues affects their own case, they are not seeking any aggrandisement or financial reward for themselves but addressing the principle that the labourer gets paid for his or her hire.  It is daft that a political party or an organisation should be paid for the work done by somebody who has disassociated himself or herself from that organisation or party.<\/p><p>I had forgotten about the precedent to which Senator Byrne referred.  It appears that this was merely counsel's advice.  I wonder if my colleagues, Senators Bradford and Healy Eames, would consider taking this matter before the courts to obtain a ruling.  There are legal implications to this important constitutional point.  It is likely that in these circumstances a court would avoid embarrassment for the Minister and two individuals involved and would lay down a principle that would continue and would, I hope, be unlikely to cause any great financial burden on the two Senators in question.  This is a matter of considerable constitutional importance and in such cases the court usually waives legal fees.  Perhaps the Senators will think along these lines. <\/p><p>As I stated, the proposed amendment sets out an honourable course of action.  It is not as if the political parties are destitute of funds.  It is revealing to learn how much they receive.  The loss of the money intended and specified for the two individuals involved would not bankrupt the Fine Gael Party as it has adequate resources.  <\/p> <p>In anticipation of an argument that the Minister may feel inclined to repeat, namely, that they were elected as members of Fine Gael, how can we know this?  We cannot know what is in the minds of all the people in the electorate.  I regularly hear people in my area say they voted for the person rather than the party.  They vote for the person they trust to represent them adequately.  The argument falls because one can assume that at least a reasonable proportion of the people who voted for Senator Paul Bradford, even though they were merely Members of Parliament and county councillors rather than real people, had a good idea of what they were doing.  The Minister's position raises the spectre of the mediaeval system that obtained when I was first elected to this House, whereby Members electing persons to Seanad &Eacute;ireann were dragooned into their parties' rooms, told where to mark their \"X\" and stood over while they voted.

The Government estimates that there are 750,000 university voters - that is a big wallop of voters.  Senator Martin Conway made a good point about blind people being allowed to use computers, but everybody should be allowed to do so.  Six Senators will be elected from the universities by 750,000 voters; 43 will be elected by fewer than 1,000 voters, while the remainder will be elected by the Taoiseach through the glory of the single voter electorate.  It can be similar in other elections.  I recall the last by-election, in which there were only 237 votes for technical reasons.  We have to equalise and democratise the system.

We would not have the spectacle of politicians standing at church gates or the other nonsense that occurs such as politicians trying to sell raffle tickets.  Our democracy is worth much more than this and political parties should be properly funded.  Similarly, Members of the Oireachtas should be properly supported.

I choose to do my business in County Clare because that is where I happen to live.  Members of the other House have offices that are funded by the taxpayer.

Deputies and Senators should be on the same salary.  Deputies should not be on a higher salary than Senators.  They could well survive on our salary.  Senators work equally as hard as Deputies.

It implements our commitment to reduce the party leaders' allowance, as it was then called, or the parliamentary activities allowance, as it will be known henceforth, for all recipients.  At the same time, it is being used as a legislative vehicle to end severance payments for Ministers which many people found anomalous.

Such payments are anomalous in terms of the pressures we are facing and we need to abolish them.  We are doing a lot of things we did not do in the 1990s.  Perhaps we should have done them at that stage.  A number of policies were wrongly bolted on during what were purported to be the boom times.  At one stage, all but two Fianna F&aacute;il Members had an allowance for something.  The public reacted badly to this and we need to address the issue.  I am also minded that we should avoid the other extreme.  Politics should not be for those who can afford to practise it as a hobby.  One of the first demands of the British Labour Party at the beginning of the 20th century, when it first elected representatives to the UK Parliament, was to have parliamentarians paid.  Until then it had been a gentleman's club to which people moved from the law library or the shires.  For ordinary people to do a job, there is a rate that should be paid.  I am conscious of this as a former trade union official.  <\/p><p>I have listened with care and noted the passion - I use the word advisedly - with which the proposers of the amendment, Senators Paul Bradford and Fidelma Healy Eames, have made their arguments.<\/p> <p>I said on the last occasion that I believed they were motivated by honourable beliefs to table this amendment.  I have a different view on it, as I have explained at length.  <\/p><p>A snapshot in time, namely, the day of the election, determines the parliamentary provision we provide.  As to why we provide any parliamentary provision from the public purse, we do so to address the issue about which all of us are deeply concerned, namely, that everybody is entitled to operate within the political system, of which parties are an essential part, although they are not formally recognised in the Constitution.  They run press offices, conduct research and support their members.  Traditionally, that was done through the leader's allowance and it will now be done at a reduced rate through the new parliamentary activities allowance.  It is available to both party members and Independents, as determined by that snapshot in time when the electorate, whether it be the confined electorate for this House or the broader franchise for the other House, determines the distribution of the money.  The essence of the argument being made is that this should be a variable and cover a situation where people move out or in of a party, but that is highly problematic for all the reasons I have given.  <\/p><p>To put this matter in its context, the backdrop is the reforming of the political funding system whereby one would had to be beholden, either at the church gate or, bluntly, more alarmingly at the Galway tent, to people with deep pockets; of course, they were not giving the contributions to influence policy and they were giving it, I am sure, for the best of motivations, but the perception is that if people with deep pockets give very large contributions to political parties or individual politicians, they could be influencing decision-making and policy-making.  That is the reason we moved in the electoral Acts and the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act which we are now amending to bring forward a different support mechanism which, obviously, we have to keep under constant review.<\/p><p>The point I will make in response to Senator Thomas Byrne's point on people leaving and surrendering their allowances is that it does not get away from fixed point decision-making.  In my judgment, it would be very complicated were it to be a moveable feast.  I gave the example of Deputy Willie Penrose in my own party who had left the parliamentary party and then rejoined it.  Are we supposed to constantly adjust for those who are in and out on the basis of having a proper support system and so on for parliamentarians?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800011#L01300","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385640000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800012#M00200","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1385640000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I am uncomfortable with shifting the vote in the people's determination of who should be elected and an individual's decision to move from a party position.

There is also a third element that I should have mentioned; the Bill seeks to broaden the arch of accountability from what now applies to parties to Independent Members also.  There is an anomaly in that there is no accounting for the sums of money given to Independents and the public require such accountability at this time.  That is the nub of what is captured in the Bill, but we have spent 90% of the time dealing with an issue which is not an essential part of it.

I reported the approximate ten shillings a month I got from a sitting tenant in a little flat when I bought my house in North Great Georges Street.  I always try to be scrupulous in these matters.  My concern is the waste of time involved.<\/p><p>The difference between the Independents and the parties is that the parties have structures and ways of accounting that Independents do not.  I find it very difficult to tax my personal assistant, who is brilliant and does an amount of work and overtime.  She is here the minute this place opens and often does not leave until late.  She will also do work at home.  Nobody could pay adequately for the superb assistance I have.  I would feel very bad having to tell her that she must keep dozens of receipts for this, that and the other for six years.  That is a waste of our time.  I do not believe we are supposed to spend time doing that.  We should we treated with respect as parliamentarians.  The best way to do this is to abolish the whole bloody lot of this, decide on a rate for the job and then off we can go and tax everything.<\/p><p>I will withdraw the amendment, but I hope the Minister will consider what I have said.

I am not so much concerned with the amount Senators receive.  I respect the fact these are difficult financial times for taxpayers, the Government and the country.  The maximum allowable expense for Senators is &euro;12,000, compared to &euro;23,000 or &euro;24,000 for Deputies.<\/p> <p>It is probably fair and balanced and I am not proposing any changes which would allow Senators to receive more than they are currently entitled to legally receive.  Will the Minister reflect on the categories of what are determined to be allowable expenses for Seanad purposes, however?<\/p><p>While we have had many discussions on this matter with the Minister and his officials over the past 24 months, last week an anomaly came to my attention which highlights the need for these categories to be changed.  A Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is entitled to an office allowance, a constituency office and other entitlements which Senators do not have.  As part of these allowances, a D&aacute;il Member is entitled to purchase an iPad yet a Senator, who is not entitled to a constituency office, is not allowed the purchase of an iPad as an allowable expense.  When one of my colleagues said this to me last week, I assured her she could not be correct but it turns out that is the rule.<\/p><p>There are 15 categories of allowable expenses for Deputies with only five categories for Senators.  We are not children of a lesser political god but fully fledged Oireachtas Members.  We were also fully approved, unlike the D&aacute;il, in a recent referendum by the people.  As well as being members of various committees, under the Leader, Senator Cummins, we meet as many days as the D&aacute;il does.  We tend to be busier from a parliamentary perspective.  If the records were checked, it would be noted every Member of the Seanad contributes more by way of debate.  I am not sure of the value of our contributions sometimes, but there are more contributions by all Seanad Members on the floor of this House than by D&aacute;il Members in that Chamber.<\/p><p>Will the Minister re-examine the categories of expenses?  I have no difficulty with the fact Senators receive less than half the financial expenses a D&aacute;il Member gets.  An argument could be made that it should be balanced.  Senators receive a maximum &euro;12,000 for vouched expenses.  However, the categories which we can vouch for are extremely limited and narrow.<\/p><p>The party allowance available to Independent Members is important for them for research, training, policy formulation, hiring staff, conducting public opinion polls and purchasing support services.  The Minister should examine the possibility of a single list of fair and reasonable categories to apply under the party leaders&rsquo; allowance, public representation and Independents.  There is the anomaly in the concept that a Senator is not entitled financially to have an office.  The vouched leaders&rsquo; allowance system with the &euro;20,000 available under it allows an Independent Senator to have an office, however.  Senators Crown, Barrett and Norris can open an office if they so wish under this Bill yet the other 57 Members cannot.  That is two Houses within the one House.  It is a good time for the Minister to look upon these anomalies as the Seanad referendum is over.  There was an erroneous, possibly deliberately leaked, silly made-up story that Senators were looking for &euro;4,000 more in expenses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800015#P02100","speaker":"1121","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385641800,"counter":153,"content":"<p>It did not work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800016#Q00200","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1385641800,"counter":154,"content":"<p>Whether it worked or not, it was a falsehood.  We appreciate that we are fortunate, honoured and privileged to be in this House.  By virtue of a salary of &euro;65,000 we are well paid with the entitlement to claim &euro;12,000 per annum in expenses.  That should be payable under fair and achievable categories.  Deputies have a much better salary, entitled to two staff and funded constituency offices compared to us.  It is unfair that Senators should only have five allowable categories under which they claim expenses while Deputies have 15.  Allowable expenses under the parliamentary allowance include general administration, technical or specialist advice, research and training, policy formulation, the purchase of support services, payment to another person arising from activities in a parliamentary party and such other matters as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Minister.  I hope the Minister will accept my view.<\/p><p>At a time when the country is still a long way from being as well off as we would wish it to be, we cannot look for extra moneys or expenses.  My amendments are simply asking that the moneys we are entitled to claim can be used most effectively for political purposes.  For public representatives to employ people to do opinion polls or other political activity is good for the body politic.  The Minister earlier claimed his party&rsquo;s first cousin, the British Labour Party, brought in the idea of paying politicians so politics would not be a wealthy person&rsquo;s club.  We must aspire to ensure that every politician uses his or her talents and supports for the country&rsquo;s best.  These moneys should be used for good political purposes.  We are all on a vouched system with no one receiving improper moneys.  However, we need to be realistic about the categories.  Why can they not be extended to all Oireachtas Members?<\/p> <p>Now that the leaders' allowance for independent Deputies and Senators is becoming vouched, those independent Deputies and Senators will be operating on a different stream from us in this House because they are legally entitled to have an office and staff, and we are not.<\/p><p>The Minister is thinking about this on an ongoing basis.  I appeal to him to re-engage with our political leaders in this House.  We are all coming from a starting position of respect for the fortunate position we are in, acknowledging the fact that our salary is good and that until times get much better our salaries and allowances cannot and should not increase.  However, the payment of that allowance should be under a fair system of categories and there should not be this dramatically disadvantaged position for a Senator versus a Deputy.  Why can a Deputy claim expenses under 15 different, admittedly vouchable, categories while a Senator has only five such categories?  Why can my colleague in the D&aacute;il use his or her money from the taxpayer to purchase an iPad and other computer equipment while I cannot?  I find that very difficult to understand.  It is among the anomalies that must be reflected upon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800016#Q00300","speaker":"1121","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385642400,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I second the motion.  It is important that the Minister examine broadening the range of categories that qualify for Senators to claim within the &euro;12,000 cap.  There is no request for any extra money.  It is just a request to broaden the categories for which Senators may claim.  I will give some examples.  I am based in Galway and have one assistant, supplied by two people who job share.  Under working rules it is my duty to provide a place of work for my assistant.  I provide an office attached to my home, with light, heat and a land line as the mobile coverage is very poor.  That office space cannot be claimed for within the allowance for Senators.  That is fundamentally unfair.  It is a cost for Senators in this position.  I ask that a credit be allowed for the use of an office space, be it attached to one's home or elsewhere, within the &euro;12,000 allowance, nothing extra.<\/p><p>Theoretically, we are told, the Senator's constituency is the country.  Constituency travel is allowed for Deputies within their D&aacute;il constituency, which is a much smaller geographical area, but not for Senators.  I strongly support what Senator Bradford said about the unlevel playing field that will exist for Senators.  The Senators who came in on day one as Independent Senators are allowed to claim a leader's allowance and now, because that must be vouched and justified, they can feasibly fund an office and an assistant.  The Minister will speak to that.  We need to ensure a level playing field across the House.  We have spent three weeks speaking to the Minister about the unlevel playing field addressed in our previous amendment.<\/p><p>I have been a member of the Oireachtas committee on education.  Last year a decision was made that six members of the committee would go to Finland to study the Finnish education system.  Members will know it has got much acclaim for being the best education system in the world.  The outcomes, Programme for International Student Assessment, PISA, reports and OECD studies show that.  Seven members wanted to go.  I was unlucky and was not one of the members drawn out of the hat but decided I was willing to pay to join the group to get access to all those important meetings and learning opportunities.  I wanted to be a better parliamentarian, return here and share my knowledge and maybe bring forward a Bill or policies to enhance the education system, something to which I am committed all my life.  I went to the one stop shop and found that if I paid for it myself I could not get credit for it under the current system.  I was not seeking the money back, but wanted to know if I could use that within the &euro;12,000 party allowance.<\/p><p>We are cutting off our nose to spite our face.  When it is to do with our work, something that is good for parliamentarians can be good for the State.  While any conference fee would have been allowable, the travel and subsistence costs would not.  I am very careful to state that we do not seek any more money than the &euro;12,000 already allowable but ask that the Minister come up with a single list for all parliamentarians in both Houses that would offer fair and achievable categories and, in our case, broaden the range of categories so we can have a bit of decency in doing our work.<\/p><p>How can I possibly run a home office and have an assistant who has no place of work?  She must have a place to work from.  She does not wish to work from Dublin.  She is based in Galway, wishes to work there and I am glad to have her.  I will be happy to hear the Minister's responses but above all that he would take time in the coming weeks and months to reflect on our request.  I have heard through the grapevine that the Minister is very open to our arguments about examining a credit within the &euro;12,000 allowance for an office based around one's home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800017#R00200","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1385642400,"counter":157,"content":"<p>The Members make their point well.  We have raised this with the Minister on a number of occasions.  The guidelines for Senators are extremely restrictive compared with those in the D&aacute;il.  In some instances there are genuine reasons for that but in others, such as the purchase of an iPad, Members of the other House can claim from their allowances but Members of this House cannot.  Members of this House have their office space, the same as everybody else, or they can rent a room for clinics on a Monday or Friday, but we are told we cannot even mention clinics if we are claiming for a room.

We all know the Minister inherited this issue and it has been going on for decades.  We all know the reality is Deputies do not want Senators functioning to their full capacity.  They think if Senators are to function to their full capacity they can bloody well pay for it themselves and they will not facilitate them in carrying out their constitutional duties as Members of the Oireachtas.  Along with the other Whips in the House I put my signature to a letter calling on the Minister to rectify this situation.<\/p><p>While I accept, as Senator Healy Eames stated, the Minister is minded to resolve the difficulty, he is being prevented by doing so by somebody.  I can only imagine if I were fortunate enough to be in his position and I was minded to do something which was legally possible I would do it.  Since becoming a Member of the House I have been amazed by Ministers, primarily from my party, stating he or she would like to do something and to leave it with them but one never hears from them again.  If they would like to do it they should go and do it unless it is against the law.  If there is a difficulty in doing this the Minister should tell us what it is, and that we will not get it because he does not want to give it to us.  It is akin to being a member of a swimming pool with 166 or 168 members able to dive in at the deep end and swim to the other end without any difficulty while 60 members, who are told they are equal members, have an arm tied behind their back and a weight on one of their legs.<\/p><p>On 4 October the people of the country, against the wishes of the Minister and his colleagues, decided the House was to remain.

Others have reflected on the fact the referendum campaign and the poll on 4 October, the famous day in the life of the Seanad, has given democracy and the Seanad a mandate.

This is a very complex area.  Current legislation allows officials of my Department, including appeals officers, to revise earlier decisions in a range of circumstances.  This includes situations in which new evidence is produced which indicated that the original decision was wrong, and situations in which there has been a change of circumstances since the original decision was given.  These powers are wide-ranging and give considerable flexibility to deciding officers and appeals officers to deal with new evidence or changed circumstances which have been brought to their notice.  In the past and at present, this flexibility has been seen as an asset in allowing deciding officers and appeals officers to deal with different circumstances.  Many Senators will be familiar with this.  However, in light of the recent High Court ruling the provisions relating to a change of circumstances are now considered problematic, as they unintentionally remove finality from social welfare determinations that refuse claims and introduce considerable uncertainty into the system of social welfare decision making as a consequence.<\/p><p>Until now, in most cases, it has been the practice in the Department that once a claim is refused and all review and appeal processes are finalised, if the customer seeks a revised decision based on a change of circumstances, he or she is advised to make a fresh application.  The new claim is then fully assessed in light of all the circumstances of the case.  Due to the recent High Court decision, the Department can no longer require people to make a fresh claim but must reopen a claim, even if that claim was closed many years previously.  The purpose of the amendment is to address this issue, but in a limited range of circumstances.  I stress that in cases in which the original decision was wrong, or if new facts and evidence emerge, the customer will still be able to seek a revised decision.  The amendment does not change this.  For a claim that is in payment, it will still be possible to revise the decision if circumstances change, but where a person was refused a social welfare payment in the past and his or her circumstances change, the correct channel is to make a fresh application so the application can be fully considered in light of the current circumstances.  The amendment aims to ensure that this will be the practice in all cases.<\/p><p>Let me add that in the aftermath of the High Court decision I have asked officials of the Department to carry out a more wide-ranging review of the legislation on social welfare decisions.  I will bring forward any necessary legislation at a later date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800019#T01700","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385644200,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I broadly welcome this amendment because other Senators and I have been dealing with people who have had to reapply on several occasions until their application is successful.  The paperwork is immense.  Are we safeguarding the social welfare system by putting in place a stipulation on how far back one can go?  Once an application is reviewed and found to be successful, the payment is backdated to the date of application.  If the initial application was made five years ago, will the ramifications be that the Department will have to pay significant arrears from the date of the initial application some five years previously?  Are we safeguarding ourselves by saying that the claim will be backdated to the date the Department was notified of the change of circumstances rather than to the date of application?  Are we allowed to do that following the High Court ruling?  Will the Minister clarify the position?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800020#U00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1385644200,"counter":205,"content":"<p>As the legislation stands, if a deciding officer or an appeals officer revises an earlier decision, he or she has considerable flexibility regarding the date from which the revised decision takes effect.  Apart from a small number of situations, such as cases in which a person knowingly makes a false statement or withholds relevant information or cases in which a payment is reduced due to a revised decision, the legislation provides that the revised decision will take effect from the date considered appropriate by the deciding officer, having regard to the circumstances of the case.  This gives us, as I said, considerable flexibility to award a decision from any appropriate date.  If there is a change in circumstance, the date of the revised decision will depend on the individual case, and it is not limited in the legislation.  However, in the case of a person who makes a claim for the first time, there are fixed time limits with regard to how far a claim can be backdated.  These vary according to the particular payment - for example, a person in general would be expected to apply for a jobseeker's payment immediately and payment would not normally be backdated to before the date of the claim, but some other payments, such as contributory State pensions, can be backdated for up to six months.<\/p><p>The amendments we are discussing today will have the effect of bringing more cases into the new claims category rather than the category of revision of an earlier decision.  These amendments will give greater protection against the possibility of arrears being awarded against the State in some cases.  I want to reiterate that if the original decision was found to be erroneous then a backdated decision is still possible.

The process is generally managed through dialogue between the three principal parties - the trustees who operate in a fiduciary capacity under trust law; the employers who sponsor the scheme; and the members who are the employees who might, in many cases, be represented by their trade unions.  Efforts are made to reach agreement on the steps that must be taken to secure scheme viability, which may include a mix of measures such as increased employer-member contributions, longer working and amended benefits.  There have been a lot of such instances of restructurings in recent years.<\/p><p>It should be noted that pensioners, current and former members of pension schemes are collectively protected by a broad and detailed range of measures to safeguard their interests.  First, the trustees of defined benefit pension schemes have a fiduciary duty under trust law and the Pensions Acts to act in the best interests of all scheme members.  There are further regulatory safeguards and oversight by the Pensions Board.  Scheme trustees must apply to the Pensions Board before they can reduce benefits.  It is very important that people are aware of this fact.  Before trustees make an application to the Pensions Board they must consult the employer, scheme members, pensioners and the authorised trade unions representing scheme members.  Trustees must also have undertaken a comprehensive review of the scheme with a view to long-term stability and sustainability.  They must have requested from the employer contributions sufficient to ensure the long-term stability and sustainability of the scheme.  They are required to have taken legal advice on their powers and duties and the obligations of the employer to contribute to the scheme.<\/p><p>During the deliberative process consideration was given to placing a statutory obligation on the employer to provide for a base level of scheme funding that would secure a certain level of benefits in the event of a scheme winding-up or restructuring.  The advantage of placing such a obligation on the employer would be to reduce further the possible risk to the State and protect the benefits of current and former scheme members.  It would also prevent the employers from walking away from defined benefit schemes and encourage them to ensure a scheme was well funded and managed.  However, there are strong arguments against the introduction of such an obligation on employers owing to uncertainty about the overall impact, particularly in the context of the current economic environment.  Given current economic circumstances, the imposition of additional costs on employers might be counterproductive and impact on the viability of a business and the jobs of those employed.  This is one of the issues in current circumstances that is particularly difficult.  An obligation, or the perception that there is an obligation, could rank with company debt.  It could have an impact on investment and growth and the employer's ability to raise fresh funds in the market.  It would also give a competitive advantage to those employers who have never provided a pension scheme for their employees.  My fear is that it would encourage employers to close their schemes.  It would also be a complex measure to provide for and administer as employers could take avoidance measures.  The measures would also need to be viewed in the context of a declining number of defined benefit schemes.<\/p><p>Given the complexity of the issues involved, the number of unknowns regarding their impact and the time constraints, it is not proposed to proceed with the measure.  The overriding priority is to ensure pensioners and members of pension schemes are protected and that the future viability and sustainability of their schemes are ensured and made safer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800020#U02900","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385644800,"counter":229,"content":"<p>The purpose of the legislation is to protect pensions and pensioners and counter the possibility of a scheme being allowed to close, with no minimum percentage reached.

I was in a meeting with someone when I noticed that amendments Nos. 9 and 18, in which I was interested, were being discussed and rushed ihere.<\/p><p>  The Minister will recall that on the last day she attended I mentioned the EMI pension scheme.  I had been approached by a number of its members.  Obviously the Bill will be of advantage to those who receive pensions to some degree, but it will also be of advantage to persons who are still in employment and will leave in a few years time.  I understand the thinking behind the provision.  EMI was owned by the investment company, Terra Firma.  Owing to leveraging, the Citigroup foreclosed on the loans, took control of the company and sold it to an American company for a few billion dollars.  When Citigroup dealt with the matter in Britain in order to achieve a sale, it had a hole to fill in the pension fund.  EMI has operated in Ireland for between 40 and 50 years and in the early days there was one pension fund.  Later the company was split, which meant that there were separate companies under the same parent company and the pension fund was split.  My information is that in Britain EMI was required to meet the fund deficit and I understand it put &pound;200 million into it to enable it to sell the company.  There was no such requirement for it to do the same here and it chose not to do so.  The Irish employees were seriously disadvantaged <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> their British counterparts.  There is a great disparity between British and Irish pension laws.  I raised the matter with the Pensions Board, but I got no comfort from talking to it.  As a consequence, the matter needs to be addressed, which is why I was so critical of the legislation on Second Stage.  There are lots of issues with pension schemes and unless we tackle and address the loopholes in a manner that will encourage and incentivises people to provide for their own pensions, our policies will be counter intuitive and we are being counter intuitive, given the fiscal policies the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Finance, has pursued by taxing pension funds and, in particular, the imputed distribution arrangements that apply to private pension funds.  Obviously, some private pension funds are shipping a lot of losses and will not yield large pensions.  We are now saying to the people affected that they must take out a figure of 5% per annum.  Originally when the provision was introduced, the rate was 3%, but then it was increased to 5% and, in the case of a pension fund worth over &euro;2 million, 6%.  I do not object to a rate of 6% because &euro;2 million in a pension pot is a substantial amount of money.  However, there are people with much smaller pots to which no imputed distribution arrangement should apply.  <\/p><p>  I know that taxation is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance, but I have raised this matter because I want to draw attention to the fact that there is a ream of pension issues that need to be addressed.<\/p> <p>I was surprised, perhaps I should have known, having spoken to the pensions board, that it appears to have no interest or no remit to deal with companies who are closing down their pension schemes, in particular, defined pension schemes.  I cannot understand the reason the legislation will adversely affect many people who have invested in private pensions and who are in receipt of private pensions but at the same time does not do anything to focus on the employers.  I have argued in the House many times that wages and salaries across all of Irish society, particularly in the public service, are much too high and are 22% or 23% higher in the private sector.  There is no justification for that.  I am one of those who receives a public service salary.<\/p><p> It is also the case that our pension entitlements supersede anything that, other than a small coterie, of people at the top in the private sector would enjoy.  There is a need to look at that issue.  It is the same in the private sector where wages are too high.  We should be aiming to maximise the number of people in the private sector who are entitled to a pension.  There is a huge fiscal challenge coming to us in the future with our public service pensions and our State pension.  It has been estimated that if an actuarial valuation of the public service pension was undertaken there is probably a shortfall in it.  The last figure I saw was one of about &euro;120 billion to &euro;130 billion.  These are significant issues which need to be addressed.  I hold the view - this is a change of opinion from five, six or seven years ago - that, perhaps, all defined benefits should be looked at with a view to changing them, including public service pensions, to a defined contribution scheme.  I remember ten, 15 or 20 years ago, in the 1990s, looking at pension entitlement in the US.  The US introduced what I think was called &quot;mutual funds&quot; or something similar, under which individuals made a contribution to a pension which grew.  I remember speaking to people in the US who said that they had created within that fund a level of wealth they had never dreamed of being able to do.  It is right to give the taxation provision for it.  In this way people should know on an annual basis the amount in the fund and the growth in the fund.  There should be no disadvantage by way of imposing levies on the fund.  It should be allowed to grow.  People will pay the full amount of tax on it when it is due - that is really the third tax on the fund.  If we can do that, perhaps, in 2030, 2040 or 2050 when the demographics change dramatically, those retiring will have sufficient funds to live their life in a reasonable degree of comfort.  I would like to see that proposal examined.  <\/p><p> The amendments focus specifically on a situation where we allow trustees, because the company decides, as many profitable companies do, not to make any more contributions.  There is no doubt that many companies have gone to the wall as a consequence of this unprecedented recession but there are also many companies who have taken advantage of the economic downturn in order to suppress wages and entitlements.  I am strongly in favour of the private sector, as that is what drives the economy.  However, there must be equity, fairness and ethical policies in the private sector and it is up to the State to ensure that is case.  <\/p><p> We must ensure that companies fulfil their commitments to employees.  It would be in employees' interests and in the State's interest if we were to seek to benchmark all salaries in the public sector and the private sector, which should have happened at the time of benchmarking, with those of other western European countries, that is, the countries with which we are competing.  An analysis I did in 2008, based on research conducted by the university of Glasgow, showed that wages and salaries in Ireland were significantly higher than in any other country.  I suspect wages and salaries are still higher here but if we are to be competitive we must bring pay rates to the average of those countries.  In doing that the <i>quid pro quo<\/i>must be that people who are now much more likely to enjoy a longer retirement will be properly supported.  The State pension will not achieve that. <\/p><p> Amendment No. 9 seeks that the sponsoring companies should not be allowed to close the scheme without ensuring the scheme has reached a minimum 90% funding standard.  As I said on Second Stage, I think the OECD has recommended that.  I ask the Minister to look favourably on this amendment because it is essential that we do more than is provided for in the Bill.  I acknowledged on Second Stage, even though I have been critical, that what the Minister has done is a step in the right direction but there are too many other steps that have not been taken and that is where my criticism lies.  <\/p><p> Amendment No. 18 seeks that the pensions board would not have the entitlement to direct the trustees of a pension scheme to reduce the benefits of current or former scheme members and-or post-retirement increases where a sponsoring company or its parent company have the financial capacity to meet the under-funding in the scheme.  It is important to make the distinction that sometimes the sponsoring company may be borderline viability but its parent company can be well positioned to meet the funding deficit.  Where a sponsoring company applies to close a scheme it should be required to provide the financial information necessary for the pensions board to assess whether it, the sponsoring company, or its parent company have the financial capacity to deal with the shortfall and should not be allowed to close the scheme.  That they are not prepared to do so should not be a factor.  There is a real need to protect pensions in this regard. <\/p><p> As I said on Second Stage, the Bill is about robbing Peter to pay Paul.  It is seeking to take money from current pensioners to assist employees who have paid their contributions and who, perhaps, within a short number of years may seek to access the pension to which they have contributed.  It also seeks to take money from those who have worked hard all their lives to provide a pension for themselves - that is a small percentage in the private sector.  That is fundamentally wrong.  If, on the other hand, employers, for whom all these people worked, are highly profitable have very good reserves and are not prepared to make their contribution to fixing this particular issue, that is fundamentally unfair.  We should aim to be just, fair and ensure that those most in need are catered for.  If the Minister does not accept the amendments now I implore her, between now and Report Stage, to examine what can be done.  I would be very surprised if the concept and the principles I am proposing do not find favour with her thinking and analysis in this regard. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800021#V00300","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385645400,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I apologise to the Minister for not having been in the House earlier and I am afraid I will have to leave but I will read her response.  I know she will understand the situation because she is in a much more extreme situation than me.  I am trying to juggle about nine things at the same time and I can only imagine what her life is like.<\/p><p>I wish to endorse a great deal of what my colleague, Senator Jim Walsh, has said.  I listened to him with great interest.  I am not as much of a fan of private enterprise as he is: I would be a little more to the left, which may or may not recommend itself to the Minister.  I have particular concerns with regard to the fact that even after the Bill is enacted, companies can walk away from certain of their obligations.  This is very regrettable.  I know there are difficult situations and I know certain firms are in periods of tumult financially and may be going under and so on but it is indefensible that a company that is solvent, trading and making profits, should be allowed to deny previously made pension profits.  In particular, I refer to the case of Aer Lingus which denies that it has any responsibility to meet some of its pension promises.<\/p> <p>The retirees now have no access to the Labour Court or anywhere else and there is very little they can do.  If inflation takes off again, there is no provision for any mechanism for increase.  Therefore, the affected people are left stranded.<\/p><p> This part of my contribution is taken very largely from the substance of a letter I received just this morning.  It puts a human face on the matter.  The writer states Aer Lingus has a very good balance sheet, is solvent and has cash in hand.  Furthermore, he states:<blockquote> I can't stack this up at all with any sort of notion of &quot;fairness&quot;.<br \/><br \/> I did declare my interest - I am a pensioner member of that Scheme, and, Senator, I am worried.  I saved and provided responsibly for my retirement and made a &quot;life plan&quot; accordingly.  My &quot;life plan&quot; is in tatters.  <br \/><br \/> I regret I was prudent.  I should have had a ball and left it to the State to provide for me in my dotage.  A place in a 12-bed geriatric ward seems to be what I can look forward to now - maybe a corner bed near a window if I'm lucky!<\/blockquote>That seems to me to indicate that values that are important to this country, such as prudence and making provision for old age, are being undermined.<\/p><p> Consider the circumstances of employees in the airline industry under the <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">IASS proposals.  <\/font>With regard to Aer Lingus, the scheme is frozen and no additional funds will be paid into it.  Outside the IASS, the current funds placed by Aer Lingus of &euro;140 million are being allocated as follows: 2,570 current employees will share in a fund of &euro;110 million, or approximately &euro;92 million after productivity pledged on foot of cost stabilisation, but there are 3,687 - over 1,000 more - deferred pensioners who will share a fund of simply &euro;30 million.<\/p><p> With regard to the proposed cuts, including the removal of statutory preservation, CPI,  and a period of deferment, as provided for in the Pensions Act, this could equate to a 25% loss of real pension every ten years.  There is to be an increase in the IASS pension age of 65 years to a State pension age of 66 from 2014, 67 from 2021 and 68 from 2028, except where there is more than 25 years service.  Reference is made to a 12% straight cut and compulsory commutation of 25% of pensions.<\/p><p> The Minister will remember I spoke about deferred pension members on the last occasion.  With regard to the combination of the aforesaid cuts, I must refer to the paper I have to hand.  I try not to read.  I am all right with words but when I get to numbers, I find the difference between 5 million and 500 million difficult to contemplate.  My innumeracy is almost entirely due to some kind of genetic inadequacy or something.  It means I do not really follow numbers so it is better if I read them from the document.  I apologise to the House for doing so.<\/p><p> For deferred members, the combination of all the above cuts will equate to a loss of between 45% and 55% in their expected benefit.  That is a hell of a lot.  If one averages the figures, it amounts to half the expected pension.  This makes the point that the gentleman made in his letter to me.  The expected pension of a 55-year old individual who left in 2005 with 25 years' service and a final retiring salary of &euro;40,655 will reduce from &euro;23,608 to &euro;9,925.  That is a loss of 57.95%, which is vast.  I wonder whether the Minister and her advisers will be able to state whether the figure is correct.  Consider another listed example concerning an individual who left the workplace in 1998 with 27 years service on a final retiring salary of &euro;34,523 and who is now aged 62.9 years.  One can tell from this and the inclusion of percentage points that there has been an actuary involved who has calculated the worst possible case, but it is no harm to make that case.  The expected pension for the individual will be reduced from &euro;23,105 to &euro;12,043.  That is the minimum State pension and it represents a loss of 47.8%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800022#W00200","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385646000,"counter":234,"content":"<p>It is inaccurate, I think.

Senator Mooney referred to Waterford Glass.  I understand the thinking behind the two amendments but one should bear in mind the position of Waterford Glass and what ultimately triggered the problems aside from the difficult trading results and trading conditions.  The point at issue for the Government in the late 2000s was its guarantee and a request from the company of a bond of &euro;40 million.  That was not forthcoming and one of my predecessors, possibly Mary Hanafin, spoke about why it was inappropriate.  It was a general bond; it was not specifically related to the pension fund and concerned the company's borrowings.  It was finding it difficult to renew it.  One of the problems is that we have been in a period of unprecedented difficulty.  What one wants to try to do is to have maximum protection for the maximum number of defined benefit schemes and the maximum number of parties to such schemes.  I include the pensioners, the already retired, those who have deferred their pensions and will not reach pension age for some time and the active members who are coming in.  We spoke on the last occasion about the contrast between somebody who is 66 and on a pension and somebody who, at 62 or 63, is almost at pension age.  Currently, without this legislation, the 66 year old could be quite highly protected and the person who is not yet at pension age could lose everything.  The legislation seeks to offer protection in this case.<\/p><p>We examined the issue of employer risk extensively.  What one opts for involves a balanced decision.  In the Irish circumstances, however, one should bear in mind that we are just emerging from a unprecedented, difficult period.  The history of pension funds shows that the major problem in Ireland has primarily been the promise made by good employers.  Most employers establishing pension schemes intend to fulfil their promises.  It is important to recognise and acknowledge that.  Those employers are as distressed as many of the members of the schemes over the fact that the schemes have got into difficulty.  The most difficult issue employers faced was the change in life expectancy, which has an effect on the period over which one can benefit from a scheme.  I refer in particular to older schemes.  When these schemes were set up, life expectancy after pension age was a fraction of what it has become.  This means the original promise, perhaps based on an expected life expectancy of 15 years after reaching pension age, is harder to honour as the period for which one lives after reaching pension age has almost doubled.  Therefore, it is almost inevitable that a scheme will be under-funded unless both the members and employer find a way of contributing or changing the promise to reflect the changes in the financial circumstances of the employer.<\/p> <p> I agree with Senator Jim Walsh that mutuals in America have much to offer.  The route for us, as I stated on the last occasion, is to look, as we have done - we have asked the OECD to comment on it - at the development of a further contributory pension aimed at those on low and middle incomes, either on a mandatory or - this may be more attractive in an Irish context - an auto-enrolment basis, the OECD's first and second preferences, respectively.  We should try to move in that direction, sooner rather than later, particularly for the current generation of new workers coming through who, in many cases, will be relying on the State pension only.  As Senator Jim Walsh stated, the advantage in the case of mutuals is that they could then join in a general fund, whereas the Senator and I, or other individuals, particularly somebody in his or her 20s, are trying to make decisions about in what exactly one invests in a defined contribution scheme as an individual, which is a fairly tough call.  It is a fairly tough call for young people in their 20s and 30s and practically everybody else, unless one has considerable financial acumen as compared, as the Senator said, with the advantage enjoyed by the mutual.  That is one point.  That is not included in the Bill, but it is something I certainly hope to advance.  The OECD's recommendation in the report published in April is positive in that context.  The issue is whether an obligation, if we were to place it on the employer, would make more employers want to walk away and whether it would disadvantage the good employer who had made pension provision and was committed to it, as opposed to the employer who had never made any provision?  As I stated, pension schemes are based on trust law.  They are based on the employer's promise, but if the employer's financial position is precarious, putting an additional obligation on him or her might make what is already precarious far worse.  That really is the fine balance one must manage.<\/p><p>In the United States and the United Kingdom, far bigger economies than this one, owing to the population to be covered, the risk can be spread, whereas here, because the population is so small, it is much more difficult to spread the risk among a much wider population of employers.  We do not have the capacity to the same extent as they do in the United States and the United Kingdom.  In the long run, in 30 or 40 years time, one might say the way to do it would be to have some level of risk coverage in the European Union or like-minded countries in it.  Seeing that we are still sorting out the issues of the ECB and the euro, that matter is a long way down the road.  For that reason, I am not inclined to accept what is a thoughtful amendment, one which has been debated and discussed.  On balance, it would not be appropriate to place an obligation on the employer, the administration of which might be difficult and advantageous to employers which did not have pension obligations and relied only on the State pension.<\/p><p>On Senator David Norris's point, I would like to see the paper from which he has read as I did not catch all of the figures.  He mentioned the value of pensions falling below &euro;12,000.  The purpose of the Bill is to protect pensioners up to a figure of &euro;12,000.  Much has been much written about this.  There are those in the pensions sector who have advocated a protection level of &euro;6,000; perhaps some of the examples might be based on that figure, I simply do not know.  In the Bill we are addressing a protection level of &euro;12,000.  As I stated, if there is a protection level of &euro;12,000 and if, as in the case of defined benefit schemes, the majority also have access to the State contributory pension, one is talking about a further &euro;12,000, bringing the total of &euro;24,000.  I will certainly take the figures the Senator has put forward and ask the staff of the Department to have a look at them.<\/p><p>For the reasons I have set out, I do not propose to accept the amendments, although I understand the spirit behind them.  It really is a finely drawn decision.  The real difficulty is the position the economy is in.  It would be risky to place an additional significant burden on employers and it might result in more schemes than the Senators might have anticipated deciding to close.  What we want to do is keep as many schemes as possible open and to get them to a better place, even if that means restructuring and amending the promises made in order to conserve the maximum pension for pensioners, current active members and retired members.  I would also be wary because of the financial position of placing additional burdens on the balance sheets of employers, some of whom, although it is improving, are still in a precarious position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800023#X00600","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385646600,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive response to the amendments which they warranted.<\/p><p>To deal with the obligation on employers first, the requirement is that it would only apply to companies which had the financial capacity to deal with the shortfall and deficit, around which one would have to develop a model.  I am not talking about companies which are on the cusp of viability or marginally profitable with few reserves.  One does not want to affect employment in these companies.  I share the Minister's concern that anything we do must not drive employers out of the scene.  I am referring to the many companies which are very profitable, have good reserves and could make a contribution to meet the deficit in a situation where it would have no adverse effects on their viability, although it might have an impact in the short term on the distribution of dividends or shareholders' funds.<\/p><p>When I was in business, I attended seminars at which people talked about the stakeholders in a business and shareholders ranked highly because they were the ones who had invested their money.  However, there are other stakeholders who equally need to be considered.  Among them, one of the priority groups would be the employees who, in many instances, give their lives' work to a company.  There are also a company's suppliers and customers, all of whom must be taken into account because one does not have a viable business without customers.  All stakeholders must be considered in the running of the business and the decisions taken by management and the board.  In this instance, the legislation is coming down heavily on one stakeholder group - the employees.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to look at the amendments and the manner in which we are putting them forward to see whether something could be done in companies that have cash flow, as that would remove the risk.  The Minister would have to develop a model of thresholds above which the reserves and profit levels would have to be maintained, but that could be worked out economically and from an accounting point of view.  It might take a little work by officials in the Department and the Pensions Board, but it would not be impossible to develop such a model.  It would carry no risk for such employers.  Like the Minister, I applaud those employers with private pension funds.<\/p> <p>When I was the chief executive of a company many years ago, I always resisted granting unnecessary wage increases.   This was because they posed a risk to jobs, particularly in the competitive arena in which the business was operating.  I recall trying to encourage the employees in the company, particularly the general operatives, to focus on establishing a pension scheme.  Many companies have pension schemes for administrative and clerical staff but such schemes do not always apply to general operatives and other non-skilled and semi-skilled employees.  I recall persuading the union involved that it should have been pursuing the setting up of a pension scheme rather than pay increases.  A scheme was eventually put in place.  I was glad, some time later, that when private insurance companies tried to encourage the employees at the company to join their pension schemes, these companies actually informed them that they were very fortunate to have access to the type of scheme we had put in place and that it was one of the better ones.<\/p><p>I fully agree with the Minister's assertion that we do not want to frighten companies of this type away.  There are many companies which do not have pension schemes which should have them.  I request that the Minister reconsider the position on this matter.  I discussed with Senator Paschal Mooney, my party's spokesperson on social welfare in the Seanad, the question of what we should do in respect of this matter and we decided that we should probably withdraw the amendment with leave to re-enter it on Report Stage.  I genuinely hope that in the interim the Minister will give genuine consideration to whether there is any way we can facilitate what, I am sure she will agree, is a good aspiration without incurring a risk.<\/p><p>Will the Minister examine the general matter I raised in respect of EMI?  I understand legislation in place in Britain obliged EMI to fill the deficit in its pension fund.  As a consequence, those employees now have access to a fully paid up scheme and will be able to enjoy the pensions to which they have been making contributions.  However, their colleagues in Ireland who have worked for the company for as long, if not longer, have been placed at a complete disadvantage.  What happened in this instance seems to highlight a deficiency in our laws.  Will the Minister see if she can identify whether the latter is actually the case and, if so, consider what action she might be able to take?<\/p><p>I feel strongly about another matter, in respect of which we have not tabled an amendment but which certainly should be considered in the context of the Bill.  There is nothing to prevent the Minister from drafting an amendment on it.  I refer to the issue of annuities.  I am a member of a defined benefit scheme and at one point the annuity relating to it stood at 3%.  In other words, if one had &euro;100,000 in the scheme, one would get back &euro;3,000 per year.  I worked out at the time that it would take 25 or 30 years to recoup on the basis of the annuity the capital sum which the insurance company was going to get from day one.  As a result, one would have to live well into ones 90s in order to recoup all of one's money.  I think the annuity has increased and currently stands at 4% or 5%.  There should be no requirement on individuals, be they members of defined pension or defined contribution schemes, to go the route of annuity.  I understand, however, that they must do so under the law.  That is wrong because it creates a windfall profit scenario for insurance companies.  We should allow everyone to convert his or her pension entitlements into ARFs or AMRFs.  If we were to do so, people would have the benefit of having their own pension pots and would be able to garner the proceeds from their investments in this regard.  There is a need for regulation in this area.  No one should be required to go the annuity route, regardless of his or her position.  My information may be a few years out of date, but I recall that one was obliged to have more than 5% of the shareholding in a company in order to be able to convert one's entitlements.  If one was under the figure of 5%, one was obliged to go the annuity route.  I ask that the Minister give consideration to this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800024#Y00200","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385647200,"counter":242,"content":"<p>As stated, since I became Minister the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, has created a sovereign annuity on the basis of which a number of insurance companies have developed products.  It is quite interesting that the NTMA has indicated a continuous demand, with a financial value amount to &euro;1.377 billion, for the amortising bonds used to underwrite sovereign annuities.  The data from the industry indicate that the figure for total bulk sales for sovereign and conventional annuities to the end of quarter three of 2013 is three times that achieved in the 12 months of 2012.  As the Senator is aware, if one transfers one's pension entitlements to an annuity, one will, as it were, be out of the fund and, generally, receiving a fixed income for the remainder of one's life.  Obviously, how much one benefits depends on how long one lives.  The difficulty for us is that the annuities were based on German sovereign bond rates which, in the context of the economic crash, became stratospheric in terms of cost.  Essentially, people were paying to hold German bonds but were receiving hardly any interest in return.<\/p><p>When the NTMA issued its product, the rates were much more attractive, hence the level of take-up.  In the current year sovereign annuity sales account for 75% of all annuity sales for defined benefit schemes.  In monetary value, some &euro;400 million of the &euro;540 million in bulk annuity sales to the end of quarter three of this year was accounted for by sovereign annuities.  These annuities were initially launched in 2012 and the trustees have tended towards the purchase of hybrid or basket products.  Such products involved a mix of a conventional annuity for a portion of the pension and a sovereign annuity above a certain amount.  However, it is generally full sovereign annuities which are being purchased.  Information from the three providers currently in the market - Irish Life, Zurich Life and New Ireland - indicates that some 1,500 pensioners have received sovereign annuities to date.  When the comparable cost of traditional annuities is taken into consideration, it is estimated that schemes have saved &euro;70 million.  Again, all of this is in the context of the financial crisis, what has happened to sovereign bonds and the comparison between the cost of Ireland's sovereign bonds and those of Germany.  The German bond price tends to be the one which people take as the benchmark.<\/p><p>I will certainly obtain further information on the position with regard to EMI and return to the matter at a later date, perhaps even briefly on Report Stage.  Senators Maurice Cummins and Marie Moloney asked a number of important questions about Waterford Glass.  Again, I propose to come back to the House with information on exactly where matters stand in that regard at a later date.

It seems that for the vast majority of people, placing their pension pot on deposit would deliver greater value, even if at the current low interest rates, than having it invested and administered by a pensions company.

The standard advice is that as people get older, the value of certainty and lower risk increases.  The median pension amount is approximately &euro;11,000 per annum, which is not a high figure.  The funds are, therefore, not large, and the conventional advice, which I suspect is correct, is to move closer to cash or its equivalent.  One of the current difficulties, however, is that interest rates are extremely low.  While low interest rates are good for the investing side of business, they are difficult for savers and pensioners.  As the organisations which lobby on behalf of pensioners correctly remind us, pensioners are on fixed incomes.  If the fixed income is interest-based and one is purchasing an interest-based product, it is difficult to obtain an appropriate return.  The interest rates available from the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve in the United States are close to zero.  I wish the ECB would take greater cognisance of the fact that inflation is not an issue.  The annuity approach may be safer, even if the returns can be unsatisfactory, as choosing the investment route for a small fund could have high risks attached.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800026#AA00200","speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1385647800,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\nSECTION 5<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1385647800,"counter":250,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 11, a Government amendment, has been discussed with amendment No. 1.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800026#AA00400","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1385647800,"counter":251,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 11:\r\nIn page 4, line 10, to delete &ldquo;Principal Act&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Act of 1990&rdquo;.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1385647800,"counter":252,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1385647800,"counter":253,"content":"<p>Amendments No. 12 and 13 are out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800026#AA00700","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1385647800,"counter":254,"content":"<p>On a point of order, why has amendment No. 12 been ruled out of order?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800026#AA00800","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1385647800,"counter":255,"content":"<p>It creates a potential charge on the Revenue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800026#AA00900","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1385647800,"counter":256,"content":"<p>As a former member of the Opposition, the Cathaoirleach will be aware that Opposition Members read legislation and make various suggestions to improve it.

The amendment arises from the provisions in subsection (1D) of section 5 of the Bill, as published, which provides that in the event of the wind-up of a pension scheme, where the employer is insolvent and there are not sufficient funds in the scheme to meet 50% of the liabilities of the scheme in respect of all scheme members of up to &euro;12,000 of pensioner liabilities, the Minister for Finance will provide moneys to cover the shortfall in scheme resources to secure that level of benefits.<\/p><p>The amendment inserts a new section 48A into the Pensions Act to provide for the drawdown of the amount required to cover the shortfall in the resources of the scheme.  The amendment will require the trustees of the scheme to submit an application to the Pensions Board to certify the amount of the shortfall in scheme resources.  This application will be accompanied by a statement completed by the scheme actuary setting out the amount of the shortfall in scheme resources.  The application and statement must comply with statutory guidance issued by the board.  When the Pensions Board has certified this amount the trustees will apply to the Minister for Social Protection to request the Minister for Finance to pay the certified amount out of the Central Fund to the trustees of the pensions scheme.  The trustees will be required to use this amount for the purposes of the discharging of the liabilities of the scheme.<\/p><p>The amendment allows the Minister for Social Protection to make guidelines in respect of the certification by the Pensions Board of the shortfall in the scheme resources.  As a consequence of this amendment, I propose replacing the following text, &quot;provide such moneys as are&quot; in page 7, line 29, with the words &quot;pay the amount certified under section 48A that is&quot;, to ensure consistency in the language between the new subsection 48A and the new section 48(1D), as set out in the Bill as published.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800026#AA01300","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1385647800,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  The way in which the trustees make the request to the Minister is the kernel of the issue.  The new section inserted by amendment No. 17 states: \"the Minister shall request the Minister for Finance to pay out of the Central Fund to the trustees of the relevant scheme, an amount equal to the certified amount for the purpose of the discharge, by the trustees of that relevant scheme, of the liabilities of that scheme in respect of the benefits referred to in section 48(1D).\"<\/p><p>I was pleased to learn that 40% of the schemes are fine and that problems arise in only 20% of them, as I had heard that up to 80% of the schemes were in trouble.  The Minister informed the House that the position is more optimistic than we expected, which is good.  I commend her interest in this area.  Arising from the annual addresses she gave to my students each year after the budget, I am aware that she has the business and accounting background to tackle this problem, which has been around for much too long, and I support her in that regard.<\/p><p>The problem of moral hazard arises.  How will we be certain of the reasons the schemes that apply to the Minister to request that the Minister for Finance make a payout have got into trouble?  The Minister may have learned today that Legal &amp;amp; General in the United Kingdom has found that older schemes have an administration charge of 2%.  The British Government is considering imposing a cap of 0.75% on administration fees, but this one company believes it can do it for 0.5%.  That is an important development.  I do not know if we have a figure that is comparable for Ireland, but in the United Kingdom, each 1% charge costs &pound;170,000 where a saver pays &pound;1,200 per annum for 46 years.  Are excessive administrative costs one of the reasons pension schemes get into trouble?  I pose this question because we have had a succession of bankers, accountants, fund managers, credit unions and others seeking to have moneys paid to them from the public purse, in many cases as a result of their own inefficiencies.  <\/p><p>We spoke yesterday to the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, about the need to have much stricter regulation of all financial services because &euro;64 billion in debt was incurred by the State as a result of one sector behaving in an incompetent manner and visiting the entire burden on the Exchequer and citizens.<\/p> <p>Take, for example, the role of trustees as expressed in the 2010 publication of the Pensions Board.  Did they always act prudently and diligently in the interests of beneficiaries or were they incompetent?  The Minister referred to longevity.  One can argue, to the contrary, that the studies showing we are living longer have been around for a long time.  Should the Exchequer be bailing out incompetents who did not do their life expectancy sums properly?  A girl born today can expect to live for close to 100 years.  Did the trustees and actuaries keep up with the research?  Has the industry been keeping an eye on costs?  Why does Legal and General state in the report it has published today that costs are too high?  Rather than shift the burden to the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, or the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, there has to be some penalty for people who invest poorly.  Were too many years added in?<\/p><p> My fears increased when I read in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>on Monday that pension scheme members in County Clare planned to sue their trustees for &euro;50 million.  Will an amendment be needed on Report Stage to provide for strict controls ovn who can qualify or will we be bailing out the funds because of the problems to which I have referred?  If we were to bail them out, why would pension funds ever take steps to reduce their costs and fees?  They could make themselves popular by awarding added years or not doing their actuarial sums properly and then transfer the ensuing problems to Leinster House.  I appreciate the reason for intervening in the current context.  That need has decreased with the good news that 40% of schemes are now fully funded.  Given what has happened in related financial sectors such as &euro;52 million for a credit union and the uncertain cost of banking and accounting schemes, do we need stricter controls on fund managers?  When people are incompetent or excessively generous, should they not bear some of the burden?  Can the Exchequer be protected in a way that did not happen in 2008 when the financial sector dumped its financial problems on its doorstep?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800026#AA01400","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385648400,"counter":264,"content":"<p>The issue of pension charges is, as Senator Sean D. Barrett suggests, extremely important.  The amendment will give clarity to the procedures involved.  It has been argued that 50% is not adequate and people have asked why, for example, the State cannot cover 90% or 100%.  After a period of serious economic difficulty, we are finally getting back on our feet.  Employment figures are moving in a positive direction, but we are not out of the woods by a long chalk and have a huge legacy of debts owed to international creditors, led by the troika.  The question arises of how we would fund a significantly higher burden on the State than the EU directive proposes in the context of the pressure put on citizens of the State to meet the costs of the bank collapse and the troika obligations entered into in 2010.<\/p><p>When I came into office, I approached the issue of pension reform in a systematic way by bringing forward a number of changes, getting the sovereign bond off the ground via the NTMA in 2012 and commissioning reports on pension charges and the structure of pension governance and a report from the OECD on how we might develop a better structure.  The report on pension charges which I commissioned shortly after I came into office was undertaken by the Department of Social Protection, the Central Bank and the Pensions Board, with support from PwC.  After we published the report, we opened it to consultation by inviting the industry and other interested parties to respond.  The level of response was rather low.  Essentially, smaller schemes in Ireland pay more.  It is a problem for a country such as Ireland, with a small population base and a relatively small number of employers, that we have a lot of smaller schemes.  The cost can be significant.  The deregulation introduced at the height of the boom in the late 1990s and early 2000s allowed individuals to manage their own pension schemes.  In many cases, these were educated and successful business people.  They were assisted in managing their schemes by significant tax breaks for self-employed persons.  The report on pension charges showed that people in that situation could have paid up to one third of the total fund in charges.  I created a number of structures to approach the complexity of pensions.  I have committed to changing the governance structure for pensions and when the Bill has been enacted, I will establish a pensions council which will represent consumer interests.<\/p><p>As Senator Sean D. Barrett noted in respect of students, it is important to develop an understanding of this area.  One of the reasons pensions policy has been the responsibility of the Department of Social Protection rather than the Financial Regulator is my Department can make the advocacy case on the importance of pensions to people who are in their 20s and 30s.  This is a period of life when people often have more on their minds than providing for pensions.  That is why I welcome the proposal in the OECD's report of having an additional pension provision to that of the State pension on either a mandatory or an auto-enrolment basis.  It will be essential to develop such a system in the Irish case.<\/p><p>The amendment sets out exactly what is to happen.  In this case, it will involve the general body of taxpayers, some of whom may not have pensions other than their general retirement pension based on their PRSI contributions.

Given the broken promises, it seems inevitable that the levy of 0.15% will continue the following year and I reckon it will be increased to meet any requirement or shortfall.  That seems to be the logical structure of the legislation and it is my opinion that this is exactly what the Government will do.  What we need in this area is a degree of certainty.  There is too much sophistry with regard to these policies.  It would be far better to state where we were going.

I do not like going back in time too much, but as I recall the directive dates from 2008 when there was still quite an amount of money in the country.  The previous Government did not rush to implement the EU pensions directive for reasons we understand.  We are now trying to get things together and put the country back on a sustainable and sensible footing with modest prosperity and a recovery now in train.  The initiative on job creation and the increase of 58,000 people in work this year, of whom 54,000 are in full-time employment, are among the most positive news stories anyone looking at the economy would take into account.  Since 2008 we have lost 250,000 jobs, one of the biggest numbers of jobs lost in any country as a consequence of the bank and construction failure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800028#CC00700","speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1385649000,"counter":272,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1385649000,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 15:<blockquote><br \/>In page 7, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:&quot;(1E) An appeals mechanism for pensioners shall be put in place where trustees have decided upon reduced benefits for members, and such appeals mechanism shall ensure that such pensioners have not been unfairly treated in any restructuring arrangement.&quot;,&quot;.<\/blockquote>I am relying on the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament which has expressed serious concerns about the lack of access.  It states the pension, as indicated, will deal with the priority order for defined benefit schemes in the event of a wind-up.  If one examines the detail, it will do much more than this, as it will give additional powers to trustees and nothing to pensioners.  The Irish Senior Citizens Parliament and its members are concerned that, once again, the issue of the right of audience for pensioners is not being dealt with in the Bill.<\/p> <p>It is worth reiterating that pensioners are former workers who are now in receipt of benefits for which they and their employers paid during their working lives.  Until the 1970s, pensioners had a right of audience in the industrial relations machinery of the State.  When this matter was raised by the Irish Senior Citizens' Parliament, ISCP, with the Government, the response was that, since pensions in payment could not be reduced, there was no need for such access.  The CEO of the ISCP, Ms Mairead Hayes, stated that this reason was no longer valid because the position had changed dramatically in that pensions in payment had been reduced because of the imposition of the stamp duty pension levy.  If the Bill is passed without amendment, the vista facing many pensioners may be bleak and their pensions will be reduced further.<\/p><p>According to the ISCP, if the Government is serious about fairness and intergenerational equality, it must start by giving pensioners a right of audience.  In many schemes, pensioners or their associations are denied access to scheme trustees and sponsoring employers.  This is regrettable at a time when the power of trustees is being rapidly increased.  The ISCP is concerned that the option to restructure a scheme outside the double and single insolvency process might confer powers on trustees to act in a manner that might not be open and transparent to all of the stakeholders in a scheme.  The ISCP wants the Bill to ensure that pensioners are recognised as active participants in any and all processes that impinge on their schemes, up to and including access to the State's industrial relations machinery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800028#CC00900","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385649600,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  Significant efforts have been made to identify an approach that strikes a reasonable balance between the interests of pensioners and the active and deferred members of scheme portfolios and scheme structures.  To ensure that the broadest range of views and expertise was considered, the consultation process during the review of these provisions included a stakeholder consultation forum in late 2012 for those representing older people and pensioners, the pensions industry, employers, trade unions, older representatives attending the ISCP, Age Action Ireland and the National Federation of Pensioners' Associations.  Written submissions were also sought from the groups and informed the review process when received.  The Department engaged external technical and actuarial specialists to undertake modelling exercises that assisted in the review process.<\/p><p>It should be noted that current and former members of pension schemes are collectively protected by a broad and detailed range of measures.  The trustees of defined benefit pension schemes have a fiduciary duty under trust law and the Pensions Act to act in the best interests of all scheme members.  If they do not, how they carry out their duties may be contested.  It is an onerous responsibility under trust law.<\/p><p>The Pensions Board provides further regulatory safeguards and oversight, some of which I have already mentioned.  Scheme trustees must apply to the Pensions Board before it can reduce benefits.  Before trustees make their application, they must consult the employer, the scheme members, any person receiving benefits from the scheme and the authorised trade union representing scheme members.  Trustees must also undertake a comprehensive review of the scheme with a view to its long-term stability and sustainability.  The review must cover the benefits payable under the scheme, the options available for reductions in benefits and their impact on the different categories of members and other people, the contributions required, the options for increasing those contributions, the employer's attitude to any request for increased contributions, and the long-term investment strategy, including the future risks for the scheme, the possibility that the scheme will prove more expensive than anticipated - whether this is due to underperforming investments, increased longevity or anything else - and what measures could be available to the trustees in these circumstances, such as contribution increases or changes to discretionary benefits.  The trustees must have requested from the employer contributions sufficient to ensure long-term stability and application and the employer must have declined to pay those contributions.  Trustees are required to take legal advice on their powers and duties and on the obligations on employers to contribute to the scheme.  The trustees must notify in writing all of the members of the scheme and any other person in receipt of benefits.  They must also advise in writing authorised trade unions and give them the details of the context in which the potential changes arise.<\/p><p>Revising a scheme is a fairly exhaustive and technically difficult process.

It was probably this time last year.  Up to a few years ago there was ongoing testing to ensure the bay was free of the ostreid herpes virus.  Four years ago an infected oyster was found and the bay's disease free status was removed.  The detection was made under an ongoing surveillance programme sponsored by the European Union and as a result, the bay's organic status was taken away.  This time last year we questioned the efficacy of taking away this status.  In other bays around the coast there had been a more serious outbreak of the virus and they had lost their disease free status.  What happened in Ballinakill Bay seems to be an aberration because only one diseased oyster was found four years ago.  Recent tests show that the bay has been clear of the virus for another year.  The only time it was present was when it was discovered in one oyster four years ago.  Can the issue of the status of the bay be revisited?  Its status is important to oyster farmers in the area because it allows them to sell high quality oysters.  There is also great potential to create more jobs by supplying seed oysters to oyster farms.  It is important that the matter be revisited and the bay's disease free status reinstated.  It is also a good opportunity to create employment and keep Ireland's image of being a clean and green environment for growing shellfish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800031#GG00300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1385650800,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  This is essentially a fish health issue and I understand the competent authority for dealing with it is the Marine Institute.  Of key note in this case is that in respect of areas deemed to be free of the disease, there should be no importation of stock from infected areas.  These areas were known as surveillance areas and included Ballinakill.  In 2011 a positive test result for the virus necessitated the removal of Ballinakill Bay from the surveillance programme.  Losses related to the virus in oysters were first observed in Ireland in 2008.  The disease spread in the next couple of years and was strongly associated with imports of seeds from France.<\/p><p>Following representations made to the European Commission by the Marine Institute and the relevant Department in the United Kingdom, it was agreed by the Commission that this was a serious emerging disease and that trade restrictions should be put in place to protect those areas still free of the virus, while allowing trade to continue between infected areas.  EU legislation was brought forward to that effect in 2010 and as a result, a surveillance programme was established in certain parts of Ireland, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.  The kernel of the surveillance programme was that each competent authority identified epidemiological units, or bays in the case of Ireland, where virus related mortality had not been observed to date and which the member state wished to protect from trade with other infected areas, either within their own member state or further afield, most particularly France.  Once these areas were identified as part of the surveillance programme, they could only trade with areas that were also in a surveillance programme.  <\/p><p>One of the requirements of being in the surveillance programme was that a testing regime would be put in place to ensure these bays were, in fact, free of the virus.  A significant amount of State resources have been put into the operation of the Irish surveillance programme since it started in 2010.  Since the basis of the surveillance programme was to underpin safe trade, an obvious prerequisite was that an epidemiological unit, or bay in this case, had to be removed from the programme should a positive result be detected.  Such a result was obtained in Ballinakill Bay in 2011.<\/p><p>The Irish surveillance programme started with 19 surveillance areas.  In the period since 2010 testing revealed that five of these areas were infected and had to be removed from the programme.  The five bays are Gweedore, Drumcliffe, Ballinakill, Oysterhaven and the Shannon Estuary.  As new positive findings were made, new decisions were issued by the European Commission, which meant that newly infected areas were removed from the national programme and the legislation was modified to reflect these findings.  Newly infected areas were also detected in Northern Ireland and Great Britain since the programme began in 2010.<\/p><p>Clinical disease is not required for an epidemiological unit to be removed from the programme.  The positive finding in Ballinakill Bay necessitated its removal from the surveillance programme in 2011.  It is important to note that the current legislation provides for no option other than to remove the bay from the surveillance programme following the detection of one positive oyster in the bay.  Once a bay is removed from the surveillance programme, the relevant competent authority no longer has any legal basis for restricting trade into that bay.  That is the basis of the agreed EU programme and applies equally in all member states which participate in the programme.  In the case of Ballinakill Bay, if the Marine Institute had continued to restrict trade following the removal of the bay from the programme, a legitimate challenge could have been taken by other operators in the bay who were at that stage extremely keen to bring in stock from France.  This was not allowed while the bay was in the surveillance programme.<\/p><p>The very complex situation in Ballinakill Bay was recognised by the Marine Institute.  Instead of simply removing the bay from the surveillance programme and immediately allowing importation of stocks from France, the institute invested significant efforts into encouraging growers to voluntarily restrict trade with France for that season while testing continued.  The objective was for the institute to gather specific data that would be used to inform a voluntary path forward for all stakeholders.  Samples taken by the institute last year were negative for the disease and no samples have been taken in 2013.  Specifically, the institute was faced with a situation where certain growers wanted to bring in stock from France and others wanted to go back into a surveillance programme which was not legally permissible.  Instead, the institute tried to encourage stakeholders to consider the results obtained and reach an agreement on a code of practice for the bay that the institute would support with testing and advice.  This has not been acted on by the stakeholders to date.<\/p><p>The action taken by the Marine Institute in Ballinakill Bay has been agreed to by the European Commission.  The institute has made considerable efforts to encourage the stakeholders to agree to a code of practice.  Agreement to a code of practice could, potentially, after a number of years provide data on which the virus free status of Ballinakill Bay could be reinstated.   The institute has offered scientific advice and laboratory testing to support the approach, but it has had no communications with the growers in Ballinakill Bay on its offer to facilitate the development of a code of practice.  However, the offer remains intact.  <\/p><p>As the Senator rightly said, Ireland's reputation as a producer of top quality seafood is predicated on the implementation of a sound regulatory system that has the confidence of the public in general and also the European Commission.  I am satisfied that in the circumstances the correct approach is being adopted in this case.  I urge the growers in Ballinakill Bay to contact the Marine Institute with a view to progressing the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800031#GG00400","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1385650800,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply.

Four years ago only one contaminated oyster was found in Ballinakill Bay and nothing has been found since.  It is hard to say a whole bay is contaminated based on that science.  The legislation needs to be revisited in order to allow the bay to be brought back into the scheme, if the Minister deems it to be fit to do so or the European Union agrees that he should do so.  Perhaps the Minister of State might ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine if he was willing to examine the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800031#GG00500","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1385651400,"counter":299,"content":"<p>This is an EU-wide programme and all 28 member states are required to agree to it.

I am disturbed to have to raise this matter which involves looking for basic items.  The basic requirement is the continuation of a rental grant for prefabricated accommodation in Scoil Mhainchin national school, Ennistymon, County Clare.  The building in which the school is housed is over 100 years old and could do with reinvestment to bring it to the standard one would reasonably expect for our children in First world Ireland.  The fact that the building is 100 years old means some of the classrooms are totally unacceptable and of a poor standard.  The issues involved include insulation and heating, etc.  For some time, a number of the classes have been accommodated in prefabricated buildings and a grant was made available by the Department of Education and Science to cover the rental cost.  The school was contacted a number of weeks ago to be told the grant would not be available in 2014.  The grant has been pulled in the middle of the school term.  Accommodation is expected to be brought up to an acceptable level over the Christmas period, which is totally impractical and will not happen.  No decent toilet facilities are available.  The Department cannot stand over the removal of this small grant to provide prefabricated accommodation.  I seek the reversal of the decision as a matter of extreme urgency.  This is causing stress to teachers, the board of management, parents and children.  This is not acceptable and should not happen in the run-up to Christmas.<\/p><p>The children attending school in Ennistymon are what I describe as discommoded because they are going from one second level school to another.  They have to tramp across town in the wind and rain.  Now primary schoolchildren in Ennistymon will be discriminated against and do not have simple prefabricated accommodation, which is unacceptable.  I want this decision reversed and hope the reply of the Minister of State will inform me it has been reversed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800032#HH00200","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1385651400,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter and apologise on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, who is unable to attend the House.  <\/p><p>From my knowledge of Ennistymon, Scoil Mhainchin is an important school and was established as a result of an amalgamation in September 2007 on the existing convent site.  The Senator may also be aware of the three post-primary schools in Ennistymon that have agreed to amalgamate on the delivery of a new school building.  This building project has been earmarked to be established on the convent site on which Scoil Mhainchin is located.  The religious congregation that owns the property has offered to transfer the site to the State as part of its offer of a number of properties.  The Government has agreed to accept the property in question and the Department, through the Chief State Solicitor's office, is working on finalising the transfer of the property.  When the transfer has been completed, the Department will be in a position to further consider how the amalgamated post-primary school project can be progressed within the context of the available funding.  Thereafter, the amalgamated primary school, Scoil Mhainchin, will be required to relocate to provide a clear site for the amalgamated post-primary school development.  The current CBS post-primary site which will become vacant once the amalgamated post-primary project has been delivered is considered to be a suitable one for the amalgamated primary school, Scoil Mhainchin.  In the meantime, the Department is providing rental grant aid for a number of rented prefabs for the school and this arrangement is the subject of a rental review.  The Department has been in contact with the school authorities in the context of that review.  In order to complete the assessment of the continuing need for all of the prefabs on the site, a technical site visit will be carried out shortly by the Department.  Should a meeting with the school authorities be required further to that site visit, officials in the Department's building unit will be in contact directly with the school to arrange same.  <\/p><p>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position on Scoil Mhainchin in Ennistymon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013112800032#HH00300","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1385651400,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I take it that the grant will continue to be paid until the site inspection takes place.
