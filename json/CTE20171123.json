Today he is accompanied by Ms Mary Henry, deputy director of audit.  The first session today deals with the reopening of Garda stations.  The next item will be Chapter 12 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which is on the management of ancillary services at the Garda training college.  We are dealing with these matters first and we will defer our normal consideration of correspondence, our work programme and accounts received until the afternoon, as the witnesses from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must attend a Policing Authority meeting later on today.  They have to be long gone from here before 1 p.m.  We will come back to our normal business in the afternoon.<\/p><p>As I mentioned, two matters are to be considered today.  However, we also requested and received a note last week from the acting Garda Commissioner, D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, on the recruitment process and a breakdown of costs associated with the Charleton tribunal.  This had been raised in previous correspondence with the acting Garda Commissioner.  We received a letter from him yesterday evening on this particular item.  I will read it into the public record.  It has not yet been circulated but it will be published now.  It is addressed to the committee and is dated yesterday.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>I refer to your email of 16th November 2017 and note the Committee's intention to set aside a small amount of time at the PAC to questions on the setting up of the Tribunal Co-Ordination Office.  <br \/><br \/>Please note that this matter has been the subject of correspondence between ... An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Committee [since] August 2017.<br \/><br \/>Beyond the delivery of the public funding information furnished in that correspondence, and having taken Counsel's advice on the matter, I am concerned that discussions in the Public Accounts Committee concerning the Tribunal Coordination Office might easily trespass on the work of the Tribunal.  The Coordination Office are fully cooperating with the Tribunal on behalf of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I wish to ensure that there is no potential for any trespass on it's [sic] important work.  <br \/><br \/>In the circumstances, I would be grateful if the Committee could postpone discussions on this particular matter.<\/blockquote><p> We will confine this matter to the very tight issue of costs, and there will be no straying into discussions that are taking place in the Chamber every day and the matters before the tribunal.  I have not spoken to the acting Commissioner because I have just received this letter, but can we deal with that one small item without straying any further?  I am saying to both the witnesses and the members that they are not to stray any further.  It is not within the remit of this committee to discuss what it happening at the tribunal, but we can talk briefly on the costs issue in terms of that unit.  I am not sure if such a comment is in the acting Commissioner's opening statement.<\/p><p> I have been asked to read the normal welcome.  I skipped that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017112300002#A00300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511427600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Why was this information sought?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017112300002#B00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1511427600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>This committee sought it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017112300002#B00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1511427600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>When did it seek it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017112300002#B00400","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1511427600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>We sought it before the summer, and there has been correspondence between the Garda and this committee since August 2017, after the issue arose in July.

This requires extensive and considerable resources to be devoted to the task.  At all times our objective is to provide the tribunal with the information it requires as quickly as possible.  So far, tens of thousands of pages of material have been provided to the tribunal.  As per material provided to the committee, additional, dedicated staff with expertise and experience in this area were required to assist with this task to meet the timelines of the tribunal.

On the commitment in the programme for Government for the reopening of six Garda stations on a pilot basis, the Commissioner was asked by the Department of Justice and Equality to identify six stations with specific criteria to include a mix of urban and rural with a minimum of one in Dublin and a good geographical spread.  Furthermore, the Department advised the stations to be considered for reopening must be in State ownership.  In total, 139 stations were closed.  Of these, 78 stations could potentially be reopened.  Based on the criteria provided, a scoping exercise was conducted by an assistant commissioner with views taken from each regional assistant commissioner following consultation with local stakeholders.  Census data was also examined, as was data on crime trends from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na analysis service.<\/p> <p>  Assistant Garda Commissioner John O'Driscoll provided an interim report in June with a recommendation that Stepaside Garda station be reopened.  Assistant Commissioner O'Driscoll was awaiting final recommendations from all regions as well as recent census and crime data before completing his report.  His final report and its recommendations have been approved by me as acting Commissioner and the report was forwarded to the Department of Justice and Equality earlier this week.  The six stations recommended to be reopened are, in alphabetical order, Ballinspittle, Bawnboy, Donard, Leighlinbridge, Rush and Stepaside.  Those include a station closer to the Border, two in Dublin at either end of the county, one of them large and the other smaller, another in the most southerly part of west Cork, along with a spread across five of the six Garda regions, which reflects consideration given to the criteria provided to us.  Following this, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will liaise with the Office of Public Works to determine what remedial works need to be done at each station and the length of time and the associated costs of the works.  Furthermore, an examination of the resources required will be undertaken which will examine the numbers of staff, equipment, vehicles and ICT infrastructure required to determine in what order these stations are opened and when they are opened.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to the interim audit report and financial procedures in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na College of February 2017.  The organisation is committed to implementing all 19 recommendations in full.  Recommendation 1 cannot be completed until all 18 other recommendations have been completed.  Recommendation 19 can only be completed when the head of internal audit has conducted his audit of the implementation of the recommendations which he has indicated will be completed by the end of December.  The Policing Authority is overseeing our implementation of the recommendations contained in the interim report.  The Policing Authority has deemed that 11 of the 19 recommendations have been completed.  Of the remaining six recommendations, three are on target for completion by the end of December and significant progress will be demonstrated on the remaining three which relate to procurement of food for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na College and the transfer of lands to State control.  This clearly demonstrates the organisation's continued commitment to ensuring that there are effective financial management and control systems in place to manage finances and all administrative functions in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na College.<\/p> <p>  As Accounting Officer for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I can say it takes seriously its responsibility for ensuring public moneys are spent efficiently and effectively in the best interests of the community and State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017112300002#E01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1511427600,"counter":228,"content":"<p>We have approximately 45 minutes left for this session and speakers have indicated in the following sequence - Deputies Alan Kelly, David Cullinane and Marc MacSharry.

On 6 October, the chief superintendent of DMR west, Lorraine Wheatley, recommended the opening of Cabra Garda station to 24 hours, that is, extended hours for the station.  On 24 October 2016, Chief Superintendent Gerry Russell from DMR east recommended the reopening of Stepaside Garda station on reduced opening hours, namely, from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.  On 1 November 2016, Assistant Commissioner Jack Nolan took responsibility for the process, again for a short while.  On 15 November 2016, the chief superintendent of DMR south, Frank Clerkin, recommended a nil return for the south central division.  On 18 November 2016, the chief superintendent for DMR north, Barry O'Brien, recommended the reopening of Rush Garda station, indicating that Lusk Garda station should have been closed initially.<\/p> <p>  Based on the information that came back from the chief superintendents, three out of six divisions had a nil return.

I asked at the start of this process a number of months ago when we first started to ask questions about this that we would examine process.

We have now learned that it is also the prerogative of the Commissioner - in this case, it was the former Commissioner - to change the criteria and that did not happen.  If the criteria had been changed, for example, to give heavy credence to the view of Mr. Leahy, it probably would have ended up with a different outcome.  That concerns me.

If it were a thing that Stepaside opened at some stage in 2018 or 2019, and I will not say when, and was being used as an outpost for community policing in advance of some other station being built or otherwise, then I would not see it as being a bad use of resources, but if I were given additional resources today and asked whether they would go to Stepaside, no they would not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017112300002#K06400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Leahy"},{"type":"speech","time":1511427600,"counter":507,"content":"<p>That is a very clear answer.

It is commendable that this committee faces the challenge of making best use of public funds.  What is being done in Sligo now is that the remedial works on the station have been planned and committed.  Matters are out to tender, with tenders to be back on 6 December for considerable remedial works.  We had discussions with the Garda Representative Association, GRA, on Friday 17 November which were focused on ensuring the greatest good for the greatest number and making certain that the works in the station were focused on bringing the cells in the Sligo station back into functioning order.  The lockers and member facilities are to be improved dramatically.  Congestion in the station will be addressed and alleviated.  The focus is on ensuring that the scarce resources available are targeted to make the greatest impact.<\/p> <p>  The position of the assistant commissioner for the northern region has been that priority be given to works on the station, which is the very point the Deputy raised and which has caused some tension.  There is a proposal that he and the chief superintendent would decamp to an alternative station at a cost of &euro;750,000.  The cost of fixing the station is &euro;1.25 million, and he has quite properly, in my view, decided that a policy of the greatest good to the greatest number should apply and so the station is to be fixed.  My colleague, Mr. Se&aacute;n Murphy, has outlined with the OPW a programme of work which would see the entire ground floor of the Sligo station, including the refurbishment of the cells, back in use by 30 September 2018.  <\/p> <p>  I would like to commend the Deputy for his constant commitment to seeking an appropriate site.  I understand that there is potential, working with the local authority, of gaining a 14 acre site at the Summerhill College roundabout.  It is ideal, given the confluence of roads, from an access-egress perspective.  The matter has been close to the Deputy's heart.  There is a requirement to consider the needs of the region for an appropriate station.  There are people working in that station at the minute.  I believe this matter has been amplified to suit certain agendas.  Mr. Reilly's report is not the only one in existence.  There is also an OPW report, which Mr. Murphy will deal with in a moment.  There is a commitment to dealing with the remedial issues.  It is a very real and time-bound commitment.  It is costed and makes the best use of taxpayers' funds.  There is a longer-term requirement, independent of that, to ensure that Sligo has the station that it needs and that the region is serviced appropriately.  Work is continuing in parallel, with Assistant Commissioner Barry O'Brien leading on it.  There are many areas where there is an absolute commonality of approach between the Garda associations, the civilian trade unions and Garda management on this.  There is an issue, but I believe that there are a certain amount of other contaminants involved which lead to the unfortunate events of last Monday.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017112300002#L02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Barrett"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511427600,"counter":532,"content":"<p>We have received a report from the OPW on the condition of Sligo Garda station, and contrary to the report of Mr. Reilly which the Deputy referred to, the OPW does not accept that the building is unsafe and does not agree that the building is unfit for occupation.

I will conclude this section.  When we get to deal with our normal work programme this afternoon, we can discuss these issues.<\/p> <p>  I have listened to today's debate as Chairman.  In the acting Commissioner's opening statement, he has hinged everything  on the phrase \"based on the criteria provided\".  He also spoke about a report and recommendations, saying he recommended the reopening of six stations.  In alphabetical order, they are Ballinspittle, Bawnboy, Donard, Leighlinbridge, Rush and Stepaside.  The members of the Committee of Public Accounts may wish to consider what I have to say as Chairman.  Our function as a committee is to ensure good value for money for the Department of Justice and Equality and the Garda Vote.  Our priority should be the same as that in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in ensuring the force has the resources it requires, gets the best value for money and can deal with crime in urban and rural areas.  Crime rates may increase or decrease along with populations.  As far as the Committee of Public Accounts is concerned, policing priorities should take precedence in the achievement of those results.  The allocation of resources should be based on policing priorities.<\/p> <p>  It is the job of the Committee of Public Accounts to call out where we think political promises or commitments may not gel with what we would consider the best use of taxpayer resources in the management and operation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I want to get agreement from the committee today.  The Secretary General has stated this matter is for 2018 and the stations will not open before Christmas.  There will be a debate on the Estimate for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Vote, and we are informed that will happen next Wednesday, 29 November.  I would like this committee to agree to write to the justice committee in the morning, highlighting that it is the view of the Committee of Public Accounts that when it discusses the Estimate, it should deal with policing priorities and best value for money.  That should be its role.  It will be our role to examine the spending afterwards.  Our view will be that policing priorities should take precedence over any political promise when it comes to dealing with crime in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Our committee will be drafting a report on this matter and we will discuss it in due course.  Our role is to ensure best value for money for resources and this should be based on policing priorities.  We can come back to it.

The report does not revisit those matters.  Instead it examines the operation, funding and accounting for ancillary services at the Garda College and the management of State-owned land acquired by the Office of Public Works for Garda College purposes.  In addition to the college's core training operations, a variety of ancillary services and social activities have operated within the college campus, mainly for the use and benefit of trainees.  These include the restaurant, bar and shop, and a number of college clubs and societies.<\/p> <p>  The operations and costs of the Garda College are administered in a similar manner to those of Garda districts.  Most expenditure, including pay, equipment and capital costs, is managed and controlled centrally.  Local management is responsible for expenditure incurred locally using funds advanced for that purpose.  In addition to the Department-sanctioned public bank accounts used for the operation of the college&rsquo;s core activities, members will recall that over 40 accounts with financial institutions had been operated, relating to the college's ancillary services.  As of August 2017, a total of nine accounts were operating, including three public bank accounts for funding of core activities; two accounts controlled by college management for ancillary services, that is, one each for the restaurant and shop; and four club or society accounts managed by the respective memberships.  A summary of the bank accounts is presented in figure 12.3 of the report.<\/p> <p>  The college's restaurant is the biggest element of the ancillary services, with a turnover of over &euro;1.1 million in 2016.  The restaurant was not formally established as a company but had its own accounting records and a separate tax number.  The independently audited accounts for the restaurant indicate that up to 2008, the restaurant generated annual surpluses, with around &euro;2 million in accumulated reserves at the end of 2008.  Garda recruitment activity was suspended in the aftermath of the financial crisis.  As a result, over the period from 2009 to 2016, the restaurant incurred trading losses totalling &euro;1.95 million, which all but eliminated the reserves.  The restaurant was primarily funded through retained living allowances, which were paid on a capitation basis to the restaurant for periods when recruits were attending the college.  The funding model for the restaurant was changed in May 2017.  It is now being run on a net cost basis, calculated from the cost of staff wages and restaurant supplies and taking account of till receipts.  A record of the number of recruits in attendance in the college during each payment period is also provided to the finance directorate for information and correlation purposes.  This is intended to avoid surpluses occurring in the account in the future.<\/p> <p>  For comparative purposes, we also examined the arrangements in place in a number of other public bodies that provide restaurant and canteen services on-site for staff and other users.  These include the Defence Forces, a number of Departments, third level colleges and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  Different service models are in place, with some providing services directly and other providing services on an outsourced or contracted basis, procured under a competitive process.  The models used are summarised in figure 12.5 of the report.  We found that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na did not have a clear framework in place for management of the college restaurant operations.  Other bodies have formal arrangements in place that set out the governance structure and accountability arrangements, and how any surpluses generated may be used.  I have recommended that a formal framework be put in place for the management and control of ancillary services.  The Accounting Officer has agreed to that recommendation.<\/p> <p>  The other main issue dealt with in the report relates to the management of land at the college, all of which was acquired by the Office of Public Works and made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>The report outlines the complex legal situation that has arisen regarding the 37-acre site adjacent to the college that is used to provide a golf course and the process for acquisition of a large property at Dromard, 6 km from the college, in 2006 which was intended for development of a Garda training centre of excellence that has not yet been provided.  In both cases, there are concerns that the approach taken may not have achieved good value for money.  In particular, we found no evidence that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na involved OPW in advising on the granting, in 2000, of a licence for access to the golf course lands to a local club, no evidence that use of the golf course land was considered for college development purposes when An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department sought additional land to increase the training capacity of the college, no evidence that the purchase of the Dromard land and transfer of control over it to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been underpinned by any formal agreement or clarification of responsibilities and no evidence that OPW followed up or monitored the extent to which the Dromard farm was used for the purposes for which it was acquired, or that its value was otherwise protected or optimised.  I have made a number of recommendations in respect of property management that the Accounting Officers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of Public Works have accepted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017112300002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511427600,"counter":589,"content":"<p>As already indicated, this session must be completed by 1 p.m. at the latest because the acting Commissioner must attend a Policing Authority meeting in the early afternoon.

It then lists those external agencies and among them is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The report goes on to specifically state that the management of the relationship of the Department with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also needed to be examined and then finally says that this relationship is ineffective and an oversight of a confused, passive and disaggregated departmental relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Item No. 916C is correspondence dated 10 November from an individual relating to the awarding of a contract to a body without a tender process by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The correspondence raises questions as to why this Department is developing the framework when it has been previously undertaken by the Department of Justice and Equality.  I propose we write to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht for a full note on this to address the questions contained in the correspondence.  When we get a reply we will follow it up at that stage.<\/p> <p>  No. 917C is correspondence dated 15 November 2017 from Mr. Aidan O&rsquo;Driscoll, Secretary General in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in reply to a request for information on the PRSI classification of certain staff employed by Coillte.  The reply says that the Department is not involved in this case and suggests that we direct our enquiry to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I propose that we write to that Department, as suggested and also request information directly form Coillte.  <\/p> <p>  No. 920C, correspondence dated 16 November 2017 from an individual in regard to a number of issues including the Rugby World Cup, Government funding for the RDS and lobbying by an insurance company.

It was necessary under EUROSTAT rules to set up a special purpose vehicle, that is, a company to own NAMA, that would not be on the State balance sheet.  That can only happen if the majority shareholding is held in private ownership.  People may find this very strange.  This is a mechanism to take major debts off the State balance sheet.  The statistical office of the European Union, EUROSTAT, will only allow them to be taken off the State's balance sheet if the debts are majority owned, 51%, by private investors.<\/p> <p>  One newspaper picked up on the Minister's reply to my question on 10 October 2017.

I asked the amount of funding each of these invested in the NAMA group and how much they will get when NAMA is being wound up, because NAMA will have a surplus.<\/p> <p>  In recent weeks, the Minister would have made a statement that Members asked about paying off the NAMA debts earlier because NAMA has plenty of money in its account and will have a surplus.  The Minister for Finance said that they could only return the money to the Exchequer when all its debts are paid off and the investors in the holding company have been paid.  I asked who were the investors in the holding company.  Let me read from the Minister's reply to my parliamentary Question No. 28.<\/p><p>The reply said there was a decision issued by EUROSTAT in 2009 that only special purpose vehicles, SPVs, that were majority owned by private companies would be regarded as being outside the Government sector, which means off the State balance sheet.  It said: <\/p><blockquote>Among the conditions were that the SPVs were of temporary duration and were established for the sole purpose of addressing the financial crisis.<br \/><br \/>In order to avail of this accounting treatment, NAMA established an investment holding company &ndash; National Asset Management Agency Investment D.A.C. &ndash; which is majority-owned by private investors.  51% of its shares are collectively owned by private companies and the remaining 49% are owned by NAMA.  Under the shareholders&rsquo; agreement between NAMA and the Private Investors, NAMA exercises a veto over decisions ...  EUROSTAT gave its approval to this structure in October 2009. <\/blockquote><p>Even though they own 51% and 49% have a veto, EUROSTAT accepts that once there is 51% private ownership, it is off the State balance sheet.  <br\/><br\/>The reply continued: &quot;The total issued share capital of National Asset Management Agency Investment D.A.C\u00a0is &euro;100m of which &euro;51m ... was invested by the Private Investors, each receiving an equal share of the 51 million B ordinary shares.&quot;  It then gave a breakdown of the share capital invested by the original private investors in 2010.  I will not read it all.  To come up with the &euro;51 million, the 51% of the NAMA holding company, Irish Life Assurance Plc put in &euro;17 million, New Ireland Assurance Company Plc put in &euro;17 million and a company called Percy Nominees Limited put in &euro;17 million.  That &euro;51 million gave them 51% ownership of the holding company in NAMA and that took NAMA off the State balance sheet.  EUROSTAT is happy with that but 51% of it is owned by the private sector.  Some of those companies changed and now the final shareholding is still owned by a company called BNY Custodial Nominees, which owns &euro;17 million; New Ireland Assurance, which owns &euro;17 million; and the &euro;17 million owned by the other company is now being split between Arthur Michael Joseph Keeley; the Church of Ireland Clergy Pensions Fund, which owns 3%; the Representative Church Body, Church of Ireland investment fund, which owns another 2.5%; Geoffrey Ian Broomhead, who owns 1.3% of the shares and Simon Stuart Haworth, who owns 1.2% of the shares.  The arrangement is they get a dividend each year based on the interest available on the market at that time.  At the end of it they get a dividend.  Before the &euro;3 million surplus of NAMA can be handed back to the State, that &euro;51 million has to be bought back by the Government.  They have to get their dividend which they are getting each year.  The dividends paid to these companies was &euro;5 million in 2011.  It is on the record in a reply to a parliamentary question on 10 October.  They have been paid &euro;13.52 million in dividends to date.  They will get a dividend at the end of the process and &euro;13.552 million has been paid to them by way of a dividend for their investment in the NAMA holding company.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017112300002#OO03900","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511427600,"counter":1315,"content":"<p>Is that collectively or individually?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017112300002#PP00200","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speech","time":1511427600,"counter":1316,"content":"<p>It is each individual.

The interest rate is based on the Government borrowing rates.  They are not getting an exorbitant interest rate.  It is based on the Government borrowing rate and then there can be another small amount of a dividend given on the winding up of the company.  When they get all their money back, the &euro;51 million plus the dividend and their final dividend and when that company is dissolved, the surplus of &euro;3.5 million in NAMA can then come to the State.  This has to happen first.  I say that by way of information.  The date that written parliamentary question was answered was 10 October.  We will write to the Minister and NAMA to ask why the accounts of the holding company for the past five years were published?  I found it interesting.  When it comes to social housing, I see no reason why on a temporary basis, to deal with the housing emergency as we did with the financial one, we cannot come to an accounting arrangement, as it is called in the reply by the Minister to the parliamentary question, that would allow a company to technically own 51%.  The State would have a veto on all operations and it would take all borrowings off the State's balance sheet.  The argument we cannot borrow because of EUROSTAT is right but if we go about it this way, we certainly can.  It is an eye-opener.  It sets a precedent.  When the Government wanted to get permission to borrow tens of billions off the State balance sheet, there was an accounting mechanism introduced to satisfy EUROSTAT and I think it could be used for other purposes.  It is up to members.  I think they get where I am coming from.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017112300002#PP00700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1511427600,"counter":1321,"content":"<p>Good work, Sherlock.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017112300002#PP00800","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1511427600,"counter":1322,"content":"<p>That is the accountant coming out in me.  Our work programme is on the screen.  We are getting there.  Today we had the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in and there are a few comments I want to make.  Next Thursday, we have the Revenue Commissioners in on corporation tax receipts, chapter 20 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and the question of dealing with corporation tax.  We decided two weeks ago, as part of assisting the committee in our understanding of how multinationals understand our taxation system, that we would invite Apple, Google, Citibank, JP Morgan, GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer to appear before the committee.  The letters were issued this week inviting those six companies to send their most senior representatives to the committee early in 2018.  We cannot pencil in dates or anything like that.  We will talk about scheduling meetings over a couple of days if we can get them to come in on a particular date.  Those letters of invitation have gone out this week and we wait to hear from them in due course.<\/p> <p>  The following week we have the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection which will be straightforward.  It is a very big Department and there are lots of questions to ask.  The following Thursday, 14 December, we are starting into chapter 3 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General dealing with the cost of banking stabilisation.  IBRC liquidation has been mentioned for special consideration as part of that meeting.<\/p> <p>  I am most keen that instead of having public sessions here and that being the end of it, the Committee of Public Accounts should draft a summary of our meetings and any conclusions and recommendations we make.  Since we came back at the end of September, we are being assisted by an additional staff member who is now carrying out drafting work on a report of every meeting we have had and the key topics covered.  I will summarise them now in a minute.  That has been done since we came back in September with a view to producing a report on our work every so often.  It is part of our duty when we find something, not to walk out the door but to put it in writing in a report, send it to the Minister and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to get a formal response and follow through.  <\/p> <p>  On 28 September we had HIQA in.  On 5 October, we had the IDA in.  On 12 October, we had Transport Infrastructure Ireland in.  On 19 October, we had Tusla in.  On 27 October, we had the HSE to deal with section 38 and section 39.  We have dealt with the issue of Garda stations.  I think we have nearly concluded it today.   The secretariat is now working on the report and we will have it next month.  The reports will not be very extensive.  They will be a short chapter to summarise each of the meetings and recommendations.  We will have an update with a view to the following week having a look at a draft report with those six chapters in it.  We might then sign off on it a week or so later, probably with a view to launching it in early January.  We have enough on our plate between now and Christmas.  There is no point in launching a report Christmas week.  We could nearly get it put to bed.  I do not think the report will be too complicated.  Some people will be interested in some chapters and some people will be interested in others.<\/p><p>We might have a full briefing at next week's meeting, even if we have to do it in private session, with a view to having a preliminary draft ready as soon as possible.  I have seen the <i>modus operandi <\/i>of the secretariat and it is starting to put a nice, concise report together for us.  The plan then would be to have a report on the five or six meetings between mid November and Christmas one month later.

I will start with a short introduction to myself and my background.  I have a background in law and sociology.  I was professor of health law for more than 20 years in the University of Amsterdam in the faculties of law and medicine, in the academic medical centre where my colleague, Professor Pajkrt, also works.  I was a former editor-in-chief of a European journal of health law and of the Dutch journal of health law.  For more than 25 years I was a member of the Dutch health council advising the government on health and the ethical and legal aspects of health care, and, in relation to today's subject, I was responsible for the first evaluation of the abortion Act in the Netherlands which took place in 2005, 20 years after it was issued in 1985.  We conducted a nationwide study of how it was applied and functioned.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the invitation to inform it about abortion law and practice in the Netherlands.  We have already given the committee an overview of the Dutch situation in our joint paper.  In this opening statement we will briefly summarise this paper, focusing first on the law, which I will do, and then on the practice in the Netherlands, which my colleague, Professor Pajkrt, will do.   <\/p> <p>  I will say a few words first on the termination of pregnancy Act as it was enacted in 1984.<\/p><p>Terminating a pregnancy is a crime under Article 296 of the Dutch penal code.  The abortion Act is based on the criminal law and abortion is an exception to the basic prohibition in the criminal law.  According to the fifth paragraph of Article 296, abortion will not be punished if carried out by a doctor in a hospital or abortion clinic with a licence in accordance with the termination of pregnancy Act.  The Act is known in common or lay terms as the abortion Act and I will use this term in the rest of my contribution.  The Act was adopted in 1981 and, as I stated, it came into force in 1984 after a long history and more than ten years of public and political debate.  Several Bills were introduced in Parliament and only the last Bill was narrowly accepted with a voting margin of 38 in favour and 37 against.  The two conflicting values that had to be accommodated in the legislation were clearly expressed by the Government of the Netherlands during parliamentary proceedings.  The Government stated:<\/p><blockquote>The Bill is based on the view that women, who are in a situation of emergency due to an unwanted pregnancy, should receive help.  But we consider the termination of unborn human life as such a serious act, that it is only acceptable if unavoidable because of that emergency.  This means that the physician, the woman and others that may be involved before the decision to terminate, need to act with utmost care and in awareness of their responsibility towards unborn human life and of the consequences for the woman.<\/blockquote><p>At the moment, 93 hospitals and 15 clinics have a licence to terminate pregnancies within the limits set by the abortion Act.  Licences are granted by the Minister of health to establishments that satisfy statutory requirements relating to the quality of treatment in terms of medical competence and facilities as well as psychological care.  The directors of these establishments must submit periodic reports to the Health Care Inspectorate about the number of patients they have treated and some characteristics of these patients.  The figures are published in the inspectorate's annual report.  It is important to stress that abortion is not seen as a routine medical procedure but as one that may only be carried out at the request of the woman if her circumstances leave her no other alternative.<br\/><br\/>I will say a few words about the key provisions of the abortion Act, which relate to careful decision-making, because this is the substance of the Act.  Termination may only take place if a situation of emergency of the woman makes this inevitable.  An emergency refers to the psychological state of mind of the woman due to an unwanted pregnancy and does not require the risk of physical or mental injury.  The Act does not provide substantive, general criteria for assessing whether the situation of the woman amounts to an emergency.  The legislator has adopted this approach because the decision to terminate a pregnancy must be taken with due regard for the individual circumstances of each case.<br\/><br\/>Both the woman and the doctor are responsible for the process of reaching a decision, although the decision as such is ultimately made by the woman.  The physician shall assist the woman requesting an abortion in making up her mind.  For that purpose, the doctor must provide the woman with appropriate information about other solutions to her situation and see to it that her request is made and maintained freely and without undue pressure from other persons.  The doctor must also see to it that the woman insists on her request only after careful consideration.  To ensure sufficient reflection, the Act requires a reflection period of five days between the initial request of the woman and the eventual termination of her pregnancy.  An exception to this requirement is only possible when the health or life of the woman is at risk.<br\/><br\/>I will not elaborate much on other provisions of the abortion Act.  One important point, however, is that health professionals are never obliged and cannot be obliged, for instance, by employers or other persons, to perform an abortion and conscientious objections must always be respected.  Furthermore, physicians carrying out abortions must keep medical records on the reasons in each case they decided to terminate a pregnancy.  If requested, they must give the inspectorate access to these data.  Mention should also be made of the obligation to provide adequate care after the termination has been performed.  This includes not only a medical check and psycho-social assistance, if needed, but an obligation on the establishment where the abortion takes place to provide information and education concerning the prevention of undesired pregnancies.<br\/><br\/>I will now say a few words on what does not fall under the abortion Act.  I refer to three different interventions.  First, so-called morning after methods, such as the use of a morning after pill, are not considered to be a way to induce an abortion and are, therefore, not covered by the Act.  The reason is that these are methods to prevent conception, which means there will be no pregnancy.  The second circumstance that does not fall within the Act is when abortion takes place as an unavoidable side-effect of a necessary medical intervention or if continuation of the pregnancy would endanger the life of the mother.  Although formally such an abortion still comes under the penal code, no prosecution will take place because the doctor is considered to have acted in a situation of <i>force majeure<\/i>and he or she can invoke the defence of necessity in legal terms, resulting from a conflict of duties.  Criminal proceedings will not be taken in such circumstances.<br\/><br\/>The third intervention is slightly more complicated and relates to inducing an abortion within 44 days after the first day of the last menstrual period, that is, where menstruation is 16 days overdue.  This circumstance does not fall within the provisions of the abortion Act and is, if I may say so, a bit special.  It means that although the abortion must still be performed in a hospital or an abortion clinic with a licence, formally, the provisions of the abortion Act, including the statutory waiting and reflection period, do not apply.  This interpretation of the Act dates to the beginning of the 1980s when the abortion Act was adopted and came into force.  At that time, it was not yet possible to confirm the existence of an early pregnancy beyond doubt.  Although this is no longer the case - we now have far better medical methods, on which Professor Pajkrt will elaborate, if necessary - this restrictive interpretation of the scope of the Act has survived until today.  In practice, however, the requirements of the Act relating to careful decision-making are usually observed in such cases of early pregnancy.<br\/><br\/>While the abortion Act does not set a time limit for abortion, the penal code does.  According to Article 82a of the code, abortion amounts to a crime against human life if the unborn child has developed to the point where it is able to survive outside the womb.  This is known as foetal viability.  On the basis of current medical opinion, this is after 24 weeks of gestation.  In practice, however, a period of 22 weeks is used, if I am correct.  After this time limit, the doctor involved can only defend himself or herself by invoking a situation of necessity or a conflict of duties.<br\/><br\/>If I may, I will conclude by saying a few words on the evaluation of the abortion Act which took place in 2005.  Many health laws in the Netherlands are evaluated after four or five years.<\/p><p>The idea is that we should have a look at whether they work in practice, whether they are complied with, whether they achieve their goals, etc.  There was no such obligation within the abortion Act itself.  Perhaps that is because it was already enacted in the 1980s.  The way it operates in practice, however, is closely followed, in particular, by pro-life groups - of course, we have them in the Netherlands - and some of the political parties which are concerned that our legislation is applied too liberally.  To address these concerns, when a new coalition was formed in 2002, it was agreed that the application of the abortion Act would be the subject of a nationwide study.<\/p><p> In 2005, as I said, the evaluation report was published.  Its overall conclusion is that the compliance by clinics and hospitals with the Act was satisfactory and that health professionals did what the law required of them to ensure that decisions concerning abortion were taken in a careful way.  Furthermore, the report concludes that abortion services are available and accessible where needed and that, in general, they are of good quality.<\/p><p> One interesting point we found relates to the interviews we held with many women who had gone through this process of requesting an abortion and having one.  I picked this out of the 250-page report to put it forward here.  According to the women who were interviewed, the reasons for requesting an abortion are quite diverse.  They range from financial and housing constraints, to age, the fact that the family is already complete, a broken or fragile relationship, lack of possibilities to raise a child, and then, of course, sometimes medical reasons in the strict sense of the word.  Most often, there is more than one reason to request abortion.  This is also confirmed in a later study conducted in 2012 by the University of Utrecht and commissioned by the Ministry of Health in the Netherlands.  The outcome was that most women who were interviewed said that their final decision was the result of a number of reasons and should be seen against the background of their present situation in life.  All of them, according to the report, experienced the decision to terminate their pregnancies as a hard one, and some of them experienced it as the most difficult decision in their lives.<\/p><p> Finally, last year, a new evaluation of the abortion Act was planned.  It should have taken place this year but has been postponed because the Government fell.  It was replaced last month by a new Government and the Parliament decided to allow the latter to decide on how this new evaluation of the Act should proceed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Sjef Gevers","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511445600,"counter":1344,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Gevers.

I am a professor in obstetrics, in particular, prenatal diagnosis and obstetric ultrasound, at the academic medical centre of the University of Amsterdam.  I was trained as a gynaecologist at Medical Centre Alkmaar, which is a general hospital, and afterwards in the Academic Medical Centre in Amsterdam, which is a tertiary referral centre.  I was trained as a general gynaecologist in all aspects of the specialty.  Before and during my residency, I did my PhD on prenatal screening for chromosome anomalies and I worked later and contributed to the national introduction of prenatal screening in the Netherlands.  Following my residency, I did a two-year clinical fellowship in foetal medicine at University College London Hospital.  Once I came back to the Netherlands in 2005, I started working again at the Academic Medical Centre as a consultant in foetal and maternal medicine.  I have been head of the foetal medicine unit since 2010 and was appointed professor in 2016.<\/p> <p>  I am involved in numerous committees of the Dutch Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.  Since the introduction of the prenatal screening programme, I have been a member on several working parties concerned with the quality of care of the programme and I have been advising the Ministry of Health on several abortion issues.<\/p> <p>  My presence here has been requested to answer the committee's question about Dutch abortion care.  The abortion care is imbedded within the ethical framework of patient autonomy and is completely woman centred.  The objective of Dutch abortion care is to have a thorough and comprehensive process without creating any obstacles.<\/p> <p>  I will briefly take the committee through the statement it has already received.  I will not go through it extensively but I understand some of the people are following this online only and they do not have the statement.  I will skip certain parts and if the committee cannot follow me, that is why.<\/p> <p>  Since 2016, there has been a national co-operation agreement between the Dutch Association of Abortion Specialists, the Dutch psycho-social counselling service for questions of unintended pregnancy, adoption and abortion, the Dutch Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and the Royal Dutch Organisation of Midwives.  The Dutch College of General Practitioners, which is not listed, is also involved in this agreement.  Women with an unplanned or undesirable pregnancies and doubts about continuation of their pregnancies will generally go to their general practitioners - this is about which professionals are involved.<\/p> <p>  In 56% of cases, the general practitioner will be the first contact.  He or she may counsel the woman about her options and may refer her to an abortion clinic, a gynaecologist or for further psychological counselling.  General practitioners have their own national guidelines.  There is an English version which is available.  In 25% of cases, women go directly to the abortion clinic and it is the first contact.  The abortion clinic doctor may counsel the woman about her options.  They may perform the procedure or they may refer the woman for further counselling.  The other 25% either go to a midwife, a gynaecologist or some other professional.  If the pregnant woman goes to the midwife, the midwife never will be the referring physician.  The midwife is not legally a doctor and should refer the woman, and then the GP or gynaecologist has to refer the woman.  The first contact may be a gynaecologist or other doctors.  For example, the doctors of women with a cardiac problem in which it is unsafe to have a ongoing pregnancy may also refer them.<\/p> <p>  There are general considerations in cases of unplanned and undesirable pregnancy.  One of the first questions one asks is whether there was a pregnancy test performed and whether there should be a repeat test.  Then one should always ask if the pregnancy was planned or unplanned.  That seems contradictory but it is, of course, not always so.  A planned pregnancy may become undesirable and an unplanned pregnancy may become desirable.  Ask about the circumstances leading to the pregnancy and whether or not the woman was on contraceptives.  Mention there is always a choice and a dilemma in case of unplanned pregnancy.  Ask about a dating with a scan.  If there has not been one, please have one performed, preferably transvaginally.  If the woman is determined to have an abortion, she should mention that on her request to the person performing the scan.  Is the partner present at the consultation?  If so, explore whether the woman was not forced by the partner or the person sitting beside her and that it is a voluntary request.  Explore whether there has been any sexual abuse.  Be aware of cultural and religious factors.  Ask whether there would be a risk of genital tract infections, but in case of abortions on request as opposed to abortions due to prenatal diagnosis, we always test for sexually transmitted diseases in the Netherlands.  We always discuss contraceptives - what kind of contraceptives the woman will use after she has had the abortion.  Is the request consistent or does the woman seem to be in a state of panic and, as a result, would she potentially benefit from more time to make a decision?  If so, refer woman for further counselling.  When referring a woman for an abortion, always document the first date of the abortion request.  Of course, there are several websites and I have included the address of one.  Women can go online.  There is a help choice and they can go through it.<\/p> <p>  There are also some questions one should always ask, including, \"Are you certain about your decision?\"  It seems obvious but one has to ask.  The others are: \"How did you reach this decision?\"; \"Is this your own choice?\"; \"Have you considered other options?\"; \"Would you like me to explain the options?\"; and \"Do you need help to make a proper decision?\"<\/p><p>If the partner is present, the partner also should be asked.  In case of ambivalence, it is important that the woman understands that she is responsible for her own choice.  Ultimately, she has to make the decision.  Nobody is going to make that decision for her.  The woman should not be forced into making a decision; rather she should be helped to make a choice.  It is important not to blame the woman for being ambivalent and that the emergency situation of the woman is considered.  If the woman remains ambivalent, she should be referred for further counselling.  In the Netherlands women are also referred to FIOM, which is the Dutch agency that helps women who give consideration to or opt to have their child adopted.<br\/><br\/><i><\/i>Time is important in any case of unplanned pregnancy in view of the method of abortion.  Once a woman is referred, a quick appointment is mandatory, preferably within a week or, at least, within ten days.  From the moment the woman indicates she is considering an abortion and the actual treatment, a reflection time of at least five completed days is mandatory in the Netherlands.  This reflection time is not mandatory until a gestational age of six weeks plus two days, which is the 44 days after the first day of the last menstrual period.  However, 65% of these women do have a reflection period of more than five days.<br\/><br\/>There are several ways to terminate a pregnancy.  A woman can have a surgical termination, a medical termination or a combined termination, which involves the use of medication followed by a surgical procedure.  Women may choose where to have an abortion and what type of abortion they would like, although their choice is, of course, dependent on gestational age.  Women over 16 years of age do not need parental consent.  Women between 12 and 16 years do require parental consent but we may withhold it if we believe it is a reasonable argument. <br\/><br\/>Approximately 90% of abortions in the Netherlands are carried out in abortion clinics.  The Dutch Health Care Inspectorate produces an annual report with statistical information on terminations performed in the Netherlands in the preceding year.  The last report was in 2015.  As the data in the report are aggregated data, it is not possible to correlate between the different components of the abortion registration.  In 2015, approximately 30,000 abortions were carried out in the Netherlands, almost 4,000, 13%, of which were on behalf of women from a foreign country.  Of these 30,000 abortions, 8,500, 28%, were carried out before 44 days and as such these terminations are not considered under the abortion Act.  Approximately 16,000, 50%, were performed before seven weeks gestation, while almost 9,000, 29%, were performed between seven and 12 weeks gestation.  Thus, 80%, of all the abortions were performed in the first trimester, before 13 weeks. <br\/><br\/>The majority of women undergoing an abortion were between 25 and 30 years of age.  Only 83 pregnancies were terminated in women under 15 years.  In 2015, the total number of pregnancy terminations in teenagers was 3,079.  This number has been decreasing slowly over the last couple of years.  This is reflected in the percentage of teenage pregnancies that go to term.  This is very low in comparison with other European countries. <br\/><br\/><i><\/i>Since 2007, all pregnant women in the Netherlands may undergo pre-natal screening.  They are offered a combined test for screening for Down's syndrome, Edward's syndrome and Patau syndrome.  As of 2017, non-invasive pre-natal testing, NIPT, has been added as a first trier test to screen for the above mentioned trisomies.  Moreover, every women is offered a 20 week scan.  Since 2011, it is possible to address whether an abortion is the result of pre-natal diagnosis.  In 2015, a little over 1,000 of all abortions were performed after pre-natal diagnosis, the majority of which were carried out in a hospital.  We know from the aggregated data that more than 30% of the abortions in hospitals are due to pre-natal diagnosis, compared with only 0.5% in abortion clinics.  However, we do not have any knowledge on diagnosis nor is it possible to correlate the date with gestational age.  It is likely that abortion due to pre-natal diagnosis will be carried out in the second trimester due to the time it takes to get a definite diagnosis.  Thus, we can assume that around 20% of the second trimester abortions is due to pre-natal diagnosis.<br\/><br\/>Of all women undergoing abortion, 75% leave the clinic or hospital with a prescription for contraceptives.  Since 2012, it is mandatory to provide sexual education to all schoolgoing children.  This starts in elementary school.  Up to 2011, contraceptives were reimbursed for every woman.  Since 2011, only women up to 21 years are reimbursed.  In the Netherlands, abortion is free for everyone who is legal and has a social security number.  It is subsidised care.  The costs are not reimbursed by the insurance companies but are subsidised by the ministry of health.

We introduced our programme in 2007.  There are two elements to the programme.  Women are first asked if they want to receive information about prenatal screening.  If the answer is affirmative, we offer the information but women have a right not to know.  It is a strong belief that if women do not want all of the information, we should not give it to them.  If the woman says that she would like to have the information, she is counselled about the fact that there is a possibility of being screened for chromosomal anomalies.  That used to be done via the combined test.  We still have the combined test but since April 2017, we now offer the non-invasive prenatal test, known as the NIPT, a blood test which determines if it is likely that the baby has trisomy 21, 18 and 13.  The NIPT is more sensitive than the combined test in detecting foetal trisomies.  However, it lacks the ability to see other problems in the foetus at an early stage.  Every woman is counselled about the 20 week scan and is offered such a scan, which we actually try to perform at around 19 weeks.  We do this because we feel that if there is an anomaly, one needs time to do further investigations.  Such investigations take time and it is better if one has a little bit more time so that women do not have to rush into making decisions.<\/p> <p>  The uptake of screening in the Netherlands for the combined test has always been around 40%.  However, it is very regionally dependent.  In Amsterdam, where we work, it is quite high but in more rural areas, the uptake is lower.  It is also quite low in the north of Holland.  It depends a little on where one lives.  We thought that once we introduced NIPT in the Netherlands that women would just rush to have it but that has not happened.  The uptake has stayed more or less the same.  It may be a little bit higher but it is not something that everyone is rushing into.  One of the arguments put forward to explain this is that the combined test and the NIPT are not free in the Netherlands.  One must pay &euro;169 for the entire combined test or &euro;175 for NIPT.  The rest of the cost of NIPT, which is more expensive than that, is paid for by the Ministry of Health.  It is a study so it is under a study protocol and the licence runs to 1 April 2020.  It will be evaluated then to determine how well it is working.  Women have to pay for that.  However, the 20 week scan is free.  If one has health care in the Netherlands and one receives a treatment, one must pay the first &euro;385 but there are certain treatments not included in that.  The 20 week scan is one such treatment.  If that is the only treatment one receives in a year, the health insurance companies will pay for it.  The uptake of the 20 week scan is quite difficult to determine.  We have everyone in a database who has the scan but it is more difficult to figure out who is not in the database.  We estimate, however, that the uptake is around 95%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112300002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Eva Pajkrt"},{"type":"speech","time":1511445600,"counter":1354,"content":"<p>I have one last question which is linked.

He asked how the regulatory system operates and, if I understood him correctly, what position it places physicians in, if they can go along with it and what problems they may encounter with the current system.  At first sight, it might seem that our law could deter doctors because abortion is still a crime and perhaps one could expect that they would be afraid of performing an abortion.  However, the abortion law has been in place for more than 30 years and is broadly accepted.  It has been an accepted practice.  The provision in the criminal code is not a deterrent as long as one remains within the well defined limits of the abortion Act.  The further question was whether it is easy for doctors to operate and proceed within those limits.  Basically it is, because there is so much emphasis on the procedure of coming to a good decision.  We do not have a system with substantive criteria, for instance, whether in this case there is a medical problem, how serious it is and whether the life of the mother is in danger.  No, the system is open to a large extent but there must be a counselling process aimed at careful decision-making.  That allows doctors to take on board different reasons and motives for abortion and different individual situations.  That does not make the decision less serious and far-reaching, but basically it is an open system that does not confine doctors to certain pre-defined situations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Sjef Gevers"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511445600,"counter":1362,"content":"<p>The next questioner is Senator Mullen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112300002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Acting Chairman (Deputy Bernard Durkan)"},{"type":"speech","time":1511445600,"counter":1363,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending and for their very interesting presentation, which brought to light something I had not realised, namely, that the number of Irish women having abortions in the Netherlands is very small.  There has been a narrative in this country that while 3,000 to 3,500 Irish women go to Britain for abortions, we are often reminded that there are more going to the Netherlands and so forth.  I had not realised the number is so small and does not, to any significant degree, impact on Irish abortion rates abroad.<\/p> <p>  I will start by asking about the Dutch abortion figures.  The Netherlands is presented as a country that has very low abortion rates.  However, from what I can see, it is more accurate to say that Britain, France and other such countries are in the highest tier and that the abortion rates in the Netherlands more resemble those of Italy and Portugal, in that it is in a second tier of abortion rates.  The figures presented to the Citizens' Assembly, using the UN approach, put the Dutch rate at 9.7 per 1,000, which would be more than twice the Irish rate of 4.5 per 1,000.<\/p><p>However, the British Office for National Statistics calculates abortions as a percentage of total pregnancies.  Do the witnesses ever use that approach to avoid things that may change from country to country, such as fertility rates?  If one looks at the rate of abortions out of total pregnancies, taking out the 4,000 German and French abortions, it was at 27,000 in 2015 out of the total of 170,000 pregnancies, so the Netherlands seems to have a rate of 13% or 14% whereas in Ireland, we have one in 20, a rate of 5%.

The previous speaker, Senator Mullen, has given the impression that we know the numbers of terminations from Ireland.  In fact we do not.  The reason we do not is because while we have a figure for the number of women who register in Britain - which is around 3,500 - that figure does not include the number of women who take abortion pills.  Estimates vary on this number but it seems to be some 1,500 women.  The total figure also gives no account of the women who do not give their true address.  A number of women do this and they have a good reason to do this; if they give a UK address they may be able to access treatments without having to pay.  To be frank, we do not know the abortion figures for Ireland.  We do know that thousands of women travel each year.  I just wanted to correct that point.<\/p> <p>  The first thing that struck me is that there is a very ethical framework in place in the Netherlands.

Of course, if the woman has progressed a little bit later in gestation, there are complications.  This issue is addressed in the annual report.  This complication mainly has to do with the fact that if the gestation is further along, say at 20 weeks, there is a 20% chance that the placenta will be retained.  The woman would have to go to the emergency room to have the placenta removed.  It is not very clear to hospitals how to register that.

Health and sexual education is very important because if we do not do it children will go online anyway.  Everybody has a smart phone now and sometimes what we see on social media is not how we want our kids to be educated about sex.  It is very good that we have a system in the Netherlands where sex education is mandatory - it is not discretionary.  In elementary school there is a programme.  We need to show it to people and we need to see what we are teaching kids.  Parents are involved.  I was asked by the school to give a sexual education course.

I think if there was one, as I have tried to say before, it would be widely endorsed.  The Senator says the language is harsh.  To some extent it is.  I think in several countries, maybe most countries of Europe, the criminal code is still the basis when we talk about abortion.  Abortion is only allowed within specific circumstances spelled out in national laws.  In the Netherlands, we have this concept of emergency, which was already mentioned.  An important issue in the parliamentary debates in the 1980s was how this concept should be applied.  The final agreement was that the law should not go into further detail when one could say that an emergency existed.  This was done deliberately to take account of the fact that the situations in which a woman might be in a situation of despair because of an unwanted or unplanned pregnancy might be so diverse.  The Legislature refrained from going into substantive criteria because of this.  That explains why so many different situations can be taken into account, provided that the decision is made in due care and after good reflection and so on.  The procedural aspect of the law is more important than substantive reasons.  They are not to be found in the law except for the very general concept of emergency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112300002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Sjef Gevers"},{"type":"speech","time":1511445600,"counter":1411,"content":"<p>I will not pursue that issue.  I suppose it is a matter for philosophy rather than anything else.  On the legislation, I think I am correct in saying that an abortion will not be allowed to a young person between the ages of 12 and 16 without parental consent.  However, should a reasonable argument be put forward by the woman in question, abortion would be allowed.  I am somewhat surprised that a 12 year old, pre-teen girl would be allowed to argue that kind of a case.

Professor Pajkrt may follow up and talk about practice.  In our law on patient rights, which is a more general law, we have a majority age for health care decisions of 16 years.  When one is 16, one is entitled to decide for one's self without parental consent.  Between 12 and 16, we have a dual system.  For an intervention, we must have the consent of the minor and his or her parents.<\/p> <p>  In the context of abortion, that law might say that abortion can only take place if the parents of the pregnant person are also in agreement with it.  However, we have an exception, not only for abortion but also for other medical procedures, in cases where a minor continues to insist that he or she wants to have it.  For instance, a couple of months ago we had a very controversial case about a young cancer patient who refused further treatment.  This exception came into the debate also.  The judge of the court that had to decide on the case agreed that in such a case, if a minor between 12 and 16 insists on having or not having a certain procedure, the voice of the minor prevails.  That applies also to abortion cases.<\/p> <p>  The problem, of course, is that even if parents do not have to consent, they usually will have to be informed.  I guess in practice the person who is requested to perform an abortion will have a discussion with the minor about why she does not want her parents to be informed and will suggest it might be better if they were informed.  If there is a strong argument not to inform them, and if this is strongly in the interests of the minor, the law makes it possible that the procedure remains confidential and the parents are not involved.  This will only take place after long discussion and careful decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112300002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Sjef Gevers"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511445600,"counter":1413,"content":"<p>We have no data on that.

On the other hand, the baby's life is still ended by abortion.  Does Professor Gevers think that an unborn baby has value?  Science shows that the baby is separate to the mother.  Should the baby, therefore, get separate protection?  Professor Gevers is probably aware that last Friday was World Prematurity Day, which is celebrated in Ireland and the Netherlands.

I take the Deputy's question to be whether there is a contradiction in it.  He referred to what I was saying about it not being a routine medical procedure.  I think there is no contradiction because it is not considered, in law or in practice, as a normal medical procedure, as a routine, which is only a question of medical expertise, technique and norms.  In my discipline of health law, we say that not everything doctors do can be regulated only by their own norms.  Some things must be considered by society.  Abortion is an example in this regard because there is more at stake than only medical intervention to solve a medical problem.  In that sense, it is not routine or normal.  That is why we have kept and will keep the basic prohibition on abortion in our criminal law and it is why we have a time limit in our penal code to say that after 24 weeks of gestation, only in very exceptional circumstances, the numbers on which were set out half an hour or so ago, can abortion take place.  As such, there is protection of unborn life and respect for unborn life, but the choice of the woman remains in the centre.  Perhaps, our system will have more protection of unborn life than others which do not respect the choice of the women concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112300002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Sjef Gevers"},{"type":"speech","time":1511445600,"counter":1438,"content":"<p>Does Professor Gevers agree that there are two people involved, namely, the unborn and the mother?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112300002#N00400","speaker":"1331"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511445600,"counter":1439,"content":"<p>We do not consider the unborn as a person in the sense of the law.

It was, therefore, nice and refreshing to have this follow today to cancel out yesterday's nonsense.

Some 35% of women in such cases make an earlier decision because they want to have this simple procedure without waiting until the pregnancy is further advanced.  In cases where women are further on in their pregnancies, 3% have abortions.  There is an escape.  I will explain how this is done.

We know, from the literature and personal experience, that abortion is always a very difficult decision.  If a woman has her arguments very straight before the event, it is easier for her to cope with it afterwards.  In that respect, the reflection time gives each woman an opportunity to get her act together and think about all the pros and cons.  This is especially true for a woman who is confronted with structural or chromosomal anomalies.  If she is considering termination, her first reaction is always \"My baby has this and I want a termination now\".  I always advise such a woman not to do it while she is going through loop after loop on a rollercoaster.  When the rollercoaster finally stops at the end of the day, if she has had a termination and has returned home, she will think about what has happened and it will really hit her.  The grieving process has to start before a woman rushes into an abortion.  I do not have data or psychological studies on that, but I have been counselling women for many years and not once has a woman come back to me to say it was inhuman of me to make her wait.  Women tend to tell me it was nice for them and their partners to have a great weekend together to do something nice, to think about it, to discuss it, to talk to their families and to make the decision.

The Dutch Government agreed with that recommendation, but it did not take many measures to implement it.  It was scared to make any change because it was worried about compromising the delicate law in this area.  In 2016, the health minister submitted a Bill to the Dutch Parliament that would allow GPs to offer abortion pills to women who request them.  We referred to this in our position paper.  There has been a lot of debate about the Bill.  It will not go further because the new Government does not like it.

I was interested by Professor Pajkrt's submission on reasons for abortion.  Women make difficult decisions about whether to have abortions.  I was interested in the list of reasons the witness provided, such as financial considerations, housing, age, whether one's family is complete, broken or fragile relationships and the lack of possibilities regarding raising a child.  In the committee's discussions on the future of abortion rights in this country, we classified such reasons as being socioeconomic in nature.  I was very interested that Professor Pajkrt did not list some of the issues that have caused most discussion in this country, such as rape, incest, fatal foetal abnormality, a risk to the life or health of a woman or suicidal ideation.  As an obstetrician, does Professor Pajkrt consider the latter risks to almost automatically be grounds for an abortion?  Is it true to say that in the case of a woman who said she had been raped and wanted an abortion, a young girl who became pregnant as a result of incest in a family or a woman presenting with a fatal foetal abnormality, there would be no discussion of whether an abortion is warranted?  Can Professor Pajkrt say how one measures up against the other?  Having listened to all the experts who have come before the committee, some of whom have been fantastic, the evidence has been that women mainly choose to terminate a pregnancy for socioeconomic reasons and that reasons such as those relating to rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormality are thankfully the exception.  That is also borne out in my experience.  Therefore, if a society is to liberalise the availability of abortion and give women choice in that regard, socioeconomic reasons for termination must be strongly considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112300002#S00600","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511445600,"counter":1526,"content":"<p>I absolutely agree.  The Deputy has made a couple of points.  In Holland, we call such terminations medical abortions but the use of the word \"medical\" is potentially confusing.  It is more accurate to call it an abortion for medical reasons.  Such abortions can arise if the foetus or the mother has a medical condition and it would be unsafe to carry on with the pregnancy.  If a woman has psychiatric difficulties or is suicidal, that could also be a reason.  There has been a long discussion about the latter reason in terms of when the mother's life is really in danger.  In the latest evaluation, that is now outside of the criminal law.  If it is mandatory to perform an abortion in order to save the woman's life, a doctor does not have to blink or wait but can just do it and there will be no repercussions whatsoever.<\/p> <p>  We call the other reasons for terminations social indications.

Another example could be a woman experiencing extreme poverty who has two small children and lives in a tiny one-bedroom apartment.  This is what one comes across.  They are desperate stories.  One does not encounter people who have taken the decision lightly.  As I outlined in my opening statement, there is a difference between unplanned and unwanted.

The 2017 Estimate provides a net sum of &euro;224.6 million for the Vote.  However, net outturn this year is expected to be &euro;235.3 million, leaving a shortfall of &euro;10.7 million.<\/p><p> Subhead A2 is the largest subhead of the Vote.  It covers spending on all pension benefits for former members of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, and their dependants.  It accounts for over 95% of all military pensions spending, including gratuities.  It is demand-driven and non-discretionary.  The original provision of &euro;220.1 million for subhead A2 will not be sufficient to meet all requirements for the year.  The shortfall in this subhead is estimated at &euro;10.8 million.<\/p><p> I will outline the main reasons for the shortfall in subhead A2.  The number of Defence Forces pensioners has continued to rise during the year, with some 12,350 military pensioners across all categories.  This is a net increase of about 1,350 since 2007.  It is expected that approximately 320 military personnel will retire with a pension and lump sum in 2017.  Overall, this level of turnover during the year was greater than what was provided for in the original Estimate.<\/p><p> In other areas of the public service, most people leave at a standard retirement age, meaning that their numbers and timing of departure can generally be predicted well in advance.  However, the PDF is atypical.  The majority of military personnel who retire on pension do so voluntarily, that is, before reaching maximum retirement age and at a time of their own choosing.  As such, the details are not known in advance, which can contribute to greater than expected expenditure on military retirement benefits in any given year.  This situation is a product of the availability, for operational and human resources, HR, policy reasons, of the early payment of pension benefits immediately on retirement after relatively short periods of service and regardless of age.<\/p><p> In any given year, forecasting of Defence Forces pensions expenditure and the exact numbers of retirements is difficult.  During 2016, 75% of military personnel who retired on pension did so voluntarily.  The picture is much the same for 2017.  In addition, many retirees qualified for the maximum retirement benefits, which also contributes to the ongoing increased costs.<\/p><p> A shortfall arises in subhead A3, which covers the cost of military disability pensions, disablement lump sums and related dependants' pensions.  It accounts for some 4% of all military pensions expenditure.  The original provision of &euro;8.7 million for this subhead will not be enough to meet the full costs arising during the year.  A shortfall of &euro;430,000 is expected and is due to greater than expected expenditure in respect of new disability pension and disablement lump sum awards over the course of 2017.<\/p><p> The combined shortfall of &euro;11.3 million in subheads A2 and A3 will be partly offset by expected savings of &euro;260,000 in subheads A4, A5 and A6, combined with surplus receipts of &euro;300,000 in subhead B.<\/p><p> To sum up, the purpose of the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 35 is to seek additional funding of &euro;10.83 million for subhead A2, seek additional funding of &euro;430,000 for subhead A3, reallocate savings of &euro;260,000 from subheads A4, A5 and A6 to subhead A2, and reallocate projected surplus receipts of &euro;300,000 from subhead B into subhead A2.  This leaves a net Supplementary Estimate requirement of &euro;10.7 million.<\/p><p> As I previously indicated to the committee, it has been my intention to seek extra funding for military pensions as part of the overall future budgetary negotiations.  Arising from those negotiations, the gross allocation for Army pensions was increased by &euro;6 million for 2017.  I am pleased to inform the committee that, as recently announced in budget 2018, the Army pensions allocation will be further increased by &euro;9.5 million next year.  The military pensions funding envelope for 2019 will again be addressed next year as part of the process of ongoing engagement with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his officials.<\/p><p> Although the costs of recruitment to the PDF are not met from the Army pensions Vote, I will take this opportunity to update members on the measures being taken to replace personnel who are leaving the PDF through retirements and discharges generally.  I reiterate the Government's commitment to reaching a full strength of 9,500 PDF personnel as set out in the White Paper on Defence.  In that regard, I assure the committee that there is sufficient funding within the budget for a full strength PDF.<\/p><p> In terms of defence spending, budget 2018 delivered an extra &euro;25 million for 2018 and an additional &euro;98 million for capital expenditure out to 2021.  As I have acknowledged, however, the process of reaching and maintaining the 9,500 target strength level presents many challenges.  As with other areas of the public service, challenges have arisen for the Defence Forces in terms of the recruitment and retention of personnel with scarce and highly marketable skills.  This is always a factor where highly trained personnel are a desirable asset to any employer.  There is a particular challenge in retaining personnel with specialist and scarce skills but having spoken to my ministerial colleagues at European meetings, I note this is a challenge faced by military forces internationally.<\/p><p> I have welcomed the recent announcement by my colleague, the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, on the next phase of work of the Public Service Pay Commission.  I am pleased to see that the Defence Forces are highlighted as a priority area requiring a more comprehensive examination of underlying difficulties.  The Department of Defence, in conjunction with the Defence Forces, has raised recruitment and retention issues as part of its submission to the commission.  We will be making a further submission to it when it commences this next phase of its work.<\/p><p> As stated in the 2015 White Paper on Defence, continuous recruitment is the lifeblood of the Defence Forces organisation.  It provides young, motivated and enthusiastic personnel to replenish military formations for operational deployments.  As the committee is aware, there has been a concerted effort in recent years to ensure significant ongoing recruitment at enlisted and officer levels.  It is anticipated that 800 personnel will be inducted into the PDF during 2017.  This includes officer cadets, Air Corps apprentice aircraft technicians, direct entry officers for the Naval Service, medical doctors and, of course, general service recruits.<\/p><p> A new general service recruitment campaign was launched in September.  This builds upon the successes of previous campaigns and will provide for the induction of new personnel in 2018.  Aside from recruitment, there were also more than 1,400 promotions across all PDF ranks in the years 2014 to 2016.  Promotions within officer and non-commissioned officer, NCO, ranks are ongoing in order to fill vacancies and, to date in 2017, a further 190 personnel have been promoted.<\/p><p> A range of recruitment methods are being employed, including direct entry competitions for specialist positions, and the scope to expand direct entry further is being considered.  This includes actively considering the terms and conditions that would allow and encourage former members of the Defence Forces with specialist knowledge, skills and expertise to return to service to meet any identified skills gap.<\/p><p> The Government is committed, with the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, to retaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by the Government at home and overseas.<\/p><p> I commend this Supplementary Estimate for the Army pensions Vote to the committee.  I will be happy to take whatever questions arise and will do all that I can to answer them openly and honestly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017112300002#A00300","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511439300,"counter":1582,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and note that he stuck rigidly to my exhortation that he stay with the subject matter of the Supplementary Estimate.

Recruitment, which the Minister of State mentioned in his contribution, needs to be addressed but retention also needs to be addressed.   <\/p> <p>  I gather from some of the low-ranking members of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, that the availability of the disability pension is not widely known with the Defence Forces.

The processing time depends on the complexity, nature and range of medical conditions and injuries claimed.

Since 1995, Defence Forces officers pay a pay related social insurance, PRSI, class A contribution and their pensions are fully eligible for the social welfare system.  Those officers fulfilling the agreed criteria are eligible for a supplementary pension provided for by an agreement in 2009.  The retirement age for the rank of commandant was increased from 56 to 58 years to facilitate that arrangement.  The Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 came into operation and I gather from the Department and from the Minister of State that it does not provide for pre-existing superannuation arrangements.  Therefore, the terms of the 2009 agreement no longer apply to entrants post-January 2013.  The implication of this is that a new entrant to the Defence Forces as an officer from 1 January 2013 who is mandatorily retired at 58 or 60 will have a final benefit pension less the value of the contributory State pension.  New entrants will be at the loss of the value of the contributory State pension, which is currently &euro;12,390 until they reach the age of retirement at which that becomes payable.<\/p><p>They are at a loss.  It is an anomaly.  From what I gather, that issue was not brought up during the negotiations in respect of the 2012 Act.  There was an expectation on behalf of the Defence Forces and their representative association that this superannuation arrangement would continue in place, which is no longer the case.  This will require funds to fix it, and the Minister of State will be obliged to speak to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, to address this issue.  An officer who came in post 2013 and who knows that his or her pension will be severely reduced when he or she hits the mandatory retirement age will look to get out earlier.  These people will have to find employment at a younger age and start a new career.  In light of the retention difficulties we are facing, this is an area that can be addressed with minimal cost.  The Minister of State should consider this issue and come back to the committee - and to me personally as Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on defence - to give an answer as to how that anomaly is to be addressed.  <\/p><p> I want to go through the Minister's statement and the issues raised within it.  The main reasons for the shortfall are referred to, and I accept the difficulty in calculating what the pensions are year on year because members can leave voluntarily and at different ages.  However, I find it strange that the list of main reasons did not include the issue of retention and the fact that we are losing people at an alarming rate.  That is one reason there is a shortfall in the pensions budget.  I do not see anything in the Minister of State's statement and still have not seen a physical document that outlines the Department's retention policy.  I acknowledge huge effort is being put into recruitment but we are losing people at such an alarming rate that we cannot catch up with ourselves.  <\/p><p> In his statement, the Minister of State indicated that the Government is committed to reaching a strength level of 9,500.  It is difficult to marry that with the current state of our Defence Forces.  They are currently in an extremely poor state.  We are losing middle and senior management, that is, experienced people with expertise and skills.  Those are the people we need to train the officers and NCOs coming through the recruitment process into which so much effort is being put.  Officers who are recruited, go through their cadet school training and come out the other end as second lieutenants still are not fully trained to take up some of the posts they are expected to take up.  They do not have the expertise and skills to lean on, in terms of senior personnel to help train them further, to get them to the required level to operate as unit commanders.  <\/p><p> On the last page of his statement the Minister of State observed that \"continuous recruitment is the lifeblood of the Defence Forces\".  While I acknowledge this point is not directly related to Army pensions, I must mention the Reserve Defence Force, RDF.  If the RDF continues to operate as it does currently, it will cease to exist.  It is almost dead and gone.  Recruitment continues to be a major issue.  While I acknowledge recruitment within the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, is ongoing, the issues concerning RDF recruitment, including getting people through the process of medicals and Garda clearance, have not been rectified.  The RDF's strength at the moment is down to just over 1,000 personnel.  It pains me to see the organisation struggling to survive as it is.  In the near future we will no longer have an RDF unless something is done.  I have raised this issue with the Minister of State time and time again.  Towards the end of the Minister of State's statement, he noted he is \"actively considering the terms and conditions that would allow and encourage former members of the Defence Forces with specialist knowledge ... and expertise to return to service to meet any identified skills gap\".  We have identified skills gaps.  The Air Corps is a clear example of that.  We do not have enough pilots or aircraft technicians.  We do not have enough members to run a properly functioning Air Corps.  The time for actively considering terms and conditions has long passed.  That ship has sailed.  We need proper, concrete action which will encourage members to stay within the Defence Forces in the Air Corps, Army and Naval Service.  We have not seen that to date.  <\/p><p> The Minister of State has mentioned that the Government is committed, with the support of the Chief of Staff, to retaining the capacity of the Defence Forces within the resources available.  We do not have capacity in the Defence Forces to deliver the service that is required.  That is gone and has been lost.  It will take years to build up the skills and expertise we have lost.  It is a devastating place for the Defence Forces to be.  Had this been addressed a number of years ago, we would not be in the position we are in today.  We are where we are, however, and still do not have a retention policy.  This was made clear to the Minister of State at both the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO conference and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, conference that took place in recent months.  We need a retention policy, and it needs to be implemented immediately.  <\/p><p> In the context of the Defence Forces operating effectively, need I mention Rescue 116 and how top cover could not be provided?  We could not operate effectively within the Air Corps.  We have a new naval ship which we cannot man.  We have people in the Army who are double and triple-jobbing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017112300002#C01300","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511439300,"counter":1596,"content":"<p>I said I would give some latitude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017112300002#D00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1511439300,"counter":1597,"content":"<p>It is directly related to pensions.

I presume the Deputy is referring to the University of Limerick, UL, document.  My Department, the Defence Forces and the associations have taken that report very seriously.  We have actioned quite a number of points and are working through the document.  The report was carried out at a time of tough economic circumstances within the State.  Were the UL study to be carried out again, there would be different results.  There have been pay increases across the board for members of the Defence Forces.  Deputy O'Sullivan also spoke about specialist skills.  People retire right across the board, from different ranks and with different skill sets.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, has prioritised the Defence Forces, along with the health sector, to investigate recruitment and retention issues around specialist skills.  We are preparing for negotiations with the Public Service Pay Commission.  Work is ongoing on that at present in association with the representative organisations.<\/p> <p>  The ongoing financial difficulties in respect of Vote 35 were discussed.  We have had increases over the past two years.  We are in continuous negotiations with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his officials to address this issue.  We cannot say for definite at the start of each budgetary year how many people are going to retire.  It depends on whether they retire in January or November as to how much of a chunk will be taken out of our budget. <\/p> <p>  Disability as it relates to members of the Defence Forces was brought up.  There is a range of disabilities, including hearing problems and physical injuries to limbs and backs.  Those people go through a process, which includes medical documentation, as I outlined to the Chair at the start of the meeting.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Chambers mentioned supplementary pensions for officers.  I cannot negotiate the terms of reference for a supplementary pension here.<\/p><p>I addressed this at the recent Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, conference.  I stated I will be in consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Officials from the Department and RACO have been in contact with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this issue.  The Deputy said the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, addressed the matter during question time.  I have spoken to him about this, and I told RACO at its conference that I had spoken to the Minister.  There is ongoing consultation between that Department, my officials, the representative associations and me.  I cannot negotiate the terms of reference at this meeting.  It is a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p> I do not agree with the Deputy regarding the numbers leaving.  When I was appointed in May 2016, one of my first priorities was the number of members of the Permanent Defence Force and trying to get back up to a strength level of 9,500.  We have a full budget for 9,500 members.  In 2016, 569 members left and 619 people were taken in.  It has been out there for quite some time that more people are joining then leaving.  Since my appointment in May 2016 we have taken in just over 800 members, between enlisted ranks, the Naval Service, the Air Corps and cadets.  There is ongoing recruitment.  I have recruiting meetings on a quarterly basis, with Deputy Chief of Staff support, with all of those involved in recruitment to keep the pressure on and see where they are being trained, and I am quite content.  It will take me some time.  I have stated from the time of my appointment this will be a huge challenge as we are competing with a very strong economy, but this is a priority for me.  We are taking in more than are leaving.  Our strength level at the end of October was 9,219 personnel across all services.<\/p><p> The Deputy said that after their training personnel are not fully trained.  This is absolutely not the truth.  I am not sure if that is what the Deputy meant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017112300002#D00900","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511439300,"counter":1605,"content":"<p>I will clarify.

I spoke about this in February or March and I stated I wanted this to be a priority.  The terms and conditions are being worked on regarding re-entry.  There are officers who have retired from the Defence Forces, such as pilots, explosive ordnance disposal personnel or engineers, who want to go back to the organisation.  I am not saying there will be hundreds of them, but there are a number of them and I want to give them the opportunity to come back into the organisation.  Terms and conditions are being worked on with the Defence Forces and the Department and they have to go back to the representative organisations.  Let me state very clearly I will be making a decision on this myself if it is held up by any of the representative organisations.  This is a priority.  It is the right thing to do.  Of course, people coming back in cannot come back in at the same level as their peers.  They will have to come back in at a different level.  I accept this has to be worked on, and it is being worked on as part of the terms and conditions being developed.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the Air Corps not properly functioning.  As recently as yesterday, I spoke to the general officer commanding the Air Corps about any issues he has.  I have to say that even though it has huge challenges it is properly functioning.  Huge capital investment has been made and extra investment is being planned.  There are two classes of apprentice military aircraft technicians and approximately ten began training this year.  Ten cadet pilots began their training in October.  Other cadet classes are in training.  Five cadet pilots received their wings in October.  Options on the provision of air traffic control services in the long term are being considered by a civil military working group to ensure their sustainability.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about top cover and Rescue 116.  I want to be very careful.  There is an agreement that on an available basis only we provide top cover to the Coast Guard.  Let me state this is totally on the basis of being available.  The loss of Rescue 116 was a shock for us all.  I send our deepest sympathies to all those involved.  Investigations are ongoing and I do not want to go into it.  The agreement we have with the Irish Coast Guard is on the basis of being available only, and that is the way it is.<\/p> <p>  I am not aware of any naval vessel that is not operational at present.  Huge capital investment has been made to the Naval Service over the past three or four years.  In the worst recession in the history of the State, we are awaiting the delivery of a fourth ship.  The flag officer commanding the Naval Service has not come to me, and neither has the Chief of Staff, to state they are unable to operate the full flotilla.  They are able to carry out all of their duties asked of them by the Government, such as sea fisheries.  Recently, we became fully fledged members of Operation Sofia.  All vessels are fully operational.  I am the first to state the Air Corps, the Naval Service and the Army have challenges, but I have not been told they are unable to carry out their full duties asked of them in the White Paper on Defence of 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017112300002#E00500","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1511439300,"counter":1609,"content":"<p>The Minister of State did not address the Reserve Defence Force.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017112300002#E00600","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1511439300,"counter":1610,"content":"<p>I apologise, I have it here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017112300002#E00700","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1511439300,"counter":1611,"content":"<p>I may as well finish my point.

It will provide a significant boost for people in the run-up to the festive season and for local economies throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  The overall cost is broken down into &euro;100 million for Vote 37 recipients and &euro;119 million for Social Insurance Fund recipients.  The Social Insurance Fund will fund, in its entirety, the cost of the bonus that is to be paid to people on contributory payments, such as the contributory State pension, invalidity pension and so on.  Accordingly, this element of the bonus does not impact in any way on the Supplementary Estimate.  As Deputies may be aware, the Social Insurance Fund is in surplus this year.  Income from PRSI receipts during 2017 will result in Social Insurance Fund income estimated at &euro;9.86 billion.  It will be over &euro;262 million, or 2.7%, ahead of profile for this year and will be &euro;653 million, or 7.1%, ahead of the position in 2016.  I imagine Deputies will agree that this is a positive development.  Thankfully, it is clear evidence of the significant improvements in employment levels in recent years.<\/p> <p>  Expenditure on Social Insurance Fund schemes and administration, including payment of the Christmas bonus, is estimated to cost &euro;8.897 billion.  This is &euro;86 million, or 1%, ahead of profile.  Even with the payment of the Christmas bonus to social insurance schemes, the surplus of the fund is expected to be approximately &euro;1.4 billion at the end of 2017.  In so far as is possible, I intend to keep running surpluses in the coming years in light of the need to prepare, on foot of our ageing population, for the rising cost of pensions.<\/p> <p>  Overall expenditure on the Department's schemes, services and administration in 2017 is expected to be &euro;19.951 billion.  This will be &euro;96 million, or 0.5%, more than provided for in the original 2017 Revised Estimate.  The higher expenditure is due solely to the payment of the Christmas bonus.<\/p> <p>  The numbers on the live register are expected to average at approximately 260,300 for 2017.  This is a reduction of 43,800 on the average for 2016.  The estimated cost of paying the Christmas bonus of &euro;23 million to jobseekers is being offset by underspending elsewhere in the jobseeker's allowance allocation.  Consequently, there is no additional allocation required for jobseekers in the Supplementary Estimate.<\/p> <p>  The briefing provided to Deputies in respect of the Supplementary Estimate lists the schemes for which additional sums are being sought as well as some information on underspending.  We can go through the position of individual schemes, if required, during the meeting.  In any event, Deputies should note that almost all the expenditure incurred by the Department is demand-led.  This demand is driven by demographic trends and economic factors such as developments in the labour market.  An estimate of expenditure for any scheme for the following year is published in December as part of the annual Revised Estimates Volume.  The individual estimates are constructed on a scheme-by-scheme basis using data on trends in recipient numbers, average payment values and other relevant factors available for that portion of the year in which the Estimate is calculated.  Trends can and do change over the course of each year, resulting in expenditure being higher or lower than provided for in the original Estimate.  Actual expenditure on most schemes will never be precisely on target as a result of these factors.  The extent of any overspend or underspend only becomes fully apparent at the end of the year when the outturn for the year has been confirmed.  Thus, for example, we expect an overspend on schemes such as disability allowance and other illness schemes this year.  This is primarily due to the continuing increase in the number of applications.  In the first half of this year, for example, the number of new applications for disability allowance increased by 8.2% compared with the same period last year.  We should assume that the spend in this area will increase.<\/p> <p>  I hope my opening statement has given Deputies a broad overview of the Department's expenditure in 2017 and the reason underlying the necessity to ask for a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;10 million.  I look forward to engaging with committee members presently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017112300002#B00200","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511429400,"counter":1638,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

Like the Cathaoirleach, I have no wish to frustrate the payment of the Christmas bonus.  Many people rely on the payment desperately at this time of year, especially old age pensioners.  They view and use this payment as a way to get out of many financial difficulties.<\/p> <p>  I did a rough calculation some years ago when the payment was completely stopped.  My calculation was based on one town, Bray.  Predominately, the payment goes directly to the local economy.  It is not for going off on shopping trips to New York or anywhere else.  It goes directly into the local community.  The loss of the payment to Bray amount to between &euro;3 million and &euro;4 million.  That is the impact of it.<\/p> <p>  The bonus must be welcomed, although it would be better if it were a 100% payment.  Given the fact that there are savings within the Department in respect of various schemes and that there is surplus in the Social Insurance Fund, is it possible at this point to give out a 100% payment?  Let us consider some of the savings across the Department.  There is a saving in the fuel allowance.  A whole range of savings can be made.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I reckon increasing the payment to 100% would cost in the region of &euro;32 million.  Would it be possible to increase it to 100%?<\/p> <p>  It is positive that we are ahead of the position that obtained in respect of the Social Insurance Fund in 2016.  I appreciate what the Minister has said in terms of the need to continue building the fund.  My question is on the issue of bogus self-employment.  Has the Department carried out analysis of how much we are missing out on through bogus self-employment and employer PRSI contributions?  The fact is that the fund is ahead of profile but it could be far healthier.<\/p> <p>  The Minister says that the figure for disability payments and disability allowance is up 8.2% compared with 2016.  Of all the payments, this is the largest increase.  There has to be a reason.  I understand this may be because JobPath has now come on the scene and many people are having their payments changed.  I am unsure whether there is a reason for that other than an increase in applications.<\/p><p>There has to be another reason for it so perhaps the Minister could provide a breakdown of the position.

Where does that figure come from or why would people be applying for that now?<\/p> <p>  The other issue is the yield relating to employer PRSI.  The Government is always saying it cannot afford certain things.  We are discussing the pension anomaly whereby people find themselves at a loss to the tune of &euro;1,500 per year.  The 1% increase in the 8.5% and 10.75% rates of employer PRSI would bring in &euro;707.1 million.  That would be a significant amount of money in terms of re-examining the position and giving something back to people.

That is, in turn, &euro;653 million ahead of the position for 2016.  The Minister and her officials have indicated that this is correct.  In last year's Social Welfare Act and budget, the Minister provided for the extension of invalidity pensions to the self-employed.  A number of people have been in contact with me at constituency level about that and I made inquiries with the Department as recently as last week.  I was told that the rules, forms and arrangements are not yet in place.  I understood that this was supposed to start on 1 December, which is only a week away.

The figure for disability allowance is striking.  Two questions must be asked because it is significant.  Is the Department carrying out a review to understand what is happening?  Second, the Minister referred to an increase of 8.2%.  How many of the applicants for disability allowance will be transferring from other social welfare payments?  The answer to that question might give us an indication of from where they are coming.<\/p> <p>  Subhead A36 relates to the mortgage interest supplement.  How many people were in receipt of that at the start of the year and how many are currently receiving it?  Is it still the intention that it will finish at the end of this year and will not be paid next year?<\/p> <p>  Finally, I had not intended to raise this matter but Deputy Joan Collins mentioned it.  In her opening statement, the Minister referred to the Social Insurance Fund being ahead of target.  It is the issue of the changes that were made in 2012 to the State contributory pension.  When the Minister was before us a couple of weeks ago, she indicated - she did so in the D&aacute;il as well - that she did not want to bring forward something half-baked and that she was nearly finished.  We had expected that she would have had an announcement regarding what she was working on, or we were led to believe that she almost had something ready.  That was in the interim to the roll-out of the proposals for the total contribution system.  Will the Minister provide a further update on the position since she was before us two weeks ago?<\/p> <p>  Perhaps the Minister will address those questions.  If Deputies have supplementary questions, we will take them when she has replied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017112300002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1645,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their questions.  Almost all of them raised the same matters so instead of answering them individually, I will speak in general terms.<\/p> <p>  Of course, one would love to be able to give a bonus of 100% given where people have come from in recent years.  To be fair, however, Deputies must accept that the reason I am here today is that I am looking for more money.  If I were to provide a 100% bonus, I would be seeking a hell of a lot more money.  Some Deputies suggested that because there are underspends under certain subheads we could use the money involved.  While there are underspends under certain subheads, there are overspends under others.  The reason I am here is that I am short &euro;10 million to pay the 85% bonus.  As the economy improves one would hope to be able to return to a situation where one can give people what they used to receive in previous years.  I agree with Deputy Brady that they spend it.  It does not go into a box somewhere or to the Bahamas.  They spend it so it is of value and contributes to the local economy.  Hopefully, as the country recovers, the Department might be in a position to consider that next year.  Some Deputies referred to the fact that the Social Insurance Fund is in surplus and suggested that perhaps it should have been used to pay a 100% bonus.  The way the system works is that the Christmas bonus from the Social Insurance Fund can only be paid to those in receipt of contributory benefits.  The deficit does not relate to that fund, it relates to the people who are receiving allowances.<\/p> <p>  Another question was in respect of the Social Insurance Fund and bogus self-employment.  The Deputy can bet his bottom dollar that if I had that extra &euro;750 million or so, I would be well able to spend it.  I am not sure the figure is anywhere close to that.  However, I am sure there are some people - perhaps not in the large numbers that one might expect - who are in precarious situations whereby they are being made to declare themselves as being self-employed when they truly are not.  A report is being considered by the Department, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners, to pursue that element of the Social Insurance Fund contributions, which probably does not exist in reality today.  While we are working closely with the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, I only have the joy of spending the money in the Social Insurance Fund.  I do not have responsibility for collecting that money.  It is only by working with different Departments that we can influence how that position is reached.  However, given that I am in charge of employment rights and employment affairs, we are anxious to extend those same rights to people who are not necessarily self-employed in a self-employed world, if the Deputy understands what I am trying to say.  I hope to be in a position to issue the report on bogus self-employment and our views on it before Christmas.  If not, it will be issued very early in the new year.  I will revert to the Deputy and have a fuller conversation in that regard if possible.<\/p> <p>  The next question was about the 8.2% increase in the number of disability applications.  The main reason for it is that there has been a change in our demographics.  In fact, that is the only reason.  However, I believe there probably are some people on the live register who should not be on it.  We might conduct an analysis of that next year.<\/p><p>If there is a view that maybe there is a draw from one scheme to the other just because of this, it definitely is not just because of this.  There is a change in our demographics.<\/p><p> I assure the members that there are strict medical conditions to qualify for receipt of a disability allowance payment.  One cannot just arrive and say whatever one wants to say.  There are strict medical conditions that have to be adhered to and supporting documentation.  Those who apply and are successful and who are in receipt of disability payments genuinely have a disability that proves that they cannot work in the profession in which they would have been able to work and enjoy employment heretofore.  We will obviously keep an eye on that.  We do not look at rises in schemes and merely say it is well and good.  We conduct deep analysis and investigations.  However, we are quite satisfied that those in receipt of disability payments are adhering to the strict criteria that were set out beforehand.<\/p><p> At the start of this year 2,000 families were receiving mortgage interest relief.  At the end of this year, there are 1,400.  We will continue to pay those 1,400, but as the economy improves, I anticipate that number will continue to go down.  As long as people satisfy the conditions to receive that payment, they will receive it.  We are here to provide income supports for people when they need them.  If they need them, they will continue to get them.  As I said, I hope and envisage that as the economy recovers and people's personal finances recover, they might not need them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017112300002#C00600","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511429400,"counter":1647,"content":"<p>The indication from the Department in previous  replies to parliamentary questions was that it would expire on 1 January 2018.

It is an injustice that continues every day while the present regime is in existence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017112300002#D01900","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1665,"content":"<p>It was not an external report.  The report was compiled by a senior officials group across the three Departments - Revenue, my Department and the Department of Finance.  The reason it has not been published is because I am only considering it.  It is being worked on.  As soon as I have worked through the report, it will be published.  I am exceptionally clear in this area.  I look forward to the day that I have the money to spend that we can recoup from those who are not genuinely self-employed.  As soon as I can do that, it will be done.<\/p> <p>  The difficulty, in response to Deputy Joan Collins, is that there are 360,000 designated as self-employed.  Without speaking to each individual, one does not know who is and who is not self-employed.<\/p><p>What we have is anecdotal.  I know there are certain industries in which it is much more prevalent but there are industries that we do not even recognise in which it is a significant issue.  I am not trying to downplay whether it is &euro;750 million.  If it was twice or three times that, I am sure we would all enjoy being able to spend it, but I do not want to set expectations for people and then have us end up with an extra &euro;50 million a year in reality.  We will go after whatever the amount is and will enjoy divvying it out to people who deserve it most under income supports and schemes in the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017112300002#D02000","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1667,"content":"<p>It is not just a question of the money the Minister will raise.

If we get money, we will spend it.  Whether we get it from the recovering economy or from this pot, we will spend it.  We will spend whatever money we get.  The driver for me is that there are people in precarious positions who could be let go this Friday through no fault of their own.  They do not get paid sick leave or paid holidays.  It will be dealt with.  That is all I can say to the Deputy and it is a categorical commitment.  To be clear, the paper compiled by my Department on the anomalies and the working suggestions to resolve it will be sent to the next Cabinet sub-committee.  That will happen before Christmas or immediately after Christmas.  So as the Deputy does not think I am misleading him, there is a Cabinet sub-committee meeting today.  The paper is not quite ready to be put on the agenda today, but if there is another one next week or next month, it will be on that agenda and what the paper is and what the options are will be made public to the Deputy.  I would value Deputy O'Dea's support in dealing with that.<\/p> <p>  In answer to Deputy Collins, the reason it is going to a Cabinet sub-committee is because I do not have the money to fix the anomaly right now.  If I did have the money, we would most likely not have to ask for money.  We in the Department do not have the money to fix it within the finances allocated to us for next year.  It has to go through the normal methods of seeking the cross-departmental commitment that it is agreeable that this is how we fix it and to determine how best to find the money to fix it.  Deputy Collins is not the only person who will get calls afterwards.  That money does not currently exist in anybody's Department which is why it has to go to the Cabinet sub-committee to try to determine if the options we are going to provide are agreeable to other Departments, and then to determine how quickly we can fix it based on the resources we have.  That is the commitment and roadmap.  That paper and the options in it will go to the next Cabinet sub-committee meeting, and once that committee has considered it, I assume it will then allow us to bring it to a full Cabinet meeting and it will be made public as soon as I can do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017112300002#E00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511429400,"counter":1669,"content":"<p>Deputy Brady wants to speak, but before that, I thank the Minister for her comments on the anomalies.

The last day I was here, I answered a question from Deputy O'Dea and had hoped to be in a position to be able to bring the paper to Cabinet the following week or the week after.  Probably because of my naivety, I did not realise that I cannot bring something to Cabinet unless I have the resources to fix it because to go to Cabinet is to ask somebody for a decision to fix something.  Therefore I have to bring it to the Cabinet sub-committee.  We made a commitment to recognise the anomaly, and we recognise it.  The commitment to fix the anomaly is entirely in place.  There might have been a loss in translation following something reported here of what I said and it was then suggested to the Taoiseach that we would fix it within a couple of weeks.  He knows the reality, that this requires new money which is not currently there so he would have tempered his response accordingly.<\/p> <p>  When the paper is ready, it will be sent to the next Cabinet sub-committee.

This anomaly will be fixed as soon as the money is available, depending on the options chosen in the paper to resolve the issue.  The commitment has not changed.  I stand with the Chair and say that this is an entirely separate issue from our pension reforms which will come into place in 2020.  It is entirely dependent on the resources required to fix this and we all have to acknowledge that new resources are required to fix this but the intent is to recognise it as a stand-alone issue and to fix it as soon as we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017112300002#E00800","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1674,"content":"<p>Has the Minister had discussions with the Minister for Finance about this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017112300002#E00900","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1675,"content":"<p>We will do that at the Cabinet sub-committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017112300002#E01000","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1676,"content":"<p>It is disappointing that mixed messages are coming out.
