Today he is accompanied by Ms Mary Henry, deputy director of audit.  The first session today deals with the reopening of Garda stations.  The next item will be Chapter 12 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which is on the management of ancillary services at the Garda training college.  We are dealing with these matters first and we will defer our normal consideration of correspondence, our work programme and accounts received until the afternoon, as the witnesses from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must attend a Policing Authority meeting later on today.  They have to be long gone from here before 1 p.m.  We will come back to our normal business in the afternoon.<\/p><p>As I mentioned, two matters are to be considered today.  However, we also requested and received a note last week from the acting Garda Commissioner, D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, on the recruitment process and a breakdown of costs associated with the Charleton tribunal.  This had been raised in previous correspondence with the acting Garda Commissioner.  We received a letter from him yesterday evening on this particular item.  I will read it into the public record.  It has not yet been circulated but it will be published now.  It is addressed to the committee and is dated yesterday.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>I refer to your email of 16th November 2017 and note the Committee's intention to set aside a small amount of time at the PAC to questions on the setting up of the Tribunal Co-Ordination Office.  <br \/><br \/>Please note that this matter has been the subject of correspondence between ... An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Committee [since] August 2017.<br \/><br \/>Beyond the delivery of the public funding information furnished in that correspondence, and having taken Counsel's advice on the matter, I am concerned that discussions in the Public Accounts Committee concerning the Tribunal Coordination Office might easily trespass on the work of the Tribunal.  The Coordination Office are fully cooperating with the Tribunal on behalf of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I wish to ensure that there is no potential for any trespass on it's [sic] important work.  <br \/><br \/>In the circumstances, I would be grateful if the Committee could postpone discussions on this particular matter.<\/blockquote><p> We will confine this matter to the very tight issue of costs, and there will be no straying into discussions that are taking place in the Chamber every day and the matters before the tribunal.  I have not spoken to the acting Commissioner because I have just received this letter, but can we deal with that one small item without straying any further?  I am saying to both the witnesses and the members that they are not to stray any further.  It is not within the remit of this committee to discuss what it happening at the tribunal, but we can talk briefly on the costs issue in terms of that unit.  I am not sure if such a comment is in the acting Commissioner's opening statement.<\/p><p> I have been asked to read the normal welcome.  I skipped that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017112300002#A00300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511427600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Why was this information sought?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017112300002#B00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1511427600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>This committee sought it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017112300002#B00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1511427600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>When did it seek it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017112300002#B00400","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1511427600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>We sought it before the summer, and there has been correspondence between the Garda and this committee since August 2017, after the issue arose in July.

This requires extensive and considerable resources to be devoted to the task.  At all times our objective is to provide the tribunal with the information it requires as quickly as possible.  So far, tens of thousands of pages of material have been provided to the tribunal.  As per material provided to the committee, additional, dedicated staff with expertise and experience in this area were required to assist with this task to meet the timelines of the tribunal.

On the commitment in the programme for Government for the reopening of six Garda stations on a pilot basis, the Commissioner was asked by the Department of Justice and Equality to identify six stations with specific criteria to include a mix of urban and rural with a minimum of one in Dublin and a good geographical spread.  Furthermore, the Department advised the stations to be considered for reopening must be in State ownership.  In total, 139 stations were closed.  Of these, 78 stations could potentially be reopened.  Based on the criteria provided, a scoping exercise was conducted by an assistant commissioner with views taken from each regional assistant commissioner following consultation with local stakeholders.  Census data was also examined, as was data on crime trends from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na analysis service.<\/p> <p>  Assistant Garda Commissioner John O'Driscoll provided an interim report in June with a recommendation that Stepaside Garda station be reopened.  Assistant Commissioner O'Driscoll was awaiting final recommendations from all regions as well as recent census and crime data before completing his report.  His final report and its recommendations have been approved by me as acting Commissioner and the report was forwarded to the Department of Justice and Equality earlier this week.  The six stations recommended to be reopened are, in alphabetical order, Ballinspittle, Bawnboy, Donard, Leighlinbridge, Rush and Stepaside.  Those include a station closer to the Border, two in Dublin at either end of the county, one of them large and the other smaller, another in the most southerly part of west Cork, along with a spread across five of the six Garda regions, which reflects consideration given to the criteria provided to us.  Following this, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will liaise with the Office of Public Works to determine what remedial works need to be done at each station and the length of time and the associated costs of the works.  Furthermore, an examination of the resources required will be undertaken which will examine the numbers of staff, equipment, vehicles and ICT infrastructure required to determine in what order these stations are opened and when they are opened.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to the interim audit report and financial procedures in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na College of February 2017.  The organisation is committed to implementing all 19 recommendations in full.  Recommendation 1 cannot be completed until all 18 other recommendations have been completed.  Recommendation 19 can only be completed when the head of internal audit has conducted his audit of the implementation of the recommendations which he has indicated will be completed by the end of December.  The Policing Authority is overseeing our implementation of the recommendations contained in the interim report.  The Policing Authority has deemed that 11 of the 19 recommendations have been completed.  Of the remaining six recommendations, three are on target for completion by the end of December and significant progress will be demonstrated on the remaining three which relate to procurement of food for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na College and the transfer of lands to State control.  This clearly demonstrates the organisation's continued commitment to ensuring that there are effective financial management and control systems in place to manage finances and all administrative functions in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na College.<\/p> <p>  As Accounting Officer for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I can say it takes seriously its responsibility for ensuring public moneys are spent efficiently and effectively in the best interests of the community and State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017112300002#E01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1511427600,"counter":228,"content":"<p>We have approximately 45 minutes left for this session and speakers have indicated in the following sequence - Deputies Alan Kelly, David Cullinane and Marc MacSharry.

On 6 October, the chief superintendent of DMR west, Lorraine Wheatley, recommended the opening of Cabra Garda station to 24 hours, that is, extended hours for the station.  On 24 October 2016, Chief Superintendent Gerry Russell from DMR east recommended the reopening of Stepaside Garda station on reduced opening hours, namely, from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.  On 1 November 2016, Assistant Commissioner Jack Nolan took responsibility for the process, again for a short while.  On 15 November 2016, the chief superintendent of DMR south, Frank Clerkin, recommended a nil return for the south central division.  On 18 November 2016, the chief superintendent for DMR north, Barry O'Brien, recommended the reopening of Rush Garda station, indicating that Lusk Garda station should have been closed initially.<\/p> <p>  Based on the information that came back from the chief superintendents, three out of six divisions had a nil return.

I asked at the start of this process a number of months ago when we first started to ask questions about this that we would examine process.

We have now learned that it is also the prerogative of the Commissioner - in this case, it was the former Commissioner - to change the criteria and that did not happen.  If the criteria had been changed, for example, to give heavy credence to the view of Mr. Leahy, it probably would have ended up with a different outcome.  That concerns me.

If it were a thing that Stepaside opened at some stage in 2018 or 2019, and I will not say when, and was being used as an outpost for community policing in advance of some other station being built or otherwise, then I would not see it as being a bad use of resources, but if I were given additional resources today and asked whether they would go to Stepaside, no they would not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017112300002#K06400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Leahy"},{"type":"speech","time":1511427600,"counter":507,"content":"<p>That is a very clear answer.

It is commendable that this committee faces the challenge of making best use of public funds.  What is being done in Sligo now is that the remedial works on the station have been planned and committed.  Matters are out to tender, with tenders to be back on 6 December for considerable remedial works.  We had discussions with the Garda Representative Association, GRA, on Friday 17 November which were focused on ensuring the greatest good for the greatest number and making certain that the works in the station were focused on bringing the cells in the Sligo station back into functioning order.  The lockers and member facilities are to be improved dramatically.  Congestion in the station will be addressed and alleviated.  The focus is on ensuring that the scarce resources available are targeted to make the greatest impact.<\/p> <p>  The position of the assistant commissioner for the northern region has been that priority be given to works on the station, which is the very point the Deputy raised and which has caused some tension.  There is a proposal that he and the chief superintendent would decamp to an alternative station at a cost of &euro;750,000.  The cost of fixing the station is &euro;1.25 million, and he has quite properly, in my view, decided that a policy of the greatest good to the greatest number should apply and so the station is to be fixed.  My colleague, Mr. Se&aacute;n Murphy, has outlined with the OPW a programme of work which would see the entire ground floor of the Sligo station, including the refurbishment of the cells, back in use by 30 September 2018.  <\/p> <p>  I would like to commend the Deputy for his constant commitment to seeking an appropriate site.  I understand that there is potential, working with the local authority, of gaining a 14 acre site at the Summerhill College roundabout.  It is ideal, given the confluence of roads, from an access-egress perspective.  The matter has been close to the Deputy's heart.  There is a requirement to consider the needs of the region for an appropriate station.  There are people working in that station at the minute.  I believe this matter has been amplified to suit certain agendas.  Mr. Reilly's report is not the only one in existence.  There is also an OPW report, which Mr. Murphy will deal with in a moment.  There is a commitment to dealing with the remedial issues.  It is a very real and time-bound commitment.  It is costed and makes the best use of taxpayers' funds.  There is a longer-term requirement, independent of that, to ensure that Sligo has the station that it needs and that the region is serviced appropriately.  Work is continuing in parallel, with Assistant Commissioner Barry O'Brien leading on it.  There are many areas where there is an absolute commonality of approach between the Garda associations, the civilian trade unions and Garda management on this.  There is an issue, but I believe that there are a certain amount of other contaminants involved which lead to the unfortunate events of last Monday.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017112300002#L02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Barrett"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511427600,"counter":532,"content":"<p>We have received a report from the OPW on the condition of Sligo Garda station, and contrary to the report of Mr. Reilly which the Deputy referred to, the OPW does not accept that the building is unsafe and does not agree that the building is unfit for occupation.

I will conclude this section.  When we get to deal with our normal work programme this afternoon, we can discuss these issues.<\/p> <p>  I have listened to today's debate as Chairman.  In the acting Commissioner's opening statement, he has hinged everything  on the phrase \"based on the criteria provided\".  He also spoke about a report and recommendations, saying he recommended the reopening of six stations.  In alphabetical order, they are Ballinspittle, Bawnboy, Donard, Leighlinbridge, Rush and Stepaside.  The members of the Committee of Public Accounts may wish to consider what I have to say as Chairman.  Our function as a committee is to ensure good value for money for the Department of Justice and Equality and the Garda Vote.  Our priority should be the same as that in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in ensuring the force has the resources it requires, gets the best value for money and can deal with crime in urban and rural areas.  Crime rates may increase or decrease along with populations.  As far as the Committee of Public Accounts is concerned, policing priorities should take precedence in the achievement of those results.  The allocation of resources should be based on policing priorities.<\/p> <p>  It is the job of the Committee of Public Accounts to call out where we think political promises or commitments may not gel with what we would consider the best use of taxpayer resources in the management and operation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I want to get agreement from the committee today.  The Secretary General has stated this matter is for 2018 and the stations will not open before Christmas.  There will be a debate on the Estimate for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Vote, and we are informed that will happen next Wednesday, 29 November.  I would like this committee to agree to write to the justice committee in the morning, highlighting that it is the view of the Committee of Public Accounts that when it discusses the Estimate, it should deal with policing priorities and best value for money.  That should be its role.  It will be our role to examine the spending afterwards.  Our view will be that policing priorities should take precedence over any political promise when it comes to dealing with crime in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Our committee will be drafting a report on this matter and we will discuss it in due course.  Our role is to ensure best value for money for resources and this should be based on policing priorities.  We can come back to it.

The report does not revisit those matters.  Instead it examines the operation, funding and accounting for ancillary services at the Garda College and the management of State-owned land acquired by the Office of Public Works for Garda College purposes.  In addition to the college's core training operations, a variety of ancillary services and social activities have operated within the college campus, mainly for the use and benefit of trainees.  These include the restaurant, bar and shop, and a number of college clubs and societies.<\/p> <p>  The operations and costs of the Garda College are administered in a similar manner to those of Garda districts.  Most expenditure, including pay, equipment and capital costs, is managed and controlled centrally.  Local management is responsible for expenditure incurred locally using funds advanced for that purpose.  In addition to the Department-sanctioned public bank accounts used for the operation of the college&rsquo;s core activities, members will recall that over 40 accounts with financial institutions had been operated, relating to the college's ancillary services.  As of August 2017, a total of nine accounts were operating, including three public bank accounts for funding of core activities; two accounts controlled by college management for ancillary services, that is, one each for the restaurant and shop; and four club or society accounts managed by the respective memberships.  A summary of the bank accounts is presented in figure 12.3 of the report.<\/p> <p>  The college's restaurant is the biggest element of the ancillary services, with a turnover of over &euro;1.1 million in 2016.  The restaurant was not formally established as a company but had its own accounting records and a separate tax number.  The independently audited accounts for the restaurant indicate that up to 2008, the restaurant generated annual surpluses, with around &euro;2 million in accumulated reserves at the end of 2008.  Garda recruitment activity was suspended in the aftermath of the financial crisis.  As a result, over the period from 2009 to 2016, the restaurant incurred trading losses totalling &euro;1.95 million, which all but eliminated the reserves.  The restaurant was primarily funded through retained living allowances, which were paid on a capitation basis to the restaurant for periods when recruits were attending the college.  The funding model for the restaurant was changed in May 2017.  It is now being run on a net cost basis, calculated from the cost of staff wages and restaurant supplies and taking account of till receipts.  A record of the number of recruits in attendance in the college during each payment period is also provided to the finance directorate for information and correlation purposes.  This is intended to avoid surpluses occurring in the account in the future.<\/p> <p>  For comparative purposes, we also examined the arrangements in place in a number of other public bodies that provide restaurant and canteen services on-site for staff and other users.  These include the Defence Forces, a number of Departments, third level colleges and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  Different service models are in place, with some providing services directly and other providing services on an outsourced or contracted basis, procured under a competitive process.  The models used are summarised in figure 12.5 of the report.  We found that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na did not have a clear framework in place for management of the college restaurant operations.  Other bodies have formal arrangements in place that set out the governance structure and accountability arrangements, and how any surpluses generated may be used.  I have recommended that a formal framework be put in place for the management and control of ancillary services.  The Accounting Officer has agreed to that recommendation.<\/p> <p>  The other main issue dealt with in the report relates to the management of land at the college, all of which was acquired by the Office of Public Works and made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>The report outlines the complex legal situation that has arisen regarding the 37-acre site adjacent to the college that is used to provide a golf course and the process for acquisition of a large property at Dromard, 6 km from the college, in 2006 which was intended for development of a Garda training centre of excellence that has not yet been provided.  In both cases, there are concerns that the approach taken may not have achieved good value for money.  In particular, we found no evidence that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na involved OPW in advising on the granting, in 2000, of a licence for access to the golf course lands to a local club, no evidence that use of the golf course land was considered for college development purposes when An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department sought additional land to increase the training capacity of the college, no evidence that the purchase of the Dromard land and transfer of control over it to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been underpinned by any formal agreement or clarification of responsibilities and no evidence that OPW followed up or monitored the extent to which the Dromard farm was used for the purposes for which it was acquired, or that its value was otherwise protected or optimised.  I have made a number of recommendations in respect of property management that the Accounting Officers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of Public Works have accepted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017112300002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511427600,"counter":589,"content":"<p>As already indicated, this session must be completed by 1 p.m. at the latest because the acting Commissioner must attend a Policing Authority meeting in the early afternoon.

It then lists those external agencies and among them is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The report goes on to specifically state that the management of the relationship of the Department with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also needed to be examined and then finally says that this relationship is ineffective and an oversight of a confused, passive and disaggregated departmental relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Item No. 916C is correspondence dated 10 November from an individual relating to the awarding of a contract to a body without a tender process by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The correspondence raises questions as to why this Department is developing the framework when it has been previously undertaken by the Department of Justice and Equality.  I propose we write to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht for a full note on this to address the questions contained in the correspondence.  When we get a reply we will follow it up at that stage.<\/p> <p>  No. 917C is correspondence dated 15 November 2017 from Mr. Aidan O&rsquo;Driscoll, Secretary General in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in reply to a request for information on the PRSI classification of certain staff employed by Coillte.  The reply says that the Department is not involved in this case and suggests that we direct our enquiry to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I propose that we write to that Department, as suggested and also request information directly form Coillte.  <\/p> <p>  No. 920C, correspondence dated 16 November 2017 from an individual in regard to a number of issues including the Rugby World Cup, Government funding for the RDS and lobbying by an insurance company.

It was necessary under EUROSTAT rules to set up a special purpose vehicle, that is, a company to own NAMA, that would not be on the State balance sheet.  That can only happen if the majority shareholding is held in private ownership.  People may find this very strange.  This is a mechanism to take major debts off the State balance sheet.  The statistical office of the European Union, EUROSTAT, will only allow them to be taken off the State's balance sheet if the debts are majority owned, 51%, by private investors.<\/p> <p>  One newspaper picked up on the Minister's reply to my question on 10 October 2017.

I asked the amount of funding each of these invested in the NAMA group and how much they will get when NAMA is being wound up, because NAMA will have a surplus.<\/p> <p>  In recent weeks, the Minister would have made a statement that Members asked about paying off the NAMA debts earlier because NAMA has plenty of money in its account and will have a surplus.  The Minister for Finance said that they could only return the money to the Exchequer when all its debts are paid off and the investors in the holding company have been paid.  I asked who were the investors in the holding company.  Let me read from the Minister's reply to my parliamentary Question No. 28.<\/p><p>The reply said there was a decision issued by EUROSTAT in 2009 that only special purpose vehicles, SPVs, that were majority owned by private companies would be regarded as being outside the Government sector, which means off the State balance sheet.  It said: <\/p><blockquote>Among the conditions were that the SPVs were of temporary duration and were established for the sole purpose of addressing the financial crisis.<br \/><br \/>In order to avail of this accounting treatment, NAMA established an investment holding company &ndash; National Asset Management Agency Investment D.A.C. &ndash; which is majority-owned by private investors.  51% of its shares are collectively owned by private companies and the remaining 49% are owned by NAMA.  Under the shareholders&rsquo; agreement between NAMA and the Private Investors, NAMA exercises a veto over decisions ...  EUROSTAT gave its approval to this structure in October 2009. <\/blockquote><p>Even though they own 51% and 49% have a veto, EUROSTAT accepts that once there is 51% private ownership, it is off the State balance sheet.  <br\/><br\/>The reply continued: &quot;The total issued share capital of National Asset Management Agency Investment D.A.C\u00a0is &euro;100m of which &euro;51m ... was invested by the Private Investors, each receiving an equal share of the 51 million B ordinary shares.&quot;  It then gave a breakdown of the share capital invested by the original private investors in 2010.  I will not read it all.  To come up with the &euro;51 million, the 51% of the NAMA holding company, Irish Life Assurance Plc put in &euro;17 million, New Ireland Assurance Company Plc put in &euro;17 million and a company called Percy Nominees Limited put in &euro;17 million.  That &euro;51 million gave them 51% ownership of the holding company in NAMA and that took NAMA off the State balance sheet.  EUROSTAT is happy with that but 51% of it is owned by the private sector.  Some of those companies changed and now the final shareholding is still owned by a company called BNY Custodial Nominees, which owns &euro;17 million; New Ireland Assurance, which owns &euro;17 million; and the &euro;17 million owned by the other company is now being split between Arthur Michael Joseph Keeley; the Church of Ireland Clergy Pensions Fund, which owns 3%; the Representative Church Body, Church of Ireland investment fund, which owns another 2.5%; Geoffrey Ian Broomhead, who owns 1.3% of the shares and Simon Stuart Haworth, who owns 1.2% of the shares.  The arrangement is they get a dividend each year based on the interest available on the market at that time.  At the end of it they get a dividend.  Before the &euro;3 million surplus of NAMA can be handed back to the State, that &euro;51 million has to be bought back by the Government.  They have to get their dividend which they are getting each year.  The dividends paid to these companies was &euro;5 million in 2011.  It is on the record in a reply to a parliamentary question on 10 October.  They have been paid &euro;13.52 million in dividends to date.  They will get a dividend at the end of the process and &euro;13.552 million has been paid to them by way of a dividend for their investment in the NAMA holding company.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017112300002#OO03900","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511427600,"counter":1315,"content":"<p>Is that collectively or individually?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017112300002#PP00200","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speech","time":1511427600,"counter":1316,"content":"<p>It is each individual.

The interest rate is based on the Government borrowing rates.  They are not getting an exorbitant interest rate.  It is based on the Government borrowing rate and then there can be another small amount of a dividend given on the winding up of the company.  When they get all their money back, the &euro;51 million plus the dividend and their final dividend and when that company is dissolved, the surplus of &euro;3.5 million in NAMA can then come to the State.  This has to happen first.  I say that by way of information.  The date that written parliamentary question was answered was 10 October.  We will write to the Minister and NAMA to ask why the accounts of the holding company for the past five years were published?  I found it interesting.  When it comes to social housing, I see no reason why on a temporary basis, to deal with the housing emergency as we did with the financial one, we cannot come to an accounting arrangement, as it is called in the reply by the Minister to the parliamentary question, that would allow a company to technically own 51%.  The State would have a veto on all operations and it would take all borrowings off the State's balance sheet.  The argument we cannot borrow because of EUROSTAT is right but if we go about it this way, we certainly can.  It is an eye-opener.  It sets a precedent.  When the Government wanted to get permission to borrow tens of billions off the State balance sheet, there was an accounting mechanism introduced to satisfy EUROSTAT and I think it could be used for other purposes.  It is up to members.  I think they get where I am coming from.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017112300002#PP00700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1511427600,"counter":1321,"content":"<p>Good work, Sherlock.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017112300002#PP00800","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1511427600,"counter":1322,"content":"<p>That is the accountant coming out in me.  Our work programme is on the screen.  We are getting there.  Today we had the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in and there are a few comments I want to make.  Next Thursday, we have the Revenue Commissioners in on corporation tax receipts, chapter 20 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and the question of dealing with corporation tax.  We decided two weeks ago, as part of assisting the committee in our understanding of how multinationals understand our taxation system, that we would invite Apple, Google, Citibank, JP Morgan, GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer to appear before the committee.  The letters were issued this week inviting those six companies to send their most senior representatives to the committee early in 2018.  We cannot pencil in dates or anything like that.  We will talk about scheduling meetings over a couple of days if we can get them to come in on a particular date.  Those letters of invitation have gone out this week and we wait to hear from them in due course.<\/p> <p>  The following week we have the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection which will be straightforward.  It is a very big Department and there are lots of questions to ask.  The following Thursday, 14 December, we are starting into chapter 3 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General dealing with the cost of banking stabilisation.  IBRC liquidation has been mentioned for special consideration as part of that meeting.<\/p> <p>  I am most keen that instead of having public sessions here and that being the end of it, the Committee of Public Accounts should draft a summary of our meetings and any conclusions and recommendations we make.  Since we came back at the end of September, we are being assisted by an additional staff member who is now carrying out drafting work on a report of every meeting we have had and the key topics covered.  I will summarise them now in a minute.  That has been done since we came back in September with a view to producing a report on our work every so often.  It is part of our duty when we find something, not to walk out the door but to put it in writing in a report, send it to the Minister and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to get a formal response and follow through.  <\/p> <p>  On 28 September we had HIQA in.  On 5 October, we had the IDA in.  On 12 October, we had Transport Infrastructure Ireland in.  On 19 October, we had Tusla in.  On 27 October, we had the HSE to deal with section 38 and section 39.  We have dealt with the issue of Garda stations.  I think we have nearly concluded it today.   The secretariat is now working on the report and we will have it next month.  The reports will not be very extensive.  They will be a short chapter to summarise each of the meetings and recommendations.  We will have an update with a view to the following week having a look at a draft report with those six chapters in it.  We might then sign off on it a week or so later, probably with a view to launching it in early January.  We have enough on our plate between now and Christmas.  There is no point in launching a report Christmas week.  We could nearly get it put to bed.  I do not think the report will be too complicated.  Some people will be interested in some chapters and some people will be interested in others.<\/p><p>We might have a full briefing at next week's meeting, even if we have to do it in private session, with a view to having a preliminary draft ready as soon as possible.  I have seen the <i>modus operandi <\/i>of the secretariat and it is starting to put a nice, concise report together for us.  The plan then would be to have a report on the five or six meetings between mid November and Christmas one month later.

I will start with a short introduction to myself and my background.  I have a background in law and sociology.  I was professor of health law for more than 20 years in the University of Amsterdam in the faculties of law and medicine, in the academic medical centre where my colleague, Professor Pajkrt, also works.  I was a former editor-in-chief of a European journal of health law and of the Dutch journal of health law.  For more than 25 years I was a member of the Dutch health council advising the government on health and the ethical and legal aspects of health care, and, in relation to today's subject, I was responsible for the first evaluation of the abortion Act in the Netherlands which took place in 2005, 20 years after it was issued in 1985.  We conducted a nationwide study of how it was applied and functioned.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the invitation to inform it about abortion law and practice in the Netherlands.  We have already given the committee an overview of the Dutch situation in our joint paper.  In this opening statement we will briefly summarise this paper, focusing first on the law, which I will do, and then on the practice in the Netherlands, which my colleague, Professor Pajkrt, will do.   <\/p> <p>  I will say a few words first on the termination of pregnancy Act as it was enacted in 1984.<\/p><p>Terminating a pregnancy is a crime under Article 296 of the Dutch penal code.  The abortion Act is based on the criminal law and abortion is an exception to the basic prohibition in the criminal law.  According to the fifth paragraph of Article 296, abortion will not be punished if carried out by a doctor in a hospital or abortion clinic with a licence in accordance with the termination of pregnancy Act.  The Act is known in common or lay terms as the abortion Act and I will use this term in the rest of my contribution.  The Act was adopted in 1981 and, as I stated, it came into force in 1984 after a long history and more than ten years of public and political debate.  Several Bills were introduced in Parliament and only the last Bill was narrowly accepted with a voting margin of 38 in favour and 37 against.  The two conflicting values that had to be accommodated in the legislation were clearly expressed by the Government of the Netherlands during parliamentary proceedings.  The Government stated:<\/p><blockquote>The Bill is based on the view that women, who are in a situation of emergency due to an unwanted pregnancy, should receive help.  But we consider the termination of unborn human life as such a serious act, that it is only acceptable if unavoidable because of that emergency.  This means that the physician, the woman and others that may be involved before the decision to terminate, need to act with utmost care and in awareness of their responsibility towards unborn human life and of the consequences for the woman.<\/blockquote><p>At the moment, 93 hospitals and 15 clinics have a licence to terminate pregnancies within the limits set by the abortion Act.  Licences are granted by the Minister of health to establishments that satisfy statutory requirements relating to the quality of treatment in terms of medical competence and facilities as well as psychological care.  The directors of these establishments must submit periodic reports to the Health Care Inspectorate about the number of patients they have treated and some characteristics of these patients.  The figures are published in the inspectorate's annual report.  It is important to stress that abortion is not seen as a routine medical procedure but as one that may only be carried out at the request of the woman if her circumstances leave her no other alternative.<br\/><br\/>I will say a few words about the key provisions of the abortion Act, which relate to careful decision-making, because this is the substance of the Act.  Termination may only take place if a situation of emergency of the woman makes this inevitable.  An emergency refers to the psychological state of mind of the woman due to an unwanted pregnancy and does not require the risk of physical or mental injury.  The Act does not provide substantive, general criteria for assessing whether the situation of the woman amounts to an emergency.  The legislator has adopted this approach because the decision to terminate a pregnancy must be taken with due regard for the individual circumstances of each case.<br\/><br\/>Both the woman and the doctor are responsible for the process of reaching a decision, although the decision as such is ultimately made by the woman.  The physician shall assist the woman requesting an abortion in making up her mind.  For that purpose, the doctor must provide the woman with appropriate information about other solutions to her situation and see to it that her request is made and maintained freely and without undue pressure from other persons.  The doctor must also see to it that the woman insists on her request only after careful consideration.  To ensure sufficient reflection, the Act requires a reflection period of five days between the initial request of the woman and the eventual termination of her pregnancy.  An exception to this requirement is only possible when the health or life of the woman is at risk.<br\/><br\/>I will not elaborate much on other provisions of the abortion Act.  One important point, however, is that health professionals are never obliged and cannot be obliged, for instance, by employers or other persons, to perform an abortion and conscientious objections must always be respected.  Furthermore, physicians carrying out abortions must keep medical records on the reasons in each case they decided to terminate a pregnancy.  If requested, they must give the inspectorate access to these data.  Mention should also be made of the obligation to provide adequate care after the termination has been performed.  This includes not only a medical check and psycho-social assistance, if needed, but an obligation on the establishment where the abortion takes place to provide information and education concerning the prevention of undesired pregnancies.<br\/><br\/>I will now say a few words on what does not fall under the abortion Act.  I refer to three different interventions.  First, so-called morning after methods, such as the use of a morning after pill, are not considered to be a way to induce an abortion and are, therefore, not covered by the Act.  The reason is that these are methods to prevent conception, which means there will be no pregnancy.  The second circumstance that does not fall within the Act is when abortion takes place as an unavoidable side-effect of a necessary medical intervention or if continuation of the pregnancy would endanger the life of the mother.  Although formally such an abortion still comes under the penal code, no prosecution will take place because the doctor is considered to have acted in a situation of <i>force majeure<\/i>and he or she can invoke the defence of necessity in legal terms, resulting from a conflict of duties.  Criminal proceedings will not be taken in such circumstances.<br\/><br\/>The third intervention is slightly more complicated and relates to inducing an abortion within 44 days after the first day of the last menstrual period, that is, where menstruation is 16 days overdue.  This circumstance does not fall within the provisions of the abortion Act and is, if I may say so, a bit special.  It means that although the abortion must still be performed in a hospital or an abortion clinic with a licence, formally, the provisions of the abortion Act, including the statutory waiting and reflection period, do not apply.  This interpretation of the Act dates to the beginning of the 1980s when the abortion Act was adopted and came into force.  At that time, it was not yet possible to confirm the existence of an early pregnancy beyond doubt.  Although this is no longer the case - we now have far better medical methods, on which Professor Pajkrt will elaborate, if necessary - this restrictive interpretation of the scope of the Act has survived until today.  In practice, however, the requirements of the Act relating to careful decision-making are usually observed in such cases of early pregnancy.<br\/><br\/>While the abortion Act does not set a time limit for abortion, the penal code does.  According to Article 82a of the code, abortion amounts to a crime against human life if the unborn child has developed to the point where it is able to survive outside the womb.  This is known as foetal viability.  On the basis of current medical opinion, this is after 24 weeks of gestation.  In practice, however, a period of 22 weeks is used, if I am correct.  After this time limit, the doctor involved can only defend himself or herself by invoking a situation of necessity or a conflict of duties.<br\/><br\/>If I may, I will conclude by saying a few words on the evaluation of the abortion Act which took place in 2005.  Many health laws in the Netherlands are evaluated after four or five years.<\/p><p>The idea is that we should have a look at whether they work in practice, whether they are complied with, whether they achieve their goals, etc.  There was no such obligation within the abortion Act itself.  Perhaps that is because it was already enacted in the 1980s.  The way it operates in practice, however, is closely followed, in particular, by pro-life groups - of course, we have them in the Netherlands - and some of the political parties which are concerned that our legislation is applied too liberally.  To address these concerns, when a new coalition was formed in 2002, it was agreed that the application of the abortion Act would be the subject of a nationwide study.<\/p><p> In 2005, as I said, the evaluation report was published.  Its overall conclusion is that the compliance by clinics and hospitals with the Act was satisfactory and that health professionals did what the law required of them to ensure that decisions concerning abortion were taken in a careful way.  Furthermore, the report concludes that abortion services are available and accessible where needed and that, in general, they are of good quality.<\/p><p> One interesting point we found relates to the interviews we held with many women who had gone through this process of requesting an abortion and having one.  I picked this out of the 250-page report to put it forward here.  According to the women who were interviewed, the reasons for requesting an abortion are quite diverse.  They range from financial and housing constraints, to age, the fact that the family is already complete, a broken or fragile relationship, lack of possibilities to raise a child, and then, of course, sometimes medical reasons in the strict sense of the word.  Most often, there is more than one reason to request abortion.  This is also confirmed in a later study conducted in 2012 by the University of Utrecht and commissioned by the Ministry of Health in the Netherlands.  The outcome was that most women who were interviewed said that their final decision was the result of a number of reasons and should be seen against the background of their present situation in life.  All of them, according to the report, experienced the decision to terminate their pregnancies as a hard one, and some of them experienced it as the most difficult decision in their lives.<\/p><p> Finally, last year, a new evaluation of the abortion Act was planned.  It should have taken place this year but has been postponed because the Government fell.  It was replaced last month by a new Government and the Parliament decided to allow the latter to decide on how this new evaluation of the Act should proceed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Sjef Gevers","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511445600,"counter":1344,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Gevers.

I am a professor in obstetrics, in particular, prenatal diagnosis and obstetric ultrasound, at the academic medical centre of the University of Amsterdam.  I was trained as a gynaecologist at Medical Centre Alkmaar, which is a general hospital, and afterwards in the Academic Medical Centre in Amsterdam, which is a tertiary referral centre.  I was trained as a general gynaecologist in all aspects of the specialty.  Before and during my residency, I did my PhD on prenatal screening for chromosome anomalies and I worked later and contributed to the national introduction of prenatal screening in the Netherlands.  Following my residency, I did a two-year clinical fellowship in foetal medicine at University College London Hospital.  Once I came back to the Netherlands in 2005, I started working again at the Academic Medical Centre as a consultant in foetal and maternal medicine.  I have been head of the foetal medicine unit since 2010 and was appointed professor in 2016.<\/p> <p>  I am involved in numerous committees of the Dutch Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.  Since the introduction of the prenatal screening programme, I have been a member on several working parties concerned with the quality of care of the programme and I have been advising the Ministry of Health on several abortion issues.<\/p> <p>  My presence here has been requested to answer the committee's question about Dutch abortion care.  The abortion care is imbedded within the ethical framework of patient autonomy and is completely woman centred.  The objective of Dutch abortion care is to have a thorough and comprehensive process without creating any obstacles.<\/p> <p>  I will briefly take the committee through the statement it has already received.  I will not go through it extensively but I understand some of the people are following this online only and they do not have the statement.  I will skip certain parts and if the committee cannot follow me, that is why.<\/p> <p>  Since 2016, there has been a national co-operation agreement between the Dutch Association of Abortion Specialists, the Dutch psycho-social counselling service for questions of unintended pregnancy, adoption and abortion, the Dutch Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and the Royal Dutch Organisation of Midwives.  The Dutch College of General Practitioners, which is not listed, is also involved in this agreement.  Women with an unplanned or undesirable pregnancies and doubts about continuation of their pregnancies will generally go to their general practitioners - this is about which professionals are involved.<\/p> <p>  In 56% of cases, the general practitioner will be the first contact.  He or she may counsel the woman about her options and may refer her to an abortion clinic, a gynaecologist or for further psychological counselling.  General practitioners have their own national guidelines.  There is an English version which is available.  In 25% of cases, women go directly to the abortion clinic and it is the first contact.  The abortion clinic doctor may counsel the woman about her options.  They may perform the procedure or they may refer the woman for further counselling.  The other 25% either go to a midwife, a gynaecologist or some other professional.  If the pregnant woman goes to the midwife, the midwife never will be the referring physician.  The midwife is not legally a doctor and should refer the woman, and then the GP or gynaecologist has to refer the woman.  The first contact may be a gynaecologist or other doctors.  For example, the doctors of women with a cardiac problem in which it is unsafe to have a ongoing pregnancy may also refer them.<\/p> <p>  There are general considerations in cases of unplanned and undesirable pregnancy.  One of the first questions one asks is whether there was a pregnancy test performed and whether there should be a repeat test.  Then one should always ask if the pregnancy was planned or unplanned.  That seems contradictory but it is, of course, not always so.  A planned pregnancy may become undesirable and an unplanned pregnancy may become desirable.  Ask about the circumstances leading to the pregnancy and whether or not the woman was on contraceptives.  Mention there is always a choice and a dilemma in case of unplanned pregnancy.  Ask about a dating with a scan.  If there has not been one, please have one performed, preferably transvaginally.  If the woman is determined to have an abortion, she should mention that on her request to the person performing the scan.  Is the partner present at the consultation?  If so, explore whether the woman was not forced by the partner or the person sitting beside her and that it is a voluntary request.  Explore whether there has been any sexual abuse.  Be aware of cultural and religious factors.  Ask whether there would be a risk of genital tract infections, but in case of abortions on request as opposed to abortions due to prenatal diagnosis, we always test for sexually transmitted diseases in the Netherlands.  We always discuss contraceptives - what kind of contraceptives the woman will use after she has had the abortion.  Is the request consistent or does the woman seem to be in a state of panic and, as a result, would she potentially benefit from more time to make a decision?  If so, refer woman for further counselling.  When referring a woman for an abortion, always document the first date of the abortion request.  Of course, there are several websites and I have included the address of one.  Women can go online.  There is a help choice and they can go through it.<\/p> <p>  There are also some questions one should always ask, including, \"Are you certain about your decision?\"  It seems obvious but one has to ask.  The others are: \"How did you reach this decision?\"; \"Is this your own choice?\"; \"Have you considered other options?\"; \"Would you like me to explain the options?\"; and \"Do you need help to make a proper decision?\"<\/p><p>If the partner is present, the partner also should be asked.  In case of ambivalence, it is important that the woman understands that she is responsible for her own choice.  Ultimately, she has to make the decision.  Nobody is going to make that decision for her.  The woman should not be forced into making a decision; rather she should be helped to make a choice.  It is important not to blame the woman for being ambivalent and that the emergency situation of the woman is considered.  If the woman remains ambivalent, she should be referred for further counselling.  In the Netherlands women are also referred to FIOM, which is the Dutch agency that helps women who give consideration to or opt to have their child adopted.<br\/><br\/><i><\/i>Time is important in any case of unplanned pregnancy in view of the method of abortion.  Once a woman is referred, a quick appointment is mandatory, preferably within a week or, at least, within ten days.  From the moment the woman indicates she is considering an abortion and the actual treatment, a reflection time of at least five completed days is mandatory in the Netherlands.  This reflection time is not mandatory until a gestational age of six weeks plus two days, which is the 44 days after the first day of the last menstrual period.  However, 65% of these women do have a reflection period of more than five days.<br\/><br\/>There are several ways to terminate a pregnancy.  A woman can have a surgical termination, a medical termination or a combined termination, which involves the use of medication followed by a surgical procedure.  Women may choose where to have an abortion and what type of abortion they would like, although their choice is, of course, dependent on gestational age.  Women over 16 years of age do not need parental consent.  Women between 12 and 16 years do require parental consent but we may withhold it if we believe it is a reasonable argument. <br\/><br\/>Approximately 90% of abortions in the Netherlands are carried out in abortion clinics.  The Dutch Health Care Inspectorate produces an annual report with statistical information on terminations performed in the Netherlands in the preceding year.  The last report was in 2015.  As the data in the report are aggregated data, it is not possible to correlate between the different components of the abortion registration.  In 2015, approximately 30,000 abortions were carried out in the Netherlands, almost 4,000, 13%, of which were on behalf of women from a foreign country.  Of these 30,000 abortions, 8,500, 28%, were carried out before 44 days and as such these terminations are not considered under the abortion Act.  Approximately 16,000, 50%, were performed before seven weeks gestation, while almost 9,000, 29%, were performed between seven and 12 weeks gestation.  Thus, 80%, of all the abortions were performed in the first trimester, before 13 weeks. <br\/><br\/>The majority of women undergoing an abortion were between 25 and 30 years of age.  Only 83 pregnancies were terminated in women under 15 years.  In 2015, the total number of pregnancy terminations in teenagers was 3,079.  This number has been decreasing slowly over the last couple of years.  This is reflected in the percentage of teenage pregnancies that go to term.  This is very low in comparison with other European countries. <br\/><br\/><i><\/i>Since 2007, all pregnant women in the Netherlands may undergo pre-natal screening.  They are offered a combined test for screening for Down's syndrome, Edward's syndrome and Patau syndrome.  As of 2017, non-invasive pre-natal testing, NIPT, has been added as a first trier test to screen for the above mentioned trisomies.  Moreover, every women is offered a 20 week scan.  Since 2011, it is possible to address whether an abortion is the result of pre-natal diagnosis.  In 2015, a little over 1,000 of all abortions were performed after pre-natal diagnosis, the majority of which were carried out in a hospital.  We know from the aggregated data that more than 30% of the abortions in hospitals are due to pre-natal diagnosis, compared with only 0.5% in abortion clinics.  However, we do not have any knowledge on diagnosis nor is it possible to correlate the date with gestational age.  It is likely that abortion due to pre-natal diagnosis will be carried out in the second trimester due to the time it takes to get a definite diagnosis.  Thus, we can assume that around 20% of the second trimester abortions is due to pre-natal diagnosis.<br\/><br\/>Of all women undergoing abortion, 75% leave the clinic or hospital with a prescription for contraceptives.  Since 2012, it is mandatory to provide sexual education to all schoolgoing children.  This starts in elementary school.  Up to 2011, contraceptives were reimbursed for every woman.  Since 2011, only women up to 21 years are reimbursed.  In the Netherlands, abortion is free for everyone who is legal and has a social security number.  It is subsidised care.  The costs are not reimbursed by the insurance companies but are subsidised by the ministry of health.

We introduced our programme in 2007.  There are two elements to the programme.  Women are first asked if they want to receive information about prenatal screening.  If the answer is affirmative, we offer the information but women have a right not to know.  It is a strong belief that if women do not want all of the information, we should not give it to them.  If the woman says that she would like to have the information, she is counselled about the fact that there is a possibility of being screened for chromosomal anomalies.  That used to be done via the combined test.  We still have the combined test but since April 2017, we now offer the non-invasive prenatal test, known as the NIPT, a blood test which determines if it is likely that the baby has trisomy 21, 18 and 13.  The NIPT is more sensitive than the combined test in detecting foetal trisomies.  However, it lacks the ability to see other problems in the foetus at an early stage.  Every woman is counselled about the 20 week scan and is offered such a scan, which we actually try to perform at around 19 weeks.  We do this because we feel that if there is an anomaly, one needs time to do further investigations.  Such investigations take time and it is better if one has a little bit more time so that women do not have to rush into making decisions.<\/p> <p>  The uptake of screening in the Netherlands for the combined test has always been around 40%.  However, it is very regionally dependent.  In Amsterdam, where we work, it is quite high but in more rural areas, the uptake is lower.  It is also quite low in the north of Holland.  It depends a little on where one lives.  We thought that once we introduced NIPT in the Netherlands that women would just rush to have it but that has not happened.  The uptake has stayed more or less the same.  It may be a little bit higher but it is not something that everyone is rushing into.  One of the arguments put forward to explain this is that the combined test and the NIPT are not free in the Netherlands.  One must pay &euro;169 for the entire combined test or &euro;175 for NIPT.  The rest of the cost of NIPT, which is more expensive than that, is paid for by the Ministry of Health.  It is a study so it is under a study protocol and the licence runs to 1 April 2020.  It will be evaluated then to determine how well it is working.  Women have to pay for that.  However, the 20 week scan is free.  If one has health care in the Netherlands and one receives a treatment, one must pay the first &euro;385 but there are certain treatments not included in that.  The 20 week scan is one such treatment.  If that is the only treatment one receives in a year, the health insurance companies will pay for it.  The uptake of the 20 week scan is quite difficult to determine.  We have everyone in a database who has the scan but it is more difficult to figure out who is not in the database.  We estimate, however, that the uptake is around 95%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112300002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Eva Pajkrt"},{"type":"speech","time":1511445600,"counter":1354,"content":"<p>I have one last question which is linked.

He asked how the regulatory system operates and, if I understood him correctly, what position it places physicians in, if they can go along with it and what problems they may encounter with the current system.  At first sight, it might seem that our law could deter doctors because abortion is still a crime and perhaps one could expect that they would be afraid of performing an abortion.  However, the abortion law has been in place for more than 30 years and is broadly accepted.  It has been an accepted practice.  The provision in the criminal code is not a deterrent as long as one remains within the well defined limits of the abortion Act.  The further question was whether it is easy for doctors to operate and proceed within those limits.  Basically it is, because there is so much emphasis on the procedure of coming to a good decision.  We do not have a system with substantive criteria, for instance, whether in this case there is a medical problem, how serious it is and whether the life of the mother is in danger.  No, the system is open to a large extent but there must be a counselling process aimed at careful decision-making.  That allows doctors to take on board different reasons and motives for abortion and different individual situations.  That does not make the decision less serious and far-reaching, but basically it is an open system that does not confine doctors to certain pre-defined situations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Sjef Gevers"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511445600,"counter":1362,"content":"<p>The next questioner is Senator Mullen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112300002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Acting Chairman (Deputy Bernard Durkan)"},{"type":"speech","time":1511445600,"counter":1363,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending and for their very interesting presentation, which brought to light something I had not realised, namely, that the number of Irish women having abortions in the Netherlands is very small.  There has been a narrative in this country that while 3,000 to 3,500 Irish women go to Britain for abortions, we are often reminded that there are more going to the Netherlands and so forth.  I had not realised the number is so small and does not, to any significant degree, impact on Irish abortion rates abroad.<\/p> <p>  I will start by asking about the Dutch abortion figures.  The Netherlands is presented as a country that has very low abortion rates.  However, from what I can see, it is more accurate to say that Britain, France and other such countries are in the highest tier and that the abortion rates in the Netherlands more resemble those of Italy and Portugal, in that it is in a second tier of abortion rates.  The figures presented to the Citizens' Assembly, using the UN approach, put the Dutch rate at 9.7 per 1,000, which would be more than twice the Irish rate of 4.5 per 1,000.<\/p><p>However, the British Office for National Statistics calculates abortions as a percentage of total pregnancies.  Do the witnesses ever use that approach to avoid things that may change from country to country, such as fertility rates?  If one looks at the rate of abortions out of total pregnancies, taking out the 4,000 German and French abortions, it was at 27,000 in 2015 out of the total of 170,000 pregnancies, so the Netherlands seems to have a rate of 13% or 14% whereas in Ireland, we have one in 20, a rate of 5%.

The previous speaker, Senator Mullen, has given the impression that we know the numbers of terminations from Ireland.  In fact we do not.  The reason we do not is because while we have a figure for the number of women who register in Britain - which is around 3,500 - that figure does not include the number of women who take abortion pills.  Estimates vary on this number but it seems to be some 1,500 women.  The total figure also gives no account of the women who do not give their true address.  A number of women do this and they have a good reason to do this; if they give a UK address they may be able to access treatments without having to pay.  To be frank, we do not know the abortion figures for Ireland.  We do know that thousands of women travel each year.  I just wanted to correct that point.<\/p> <p>  The first thing that struck me is that there is a very ethical framework in place in the Netherlands.

Of course, if the woman has progressed a little bit later in gestation, there are complications.  This issue is addressed in the annual report.  This complication mainly has to do with the fact that if the gestation is further along, say at 20 weeks, there is a 20% chance that the placenta will be retained.  The woman would have to go to the emergency room to have the placenta removed.  It is not very clear to hospitals how to register that.

Health and sexual education is very important because if we do not do it children will go online anyway.  Everybody has a smart phone now and sometimes what we see on social media is not how we want our kids to be educated about sex.  It is very good that we have a system in the Netherlands where sex education is mandatory - it is not discretionary.  In elementary school there is a programme.  We need to show it to people and we need to see what we are teaching kids.  Parents are involved.  I was asked by the school to give a sexual education course.

I think if there was one, as I have tried to say before, it would be widely endorsed.  The Senator says the language is harsh.  To some extent it is.  I think in several countries, maybe most countries of Europe, the criminal code is still the basis when we talk about abortion.  Abortion is only allowed within specific circumstances spelled out in national laws.  In the Netherlands, we have this concept of emergency, which was already mentioned.  An important issue in the parliamentary debates in the 1980s was how this concept should be applied.  The final agreement was that the law should not go into further detail when one could say that an emergency existed.  This was done deliberately to take account of the fact that the situations in which a woman might be in a situation of despair because of an unwanted or unplanned pregnancy might be so diverse.  The Legislature refrained from going into substantive criteria because of this.  That explains why so many different situations can be taken into account, provided that the decision is made in due care and after good reflection and so on.  The procedural aspect of the law is more important than substantive reasons.  They are not to be found in the law except for the very general concept of emergency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112300002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Sjef Gevers"},{"type":"speech","time":1511445600,"counter":1411,"content":"<p>I will not pursue that issue.  I suppose it is a matter for philosophy rather than anything else.  On the legislation, I think I am correct in saying that an abortion will not be allowed to a young person between the ages of 12 and 16 without parental consent.  However, should a reasonable argument be put forward by the woman in question, abortion would be allowed.  I am somewhat surprised that a 12 year old, pre-teen girl would be allowed to argue that kind of a case.

Professor Pajkrt may follow up and talk about practice.  In our law on patient rights, which is a more general law, we have a majority age for health care decisions of 16 years.  When one is 16, one is entitled to decide for one's self without parental consent.  Between 12 and 16, we have a dual system.  For an intervention, we must have the consent of the minor and his or her parents.<\/p> <p>  In the context of abortion, that law might say that abortion can only take place if the parents of the pregnant person are also in agreement with it.  However, we have an exception, not only for abortion but also for other medical procedures, in cases where a minor continues to insist that he or she wants to have it.  For instance, a couple of months ago we had a very controversial case about a young cancer patient who refused further treatment.  This exception came into the debate also.  The judge of the court that had to decide on the case agreed that in such a case, if a minor between 12 and 16 insists on having or not having a certain procedure, the voice of the minor prevails.  That applies also to abortion cases.<\/p> <p>  The problem, of course, is that even if parents do not have to consent, they usually will have to be informed.  I guess in practice the person who is requested to perform an abortion will have a discussion with the minor about why she does not want her parents to be informed and will suggest it might be better if they were informed.  If there is a strong argument not to inform them, and if this is strongly in the interests of the minor, the law makes it possible that the procedure remains confidential and the parents are not involved.  This will only take place after long discussion and careful decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112300002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Sjef Gevers"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511445600,"counter":1413,"content":"<p>We have no data on that.

On the other hand, the baby's life is still ended by abortion.  Does Professor Gevers think that an unborn baby has value?  Science shows that the baby is separate to the mother.  Should the baby, therefore, get separate protection?  Professor Gevers is probably aware that last Friday was World Prematurity Day, which is celebrated in Ireland and the Netherlands.

I take the Deputy's question to be whether there is a contradiction in it.  He referred to what I was saying about it not being a routine medical procedure.  I think there is no contradiction because it is not considered, in law or in practice, as a normal medical procedure, as a routine, which is only a question of medical expertise, technique and norms.  In my discipline of health law, we say that not everything doctors do can be regulated only by their own norms.  Some things must be considered by society.  Abortion is an example in this regard because there is more at stake than only medical intervention to solve a medical problem.  In that sense, it is not routine or normal.  That is why we have kept and will keep the basic prohibition on abortion in our criminal law and it is why we have a time limit in our penal code to say that after 24 weeks of gestation, only in very exceptional circumstances, the numbers on which were set out half an hour or so ago, can abortion take place.  As such, there is protection of unborn life and respect for unborn life, but the choice of the woman remains in the centre.  Perhaps, our system will have more protection of unborn life than others which do not respect the choice of the women concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112300002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Sjef Gevers"},{"type":"speech","time":1511445600,"counter":1438,"content":"<p>Does Professor Gevers agree that there are two people involved, namely, the unborn and the mother?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112300002#N00400","speaker":"1331"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511445600,"counter":1439,"content":"<p>We do not consider the unborn as a person in the sense of the law.

It was, therefore, nice and refreshing to have this follow today to cancel out yesterday's nonsense.

Some 35% of women in such cases make an earlier decision because they want to have this simple procedure without waiting until the pregnancy is further advanced.  In cases where women are further on in their pregnancies, 3% have abortions.  There is an escape.  I will explain how this is done.

We know, from the literature and personal experience, that abortion is always a very difficult decision.  If a woman has her arguments very straight before the event, it is easier for her to cope with it afterwards.  In that respect, the reflection time gives each woman an opportunity to get her act together and think about all the pros and cons.  This is especially true for a woman who is confronted with structural or chromosomal anomalies.  If she is considering termination, her first reaction is always \"My baby has this and I want a termination now\".  I always advise such a woman not to do it while she is going through loop after loop on a rollercoaster.  When the rollercoaster finally stops at the end of the day, if she has had a termination and has returned home, she will think about what has happened and it will really hit her.  The grieving process has to start before a woman rushes into an abortion.  I do not have data or psychological studies on that, but I have been counselling women for many years and not once has a woman come back to me to say it was inhuman of me to make her wait.  Women tend to tell me it was nice for them and their partners to have a great weekend together to do something nice, to think about it, to discuss it, to talk to their families and to make the decision.

The Dutch Government agreed with that recommendation, but it did not take many measures to implement it.  It was scared to make any change because it was worried about compromising the delicate law in this area.  In 2016, the health minister submitted a Bill to the Dutch Parliament that would allow GPs to offer abortion pills to women who request them.  We referred to this in our position paper.  There has been a lot of debate about the Bill.  It will not go further because the new Government does not like it.

I was interested by Professor Pajkrt's submission on reasons for abortion.  Women make difficult decisions about whether to have abortions.  I was interested in the list of reasons the witness provided, such as financial considerations, housing, age, whether one's family is complete, broken or fragile relationships and the lack of possibilities regarding raising a child.  In the committee's discussions on the future of abortion rights in this country, we classified such reasons as being socioeconomic in nature.  I was very interested that Professor Pajkrt did not list some of the issues that have caused most discussion in this country, such as rape, incest, fatal foetal abnormality, a risk to the life or health of a woman or suicidal ideation.  As an obstetrician, does Professor Pajkrt consider the latter risks to almost automatically be grounds for an abortion?  Is it true to say that in the case of a woman who said she had been raped and wanted an abortion, a young girl who became pregnant as a result of incest in a family or a woman presenting with a fatal foetal abnormality, there would be no discussion of whether an abortion is warranted?  Can Professor Pajkrt say how one measures up against the other?  Having listened to all the experts who have come before the committee, some of whom have been fantastic, the evidence has been that women mainly choose to terminate a pregnancy for socioeconomic reasons and that reasons such as those relating to rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormality are thankfully the exception.  That is also borne out in my experience.  Therefore, if a society is to liberalise the availability of abortion and give women choice in that regard, socioeconomic reasons for termination must be strongly considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017112300002#S00600","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511445600,"counter":1526,"content":"<p>I absolutely agree.  The Deputy has made a couple of points.  In Holland, we call such terminations medical abortions but the use of the word \"medical\" is potentially confusing.  It is more accurate to call it an abortion for medical reasons.  Such abortions can arise if the foetus or the mother has a medical condition and it would be unsafe to carry on with the pregnancy.  If a woman has psychiatric difficulties or is suicidal, that could also be a reason.  There has been a long discussion about the latter reason in terms of when the mother's life is really in danger.  In the latest evaluation, that is now outside of the criminal law.  If it is mandatory to perform an abortion in order to save the woman's life, a doctor does not have to blink or wait but can just do it and there will be no repercussions whatsoever.<\/p> <p>  We call the other reasons for terminations social indications.

Another example could be a woman experiencing extreme poverty who has two small children and lives in a tiny one-bedroom apartment.  This is what one comes across.  They are desperate stories.  One does not encounter people who have taken the decision lightly.  As I outlined in my opening statement, there is a difference between unplanned and unwanted.

The 2017 Estimate provides a net sum of &euro;224.6 million for the Vote.  However, net outturn this year is expected to be &euro;235.3 million, leaving a shortfall of &euro;10.7 million.<\/p><p> Subhead A2 is the largest subhead of the Vote.  It covers spending on all pension benefits for former members of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, and their dependants.  It accounts for over 95% of all military pensions spending, including gratuities.  It is demand-driven and non-discretionary.  The original provision of &euro;220.1 million for subhead A2 will not be sufficient to meet all requirements for the year.  The shortfall in this subhead is estimated at &euro;10.8 million.<\/p><p> I will outline the main reasons for the shortfall in subhead A2.  The number of Defence Forces pensioners has continued to rise during the year, with some 12,350 military pensioners across all categories.  This is a net increase of about 1,350 since 2007.  It is expected that approximately 320 military personnel will retire with a pension and lump sum in 2017.  Overall, this level of turnover during the year was greater than what was provided for in the original Estimate.<\/p><p> In other areas of the public service, most people leave at a standard retirement age, meaning that their numbers and timing of departure can generally be predicted well in advance.  However, the PDF is atypical.  The majority of military personnel who retire on pension do so voluntarily, that is, before reaching maximum retirement age and at a time of their own choosing.  As such, the details are not known in advance, which can contribute to greater than expected expenditure on military retirement benefits in any given year.  This situation is a product of the availability, for operational and human resources, HR, policy reasons, of the early payment of pension benefits immediately on retirement after relatively short periods of service and regardless of age.<\/p><p> In any given year, forecasting of Defence Forces pensions expenditure and the exact numbers of retirements is difficult.  During 2016, 75% of military personnel who retired on pension did so voluntarily.  The picture is much the same for 2017.  In addition, many retirees qualified for the maximum retirement benefits, which also contributes to the ongoing increased costs.<\/p><p> A shortfall arises in subhead A3, which covers the cost of military disability pensions, disablement lump sums and related dependants' pensions.  It accounts for some 4% of all military pensions expenditure.  The original provision of &euro;8.7 million for this subhead will not be enough to meet the full costs arising during the year.  A shortfall of &euro;430,000 is expected and is due to greater than expected expenditure in respect of new disability pension and disablement lump sum awards over the course of 2017.<\/p><p> The combined shortfall of &euro;11.3 million in subheads A2 and A3 will be partly offset by expected savings of &euro;260,000 in subheads A4, A5 and A6, combined with surplus receipts of &euro;300,000 in subhead B.<\/p><p> To sum up, the purpose of the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 35 is to seek additional funding of &euro;10.83 million for subhead A2, seek additional funding of &euro;430,000 for subhead A3, reallocate savings of &euro;260,000 from subheads A4, A5 and A6 to subhead A2, and reallocate projected surplus receipts of &euro;300,000 from subhead B into subhead A2.  This leaves a net Supplementary Estimate requirement of &euro;10.7 million.<\/p><p> As I previously indicated to the committee, it has been my intention to seek extra funding for military pensions as part of the overall future budgetary negotiations.  Arising from those negotiations, the gross allocation for Army pensions was increased by &euro;6 million for 2017.  I am pleased to inform the committee that, as recently announced in budget 2018, the Army pensions allocation will be further increased by &euro;9.5 million next year.  The military pensions funding envelope for 2019 will again be addressed next year as part of the process of ongoing engagement with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his officials.<\/p><p> Although the costs of recruitment to the PDF are not met from the Army pensions Vote, I will take this opportunity to update members on the measures being taken to replace personnel who are leaving the PDF through retirements and discharges generally.  I reiterate the Government's commitment to reaching a full strength of 9,500 PDF personnel as set out in the White Paper on Defence.  In that regard, I assure the committee that there is sufficient funding within the budget for a full strength PDF.<\/p><p> In terms of defence spending, budget 2018 delivered an extra &euro;25 million for 2018 and an additional &euro;98 million for capital expenditure out to 2021.  As I have acknowledged, however, the process of reaching and maintaining the 9,500 target strength level presents many challenges.  As with other areas of the public service, challenges have arisen for the Defence Forces in terms of the recruitment and retention of personnel with scarce and highly marketable skills.  This is always a factor where highly trained personnel are a desirable asset to any employer.  There is a particular challenge in retaining personnel with specialist and scarce skills but having spoken to my ministerial colleagues at European meetings, I note this is a challenge faced by military forces internationally.<\/p><p> I have welcomed the recent announcement by my colleague, the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, on the next phase of work of the Public Service Pay Commission.  I am pleased to see that the Defence Forces are highlighted as a priority area requiring a more comprehensive examination of underlying difficulties.  The Department of Defence, in conjunction with the Defence Forces, has raised recruitment and retention issues as part of its submission to the commission.  We will be making a further submission to it when it commences this next phase of its work.<\/p><p> As stated in the 2015 White Paper on Defence, continuous recruitment is the lifeblood of the Defence Forces organisation.  It provides young, motivated and enthusiastic personnel to replenish military formations for operational deployments.  As the committee is aware, there has been a concerted effort in recent years to ensure significant ongoing recruitment at enlisted and officer levels.  It is anticipated that 800 personnel will be inducted into the PDF during 2017.  This includes officer cadets, Air Corps apprentice aircraft technicians, direct entry officers for the Naval Service, medical doctors and, of course, general service recruits.<\/p><p> A new general service recruitment campaign was launched in September.  This builds upon the successes of previous campaigns and will provide for the induction of new personnel in 2018.  Aside from recruitment, there were also more than 1,400 promotions across all PDF ranks in the years 2014 to 2016.  Promotions within officer and non-commissioned officer, NCO, ranks are ongoing in order to fill vacancies and, to date in 2017, a further 190 personnel have been promoted.<\/p><p> A range of recruitment methods are being employed, including direct entry competitions for specialist positions, and the scope to expand direct entry further is being considered.  This includes actively considering the terms and conditions that would allow and encourage former members of the Defence Forces with specialist knowledge, skills and expertise to return to service to meet any identified skills gap.<\/p><p> The Government is committed, with the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, to retaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by the Government at home and overseas.<\/p><p> I commend this Supplementary Estimate for the Army pensions Vote to the committee.  I will be happy to take whatever questions arise and will do all that I can to answer them openly and honestly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017112300002#A00300","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511439300,"counter":1582,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and note that he stuck rigidly to my exhortation that he stay with the subject matter of the Supplementary Estimate.

Recruitment, which the Minister of State mentioned in his contribution, needs to be addressed but retention also needs to be addressed.   <\/p> <p>  I gather from some of the low-ranking members of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, that the availability of the disability pension is not widely known with the Defence Forces.

The processing time depends on the complexity, nature and range of medical conditions and injuries claimed.

Since 1995, Defence Forces officers pay a pay related social insurance, PRSI, class A contribution and their pensions are fully eligible for the social welfare system.  Those officers fulfilling the agreed criteria are eligible for a supplementary pension provided for by an agreement in 2009.  The retirement age for the rank of commandant was increased from 56 to 58 years to facilitate that arrangement.  The Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 came into operation and I gather from the Department and from the Minister of State that it does not provide for pre-existing superannuation arrangements.  Therefore, the terms of the 2009 agreement no longer apply to entrants post-January 2013.  The implication of this is that a new entrant to the Defence Forces as an officer from 1 January 2013 who is mandatorily retired at 58 or 60 will have a final benefit pension less the value of the contributory State pension.  New entrants will be at the loss of the value of the contributory State pension, which is currently &euro;12,390 until they reach the age of retirement at which that becomes payable.<\/p><p>They are at a loss.  It is an anomaly.  From what I gather, that issue was not brought up during the negotiations in respect of the 2012 Act.  There was an expectation on behalf of the Defence Forces and their representative association that this superannuation arrangement would continue in place, which is no longer the case.  This will require funds to fix it, and the Minister of State will be obliged to speak to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, to address this issue.  An officer who came in post 2013 and who knows that his or her pension will be severely reduced when he or she hits the mandatory retirement age will look to get out earlier.  These people will have to find employment at a younger age and start a new career.  In light of the retention difficulties we are facing, this is an area that can be addressed with minimal cost.  The Minister of State should consider this issue and come back to the committee - and to me personally as Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on defence - to give an answer as to how that anomaly is to be addressed.  <\/p><p> I want to go through the Minister's statement and the issues raised within it.  The main reasons for the shortfall are referred to, and I accept the difficulty in calculating what the pensions are year on year because members can leave voluntarily and at different ages.  However, I find it strange that the list of main reasons did not include the issue of retention and the fact that we are losing people at an alarming rate.  That is one reason there is a shortfall in the pensions budget.  I do not see anything in the Minister of State's statement and still have not seen a physical document that outlines the Department's retention policy.  I acknowledge huge effort is being put into recruitment but we are losing people at such an alarming rate that we cannot catch up with ourselves.  <\/p><p> In his statement, the Minister of State indicated that the Government is committed to reaching a strength level of 9,500.  It is difficult to marry that with the current state of our Defence Forces.  They are currently in an extremely poor state.  We are losing middle and senior management, that is, experienced people with expertise and skills.  Those are the people we need to train the officers and NCOs coming through the recruitment process into which so much effort is being put.  Officers who are recruited, go through their cadet school training and come out the other end as second lieutenants still are not fully trained to take up some of the posts they are expected to take up.  They do not have the expertise and skills to lean on, in terms of senior personnel to help train them further, to get them to the required level to operate as unit commanders.  <\/p><p> On the last page of his statement the Minister of State observed that \"continuous recruitment is the lifeblood of the Defence Forces\".  While I acknowledge this point is not directly related to Army pensions, I must mention the Reserve Defence Force, RDF.  If the RDF continues to operate as it does currently, it will cease to exist.  It is almost dead and gone.  Recruitment continues to be a major issue.  While I acknowledge recruitment within the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, is ongoing, the issues concerning RDF recruitment, including getting people through the process of medicals and Garda clearance, have not been rectified.  The RDF's strength at the moment is down to just over 1,000 personnel.  It pains me to see the organisation struggling to survive as it is.  In the near future we will no longer have an RDF unless something is done.  I have raised this issue with the Minister of State time and time again.  Towards the end of the Minister of State's statement, he noted he is \"actively considering the terms and conditions that would allow and encourage former members of the Defence Forces with specialist knowledge ... and expertise to return to service to meet any identified skills gap\".  We have identified skills gaps.  The Air Corps is a clear example of that.  We do not have enough pilots or aircraft technicians.  We do not have enough members to run a properly functioning Air Corps.  The time for actively considering terms and conditions has long passed.  That ship has sailed.  We need proper, concrete action which will encourage members to stay within the Defence Forces in the Air Corps, Army and Naval Service.  We have not seen that to date.  <\/p><p> The Minister of State has mentioned that the Government is committed, with the support of the Chief of Staff, to retaining the capacity of the Defence Forces within the resources available.  We do not have capacity in the Defence Forces to deliver the service that is required.  That is gone and has been lost.  It will take years to build up the skills and expertise we have lost.  It is a devastating place for the Defence Forces to be.  Had this been addressed a number of years ago, we would not be in the position we are in today.  We are where we are, however, and still do not have a retention policy.  This was made clear to the Minister of State at both the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO conference and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, conference that took place in recent months.  We need a retention policy, and it needs to be implemented immediately.  <\/p><p> In the context of the Defence Forces operating effectively, need I mention Rescue 116 and how top cover could not be provided?  We could not operate effectively within the Air Corps.  We have a new naval ship which we cannot man.  We have people in the Army who are double and triple-jobbing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017112300002#C01300","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511439300,"counter":1596,"content":"<p>I said I would give some latitude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017112300002#D00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1511439300,"counter":1597,"content":"<p>It is directly related to pensions.

I presume the Deputy is referring to the University of Limerick, UL, document.  My Department, the Defence Forces and the associations have taken that report very seriously.  We have actioned quite a number of points and are working through the document.  The report was carried out at a time of tough economic circumstances within the State.  Were the UL study to be carried out again, there would be different results.  There have been pay increases across the board for members of the Defence Forces.  Deputy O'Sullivan also spoke about specialist skills.  People retire right across the board, from different ranks and with different skill sets.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, has prioritised the Defence Forces, along with the health sector, to investigate recruitment and retention issues around specialist skills.  We are preparing for negotiations with the Public Service Pay Commission.  Work is ongoing on that at present in association with the representative organisations.<\/p> <p>  The ongoing financial difficulties in respect of Vote 35 were discussed.  We have had increases over the past two years.  We are in continuous negotiations with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his officials to address this issue.  We cannot say for definite at the start of each budgetary year how many people are going to retire.  It depends on whether they retire in January or November as to how much of a chunk will be taken out of our budget. <\/p> <p>  Disability as it relates to members of the Defence Forces was brought up.  There is a range of disabilities, including hearing problems and physical injuries to limbs and backs.  Those people go through a process, which includes medical documentation, as I outlined to the Chair at the start of the meeting.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Chambers mentioned supplementary pensions for officers.  I cannot negotiate the terms of reference for a supplementary pension here.<\/p><p>I addressed this at the recent Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, conference.  I stated I will be in consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Officials from the Department and RACO have been in contact with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this issue.  The Deputy said the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, addressed the matter during question time.  I have spoken to him about this, and I told RACO at its conference that I had spoken to the Minister.  There is ongoing consultation between that Department, my officials, the representative associations and me.  I cannot negotiate the terms of reference at this meeting.  It is a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p> I do not agree with the Deputy regarding the numbers leaving.  When I was appointed in May 2016, one of my first priorities was the number of members of the Permanent Defence Force and trying to get back up to a strength level of 9,500.  We have a full budget for 9,500 members.  In 2016, 569 members left and 619 people were taken in.  It has been out there for quite some time that more people are joining then leaving.  Since my appointment in May 2016 we have taken in just over 800 members, between enlisted ranks, the Naval Service, the Air Corps and cadets.  There is ongoing recruitment.  I have recruiting meetings on a quarterly basis, with Deputy Chief of Staff support, with all of those involved in recruitment to keep the pressure on and see where they are being trained, and I am quite content.  It will take me some time.  I have stated from the time of my appointment this will be a huge challenge as we are competing with a very strong economy, but this is a priority for me.  We are taking in more than are leaving.  Our strength level at the end of October was 9,219 personnel across all services.<\/p><p> The Deputy said that after their training personnel are not fully trained.  This is absolutely not the truth.  I am not sure if that is what the Deputy meant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017112300002#D00900","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511439300,"counter":1605,"content":"<p>I will clarify.

I spoke about this in February or March and I stated I wanted this to be a priority.  The terms and conditions are being worked on regarding re-entry.  There are officers who have retired from the Defence Forces, such as pilots, explosive ordnance disposal personnel or engineers, who want to go back to the organisation.  I am not saying there will be hundreds of them, but there are a number of them and I want to give them the opportunity to come back into the organisation.  Terms and conditions are being worked on with the Defence Forces and the Department and they have to go back to the representative organisations.  Let me state very clearly I will be making a decision on this myself if it is held up by any of the representative organisations.  This is a priority.  It is the right thing to do.  Of course, people coming back in cannot come back in at the same level as their peers.  They will have to come back in at a different level.  I accept this has to be worked on, and it is being worked on as part of the terms and conditions being developed.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the Air Corps not properly functioning.  As recently as yesterday, I spoke to the general officer commanding the Air Corps about any issues he has.  I have to say that even though it has huge challenges it is properly functioning.  Huge capital investment has been made and extra investment is being planned.  There are two classes of apprentice military aircraft technicians and approximately ten began training this year.  Ten cadet pilots began their training in October.  Other cadet classes are in training.  Five cadet pilots received their wings in October.  Options on the provision of air traffic control services in the long term are being considered by a civil military working group to ensure their sustainability.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about top cover and Rescue 116.  I want to be very careful.  There is an agreement that on an available basis only we provide top cover to the Coast Guard.  Let me state this is totally on the basis of being available.  The loss of Rescue 116 was a shock for us all.  I send our deepest sympathies to all those involved.  Investigations are ongoing and I do not want to go into it.  The agreement we have with the Irish Coast Guard is on the basis of being available only, and that is the way it is.<\/p> <p>  I am not aware of any naval vessel that is not operational at present.  Huge capital investment has been made to the Naval Service over the past three or four years.  In the worst recession in the history of the State, we are awaiting the delivery of a fourth ship.  The flag officer commanding the Naval Service has not come to me, and neither has the Chief of Staff, to state they are unable to operate the full flotilla.  They are able to carry out all of their duties asked of them by the Government, such as sea fisheries.  Recently, we became fully fledged members of Operation Sofia.  All vessels are fully operational.  I am the first to state the Air Corps, the Naval Service and the Army have challenges, but I have not been told they are unable to carry out their full duties asked of them in the White Paper on Defence of 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017112300002#E00500","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1511439300,"counter":1609,"content":"<p>The Minister of State did not address the Reserve Defence Force.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017112300002#E00600","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1511439300,"counter":1610,"content":"<p>I apologise, I have it here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2017112300002#E00700","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1511439300,"counter":1611,"content":"<p>I may as well finish my point.

It is nearly a Cork takeover this morning, which is great to see.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted to bring the Flood Insurance Bill 2016 to the committee for legislative scrutiny.  By way of background, this Bill was introduced in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in January 2016 and passed Second Stage in late November 2016, which is just over a year ago.<\/p> <p>  Communities all around the country have experienced the devastation of flooding.  We have witnessed yet another year of extreme weather conditions from the floods in Donegal to Storm Ophelia.  In the past 24 hours we have had further flooding in County Laois, which is another reminder of what is to come.  <\/p> <p>  These weather conditions are likely to continue and will require a multifaceted response from the State.  This Bill focuses on the key area of flood insurance.  At its core, this Bill is designed to ensure that households and businesses can access flood insurance in areas where the OPW has completed flood relief schemes.  I wish to acknowledge the work of the Irish National Flood Forum that has Mr. Jer Buckley, PRO, Mr. Paul Kavanagh and, indeed, Mr. Pat O'Connell from the Cork Business Association.  They have consistently highlighted this issue over the past number of years. <\/p> <p>  There is a clear need for intervention in this area.  There are many households and businesses in the country that have been denied flood insurance.  This is despite the fact that comprehensive flood relief schemes have been completed by the OPW and are working.  In addition, when insurance is provided, it often comes with a large price tag attached or with overly restrictive terms and conditions, particularly with a significant excess applied. <\/p> <p>  Over the next number of years the OPW is expected to invest around &euro;430 million in flood relief schemes located around the country.  This investment is most welcome.  The OPW has already invested heavily in certain areas and the schemes have proven successful.  The very least we can expect from the insurance industry is to meet us halfway by ensuring that flood cover is reinstated in these communities.  It is unfair to leave households and businesses in the precarious position of having to live without flood insurance.  For many small businesses the effect is more far-reaching.  If a company cannot obtain flood insurance they may be unable to obtain finance from the bank and the business cannot grow.  Homeowners who wish to sell their property and move to another area for work or otherwise may have the sale impeded because of the inability to access adequate insurance.  In my own city of Cork, I know of house sales that fell through because the purchaser was unable to demonstrate to the bank that he or she could get insurance cover, including flood cover and cover for subsidence which is a key issue in our area.  Certain areas are essentially designated as blackspots by the insurance industry and insurance cover is extremely difficult to secure.  Not only does the absence of flood insurance cover leave many households in the lurch, it can also impact job growth and development in local areas. <\/p> <p>  I will now refer to the specifics of the Bill.  This Bill requires insurance cover to be provided in circumstances where the OPW has completed flood relief schemes to the required European standard under the 2007 directive.  The Bill will make it unlawful for an insurance company to discriminate against people and businesses in areas that now have a low probability of flooding as a result of public investment.<\/p> <p>  Low probability, as defined under this Bill, is an area certified by the OPW as having a one in 100-year flood risk or better.  Where there is a concern that an insurer is acting contrary to the requirements of the Bill, property owners will be able to lodge a complaint with the Financial Services Ombudsman.  On completing a review of a complaint, the Financial Services Ombudsman will have the power, if appropriate, to direct an insurer to offer insurance at a price and on such terms as it considers fair, reasonable and appropriate. <\/p> <p>  This Bill clearly outlines the role of the Central Bank in the application of the legislation.  The Central Bank shall have the power to carry out an assessment of how an individual insurer deals with insurance applications from individuals in the relevant areas.  It will also be empowered to direct an insurer to change its practices or take the necessary steps to ensure compliance with the legislation.  If necessary, the Central Bank could seek an enforcement order in the High Court and an insurer could be subject to significant fines. <\/p> <p>  The insurance industry continues to tell us that 98% of all home insurance policies have flood cover.  I am sure they will reiterate the point before the committee this morning.  Like a lot of statistics, this one only tells part of the story.  It covers all areas of the country, including areas where there the risk of flooding is extremely unlikely.  It ignores the unknown number of properties that do not have insurance because flood cover is denied or flood cover comes at a very significant cost.  It ignores the businesses that cannot obtain flood cover and, as a result, cannot grow.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that, like the motor insurance market, more transparent and independent data is needed.  We need accurate data on insurance coverage in areas covered by the memorandum of understanding between Insurance Ireland and the OPW.  There is no point in including areas where flood cover is not an issue.  Including these areas only serves to conceal the problem.  My Bill targets the areas where the flood relief schemes have been installed to the one  in 100-year standard.  For areas with less protection we need to find other solutions.  This Bill does not seek to solve the problem of providing cover in areas that remain at risk of flooding.  It is unreasonable to expect the industry to deal with the issue on its own. <\/p> <p>  Leaving the data issue aside, we now have a serious disagreement between the OPW and the insurance industry on whether flood defences should be demountable or permanent.  Demountable defences need human intervention to activate while permanent flood defences do not need such intervention. <\/p> <p>  First, it must be acknowledged that permanent defences are simply unsuitable in many areas and demountable defences are an appropriate substitute in such cases.  The industry will tell us that, because human intervention is required, demountable defences are insufficient.  This is despite the fact that demountable defences are common throughout Europe.  I am glad that the insurance industry is consulting with the Government and the OPW in respect of this issue.  I call on them to resolve the issue swiftly.  I cannot accept any assertion that demountable defences are unreliable, or unreliable to an extent that they place too much risk on insurance companies.  I have not seen evidence to support this claim. <\/p> <p>  In conclusion, flood insurance is a critically important issue.  The Bill is a genuine attempt to resolve the matter.  I would prefer a situation where legislative intervention was not required.  If the insurance industry does not want legislation in this area then it knows what it needs to do.  The industry must act reasonably and respond to public investment by reinstating flood cover, on reasonable terms, in the communities that have benefitted from OPW schemes.  I shall leave it at that by way of introduction.  I look forward to our engagement this morning and to hearing from the witnesses.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112300002#B00300","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1638,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McGrath.

We have been dealing with this problem over the past ten years and both Houses of the Oireachtas jointly commissioned a three-year report, which was published in 2015.  It is probably one of the most comprehensive studies into flood insurance.  I will be using part of that report in our presentation today.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the Members of the Houses who contributed to this report because it is an extremely good document and very comprehensive.  A huge number of groups and stakeholders fed into it.<br\/><br\/>The Irish National Flood Forum, INFF, is a voluntary group set up by three people in Skibbereen in 2010 as a result of flooding in the town.  We are a charitable organisation.  We work on a voluntary basis and we try to build community flood resilience that enables communities to achieve better flood alleviation and to reach their full economic and social potential, returning hope where once there was none.  We like to engage with the local authorities and stakeholders and all Government agencies in a respectful way.  That is key.  That is our motto.  That is our <i>modus operandi<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>We are going to try to paint a picture for the committee with regard to the Flood Insurance Bill 2016 and why it is needed.  We will drill down into some of the figures which are widely quoted by Insurance Ireland and by different Departments.  We will drill down through them and Mr. Kavanagh will show the committee exactly what is happening on the ground in towns which have been flooded and in which, despite major alleviation schemes having been put in, flood insurance cannot be resumed.<br\/><br\/>The Office of Public Works, OPW, has invested heavily in new flood defences.  Some &euro;41 million was invested in Clonmel in a scheme which was completed in 2013.  In Fermoy, &euro;35 million of taxpayers' money was spent on a scheme which was completed in 2014.  I emphasise that the scheme in Fermoy was tested heavily during the floods of 2015.  It was shown to be extremely good and there were absolutely no flooding problems in 2014 and 2015.  In Mallow, &euro;39 million was spent in 2014.  These three schemes alone amount to &euro;115 million.  In all of these towns home owners and businesses in the centres of the towns, near the rivers, have massive issues when trying to get flood insurance.  It is just impossible.  <br\/><br\/>It is planned to spend &euro;100 million over the next five years.  These schemes are being built to the international standard to which Deputy Michael McGrath made reference.  These schemes are some of the best in the world.  They are the newest schemes in the world.  We have now got an agency, the OPW, which has a level of expertise.  We have a flood conference in Athlone on Saturday 25 November.  Experts from Holland and Scotland are coming.  They have viewed these schemes and have said that they are some of the best schemes they have seen in Europe, yet we have problems getting flood insurance in these towns.  <br\/><br\/>Despite such large investments of taxpayers' money, communities are still experiencing difficulties obtaining flood cover.  In the schemes I have mentioned, areas remain blighted and, in some cases, insurance has actually been withdrawn after a scheme has been completed.  There have been instances of people losing their flood cover after a scheme has been completed.  The INFF's concern is that, while OPW schemes bring high standards of physical protection, without changes in the level of flood insurance cover societal resilience will remain compromised.  The objective of the scheme is incomplete, in spite of the OPW's level of technical excellence.  One of the things which we find is that there is, rightly, a huge focus on schemes.  Capital works schemes are brought in.  A community can wait for ten years for a scheme to be delivered but after all that time, all that level of expertise and all that money spent, it still cannot get insurance.<br\/><br\/>One of the major points we want to make here today is that there are no independent studies by Government whatsoever with regard to the level of flood insurance cover.  All data that the Government is using, whether for press releases or decisions made in the Department of Finance, have not been independently verified.  It is not only the INFF saying this.  An <i>Irish Examiner <\/i>article of 21 August 2017 was headlined &quot;Motor insurers investigated for possible 'price fixing'&quot;, an RT&Eacute; report on 4 July was titled &quot;Irish-based motor insurers raided by EU competition officials&quot; and an article in the <i>The Sunday Times <\/i>of 2 July had the headline &quot;Insurance firms ordered not to lie&quot;.  These are not my statements, they come from very reputable media outlets which are calling into question the bona fides of the insurance industry in respect of the facts and figures it delivers.  Despite this we, as a country, accept its data without independent verification.  That problem must be addressed.<br\/><br\/>The INFF is concerned with property owners, farmers and small businesses.  We really feel we are discriminated against.  We pay our full rates, our property tax and our inheritance tax.  We continue to wait for our flood schemes and when they are delivered we still cannot get our insurance back.  If one has a business on which there is inheritance tax to be paid and one is in a town such as Fermoy where one cannot get flood insurance, how does one borrow the money to pay one's inheritance tax?  It cannot be done.  One starves one's business of capital to pay the inheritance tax or the rates, which affects one's ability to invest in one's business in the future.  Home owners are unable to raise mortgages or loans on their properties or to sell them.  Businesses and farmers cannot expand because they cannot borrow money to renovate.  <br\/><br\/>This next point is very important.  New industry and new commerce are reluctant to invest in blighted areas.  If the current situation is allowed to continue, we will be looking at towns around Ireland, and indeed cities like Cork city, where we have had flood schemes delivered and we will be asking why they are not thriving.  The reason they will not be thriving will be because those in the area cannot borrow money.  Money is the fuel for future investment.  It is the petrol in the car which drives the business.  We are talking about home owners as well.  There is a huge lack of housing in this country.  Would it not be great if elderly people living in large houses could trade down allowing young people to buy their homes?  It is obvious.  We would all be for that.  However there could be elderly people in Fermoy or Mallow who want to downsize but they cannot sell their houses because the young people who want to buy them cannot get a mortgage because there is no flood insurance.<br\/><br\/>Insurance refusals are a huge issue and they are not based on science.  Through the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, study, Insurance Ireland is, quite rightly, getting information from the OPW.  There is an exchange of information which we would hope would lead to a building of trust but also to an expectation that insurance companies will play their roles.  They are not playing their roles however.  If one lives less than 500 m from a river it does not matter whether there is a scheme in place, no matter how strong.  The companies will refuse cover.  No account is taken of topography.  There could be a river 100 yd. from one's house and, despite the house being 100 ft up a hill, one will be refused cover.  Little or no account is taken of new flood defences.  <br\/><br\/>I will move onto the lack of transparency.  While we are talking about lack of transparency I will be referring to the document on slide 6 a lot - the 2015 report of the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht on flooding and property insurance in Ireland.  We have seen instances of insurance companies retaining partial claims.  We have seen instances where companies have failed to advise claimants that they can appoint their own assessors.  For example, if a person in Mountmellick had a problem today, the insurance company would appoint its own assessor but would not necessarily tell the individual affected by the flooding that his or her policy gives him or her the right to have an assessor appointed on his or her own behalf.  The company would not tell him or her that, which is a breach of consumer protection rights.  <br\/><br\/>These concerns are echoed in the report, which I would encourage all members to have a look at because it is a fine piece of work.  I am afraid, however, that it will be left on a shelf and not dealt with.  The report of the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht on the 2015 study, this three-year study into the lack of flood insurance, states &quot;If, after examining the various models, no adequate solution can be reached, the State could consider the merits of introducing legislation that would compel insurance providers to provide flood insurance to everyone.&quot;  That is stated in the document.<\/p><p>After the three-year study, the committee came to that finding.  The work on this started in 2012 and it was published in 2015.  It is now 2017 and the situation has not improved in the town centres.  That is why we need Deputy Michael McGrath's Bill.<\/p><p> The Irish National Flood Forum, INFF, contends that all potential solutions have been exhausted.  The report was comprehensive and three years in the making.  It has been published for two years.  The OPW's best effort to deal with this issue through the memorandum of understanding process is in operation for more than three years.<\/p><p> The 2015 joint committee report noted the OECD recommendation that it is important to identify uninsured populations and sectors of the economy which are financially vulnerable and assess the reasons they lack insurance.  That has not happened.<\/p><p> Ms Josephine Feehily, former chairperson of the Revenue Commissioners, at a hearing of the Committee of Public Accounts on 21 February 2013, said that \"flooding will impact on property tax valuations\".  This represents potential loss of income to the State when it comes to the next self-assessment for property tax, with those affected by flooding putting in lower valuations.<\/p><p> Mr. Eamonn Downey, former chair of the Irish Claims Consultants Association, asserted in the 2015 joint committee report that there was a lack of transparency.  He alleged insurance companies retain part of agreed claim settlements incorrectly.  The retention practice is not evident abroad, in Belfast or Bristol.  Mr. Downey also alleged insurers have ignored the consumer protection code by not advising home owners who notify a claim of their right to retain their own representative.  This was confirmed by a Central Bank investigation of insurance companies.  When it reviewed 188 flood claims, it found incidents of potentially unfair settlements, a lack of transparency by insurance companies with retaining partial claims, and a failure by insurance companies to advise claimants that they could appoint their own assessor.<\/p><p> Kildare County Council stated in this report that, despite the council having delivered a scheme, insurance is still not available in that area.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul is not a commercial enterprise but one that understands people living in disadvantaged areas.  Its representative, Mr. Brendan Dempsey, told the committee that the society believes the lack of flood insurance can only be addressed through legislation.  The Irish Brokers Association reckons up to 50,000 households have no flood insurance, despite this famous 98% statistic being trotted out by insurance companies regularly.<\/p><p> One of our member groups in Ballinasloe, County Galway, carried out a local audit on a flood relief scheme in Derrymullan where &euro;1.2 million was spent on flood defences in 2011.  Out of 130 houses, our member group found 60 homes still without flood insurance.  The committee can see in the presentation a picture of the flood defence walls.  It has no demountable barriers on it and it has only one gate at a stage along the wall.  That wall has protected Derrymullan since 2011 and there has never been a breach.  However, in 2017, 60 home owners still cannot get flood insurance there.<\/p><p> I plead with Members to support this Bill as it is badly needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112300002#C00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jer Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511429400,"counter":1641,"content":"<p>I am a member of the INFF, the Cork Business Association, the Cork Chamber of Commerce and the Fermoy Forum which looks after businesses and home owners alike.<\/p> <p>  Prior to flood defences being built, Clonmel, Mallow and Fermoy were under water 15 times in 30 years.  Every time there was a flood, these towns appeared on television screens just like Mountmellick last night.  I was a victim 30 years ago when my house in Fermoy was flooded.  Thankfully, I had flood cover then.  As soon as I made a modest claim, however, my cover was taken away.  Now 30 years on, there is still no flood cover being offered by Insurance Ireland members on that house, despite the fact that close on &euro;40 million of taxpayers' money has been spent by the Office of Public Works, OPW, on making Fermoy as dry as snuff, as described by the former Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney.  No Insurance Ireland member offers flood cover to houses which previously flooded in Fermoy, Mallow or Clonmel.  They are blacklisted, or red-listed, as they are all red zones on the various geocoding machines which insurers use to form their risk analyses.<\/p> <p>  Thankfully, through much hard work, I have convinced two foreign home insurers to work with our brokerage exclusively and look favourably on flood defence works completed over two and half years ago.  Up to 80% of Fermoy's flood defences are permanent.  They are mounds and are not demountable.  There have to be demountables or every town will end up looking like a castle.  Hundreds of millions of euro of taxpayers' money has been spent on demountable barriers.  However, as Mr. Kevin Thompson of Insurance Ireland has said, it does not recognise demountable barriers.  That is a damning indictment.<\/p> <p>  When Insurance Ireland starts bamboozling us with figures on the increasing number of properties it may now be covering for flood, I do not know whether to laugh or cry.  The properties it might now cover may never have had a flood.  A person may get a quote on an insurance website but that does not mean he or she gets flood cover.  If the assumptions that person ticks on the declaration state his or her house is within 250 m or 500 m of a water source, then he or she has no cover.  It is similar to the conditions used by some airlines where a person is asked to tick boxes just to buy the airline ticket.  How many people actually read the terms and conditions?<\/p> <p>  Why not get a list of the 84 houses in Fermoy identified by the OPW ten years ago and audit them independently?  I have spoken to my broker colleagues in Mallow and Clonmel and they concur with my findings.  Several D&aacute;il Members, including Deputies Fitzmaurice and Healy, have similar findings.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to commercial insurance, the stories are even worse because the majority of business premises in Fermoy, Mallow and Clonmel are all close to rivers.  Not one of them has flooded since the demountable barriers went up but not one of them has got its flood cover back.  To the contrary, several of them have had their cover withdrawn completely or an excess imposed on them since the works were completed.  I have a list of 28 such businesses in Fermoy which we insure ourselves.  Only seven have flood cover.  Of that seven, they all have an excess.  Five have an excess of &euro;2,500, one has &euro;5,000 and one has an excess of &euro;20,000.  An excess is the amount a business will have to pay upfront before a claim even becomes a claim.<\/p><p>The remaining 21 have no flood cover.  These people cannot get loans or mortgages and they cannot sell properties because a purchaser will not be able to get flood cover.  I cannot get flood cover for them.  Nobody can get it for them, including Insurance Ireland.  For new businesses, there is no flood cover available.  Last December, I met the former Minister of State, Deputy Canney, and his Department secretary and I gave him documents which prove conclusively that not alone are Insurance Ireland members not getting flood cover, but cover is being withdrawn from businesses even if they have never had a claim.  There is also proof of new businesses being denied cover, which documentation I also gave to the Minister of State.<\/p><p> We could not get flood cover at our new offices in Fermoy.  If we could not get it, who will?  Slide number 10 is a photograph of flooding at Ashe Quay, Fermoy.  The line indicates the wall height.  Half of the barriers were up and the water did not even rise above the wall.  In the middle of the photograph is Fermoy Tourist Office which was built by the OPW and was denied flood cover by all Insurance Ireland members.  In compiling these documents, I undertook a great deal of work in a data protection and business sensitive manner.  With the permission of five business people in Fermoy and the critical information blacked out I was able to supply the proof to the former Minister of State.  I am sure that he has shared that information with the current Minister of State, Deputy Boxer Moran, and so the Department is aware that I am telling it as it is.  My colleagues and others in Clonmel and Mallow have similar stories to tell.  <\/p><p> We have offices in Cork city with no flood cover and similarly in west Cork.  There is a huge expectancy in Skibbereen, Clonakilty, Bantry, Bandon and Cork city that when the OPW completes its excellent works flood cover will be available, but nothing could be further from the truth.  The late property developer, Owen O'Callaghan, told me that several multinational stores that his company were trying to attract to Cork city had been advised not to come to Cork as they would not get flood cover.  It is the Government's vision to have the cities, towns and rural communities of Ireland up and running economically with full employment for all 26 counties.  This can only be achieved if new, viable businesses are allowed to open and expand without flood restrictions being foisted upon them.  <\/p><p> I am trying to persuade commercial business insurers at home and abroad to recognise the demountable defences but because Insurance Ireland will not recognise them, foreign insurers think there is something fishy going on.  I have made this a personal crusade.  Many individuals within Insurance Ireland companies agree personally with me on this issue.  These decisions are made at the top.  Attitudes need to change.  The consumer protection code states that the consumer must be treated fairly.  I do not believe they are being treated fairly and for this issue to be resolved, the Bill must be passed immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1643,"content":"<p>Would Mr. O'Connell like to make an opening statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112300002#E00200","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511429400,"counter":1644,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to state why we support Deputy Michael McGrath's Bill.  The Cork Business Association, founded in 1957, is a not-for-profit organisation representing almost 200 businesses in Cork city.  Membership consists of a mix of local indigenous businesses and national and multinational retailers.  As an organisation, we cover a wide sectoral base, including the retail, hospitality, financial, property, insurance, catering, educational and service industry sectors.  A significant number of our members are on the city centre island, circled by the north and south channels of the River Lee.  The flood relief works proposed by the OPW are due to begin in 2018 and have been widely welcomed by businesses in Cork. Current estimates for the cost of these works is &euro;140 million to &euro;150 million, the largest ever flood scheme proposed in this country and a significant investment of taxpayers' money.  Confidence in these works has been taken from the OPW&rsquo;s track record of very successful schemes delivered in Mallow, Fermoy, Clonmel and Waterford.  These have all been designed to meet a one in 100 year event and in all cases have proved very effective to date.<br\/><br\/>Since March 2014, a memorandum of understanding has been in place between the OPW and Insurance Ireland which allows for the exchange of flood defence data.  Many inadvertently believed this transparency and delivery of robust flood defences would naturally lead to realistic flood insurance being reinstated.  Alas, Irish insurance companies, unlike their UK counterparts, have not shown the same level of social responsibility.  Given the massive investment of taxpayers' money, estimated to be in the region of &euro;500 million over the next few years, the openness of the OPW in sharing information, the track record of OPW and given that insurance by its nature is the management of risk where the premiums of the many pay for the losses of the few, surely we as taxpayers and clients have the right to expect more from our insurance industry.  Insurance is not a solution for possible loss.  However, being able to transfer or share risk, traditionally done through insurance, is critical to the economic success of business, communities and regions.  The abdication of responsibility in this instance by the insurance industry is truly reprehensible.<br\/><br\/>The late Owen O'Callaghan, a prominent and active member of the Cork Business Association and one of Cork city's largest developers, said on several occasions that many retail operations have bypassed Cork city because they are unable to get flood insurance.  If the current <i>status quo<\/i>persists when the OPW works in Cork are completed, how are we as a business organisation expected to encourage and recommend existing businesses to expand and spend thousands upgrading their premises?  How do we expect inward investment, whether domestic or foreign, to our city when our insurance industry shows no faith in the flood defences.  There are already areas suffering dereliction and neglect following the last flooding.  Business owners have been unwilling or more likely unable during what was the worst recession to hit this country to raise the funds to repair the damage.  Many have suffered physical or psychological illness from the anxiety and stress.  The immediate and future circumstances of many have utterly changed.  The human and economic cost has left many business owners broken or broke.  <br\/><br\/>Let there be no doubt the current <i>status quo<\/i>is unsustainable.  On behalf of myself and my colleagues, I thank the committee for the opportunity to put forward our views on this issue and to raise some important questions about the provision of flood insurance.  Our sincere hope is that these questions, views and concerns can be addressed in a meaningful way.

It would not be fair to say that I was born in the flood but I was certainly baptised in the flood.  I live less than 100 paces from the River Blackwater.  If I threw a stone from my house, it would pretty much land in the Blackwater.  I have first-hand experience of flooding incidences on the Munster Blackwater and I know that the schemes that have been put in place in Mallow and Fermoy demonstrably work.  There is clear evidence that they work.<\/p><p>There is no ambiguity about that whatsoever.  The system of demountables that has been put in place has been extremely successful.  I know of only one breach, which was in a very particular location and was due to an electrical fault on a pump, in the past ten years, and it has since been fixed.  I, therefore, see no reason whatsoever for any entity or party to hold back flood insurance from any premises or business within the floodplains of Fermoy and Mallow.  I concur with Deputy McGrath that we should not have to seek a legislative solution to this issue.<\/p><p> What is the perception of the three witnesses of the memorandum of understanding and how it is operating as it relates to the OPW and Insurance Ireland?  It appears to me that it merely seeks to share information and does not go beyond that.  There does not appear to be any statement of principles.  For instance, when the OPW kicks the tyres on a successful flood alleviation project, the OPW's word does not seem sufficient within that memorandum of understanding, MOU, to give assurances to any constituent member of Insurance Ireland that it can proceed to provide insurance in any areas covered by flood alleviation works.  There seems to be a complete flaw in that regard.  That is my first point and my first question.<\/p><p> My second point - I would like the witnesses' perception of this - concerns something I find incongruous and contradictory about the involvement of a global player such as Arup.  Arup's consulting engineers were engaged to assess the flood relief scheme in Mallow.  The Lagan Group provided the consulting engineers on the second phase.  Arup is a globally recognised company.  It did not come to Mallow and carry out the works it did without itself having insurance.  There are more than 100 names, including some very big ones, on the list of Insurance Ireland's members.  Starting with the As, there is Accenture, American International Group, AIG, and Alliance; going down the list, there is Lloyds and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, BBVA.  It is fair to assume that any one of these members of Insurance Ireland probably provided Arup with some degree of cover for the works it carried out.  Therefore, it seems to me a contradiction that Insurance Ireland is happy to provide cover for consulting engineers who might provide works and kick the tyres on the works carried out, which then pass muster, and does not then provide cover after the fact, after the works have been successful - it is incontrovertible that they have been successful - for the people who benefit from the very schemes provided by companies such as Lagan and Arup.  There is an inherent contradiction here.  Furthermore, we are at a disadvantage here because Insurance Ireland always comes before the Oireachtas with one person as the representative of all of these insurance houses.  I contend that we need to hear from individual voices who have provided insurance cover in the past but who do not have the guts, quite frankly, to come before us and give an account of their actions.  I would like to hear from the witnesses how they perceive the contradictions I have just outlined.<\/p><p> I want to ask another, more specific question.  It is a very simple question.  Forgive me if it is a stupid one.  I have always thought that the principles of insurance cover were such that an insurance house or company was legally obliged to provide a quote and therefore had to provide cover.  Mr. Kavanagh spoke about the issue of excess but, regarding instances of people I know and people he knows not being able to get insurance, I always thought there was a provision governing the principles of providing insurance that one had to at least provide a quote for cover.  Perhaps the witnesses could provide me with some information on that.<\/p><p> I will leave it at that for now.  With the Chairman's indulgence, I might come back in for one more bite of the cherry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112300002#E00500","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511429400,"counter":1648,"content":"<p>I will give the Deputy my interpretation of the questions he asked, and perhaps my colleagues will want to feed in afterwards.  The memorandum of understanding was drafted by a very eminent civil servant, who is now retired, called Tony Smith.  He did his best to set up an agreement between the insurance industry and the OPW whereby there would be a frank and open exchange of information.  However, there is no buy-in from Insurance Ireland and no pressure.  I would describe the memorandum of understanding as providing only for the exchange of information.  There is no commitment to reinstatement.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's point about Arup is extremely well made.  Arup engineers were involved in building probably one of the most iconic buildings in the world, the Sydney Opera House.  These are the types of companies we have coming into Ireland.  As I have said before, we have some of the best schemes in the world.  We have three experts coming to our national conference on Saturday, including Liesbeth van Riet Paap, a senior civil servant with Rijkswaterstaat, which is the Dutch equivalent of the OPW.  Holland is a country that is partly below sea level.  They say that if we lived in Holland we would drown, and if the Dutch lived here they would feed the world.  The fact of the matter is they have worldwide expertise, and that is why we have invited them to our conference to speak.  Ms van Riet Paap has visited Fermoy and can see absolutely no problem.  The demountables are recognised as workable systems right across Europe, but insurance companies in Ireland are being let off the hook.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the provision of quotes, Mr. Kavanagh probably has more expertise than I do, but what we are finding is that insurance companies will quote a household but put in exclusions.  They will quote the household and give it house insurance but they will exclude flood insurance, so one has house cover but no flood cover.  In other words, the household has a policy that will protect it from fire but not flooding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112300002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jer Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1649,"content":"<p>The MOU is not working-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112300002#F00300","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511429400,"counter":1650,"content":"<p>The MOU is not working.

Mr. Kavanagh referred earlier to the risk profile.  The risk profile, as I understand it, has become so low.  Is there something that needs to be done from an OPW point of view regarding mapping?  I am aware of mapping that has been used by insurance companies.  They sit at the desk, a customer phones them, they look at the map and they say the customer has been kicked out of the system because the map in the first instance is the guide they use.  Could we do something to address the mapping issue beyond the mere desktop?  In other words, if we started drilling down into the histories, the amount of moneys that have been spent on demountables, flood alleviation works, arterial drainage and so on, we could start to create a more accurate picture of what is actually happening in reality.<\/p><p>I contend, and I would like to hear the witnesses' perceptions and opinions on this, that the OPW probably has to push harder against Insurance Ireland, in terms of how the memorandum of understanding actually operates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112300002#F00600","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511429400,"counter":1655,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy's interpretation.  Meetings did not even take place until the flood forum started to rattle the cage a bit.  I asked on several occasions who were the individual representatives of the insurance companies, to be told off the record that he or she was gone and there was nobody at the time.  Where this information was going and how high up the line it was going is very questionable.  The memorandum has no teeth whatsoever.  It does not force anybody and is only a sharing of information.  The OPW needs to push harder from its side and the Minister needs to push harder.  To give an example, slide 11 from our presentation shows a map of the town of Fermoy.  The slide has red lines, the area within which we identified as the red zone, or the blacklisted zone.  If one found the geocoding maps, and if one was able to get them, they would vary as to the parts of the map covered, but none would give cover within the red lines.  They all vary.  The CFRAM map is more detailed and needs to be forced into geocoding.  One of the flaws is that the OPW still considers this section of Fermoy to be flood A rated, which means Cork County Council still sees Fermoy as being flood A rated, which means a house or a development with an apartment cannot be built within the zone.  Planning permission will not be obtained without really pushing the boundaries.  There needs to be a big push on the back of this, which is why we welcome the Bill in an effort to move this on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112300002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1656,"content":"<p>Mr. Kavanagh mentioned Cork County Council.

Insurance Ireland states the discussion with the OPW needs to get onto this.<\/p> <p>  It is now admitting that demountable defences work and offer the same protection as fixed defences but there is a human element.  It has given us some examples of where demountable defences have failed because of human intervention.  All of the examples given are from the UK.  None of them is from Ireland, interestingly enough.  This tells its own story.  One example given is a delay in 2007 in Upton Upon Severn in erecting the demountable defence because it was not deployed in time due to severe disruption to the transport infrastructure, itself caused by flooding.

I do not believe the insurance companies come to the table with clean hands.  I do not believe they have any willingness whatsoever to move.

This does not cut the mustard.  There is human error if someone forgets to press the brake in the car.  There is human error with regard to all insurance policies, but Insurance Ireland cannot give any example in Ireland to date, despite the worst flooding this country ever saw in 2015.  Schemes in Clonmel worked perfectly with demountable defences.  Schemes in Mallow worked perfectly, and they were fully tested, and there was the scheme in Fermoy.  Between these three schemes alone, &euro;115 million was spent.  They are up and operational since 2014 and 2015, and we are in 2017 and the insurance companies still refuse cover.<\/p> <p>  It is essential that any committee member questioning the insurance industry drills down through the figures, because the insurance industry will blind them with figures today.  They will give percentages and phrases such as \"98% cover\", and state they are not in the business of insuring an uninsurable risk.  We are not speaking about an uninsurable risk.  We are speaking about a risk that has been mitigated by some of the best flood defence schemes in the world, and we cannot get over this hurdle.  We are talking about the whole centre of Fermoy having no flood insurance.  If 98% of homeowners and businesses have flood cover, how on earth can we have this map, based on a survey, with all of the red zones shown?

There is not a willingness, and there will not be a willingness, by insurance companies to come to the table and address these issues in a proper way.  The only way forward is Deputy McGrath's Bill.

Perhaps the time has come for insurers to draw up a list after a scheme has been completed and admit that they are not insuring in particular areas.  That would allow us to get to grips with this.

The Cork Business Association has engaged with the OPW since 2009 on the upcoming flood defences in Cork to ensure that they work for businesses and people in the city and to give our support.  The whole idea of a memorandum of understanding is that there is a result at the end of it.  However, there is no substance to the memorandum, which is merely a commitment to share information.  There is no commitment to do something at the end of it in the context of bringing in realistic insurance for flood areas where there has been a level of work by the OPW which is as good as anything in the world.

It is a pity Deputy O'Brien had to leave because not one house in the Lough in Cork, where the distance is 10 m, has flood cover unless it was bought when it was built in the late 1940s or early 1950s.  Those people are being charged enormous sums of money.  Elderly people come to us with bills of up to &euro;1,500 for insurance they should be getting for &euro;350.

If we ask whether there is household flood cover, we may not get an answer to the question.  One ways that the Government could gather the data is through the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  The CSO is a reputable organisation and has a long and proven track record and history of gathering data, and there is legislation that gives it the powers to collect the data properly.  This is one way this could be done.<\/p> <p>  The former Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney, was the first Minister to insist that Insurance Ireland meet the Office of Public Works, OPW, more regularly and not just once a year.

Under the memorandum of understanding, could we reverse the cart and tell Insurance Ireland that we are not interested in where it is providing flood insurance cover, but would like an answer as to where it is not providing insurance cover?  We must put the pressure back on the insurance companies to come up with the data as to where they are not providing insurance cover, because Insurance Ireland would know where the insurance cover is not being provided.

Even though most of those from whom we have heard so far this morning have Cork accents, this is truly a national issue.  I know the witnesses respect that.  We are mindful that people in the midlands have been affected by the horrific flooding of their properties in recent days.  A huge flood relief programme on the River Nore in Kilkenny city has been completed and is working.  If that had not happened, properties all around the centre of the city and on the margins of the city would have been flooded.  In spite of that scheme, there are properties that are still failing to get proper full insurance cover or are being loaded with premiums that are so excessive that they do not bother to get insurance.  I do not think that is acceptable.<\/p> <p>  I agree fully with the points that have been made about the lack of data.  A similar point was made when we were discussing vehicle insurance.  I commend Deputy Michael McGrath on the introduction of this Bill which sets out a way forward in this respect.  The committee has a keen interest in this issue and wants to pursue it further.  I have no doubt that as a result of the focus that has been placed on this Bill, it will be possible for some changes to be made.  It is definitely more difficult to fight this issue because of the attitude of the insurance companies which have let the citizens of this country down when it comes to insurance cover.  This point also applies to other forms of insurance that are provided.<\/p><p>There is a need to break what seems to be a cartel and its power over the future cover of people who are affected, and this Bill will deal with that.  Deputy McGrath has shown great leadership and is a visionary in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112300002#K02900","speaker":"1248","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1726,"content":"<p>Thank you, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112300002#L00200","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1727,"content":"<p>Beware of Greeks bearing gifts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112300002#L00300","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1728,"content":"<p>That is the kiss of death if ever there was one.  I will be brief.  I thank sincerely our witnesses for the effort they made to be here and for the work they have put into this over a prolonged period.  It has to be acknowledged that they have brought the issue centre stage in terms of the political agenda.  That in itself is an achievement and now we want to achieve progress and get the issue dealt with.<\/p> <p>  In advance of today's hearing the Oireachtas Library and Research Service produced a document which is a very good summary of all the different strands to this issue.  We will share this with the witnesses.  It has included a good table with the key statistics.  I agree with the witnesses that it is about probing these statistics and asking the right questions, and that there is a need for independent validation.  The first job that has to be done in any analysis is to validate the data.  Mr. Jer Buckley and I would have discussed previously the estimate of the number of homes without any insurance policy.  The Library and Research Service has the reference to it in this document.  It comes from a Department of Finance report in 2010 which estimated that 33%, or 570,000, of households were estimated to have no household insurance.  That is aside from the issue of flood cover.  On Mr. Kavanagh's point, many people do not even know whether they have flood cover in their insurance policy.  I would not know that.  I would have to dig out the policy schedule, examine it and see if I have flood cover.  I believe people would not know that.  They may know in the areas affected because it would have been brought to their attention that they no longer have flood insurance cover.<\/p> <p>  The statistics from Insurance Ireland, which we need to probe, show that 98% of all household insurance policies have flood cover, which we touched on earlier, and that 83% of property insurance policies in areas which recently completed flood defences have cover, but that is those that have policies.  There are many that do not have policies for a variety of reasons, but in some cases the reason would be that they cannot get flood cover and there is little point in having a policy.  That has to be probed.  Insurance Ireland says it is at 89% coverage where the defences are permanent and at 78% for demountables.  It is even acknowledging that in areas where schemes have been completed and there are demountables, more than one in five of those in such areas who have a household insurance policy have not been given flood cover.  It has acknowledged that even in its own statistics, which are not validated.<\/p> <p>  There is no information on the issue of excess, which is a key element in any insurance policy.  We can quote these statistics about the percentage that have flood cover, but if one has to cover the first &euro;2,000, &euro;5,000 or &euro;10,000 of one's policy, that raises serious questions about the value of that cover.<\/p> <p>  We have to bear in mind the consequences for people of having no flood cover.  We spoke about households and for them it is largely piece of mind.  If they are not going to be flooded again, not having insurance for it is a piece of mind issue, but it is more than that if they have to sell the property because a prospective purchaser will have to demonstrate to the bank from which he or she is borrowing that, before they get the mortgage, that they can take out an adequate insurance policy in respect of the property.  That would include flood cover, certainly in areas where there has been a risk of flooding in the past.  We spoke about the consequences for businesses, and it is a key issue for them.  I know of a number who have no cover, not just flood cover but no cover at all, and who are taking a crazy risk because they are potentially liable, including when it comes to personal assets, homes and so on.<\/p> <p>  The key thrust of the Bill is what we have to bear in mind and section 3 is the meat of it, so to speak.  It states that insurers cannot and shall not discriminate as between people and businesses in areas where schemes have been completed and in areas where there is no risk of flooding anyway.  That is the key measure.  They cannot discriminate on the question of, first, whether an insurance policy is offered and, second, on the price at which it is offered other than to the extent reasonably justified by the current risk profile associated with a property.  That is a very fair presentation for the industry and one that should not be too onerous on it to comply with.  The adjudicator on whether it would be reasonably justified is ultimately the ombudsman.  Similarly, they cannot differentiate on the other terms either.  That is a key point.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy O'Brien's comments about what Insurance Ireland representatives will tell us and what is in their opening statement in order that the witnesses know for the record, the key line, which is probably not altogether new but might signal some progress, is that they say they accept that at this early stage in their cycle, the OPW demountable defences appear to be performing well.  They then go on to state the caveat about human intervention and cite the four instances in the United Kingdom where they claim there was a failure of demountables because of human intervention and so on.  We will question them.<\/p> <p>  I should say to the witnesses that this Bill, before proceeding to Committee Stage, which is the next Stage, requires a money message from Government.  I do not expect them to be aware of all the technicalities but the Ceann Comhairle has made a ruling, not just relating to this Bill but on a number of other Bills, that where the Bill potentially involves the expenditure of public money, which in this case is very modest and in respect of which the only additional expenditure is potentially extra resources for the Ombudsman to deal with cases, and given that there is a role for the Central Bank in the Bill, from which I assume the interpretation is that the Bill imposes potential additional costs, for the Bill to proceed, the Government has to provide a money message to this committee.  That is a decision of Government so it is an issue on which we will press it.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses again for their contributions and we will continue to work on this issue.  The information they have armed us with and the practical information on the ground is extremely helpful.  We will use it as best we can in the next session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112300002#L00400","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1729,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McGrath, each of the witnesses and their colleagues in the back row for attending.

Our members also have extensive experience of flood defence policies internationally and their interaction with insurance cover.<\/p> <p>  I will keep my remarks brief and cover the policy context of the current Government flood policy before addressing the Flood Insurance Bill 2016 directly.  I will also provide members of the committee with a brief overview of how Insurance Ireland responded to Hurricane Ophelia.  We will then be available to discuss these issues with the members present today.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the recent severe weather events, Insurance Ireland members, along with most other businesses nationwide, closed offices on Monday, 16 October for employee safety reasons.  Claims management teams deployed their individual weather catastrophe plans.  This included walking through first response procedures; refreshing claims handlers on those procedures; deploying telephony surge protocols and activating first notification of loss protocols, enabling claims personnel and customers to complete initial registration online.  Staffing levels within the first notification protocol teams were closely monitored over the following days.<\/p> <p>  Insurers, therefore, undertook several measures to ensure policyholders and claimants were dealt with in a timely and efficient manner and are now focused on the resolution and timely payment of claims.  It is worth noting that the majority of Ophelia-related claims are low value, where private dwellings were not rendered uninhabitable and therefore the need for interim payments did not generally arise.  As expected, the majority of losses occurred in the south, with the following geographic spread observed to date: Cork, 30% claimants; Tipperary, 10%; Wexford, 7%; and Waterford, Limerick, and Kilkenny, between 5% and 6%. <\/p> <p>  Regarding policy and key trends, Insurance Ireland is committed to working with the Government, the Office of Public Works, OPW, and other agencies of the State to support the policy of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to mitigating flooding.  Insurers play an important role in working with the Government and its agencies to help meet the needs of those who require flood insurance.  Insurers want to underwrite risk and they want to broaden coverage and that has been borne out in recent years with 98% of home policies in Ireland having flood insurance.  In 2014, Insurance Ireland signed a memorandum of understanding, MOU, with the OPW.  At its core, this MOU creates a system whereby the OPW shares information on the defences it has completed, and Insurance Ireland members take this information into account when underwriting these risks and seeks to ensure cover in these protected areas.<\/p><p>Insurers work to a fixed one in 100 year standard of flood defences.  Where defences have been completed to this standard in what are known as defended areas, coverage rates for flood insurance increased.  <\/p><p> We would like to be clear about how we arrive at our figures.  The only reliable measure on which we can collect data is the percentage of policies that have flood cover.  This is the only reliable baseline data.  There are a lot of properties which for any number of reasons are not insured and as such they will greatly skew the coverage rates.  We believe the policy is working and, although it is gradual, progress is being made in a sustainable manner for both communities and insurers.  <\/p><p> Regarding demountable defences, a key feature of the discussion on flood defences has been around the issue of demountable defences or schemes that have a demountable element.  From an insurance perspective, the human intervention required to put in place flood defences is a key variable and one which is difficult to resolve.  We accept, at this early stage in their cycle, that the OPW's demountable defences appear to be performing well.  However, there have been a number of demountable failures in the UK in recent years.  For example, in 2007, the Upton-upon-Severn demountable defences were not deployed in time due to the severe disruption of transport infrastructure caused by flooding.  We had a similar instance in 2012 in Kempsey, Worcestershire, where a faulty sensor caused the failure of a demountable defence.  The sensor had become waterlogged due to heavy rainfall and then two pumps that were designed to start automatically failed.  Another example is York in 2015.  Finally, a temporary steel defence was not erected in Llanrwst in Wales.  We have also experienced this situation closer to home.  In 2011, there was a failure to deploy a demountable defence for the River Dodder.  <\/p><p> We have been working with the OPW and the Government to get to a place where progress can be made on the demountable issue.  I am pleased to be able to update the committee that our discussions are making progress.  Insurance Ireland has informed the OPW and the Department of Finance that the following detailed negotiations with our members agreed that once demountables defences are erected in a timely fashion and correctly installed, they offer the same protection and risk as fixed defences.  The missing part of the puzzle is the human intervention to erect the defences.  We are beginning to look at strategies to address the issue of human intervention.  This is detailed work and needs to be progressed in a prudent manner to ensure insurance companies do not take on excessive risk that would undermine their solvency, this in turn is to ensure that they have sufficient revenues to meet the needs of their future claimants. <\/p><p> On the Flood Insurance Bill 2016, given the policy context and the current issues being worked through, it is our considered opinion that the proposed legislation will not achieve its stated aim of building coverage in defended areas.  We recognise the concerns that exist in parts of the country where flood cover is not yet available.  However, when looked at in national and international contexts, we have a sustainable model for flood protection that is linked to an appropriate national policy.  The interdepartmental flood policy group stated last year that the current focus on prioritising flood defences in areas at risk and working with insurers through the OPW is the best approach  The memorandum of understanding, MOU, is working.  It is our firm belief that it will continue to work into the future. <\/p><p> Finally, there has been a lot of discussion about a national scheme similar to Flood Re in the UK.  We caution against such an approach.  Flood Re has estimated that the average cost to repair an impacted dwelling is between &pound;20,000 and &pound;45,000.  In the UK Flood Re only applies to residential properties built before 2009.  Also, in the UK, Flood Re covers approximately 2% of policies.  It is our belief that the Department of Finance estimate that a Flood Re system would result in a levy of between 9% and 16% being imposed on every household policy every year is on the light side.  It could easily be envisaged that such a levy could rise above 17%.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear before them today.  We look forward to discussing the proposed legislation with members. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112300002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Thompson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511429400,"counter":1734,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation.  In 2015, I gave evidence here which triggered my interest and led to a project that I did with the Environmental Protection Agency.  I am quite grateful to be here and hope that my work will contribute to this debate.  Part of my work involves working with University College Cork.<\/p> <p>  Before delving into the technical details it is important that we recognise that flooding is a real concern and threat.  Yesterday and last night flooding occurred and it is ongoing.  Often when one conducts research one views it through a very technical lens.  It is really important that we understand the concerns of the businesses and home owners who struggle to get insurance cover. <\/p> <p>  My remarks will be structured around three points, which are mainly based on my policy paper that I am sure the committee has seen before.  I will commence with my understanding of the underlying problem, which is why we are having this welcome and much needed debate.  As I always say, there is a cause and a symptom.  While there is certainly a need to provide some interim solutions that will help people who are struggling to get flood insurance, it is important to understand the threat of flood risk and the related decisions in terms of planning policy and investments made to defend areas.  I know from my work here that a lot of progress has been made.  I wish to underline the fact that the OPW has made significant progress and the amount of data available has increased significantly.  Also, a lot of effort has been made around climate adaptation.  Clearly, however, this does not resolve the issue for the people who are currently struggling and that is the problem the Bill tries to address. Overall, it is important to recognise that the flood insurance market works for the large majority of people in this country.  That is not an understatement because, compared with a lot of other countries where there is no flood insurance market or where all of the flood insurance is provided through the government, that is certainly an achievement.  That does not resolve the problem for the people who are currently struggling but it is important to keep that in mind when considering ways to address their current problems. <\/p> <p>  I will outline my observations so far.  In terms of addressing the problem of businesses and home owners struggling to access flood insurance, it looks to me a little like a blame game between the industry on one side and either those affected but also, to some extent, the Government on the other side.  My intervention here is to identify ways to resolve the blame game.  <\/p> <p>  I value the debate that the Bill has triggered and to some extent, the debate is overdue.  The legislation, however,  raises two questions.  First, is intervention through a Bill necessary?  Clearly, there is need for action, more investment, better transparency, data sharing and a stronger commitment by the industry and support for those who struggle to access insurance.  It is clearly an issue that needs to be addressed.  The second question, however, is whether the Bill addresses this matter.  I believe the Bill as currently drafted does not address the problems.  I will highlight a couple of points.  While members have more experience than do I when it comes to drafting Bills, on looking at the text, the current wording raises a few questions.  For example, I refer to the aspect of what is reasonable in trying to understand how insurers can reasonably discriminate.  The legislation generates many questions such as who would make that judgment and decision, who would agree on flat-risk profiling and who would become the arbitrary body. <\/p> <p>  The Bill only considers one problem, that is, where insurers are apparently or supposedly not taking into account the existence of new or existing defences.  That is a frustrating issue and it is clearly not right.  I do not think one needs a Bill to resolve the matter and will outline a couple of ways in which this matter could be resolved.  It is key to understand where the underlying information issue sits because there is the big issue with how current is the information and how current are the maps that are being developed.<\/p><p>How good is the information held by the insurance companies themselves and how transparent is it?  Outlining those questions, it will be clear that many have no clear answer.  That is the key issue here.  We do not have a transparent approach to rating flat risk, and there is no transparent approach to showing how that flat risk is evaluated by insurers and how it is communicated to home owners.<\/p><p> Before I give a few suggestions on how this might be addressed, I will conclude my remarks on the Bill.  I feel that in its current version, the Bill might have an impact on the market which should not be underestimated.  Among the possible responses are lower coverage levels, so insurers might just review their existing provision of cover to properties, and there could be some concern on solvency.  We should recognise that if flat insurance is provided through the private market, then there must be some space for insurers to do their assessment and pricing.  From discussions, I realise that is recognised by the Bill's supporters but the mechanism as currently provided for in the Bill would not work.  The alternative would be to have a national insurance system, as in the US, where this issue is resolved because there is agreement on flat maps and flat risk and rating.  This can raise many other questions, however, and I do not know if flat insurance is the way to go.  <\/p><p> Where do I see the potential to resolve these underlying issues?  We often hear about the memorandum of understanding.  It is a step in the right direction but I do not think that it works as well as it could or should.  There must be a more transparent approach.  My recommendation would be to take the memorandum of understanding as a starting point but to revisit it and devise a new version.  We cannot hide from risk data and modelling.  Next year, a new insurance flat risk model for Ireland will be put into the market and there will be much new information coming through that.  It might raise some concerns with people worrying that it might lead to higher premiums and make the situation worse.  That is not how a flat insurance market should work.  We need to understand how insurers consider risk data and how it impacts on price and on underwriting decisions.  That transparency is necessary.  There must also be greater sharing and speedier sharing - there is a delay with data about new defences being made available and then put into a flat risk models used by insurers which is unhelpful - but the insurers must also be more proactive.  I can say that because I used to work in the insurance industry before returning to academia.<\/p><p> I work with many insurance companies internationally which also underwrite here.  There is an overarching commitment and recognition that insurers want to play a role as society's risk manager.  Ireland has an opportunity to hold the industry to account on that because clearly there are issues where that does not work.  The main issue where this could be adjusted easily is that of transparency.  Will this resolve the problem for those currently struggling to secure insurance cover?  It should, in the longer term, but now it does not.  There should be a discussion around options around deductibles, ensuring that even in high risk areas people can still access insurance, perhaps not flood insurance but insurance as such, because if someone cannot get any insurance then there is really a problem.  We also need to track the scale of the problem.  How many people are currently affected?  How many will benefit from new defences?  There is not much understanding or clarity on this question because different figures are being produced and it is not enough on which to base a strong intervention.<\/p><p> I will finish by reiterating that issues need to be addressed but by resolving the distrust and the lack of transparency, we could get quite far.  If that does not work, there is a strong case for the Bill but we are not there yet.  I hope my remarks are taken as encouragement to go back to the drawing board with the memorandum of understanding and make it work to begin with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112300002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Swenja Surminski","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1736,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their contributions and opening statements.<\/p> <p>  I will start by addressing Mr. Thompson.  I do not know if he saw much of the earlier session that we held with the Irish National Flood Forum and the Cork Business Association.  The key question that emerged from that session is one of which Mr. Thompson will be aware.  There are towns where the Office of Public Works completed flood relief schemes several years ago and these schemes have proven successful, having been tested against very severe weather conditions and flood events which would have flooded the areas in the past.  There is a map of Fermoy in County Cork which Mr. Thompson may not have seen, on which all the areas within red lines have been denied flood insurance cover despite being located in a town where a very significant public investment of &euro;35 million has resulted in an effective flood defence system being put in place.

We have given our statistics which illustrate that to the Office of Public Works.  For fixed defences, we are up to a coverage rate of 89% and the rate for the demountables is 75%, which gives us an average of 83%.  From our perspective, the memorandum of understanding is working.  Coverage rates are increasing and we would envisage that they would continue to increase over time.  Nevertheless, we recognise that it takes time for coverage rates to increase and get to a level that the public demands.  Equally, insurers must act in an prudent manner.  They must be cognisant of their solvency and the risk they take on.  To increase the coverage rates, it would help if the industry to return to a more profitable state.  Once that happens, capacity will increase and new capital will come into the market with new providers, which will increase coverage.<\/p> <p>  There are also situations in particular areas where certain insurers will have reached their concentration limits in the context of their own risk appetite.  In the management of their own capital, the committee will appreciate, certain insurers in a given area will decide that they have taken on as much risk as they can there.  That is why it is important to encourage new entrants into the market, in order to provide additional capacity so that over time we can increase the coverage rates.  We firmly believe that the Office of Public Works is working as is the memorandum of understanding between ourselves and the Office of Public Works.  That is borne out by the coverage rates.  <\/p> <p>  I also recognised some of the comments of earlier participants.  There were two observations.  One related to the industry's breach of consumer protection codes on loss assessors.  We tell people that where there is evidence of breaches in specific cases, this should be brought to the Central Bank.<\/p><p>We would encourage participants to do that.  <\/p><p> On the issue of retention limits, it is important for the committee to understand why they exist.

This has been one of my concerns and the same applies to the UK.  There is just no indication of someone's risk level on policy documentation.  A person renews his or her policy, receives the policy document and pays a premium but it does not really tell him or her anything about the specific risk.  There is no reason why insurers could not do that.  The next step involves explaining what options would exist, for example, if an insurance company assessed the risk and the consumer did not agree.  It creates that first step and there then needs to be a process.  The latter exists in some countries.  For example, there is a mechanism in Australia where there are certain forms policyholders can complete if they disagree with that assessment and they can then launch that appeal to Insurance Australia and start a dialogue.  This is just an example but one needs to start somewhere with transparency.  When it comes to pricing, clearly, that is a commercial decision on the part of insurers.  Transparency is more difficult in this area because one is not pricing just for floods but for the entire package.  Again, however, it could be argued that there could be greater transparency regarding how the rates might be affected by flood risk.  That works in other countries as well, so these are two examples.<\/p> <p>  In a situation where there is evidence of a flood defence scheme being put in place, being tested and working, there is no reason why that should not feature in the flood risk models insurers use.  Having said that, there are lots of other potential reasons which might count against an insurer underwriting in that particular region and which might have nothing to do with flood risk.  Again, this comes back to the point about transparency.  There could be a mechanism whereby there is a degree of disclosure regarding the decision about not granting cover.  There needs to be an explanation attached to such a decision.  From experience, I know it is quite difficult to then pinpoint where the efforts are exhausted because the question arises as to what one expects from a shop owner, for example.  How many efforts does a shop owner need to make before he or she comes to the conclusion that there is no insurance cover available?  This is something that needs to be looked into to because if someone has called ten insurers or five brokers, does that mean that the person is uninsurable?  There is probably a mechanism - possibly with Insurance Ireland - that could be simplified and some sort of signposting - such as a dedicated service for people who are struggling to access insurance - put in place.  These are things that have been tried and explored in other countries, so there is scope to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112300002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Swenja Surminski"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1761,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

It does not involve a big cost.  It is a matter of sending somebody down to observe.  Insurance Ireland's members need to be on the ground observing what is happening in real time for themselves.  Insurance Ireland's members hold 95% of the domestic insurance market and 85% of the international life insurance market in this country.  I do not see why they cannot go down to places such as Fermoy, Mallow and other areas which have been covered by capital works carried out by organisations such as the Lagan Group and Arup.  Arup is a global leader.  It carried out the flood alleviation works in Mallow.<\/p><p>Arup recently conducted a study with Lloyds of London on offsetting or mitigating against risk for catastrophes owing to climate change in global cities.  Lloyds is a member of Insurance Ireland.  I acknowledge Mr. Thompson will not be able to respond to this but when Arup was doing the flood alleviation works as consulting engineers, its cover for insurance was being provided by one of the witness's constituent groups.  I find it incongruous that Arup could be covered by one of Insurance Ireland's constituent groups and the works could be stood over but that after the fact, the people who rely on those works could not be covered by one of his constituent groups.  Can Mr. Thompson understand the level of anger that exists in this regard?  I believe some members of Insurance Ireland have already decided they absolutely and utterly will not provide flood cover regardless of what protocols Insurance Ireland puts in place or are covered by the memorandum of understanding, MOU.

The OPW is there and we are actively exchanging information.  The other concern which the Deputy raised was on getting people on the ground.  To be fair to the insurers, they deploy loss assessors on the ground when they know to do so through a weather warning or whatever.  Storm Ophelia was a case in point where the industry mobilised very effectively to make sure it had people on the ground to assess what was coming and ultimately what happened post the storm.  The same thing happened in County Donegal.  To be fair, the industry does mobilise in this regard.  There is an exchange of information and we are in a process in which we seek to get to the right result.<\/p> <p>  I take Deputy Sherlock's point.  We are in a free market and individual companies will make their own decisions.  I come back, however, to my earlier comment.  We are trying, with the MOU, to create an environment and a mechanism to share data that will give a degree of comfort to each company to increase their capacity and their acceptance of risk in this area.  That is not to say that every company will do it and companies also may do it in different degrees.  This comes back to my other point that if we can get the environment and the exchange of information right between us and the OPW and the relevant schemes, the likelihood is that we will attract in more players into the market.  I also note the comments of the earlier contributors to the effect they already have attracted in two new players.  That is welcome.  We only see the OPW facilitating that more and more.  If we can get the right framework through the MOU, we can do that.  We are working hard to exchange information and to be fair to our members, they deploy people on the ground.

They are typical of examples throughout the country where flood works have been carried out.  Mr. Thompson still appears to be doubting those very protocols because he said that Insurance Ireland deployed staff in Storm Ophelia.  I defy anybody to have gone out on the Monday of Storm Ophelia because one would not put anyone outside the door on that day.  He is referring to deploying after the fact and not before the fact.  There must be a greater degree of willingness on the part of Insurance Ireland to drill down further and to start talking to local authority officials.  As somebody who lives in the town, the process by which one would do that is not as formal, as formulaic or as systematic as I would like.  I live 100 paces from the Blackwater River and I still have not seen the evidence of this happening in real time.  Mr. Thompson has stated there are two processes, one being Insurance Ireland's own working groups and the other being through the OPW process.

What we are trying to do, piecemeal, is work through a system whereby Insurance Ireland's members can be absolutely and utterly convinced that they have witnessed at first hand how the demountables are working because the witness is throwing doubt over the demountables.  That is the evidence Mr. Thompson is giving here and he has cited two Irish examples.  I want to ensure that Insurance Ireland and its members will be confident that the human error protocols that are put in place, for instance, by Cork County Council are so robust as to ensure the risk is absolutely and utterly mitigated.

The individual insurance companies appear to make their own executive risk decisions.  We need to get under the floorboards and find out exactly what they are doing.  The committee should make a suggestion to bring in a number of the larger companies and see exactly what they do.  I can only speak from my own perspective.  The insurance companies have a job to do, but the assessment of this intangible risk is causing problems.  I can demonstrate with my own situation.  I am based in Limerick city.  We have had repeated flooding since 2009, and if we had flooding tomorrow, I can tell you where that flooding will be.  It will be in Castleconnell, Montpellier, Annacotty, Saint Mary's Park, Corbally, probably Mountshannon Road, and maybe the Dock Road.  In other words, a few defined areas.<\/p> <p>  I know people who are living in houses that were never flooded.  For example, Annacotty is beside Castletroy, a large built-up area, and it was not flooded.  Yet, I had people telephoning me, young couples who had bought houses and qualified for house insurance.  Then, overnight, they were told that companies would not cover them.  Overnight, they have an issue with their house being insured for flooding, and an issue with the marketable title of their house.  Mr. Thompson says that there is an 83% rate of coverage, and Insurance Ireland is looking to increase that.  Would it be fair to say that the 17% who are not covered are concentrated in a few areas where there are a lot of people without coverage?  Would that be a fair comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112300002#T02400","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511429400,"counter":1847,"content":"<p>I cannot comment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017112300002#T02500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Thompson"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1848,"content":"<p>I think it would be fair speculation.

I want to distil this down.  In the main, the 17% not covered are on flood plains or areas exposed to flooding.  The question is what can we do in terms of goodwill from the insurance companies.

Perhaps Insurance Ireland can have a part to play to bring about a sense of urgency to allow the Minister of State look for OPW funding to get flood relief schemes under way.  Obviously, he goes to the Department of Finance to get the funding.  What can the insurance industry do to assist the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW to get the requisite funding to put in place flood defences and honour its side of the bargain, whereby if they are put in place the industry will reinsure and continue house insurance?

This will not affect the building or safety standards that are required of these units.  Rather, it will make it more convenient for owners to bring compliant units to the market.  These are obviously badly needed in the context of the housing crisis.  We believe that what we are seeking to do will bring thousands of vacant units onto the market, particularly as there are thousands of units throughout the country that are above commercial spaces or in older properties which could, and hopefully will, be used for residential purposes but which are not yet compliant with building regulations.  Bringing such units to the market currently requires multiple meetings with different officials, namely, fire officers, disability officers, planners, and possibly conservation officers.  For most people, this amounts to a lot of cost and hassle, meaning that an otherwise perfect unit remains unused into the future.  Many of these units are in prime city or town centre locations.  It is estimated, for example, that there are 4,000 vacant above-the-shop units in Dublin city alone, which is a shameful waste in view of the ongoing housing crisis here.  We believe that this would also offer an opportunity to address the issue of dilapidation in cities, towns and villages and revitalise, re-energise and repopulate these areas.  The latter would, in turn, potentially lead to the provision of greater retail facilities.<\/p> <p>  Under this Bill, safety standards and the necessity for full compliance with building regulations would remain unchanged.  We earnestly ask the Department to draft and publish revised technical guidance documents to accompany each part of the building regulations for use by the one-stop shop in respect of these type of refurbishments.  The core change suggested in the Bill would involve all regulatory sections - those relating to building control, conservation, disability access, fire and planning - being brought together to agree on a solution in the case of a refurbishment or conversion of an older structure or commercial premises to residential use.  This is clearly a more joined-up approach to the issue of refurbishment and would make it more attractive for a building owner to seek certification for his or her building.  While building owners will still have the option of using the old system to certify their buildings, the new one-stop shop procedure would offer a more expedited and centralised approach.<\/p> <p>  There would be an optional pre-application consultation whereby advice would be offered as to whether an application meets requirements to be processed via the one-stop shop.  The actual application would be presented in person in front of a panel of experts.  The latter would then sign off on the full application in one or two days.<\/p><p>The one-stop shop will issue a works permit which will replace a fire safety certificate and a disability certificate, as well as verifying compliance with other parts of the building regulations.  Construction can then commence as soon as possible.<\/p><p> Approved inspectors would inspect the checklist on the site to ensure compliance.  Creating a panel of approved inspectors in every local authority is the most significant contribution to the Bill, as it would pave the way toward a more rigorous and flexible inspection regime across the country.  These inspectors would be paid standardised fees and be accountable to local authorities via a three-year framework agreement.  This would remove the financial link between certifiers and developers.  Being an approved inspector would also help inspectors get professional indemnity insurance and latent defects insurance, which is virtually unheard of in the market.  While this new approved inspector system would be initially for refurbishments, once in place it could be tasked with increasing inspections and enhancing retrospective compliance with building regulations in existing rental units.<\/p><p> As anyone who has followed the news in recent weeks can attest to, this is clearly needed.  There is just one inspector with responsibility for the entire Dublin city area for fire safety in rental accommodation.  The inspection rate is estimated to be less than 10%.  Similar issues with illegal subdivisions, over-occupancy and non-compliance with building control regulations will also be addressed by the enhanced inspection regime.<\/p><p> While this Bill is not a finished product, it represents a genuine attempt to overcome many of the existing administrative faults in our planning and building control processes identified as holding back urban regeneration.  We have worked on this Bill in conjunction with several practitioners and experts.  We have consulted widely with key stakeholders, including officials working in housing and planning in local authorities, Dublin City Council, multiple housing bodies working on the ground, such as the Peter McVerry Trust and Simon, builders and architects.  We are appreciative of their efforts and support.  We look forward to working with our parliamentary colleagues in this committee process to fine-tune the Bill.  It is hoped it will have the desired effect of addressing significant vacancy rates and provide for greater participation of building owners to ensure these premises can be placed on the market.  In turn, this will provide more units to deal with the current housing crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017112300002#C00500","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1511429400,"counter":1889,"content":"<p>Deputy Pat Casey took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1890,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cowen for this imaginative, practical and focused Bill.  Any measure which will rejuvenate and get buildings back into use is to be welcomed and is important.  However, it has to be an appropriate use and about proper planning and sustainable development.  It is not any use but appropriate use.<\/p> <p>  Being familiar with section 57, dealing with protected structures and declarations, and section 5, exempt or non-exempt developments, the Bill will amend section 57(3) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and speed up the process.  We know it is a cumbersome process.  I know from dealing with local authorities on getting clarification on exempt or non-exempt developments that it can take months.  Ultimately, I have initiated the process myself and then waited for the decision of the planning authority.  In some cases, if I were still not happy, I would go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is a terribly long process.<\/p> <p>  We need to look at the whole issue of conservation officers.  There are varying degrees of conservation officer across all of the 31 local authorities.  Some do not have them while others share them with neighbouring local authorities.  Some local authorities do little with protected structures and then there are others with engaging and imaginative conservation officers.  They are not architects or planners.  I do not know quite what they are and they do not know themselves.  There is a need for tighter guidance on what is their function.  I have spoken to planners and architects who have said that the conservation officers override their decisions.  There seems to be conflict between county architects, county planners and conservation officers.  The only way one can deal with that is by having robust guideline documents which set out the terms.<\/p> <p>  We have architecture of our time.  The Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland is keen to see architecture of our time which fits nicely with heritage buildings.  It is different outlooks and different ways of planning.  It needs to be streamlined, however, because people are telling me they are being frustrated by the process.  The Bill is addressing this, which is welcome.<\/p> <p>  It is important to get over the complexities and the slowness of dealing with section 57 and section 59, planning and protected structures, and getting them to use.  There was to be a national inventory of protected structures but some local authorities have not completed it.  We need to look at that again and the power of local councils in designating buildings as protected structures.  Several people in a local authority can decide to designate a whole lace of protected structures to frustrate development.  There is no artistic, historic, scientific context as to why they should be protected structures.  We need to tighten up how we define protected structures.  What is the function of the councillors versus the function of the executive?  There is always conflict between councillors wanting in some cases to designate buildings but they may not be motivated by what is of a historical or heritage value but more of a constituency value or to frustrate development.  We have to be careful in this regard.  We need stricter and tighter guidelines, along with a speedier and a more streamlined approach on these aspects of the Bill.  I welcome the Bill and support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017112300002#D00300","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1891,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boyhan for his contribution and welcome his support for the Bill in the round.<\/p> <p>  The whole area of protected structures is at the whim of the conservation architect in a local authority who, during the course of a preparation of a development plan, may make certain recommendations.  Councillors democratically decide on the merits of these without necessarily having the technical guidance to make that a meritorious system over which one could stand.  That is why we are seeking for the Department to draft and publish revised technical guidance documents to accompany each part of the building regulations for use by this one-stop shop.  This will ensure consistency across local authorities.  It would improve the current system, which is causing untold delays because of individuals seeking clarifications of interpretations, be they architects, fire officers or whatever.

Sinn F&eacute;in supports the legislation, as we outlined on Second Stage.  We have had several discussions at this committee about this issue, particularly when we were examining the vacant homes strategy.<\/p><p>As Deputy Cowen pointed out, a range of organisations including industry experts, homelessness organisations and others have strongly advocated such a vehicle and it is very welcome.  It is to be particularly welcomed if we are able to get the Bill through the Oireachtas in a timely fashion because it could be a very valuable tool not alone in terms of vacant housing stock, but for over-the-shop commercial units that are such a blight on our towns and urban centres and provide huge opportunities for residential stock and, in particular, affordable stock in rural town centres and large urban areas in cities such as Cork and Dublin.  On that basis, we are happy to support the Bill.  If the objective is to speed up the return of such units, we must scrutinise the issue of standards and safety to the best of our ability.  Deputy Cowen made it very clear on Second Stage and again today that there is no intention or desire in the legislation to in any way compromise on safety and standards but we would be doing a service to the legislation and the committee if we scrutinised that aspect to the best of our ability.<\/p><p> The Department will present at second phase and the first of the two main concerns it will outline is the shift away from compliance with the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations, BCAR, system as it currently stands.

It also raised a concern in regard to the subdivision of units being exempt from planning permission.  In advance of the Department coming before the committee, I ask Deputy Cowen to give us a detailed response on how he sees the text of the legislation and its enactment responding to those concerns and not in any way undermining building standards or safety, in particular fire safety, because that is the crucial issue for the committee today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017112300002#D00500","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1894,"content":"<p>Deputy Cowen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017112300002#E00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1895,"content":"<p>I ask the Vice Chairman to take another question while I prepare my response to Deputy &Oacute; Broin because I acknowledge the significance and importance of his questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017112300002#E00300","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1896,"content":"<p>There are some important positives in the proposal, such as the possibility of releasing the potential for new housing units above shops.  It would be very positive if that were to provide good quality accommodation for those who need it and would also be of benefit if it were to bring people into cities, towns and villages that have a vibrancy during the day but become like a ghost town in the evening when shop shutters go down.  To have people living in communities in those areas would benefit those towns and villages.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of this meeting is not so much to look at the broad positives but to try to tease out potential difficulties in the Bill and I will concentrate on that aspect.  We have concerns in regard to the fast-tracking of planning.  There is a danger that there could be a lowering of standards, which are important, and particularly so in respect of fire safety.  We do not want any more scenarios such as that in Priory Hall.<\/p> <p>  A particular issue on which we want more discussion is that of subdivisions being exempt from planning permission.  We do not want there to be very small units or to have the return of the bedsit by another route.  We want to hear more about that issue and have it debated.  We would be more in favour of using compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, than nudging owners into releasing the units.  <\/p> <p>  As regards inspections, Deputy Cowne referred to approved inspectors, which seems to point towards the possibility of outsourcing inspections such as, for example, that one would have inspectors on three-year contracts and outsource the work in that respect.  The inspectorate should be composed of local authority employees.  There are 60 inspectors for private sector accommodation nationwide, which is ridiculously low and has recently been debated in the D&aacute;il.  We proposed that the number of inspectors should quickly be brought up to 500 to 750.  There is no reason that a local authority inspectorate of that kind could not take this issue under its wing as part of its remit rather than outsourcing inspections, which we would oppose.<\/p> <p>  We are positively disposed toward the Bill and want it to progress but some issues need to be addressed, in particular regarding fast-tracking, fire safety, subdivision of units and the inspectorate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017112300002#E00400","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1897,"content":"<p>I will deal first with the last questions asked.  There may be some overlap.   I welcome the continued commitment of members to the thrust of the Bill, which, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin correctly stated, was also the tone on Second Stage, during which support for the Bill was obvious.  I acknowledge that and know that members are interested in exploring the Bill in order to improve it and make it workable, as are my party and I.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Barry discussed his fears in regard to fast-tracking.  The Bill does not necessarily provide for fast-tracking but, rather, a bringing together of local authority officials and those in responsibility in order to ensure there are synergies and that agreement is reached initially rather than through three or four processes taking differing lengths of time.  That would suit owners and could suit the Department.  It does not compromise standards because the system of inspection is for developments that are exempt from planning but inspection is ensured, which is not currently the case.  At present, such inspections are sporadic and self-certified.  The Bill takes that out of the equation and that can only improve standards.<\/p> <p>  We have proposed an initial outsourcing by local authorities to independent assessors.  One would hope that there is scope for local authority staff to become the independent assessors and I voiced my support for that during a debate following the \"Prime Time Investigates\" programme that explored this area.  If funding can be made available and local authorities are adequately resourced and financed to provide that expertise from within their own staff resources, I am all for that to be done because it copper-fastens the distance between the proposal and the works on the certification system.  The Department has also raised issues in that specific regard.<\/p> <p>  There is no suggestion in the Bill that there should be a change in building regulation requirements in respect of fire safety, structural safety or ventilation as claimed by the Department in its response to the proposal.  What is proposed is, as I said, a far more rigorous, integrated system with independent oversight either from independent assessors or local authority officials and which is safer than the self-certification and blanket exemptions that currently exist.  The Department has reservations regarding a proposal to exempt the complex works of developing existing buildings without appropriate alternative arrangements that maintain the integrity of the standards and process.<\/p><p>What is proposed is essentially a far more robust system of independent oversight by technical experts than self-certification by the builder which is in essence, by the builder, owner or landlord.  I contend, and I am sure the committee agrees, that what is contained here is a much higher standard of control than the Department's proposal that pursues much the same line of assessment that is currently there with self-certification.<\/p><p> The Department also states that the online application system for fire safety certificates and disability access certificates and dispensation and relaxation is also being developed.  That is welcome in its own right but I do not believe it is necessarily relevant to the issue.  It does not address the delays that are in the system now, be it online or paper-based, because it is going off on different strands.  Regulations were proposed some time ago.  They have not been published so it is not possible to compare them to this Bill.  From the information that is available, it would seem that a self-certification extension of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations, BCAR, system is envisaged.  That would not overcome the barriers we have identified.  The subdivision of a dwelling is a material change of use that could be addressed in the Bill, but in any case the Minister is not precluded from making new categories of exempted developments by regulation.  That is an issue within the one-stop-shop system for the planner to clarify.  If that is the situation, then one must accept it and go the route of a planning application for certain subdivisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017112300002#E00500","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1899,"content":"<p>I wish to follow up and expand on Deputy Barry's point on the technical instruments that we believe is required.  At no stage does this Bill indicate a shortening or weakening of the building standards that are there now.  We are, however, looking at vacant properties that exist throughout Ireland at present.  Some of them that are currently being used are probably not fit for purpose.  This Bill clearly states that when we are dealing with older buildings, we can apply the same technical documents that apply to new builds.  They currently do not exist.  We have given a number of examples of the areas in which these technical documents are required for older buildings so they ensure they comply with fire standards.  We believe there is a very significant piece of work for the Department to do in this regard to draft these technical documents to deal with the areas that have been listed in Schedule 1 to ensure they comply with safety standards.  Currently no technical documents exist for the renovations of existing old and listed buildings.  They just do not exist.  If we can get this aspect working properly and deliver this legislation, it might encourage those people out there who have already converted their buildings, which none of us knows about but we know there is a lot of them, to come in to this process to regularise it because the guidance documents will be there.  The current building regulations stand until the technical guidance documents are developed by the Department for the retrofitting of older buildings where new standards cannot apply because we are dealing with older structures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017112300002#F00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1900,"content":"<p>I welcome Deputy Cowen's submission to the committee.  There is much merit in what he proposes in the Bill.  I believe we are all agreed there is too much vacant stock, be it commercial or residential, in our towns, cities and villages.  Given the fact that the houses are already serviced, it makes sense to try to bring a renewed focus on how to bring them back into use.  A Bill such as this is very helpful not only to focus policymakers' minds, but to also put the issue on the table for the Department officials and the local authorities.<\/p> <p>  In the preparation of the Bill, did Deputy Cowen have any consultation with, for example, local authority management such as the County and City Management Association or councillor representative groups?  There could be learnings there that could strengthen the Bill.  Perhaps Deputy Cowen could clarify that point.<\/p> <p>  I take on board the Deputy's assurances on compliance, standards and building regulations.  That aspect could possibly be strengthened further by regulation if the Bill proceeds.  I have no doubt that the Deputy does not propose to reduce compliance standards, which I welcome.<\/p> <p>  On local authority inspections, I agree that we need to increase resources and increase the rate of local authority independent inspections of buildings to ensure that they are up to standard.  Ireland's record is quite poor in this regard so the results we have seen in developments such as Priory Hall and other instances where buildings have not been up to standard are not a surprise.  This Bill would certainly be a step in the right direction in that respect, starting with refurbishments.  I welcome any improvements in that area.  It will be interesting to hear the view of the Department officials on this later.  If Deputy Cowen would like to comment further about this, I would welcome it.<\/p> <p>  The idea behind the Bill is a one-stop-shop, which we can understand.   Would Deputy Cowen envisage it as just the co-ordination of existing departments within a local authority or would it be a case of professional people working as engineers, planners and fire safety officers within local authorities being seconded to the Department so that it is fully outfitted?  How will it work on the ground practically?  Obviously there will be resource issues.  Would it be a service dedicated to refurbishment?  I would like an understanding around it, for example, would there be flexibility within the local authority to manage it as it sees fit?  Does Deputy Cowen understand where I am coming from?  Will it be a dedicated service with full professional people or will it be somebody within a local authority who has the authority to call these people in from the various departments?  I am trying see how the process would function practically.<\/p> <p>  Will there be some type of reporting system to the councillors, as the elected members, on the applications that go through this proposed unit?

The members are correct that the creation of such a facility within a local authority or grouping can be a very proactive measure in this area, rather than reactive.  This is a very good suggestion.<\/p> <p>  In answer to Senator Coffey's first query, the answer is \"Yes\".  During the course of the deliberations, we consulted widely with stakeholders including council officials and especially within Dublin City Council.  They said that a similar type of mechanism was created with them in respect of the south Georgian core report.  The idea was to get all the regulatory sections such as building control, conservation, disability access and fire safety teams together to agree a solution, in this case, for Georgian protected structures.  That could be elaborated on for different types of structures depending on the age of the buildings and that expertise could then seek to assist in communicating and publicising that it could be possible to streamline the applications to put the units back in to use without compromising standards and safety.  Any such group should be accountable to the local authority members so they can ascertain and adjudge its productivity and success.  Primarily we discussed this with Dublin City Council officials and with various Fianna F&aacute;il members, especially following the UCD survey that identified up to 4,000 over-the-shop units in Dublin city, and following our own anecdotal evidence from around the State.  We have seen, and are perfectly knowledgeable of, the dilapidation of towns and villages that have lost their vitality due to unoccupancy with people no longer living and residing within town centres.  This Bill is a means to address this also.<\/p><p>Together with a re-purposed and altered repair and lease scheme and the publication of the deliberations of the commission on taxation, this would help landlords to remain in the sphere or encourage people to enter the market to address the crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017112300002#F00400","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1903,"content":"<p>This proposal is a very good one and the legislation is excellent.  Conservation is a good thing not a bad thing and we should and, in many cases, do encourage it.  The conservation and renewal of older buildings while addressing energy ratings and other issues make a great deal of sense.  While I am not talking about anybody in the room, some people say conservation is bad or does not make sense.  The quality of older materials is far superior to that of many modern ones used in the so-called buildings we had during the boom.  Those materials are much more substantial and will last a hell of a lot longer.  The buildings are old but they are still standing.  Some of them have been there for hundreds of years.  I am not familiar with the Georgian group in Dublin to which the Deputy referred, but I have personal knowledge of a listed building where we took the guys who had very kindly knocked it down to the High Court and made them rebuild it with handmade bricks.  We had a great deal of help from the Irish Georgian Society and conservation architects like Mr. John Redmill, who is extremely well known.  There are many people with a lot of knowledge who would like to conserve and restore older buildings in our town centres and rundown areas.  If we could ask them, they would set up a unit.  Having spoken to people, they are quite prepared to work on this and to assist and help in every possible way to get the old buildings restored to the greatest extent possible.  Having regard to the costs, taxation was mentioned.  We should incentivise the conservation and reconstruction of these buildings.<\/p> <p>  I have some notes on the census but I will leave my questions to the officials when they come in.  Clearly, the census indicates that there are areas in all our small or large towns and cities where there are higher rates of vacancy or, in many cases, dereliction.  Those areas are colour coded.  Where the higher vacancy rates occur is where this work needs to be done because people are not living there anymore.  We could look at the creation of zones within the larger urban areas to fast-track planning while definitively meeting all fire safety and appropriate construction regulations.  I would certainly favour making it a quicker process.<\/p> <p>  There is a great deal that is positive in what is proposed here.  As a society, we seem to rely too much on our Departments and local authorities to do everything.  They have failed the test so far in the housing crisis.  Different local authorities have different skill mixes.  I do not know if people here remember the national building agency, but it was a very efficient vehicle for the design, construction and delivery of houses and apartments in local authority areas.  If we went back to that model and, for example, Louth County Council wanted to build 50 houses, the agency could design and manage the process in a very professional and efficient way.  We would not need to start from scratch again because I presume the people involved are still employed by the public service.  We should bring them together again as a dynamic force to drive this forward.  They have all the resources, technical knowledge, expertise and skills local authorities would not otherwise have.  That is the gap I see; the absence of a streamlined, fast-track administrative procedure with the appropriate and proper professionals available nationally to drive it.  If this legislation succeeds, which I hope it does, it will be the Oireachtas working together collectively to ensure the needs of our citizens are met and that the rundown areas in our towns and cities are inhabited again.  I very much welcome the proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017112300002#G00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1904,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Dowd for his comments and queries.

In no way do we want to compromise conservation, no more than we want to compromise health and safety, fire certification or anything else in relation to building.  What we are looking for is greater clarification around technical guidance.  The example we gave on Dublin City Council and the Georgian core involves one set of guidance and criteria which applies in that sphere.  It is something that could be applied on a broader scale in relation to conservation methods because the last thing we want is to make it practically and financially impossible for these buildings to come back into use.  In the UK, for example, the facade is preserved and construction takes place behind it rather than having an effort to conserve every last detail.  I do not have the technical expertise to make that judgment and rely on the professionalism of those who are qualified.  That is why we are asking the Department to act as an agent to ensure the information is brought together and recommendations are forthcoming for legislators to adjudicate on and enact based on our constituents' representations and our knowledge of our own localities and communities.  As such, we would avoid provisions which were onerous or might act as a barrier to the development we want to see revitalising and regenerating our towns and villages where nobody lives and there is clearly less desire to move given the dilapidation we see.  There are other issues of property rights and legal difficulties which might arise relating to the release of these properties but that is for another Bill to investigate.  The Department is going through its vacant property strategy.  It was to be published in March but that is another conversation.  I hope those issues are addressed in that process, which would help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017112300002#G00500","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1907,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill which has great potential.  We were all trying to work with local authorities recently on the repair and leasing scheme, which has not taken off at all.  The uptake has been very poor.  The scheme only covers housing or apartments, but this Bill covers commercial and residential property.  I compliment Deputy Cowen on working with all of the agencies involved because that is crucial.  Currently, there are more than 240,000 vacant houses nationally, including flats.  The Bill concerns all the different bodies covering fire safety, disability access, building control and local authorities which means things can move quickly and be done to a proper standard.

I refer also to urban regeneration.  It is crucial that as Senators and Deputies, we bring back regeneration into our towns.  Doing so will help to create activity in our town centres.  As Deputy Cowen said, he has worked with the different agencies - the Peter McVerry Trust, the architects and all the local authorities, in particular Dublin City Council - and they have given him advice.

The point is well made.  As I said in response to Deputy Barry earlier, we have provided in the Bill, initially at least, for assigned certifiers or persons to be of relevant expertise but independent of the builder or landlord or both, and for an employee initially of the local authority to make an independent authoritative assessment of compliance with the regulations and technical guidelines we hope would ensue on foot of it.  I am open to that assigned person or certifier being within the local authority and having similar relevant qualifications and capabilities to those from the private sector.  This also could act as a revenue source of income for local authorities to be used and ring-fenced within the housing income for further dispersal and usage by local authorities thereafter.  I will provide Senator Murnane O'Connor with specific details regarding the section as it is composed and proposed within this Bill.  Section 11 of the Building Control Act gives the meaning to an \"authorised person\".  As I said, I am here with my colleagues, who have a shared will to address many aspects of housing policy of which this is only one.  We want to pool together those resources and those minds to improve the Bill and make it more appropriate to the needs of the market and local authorities but ultimately to target those people who do not have homes at present in a way that allows these properties to come into use much more quickly and much more cost-efficiently while improving the quality of certification regarding their suitability and compatibility with guidelines and regulations surrounding health and safety, fire certification, disability, conservation and the planning realm, as adjudicated by the planning member of the panel that initially meets the proposers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017112300002#H00200","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1910,"content":"<p>I fully support Deputy Cowen's Bill.

Regarding the conservation aspect, I lived in the Netherlands for nine years, and one sees in streetscapes in Amsterdam or any of the other large cities that they maintain their buildings very well.  There is a formula there that Ireland could use.  We have absolutely magnificent old buildings, as Deputy O'Dowd said, that were well built at the time, whose materials are still good and that should be utilised.  The compliance with regulations and standards should be recognised, but we need to push this on as a committee because we are still in a supply crisis.  We have a lot of supply, and every time I come through the city into Leinster House or wherever else, I look at the underutilised housing supply all over the place above shop buildings and so on.

I have requested this number but I do not think it is included in the figures I have already been given, so we do not have a clear picture.  Taking as an example Ballymun, which is the area with which I am most familiar, we have at least 20 to 30 units from the regeneration alone which have been lying idle and blocked up for ten to 15 years.

It is the same in Bodenstown.  Every time I go there I see these units boarded up, and we have no figures on the number of such units.  There is a huge amount of work to be done, whether planning or design, on how they might be brought back into use.  As we would have problems over development plans and master plans where these units were all put in, supposedly to supplement the incoming residential population, we really need to consider this hugely significant area.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the architects and the panel of experts, most of the local authorities have the experts.

There is a significant responsibility on the Oireachtas to help and assist people who are in dire housing circumstances.  When there is all-party support and universal weight behind a proposal such as this, it is incumbent on us to ensure this happens as soon as practicable.  We must extract such a commitment from the Department when it comes before us.  The Government had committed to bringing forward a strategy in March 2017, and I assume it is in the offing, both the Minister and the Government have acknowledged they will work with this Bill as part of their response to addressing the issue.

I am not precious about anything in the Bill and I am open to suggestions on improvements.  We can discuss use of space over the shop as well as under the shop.  We can at least make recommendations as a committee for further legislation to address the vacant commercial units that exist in towns, villages and in the city centres where the envisaged use has not materialised and there is a pressing need for residential use.

The departmental colleagues who are accompanying me are Ms Sarah Neary, who is the Department's principal adviser on building standards, Mr. Niall Cussen, who is the Department's chief planner, and Mr. Brendan Buggy, who works in the Department's new empty homes unit.<\/p> <p>  As part of the overarching Rebuilding Ireland policy document, we are committed to bringing vacant properties back into use.  There is scope to maximise the use of many underused or vacant properties in this country.  It should be noted that many such units remain underutilised for a number of complex reasons.  It can be labour-intensive and financially unreasonable to identify and reactivate them.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, with the assistance and advice of the Housing Agency, has undertaken substantial analysis and consideration of the issues around vacant housing.  Earlier this summer, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, announced that various actions are being taken at central and local government levels to prioritise the identification and reuse of vacant homes and buildings, particularly in vacancy hotspot areas where there is significant pent-up demand for houses.  It is in this context that the Department has examined the Vacant Housing (Refurbishment) Bill 2017.  I would like to take this opportunity to outline briefly the Department's broad views on the overarching provisions of the Bill in advance of more detailed discussions.<\/p> <p>  Section 2, which relates to building standards, proposes amendments to the Building Control Act 1990 to provide for a one-stop shop local authority process, exemptions from fire safety certificates, disability access certificates and certificates of compliance on completion, exemptions from being recorded on the building register, an alternative building control system, and amendments to regulations regarding structure, fire, sound, ventilation, stairs, energy efficiency and accessibility.  While we support the broad intention of the Bill, concerns are raised by the proposal to alter the performance requirements of building regulations in respect of fire safety, structural safety and ventilation, etc.  These fundamental regulations protect the health and safety of people in and around buildings.  Unfortunately, many incidences of building failures and severe non-compliance with building regulations have come to light over the past decade.  As part of the response to this, new building control requirements have been introduced to bring a new order and discipline to bear on construction projects.  For that reason, we have reservations about the proposal to exempt the complex work of developing existing buildings for residential use from these requirements without appropriate alternative arrangements that maintain the integrity of the standards and process.<\/p> <p>  A working group established by the Department has been tasked with developing new guidance to provide clarity on the regulatory requirements that apply when existing buildings are being developed for residential use and advising on how best to facilitate the reuse or development of underused older buildings in the context of such regulatory requirements.  This group, which includes people with expertise in building regulations, fire safety in buildings, planning, design and heritage from inside and outside the Department, has met twice and a further meeting is scheduled for next Monday.  The group has been gathering evidence on the real regulatory difficulties faced by people when they are bringing vacant buildings back into use for residential purposes.  The working group has identified a number of common existing building typologies, worked on the application of the regulations to existing works and commenced developing guidance for these circumstances.  An online application system for fire safety certificates, disability access certificates and dispensation and relaxation is being developed to help further streamline and speed up the certification process.<\/p> <p>  Sections 3 and 4 propose amendments to the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Section 3 relates to exempted development provisions and proposes three new classes of exemptions in the context of residential development, including works requiring the change of use from commercial or industrial use to residential use.  Section 4 provides for the new one-stop shop application procedure mentioned earlier in the Bill to be used to expedite requests for section 5 declarations and states that this will be determined by a panel of \"authorised persons\".  As the Government has already committed under Rebuilding Ireland to reviewing planning legislation to allow the change of use of vacant commercial units as residential units without the need for planning, we can indicate broad support for the thrust of the planning related proposals.  In this regard, the Department is at an advanced stage of redrafting proposed amendments in this regard by means of secondary regulations rather than by means of primary legislation as proposed in the Bill.<\/p><p>It is intended that the draft regulations will shortly be presented to the committee and to both Houses of the Oireachtas for approval before these proposed regulatory amendments can come into effect.  We are holding a further meeting on Monday on these proposed exempted development regulations. <br\/><br\/><i><\/i>A key point distinguishing the draft regulations from the features of the Bill is that it is not proposed to require a mandatory section 5 declaration prior to availing of the exemptions.<i><\/i>The draft regulations are more streamlined in approach.

I have heard and read the comments, but I am interested to know in more practical day-to-day detail how Mr. Sheridan believes the provisions of the Bill would negatively impact on safety if they were implemented.  Mr. Sheridan listed a series of concerns, including structure, fire ventilation, stairs, energy efficiency and accessibility.  In layperson's terms, I would like him to talk us through the reasons he thinks the provisions of the Bill would cause problems in those particular areas.<\/p> <p>  I would also like to address exempting the subdivision of units from planning permission.  My understanding, from the Bill and from listening to Deputy Cowen earlier, is that there is no reduction in standards.  They remain the same.  However if one has, for example, above-the-shop commercial units and one is looking to subdivide what was a large commercial unit into appropriate residential apartments, this may be a sensible way to speed that up.  If there is an appropriate inspection regime, we can make sure that the standards are fully complied with.  <\/p> <p>  Separately from the legislative language, I am interested to hear more on that.  The general view of the committee is that we support this Bill and its intentions.  There is nobody, from the proposers through to those of us who support it, who wants to see compromised in any way minimum standards, builder compliance or fire safety.

We are informed by pillar 5 in the Rebuilding Ireland plan, which includes a commitment to review the planning legislation to allow the change of use of commercial into residential without the need for planning permission and we are working on that.  Since earlier this year, we have broadened that commitment to review the building control requirements with a view to streamlining the planning aspects as much as we can and exempting specific conversions from the current requirement to obtain planning permission.  We are also working to streamline, and perhaps better co-ordinate, the management process around building control by local authorities.

It involves confined spaces and confined access and it is uncertain what will be discovered in the foundations, structure or whatever.  Existing buildings represent probably the most complex infill.  The Bill suggests a number of amendments to parts of the building regulations.  That is where I have concerns about changing the legislative requirements, which are broad performance requirements.  Regarding structure, they require that a building would be safe and can withstand the loadings.  Part B of the regulations requires a building to have adequate fire detection and alarm systems, means of escape, resistance to the spread of fire and so on.  The suggestion in Schedule 1 of the Bill before the committee is that these would change, and that would fundamentally change the level of safety.  I will come back to the question of how we are addressing that in a minute.  I understand the idea behind this but I am concerned about the approach to changing the legal performance requirements of buildings.<\/p> <p>  The second issue is the Bill's provision that such developments would not require a fire safety certificate.  That requirement is a very powerful tool in enforcing upfront consideration of fire at an early stage.  The detail must be designed in to get work approved.  It is probably the strongest of the building control measures and it would be a highly retrograde step to go without it for the most complex development works about which we are talking.  The third issue is the fundamental change from the system of assigned certifiers under the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014.  This would be an alternative means.  It is difficult to see exactly how it would work out and what fundamentally is different between the two systems.  I would rather see the existing system being built upon and the available expertise being used.  It takes time for industry to respond and when one form of development is different from another, complexities are created and things get lost in that.<\/p> <p>  I must come back to the main point around the difference in standards.  What we are trying to do in the group that Mr. Sheridan talked about is provide greater guidance on existing buildings.  Our building regulations are very much geared towards new build, and so is our guidance.  In recent amendments to building regulations the guidance has dealt a little bit more with existing buildings, particularly in Part M, which concerns accessibility, and increasingly in Part L.  We are moving into that area, but I admit there is not as much guidance for this kind of development and re-use of existing buildings as there is for new buildings.  That is what this group is all about.  If there are real problems with compliance, we are trying to identify what they are.  Even in our two meetings so far, we have brought forward a number of documents on the application of building regulations to existing buildings, examining particular parts of the regulations and how they apply.  To be honest, I do not think that is fully understood.  We have circulated some documents on that.  They are being reviewed at the moment, and even that will be a step forward in clarifying which building regulations actually apply.  The next step is to drill down into the detail to ascertain where the problems are and to provide specific guidance on that. <\/p> <p>  The emerging approach is that we look at four or five typical types of urban building, see what regulations apply and determine the guidance we provide across the building regulations for that type.<\/p><p>That is what we hope to do within this, and it addresses the issues raised in the Bill but without changing that fundamental requirement for fire safety, structural safety, etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017112300002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Neary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1933,"content":"<p>I have a brief follow-up question.  If the planning work is done and the regulations and guidelines for refurbishments changed, one of the attractive things about Deputy Cowen's Bill from our point of view is the idea of the one-stop shop, whereby a person does not have to go to a number of different places to try to get a number of different things to get his or her project across the line, particularly given that we are trying to get these units into active use more quickly.  Are the two sets of alternative proposals Ms Neary and Mr. Sheridan have outlined compatible with the one-stop shop mechanism, whereby the owner of the property can still go to a single place and go through that entire process relatively quickly and in a way that does not undermine standards?

Therefore, I do not think it is impossible to do the one-stop shop, but the landscape might be very different.  The two pillar areas are planning and building control.  If there is an exemption under planning, we are probably back to a one-stop shop in terms of building control, fire safety and the 12 parts of the building regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017112300002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Neary"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1936,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for attending.  We had a very interesting engagement with Deputy Cowen on the Bill earlier.  I think we all agreed that compliance and standards should not be compromised and we all felt there is much merit in the Bill.  It is very obvious, given the number of vacant properties in our cities, towns and villages, that something is not working.  Practically, I understand and respect the responsibilities of various Department officials and the various sections within those Departments on the ground, and the same goes for local authorities.  However, having spoken to people who wish to redevelop town centre or city centre properties, I feel that the frustration on the ground is that the bureaucracy and the administration that goes with it just creates barriers and people just do not bother.<\/p> <p>  We must look at ourselves and ask ourselves, including policymakers, officials in the Department with responsibility, and local authorities, why it is not working and what we can do to make it work.  I think we are all agreed that we cannot compromise on safety or standards, but there is a sense that there is no ownership within either local authorities or even the Department.  Mr. Sheridan has responsibility for building standards, for example, and he will protect and argue and advocate for that, and others have responsibility for planning, but there is no oversight or cross-cut, as it were, that actually makes things happen.<\/p> <p>  The thrust of the Bill is to try to introduce a one-stop shop, a co-ordination unit or whatever one wants to call it.  As Mr. Sheridan mentioned, it is already established in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in respect of vacant houses.  We do not have that in the local authorities, for example, because they are operating like silos, similar to what happens within the Department.  There is one section doing one thing, another doing its own thing, and they all do a good job, but there is no cross-cut.  The practical reality of this on the ground is that we are not making progress.  Deputy Cowen can correct me if I am wrong, but that is our frustration, and the idea behind the Bill is to try to bring that type of cross-cut into local authorities and the Department in order that we actually deliver on turning these vacant houses around and bringing them back into use.  That is my frustration.<\/p> <p>  There are also some very good proposals in the Bill concerning inspections of property which will enforce the argument Ms Neary has just made about standards.  I am concerned that self-certification is not the ideal answer, and this is reflected in the problems we have seen in building stock, as in cases such as Priory Hall.  I think Deputy Cowen's Bill proposes that there be a strong local authority inspection for all refurbishments and that nothing be signed off on unless it is up to standard and in compliance with planning regulations and so on.  I am interested to hear whether there is any new thinking within the Department in this regard.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses touched on other mechanisms that might be brought forward, but we really need to grasp this nettle and do something that can progress the bringing of vacant stock into use because there is just too much of it and we can all see it around us.  Given the crisis we have, we need to think outside the box, and Deputy Cowen's Bill could be the vehicle to do so.  Let us amend or shape it if we need to do so and bring the technical guidance or expertise along with it to make things happen because the present situation is very frustrating.  Vacant housing is not being brought back into use because there are too many silos in local authorities and within the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017112300002#M00400","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1937,"content":"<p>Do Mr. Sheridan or Ms Neary wish to come in on that point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017112300002#M00500","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511429400,"counter":1938,"content":"<p>Our objective is the same as Deputy Cowen's.

People do not understand this.  I told the Chairman this morning that, according to a survey, 70% of Irish people have no faith in the Government's housing policies.

A person trying to convert a building first applies for a planning exemption certificate, then a fire certificate and then a disability access certificate, all of which takes a significant amount of time and involves much back and forth with the authorities.  That is also the case for conservation.  The process proposed in the Bill would get all of those professionals together such that a person could deal with his or her application and the issues.  It is not the intention behind the Bill to put standards at risk and it contains no indication that that will be done.  We have suggested that instead of certificates for a planning exemption, fire safety and disability access, an applicant would be issued with a work permit that would deal with all of those issues.  I hope the Department does not think that we are trying to weaken standards through our proposal because that is not our intention.<\/p><p>We all must admit that there are no technical documents currently available for a person who is refurbishing an existing building.  All the technical documents available refer to new builds, not refurbishments.  The Bill states in subsection (6)(c)(ii), as proposed to be inserted by section 2, in regard to the six criteria we mention, that: &quot;the Department shall draft and publish revised technical guidance documents to accompany each part of the Building Regulations indicating how the amended requirements detailed in the <i>Schedule 1<\/i>of the <i>Act of 2017<\/i>can be achieved in practice&quot;.  We are asking the Department to provide those technical documents.  All present know that each local authority is currently doing so independently.  There is no standard nationwide process for the refurbishment of buildings.  Proper technical documents need to be drafted.  Has the Department got the resources to provide such technical documents?  They are significant and detailed and will be required if this Bill or the Government Bill on the issue is passed by the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>There will also be a difference of opinion in regard to the inspection and Building Control (Amendment) Regulations, BCAR, processes.

I would love it if our local authorities had the resources and expertise to do that but we all know they probably do not.

Now we are in such a crisis that we need to move much more quickly.<\/p> <p>  We talk about the 4,000 units over shops and the 200,000 or more places vacant across the country, but I have tried repeatedly to get figures on how many shops are boarded up.  Since the Celtic tiger period in 2008 there are at least 30 with fronts boarded up in Ballymun.  I see them in Bodenstown but there is no figure for them.  We should be able to get that and to find out why they are not being dealt with.  It would be complicated to convert them, whether into units for living or otherwise.  That would require a great deal of work, with architects etc.  In small towns and in Dublin there are warehouses that are not accounted for.  There are places left vacant all over the city.  We need to find out if they can be utilised, whether to help those who are homeless or to get them up and running as living places.  Years ago the mill in Phibsborough was converted.  I think there is a plan to convert the old mill on Pearse Street into something similar.  We need to be more imaginative about how we do it.  It is very frustrating.<\/p> <p>  The working group should have been set up years ago and now it has met only twice which is not very often when there is such a hell of a crisis.  We should be literally working around the clock to resolve this.  I know many of those on the working group have other things to do but there should be an urgency to identify how work can be speeded up.  We should pull out all stops to do that.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the Bill, local authorities are best placed to provide inspectors because they have experts, architects and planners.  The biggest problem in the Bill is planning because many places got permission and they have been put into development plans, area plans and master plans, and the repercussions of all those would have to be considered too.  I am not clear on that area and we need to consider it.  Anything that can speed up this process and pull all the little threads together is very important.  That is what makes the Bill attractive to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017112300002#O00200","speaker":"1303"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1954,"content":"<p>This committee has always worked very well with the Department and this time last year we passed the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2017 which allows us fast-track any application for a development of more than 100 units.

I note her comment that everything seems to be being developed, but as the Chairman has outlined, we have done an awful lot in a short space of time.  The Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016 is before the House but it has been stalled for six months.  I had hoped that it would go through the D&aacute;il before Christmas but that does not look like happening now because priority is being given to the Finance Bill 2017.<\/p> <p>  In view of that potential gap in our workload, I am optimistic that we can bring forward the exempted development regulations as a priority between now and Christmas and bring them before the committee in the normal way.  The Minister cannot sign these under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2017 without Oireachtas approval, so we have to come through the committee and a subsequent resolution of both Houses.  We will do our best to get that part of the work done between now and Christmas.<\/p> <p>  Huge priority is being attached to vacant homes as well.<\/p><p>We see them as being a very important means of increasing supply.  They are also a lower cost than a new build as well as a more efficient use of resources.  As the Chairman has outlined, we have done a great deal with the strategic housing development provisions of the Planning and Development (Housing) Residential Tenancies Act 2016.<\/p><p> We are also bringing forward the land hoarding provision in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016 that is before the D&aacute;il and which we are anxious to progress.  We are increasing the vacant site levy, which will be introduced when that Bill goes to the Seanad.  A great deal is going on in the background.  <\/p><p> We are working between the two divisions, building control and planning on clarification guidance on building control.  We are looking at the possibility of amalgamating some of the certificates.  Everything is being explored.  Originally we had a timeframe of six months from the establishment of the working group.  In view of the urgency involved, we are trying to bring that forward as best as we can.  I hope the parts dealing with planning will be out of the way between now and Christmas and we can try to progress the building control guidance documents as quickly as possible in the new year.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy Ellis who referred to vacancy figures, the CSO figures are a snapshot in time, May 2016.  In view of the demand for housing, many of those properties have been brought back into use since then.  I am not sure the figures are as high as they were at that time.  The Minister has tackled and progressed the issue of vacant properties.  He has already asked the local authorities to develop vacant homes action plans and to allocate and designate staff as empty homes officers to identify vacancy hotspots.  We have received quite a number of action plans from local authorities, although the deadline for the submission of the plans is the end of the year.  The local authorities are addressing this as well.<\/p><p> We are treating our work as urgent, but everything does take time.  We have to tease out issues and we want to ensure that there are no unintended consequences from bringing forward proposals.  My colleague, Ms Neary, will add to my comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017112300002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terry Sheridan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1957,"content":"<p>Before Ms Neary addresses the committee, I ask Deputy Cowen to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017112300002#P00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1511429400,"counter":1958,"content":"<p>I thank the officials for attending and for their response.  It is obviously vital that we hear from the departmental officials.  There is universal support and approval among all parties and none for addressing this issue.  There are things that we can do to address the short-term issues.  We know there are major ongoing efforts on the medium to long-term issues which we could spend several hours discussing, but our proposals in that regard do not necessarily mirror the current policies.<\/p> <p>  This issue predates Rebuilding Ireland.  I grew up in a town centre, but I know the occupancy rate in that town centre is very poor now.  That is replicated throughout the country.  The retail business is different now from the past.  The repopulation of town centres can revitalise and bring vibrancy to those towns, villages and cities.  It is great to see the commitment by the Department and the Government to streamline processes, and to put action plans and a working group in place to address the issues identified in Rebuilding Ireland.  We, too, have consulted with all the stakeholders and have a commitment in the first instance to our constituents, who are the most important stakeholder.<\/p> <p>  Earlier this week, we discussed rural and urban crime.  The level of frustration and anger is palpable.  Fear has taken hold.  When we talk to constituents, especially those living in substandard accommodation who are on housing waiting lists, we feel their fear because of the option of being forced out of existing accommodation for whatever reason, as provided for in recent legislation.  This has people in a state of fear and flux, because local authorities do not have alternative accommodation available for them.  It is as simple as that.  These people see the dilapidated void units in the town and ask their public representatives why they are not informing them of the ways and means of releasing these properties for residential use in the short term to address the current difficulties.<\/p> <p>  We have also consulted officials, architects and professionals in local authorities and builders.  I am ridiculed by some for seeking to help and assist builders by whatever means.  One will not build, repair or reinstate buildings without builders.  Helping builders is a nice stick to beat the likes of me and my party, but I am referring to carpenters, block layers, electricians, plasterers, labourers and the number of trades and jobs that were in the industry in the past.  Do people think that the people with these skills will fall out of the sky?  Do people think they are not entitled to their jobs or that they cannot contribute to the country?  Of course they can and the way we can help is by ensuring that we do something constructive and positive for people who are living in substandard accommodation.  It is obvious to me and my colleagues that the current system of obtaining exemptions and compliance certificates from the various sections of the local authorities is a barrier, because one has to go from one division to another and the process is costly in both money and time.

Ms Mangan said that the report provides backing in a financial sense.  I have many detailed questions on the financial side of it but I will leave those until later.  I have some general questions to begin with.  I understand Ms Mangan stated as her reason for not attending the previous meeting of this committee that she had come in, laid out the entire position and told us exactly what was happening.  My understanding is that what is happening currently is that there is a huge reorganisation of the two services under way.  I would imagine that we, as the relevant D&aacute;il committee, should be kept informed about the progress of that reorganisation.  I believe we are entitled to discuss it with Ms Mangan and for her to discuss it with us as to how that is going etc.  I do not believe that is in any way unreasonable.<\/p> <p>  We are told that the consultants' report was endorsed by Ms Mangan's board.  I am speaking for myself, and the other members can speak for themselves, but my interpretation is that when the committee requested this consultants' report, it did not imagine they were looking for the Ten Commandments or something like that, that it could be just handed down and that nobody would be in a position to discuss any aspect of it, interrogate it or question it in any way.  My information is that at a meeting on 20 September, the report was presented to the board by the executive, that the board requested that it be discussed and interrogated - they had various questions on it - and that that was not allowed.  Contrary to what we have been told, the ordinary members of the board did not endorse this report and they recommended that that fact should be stated when the report was published, which it was not.<\/p> <p>  I ask Ms Mangan to comment on the statement on page 6 of the report which, to paraphrase slightly without losing anything of the sense of it, states that the CIB has been requested by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to take action.  That seems to fly in the face of the excuse we got from the Minister to the effect that she has no legal right to interfere with any deliberations of the board in this regard and that it is only a day-to-day matter, with which I disagree.  She says she is legally precluded from intervening in any way, but according to the report itself, she is not in any way legally precluded from requesting a massive, fundamental reorganisation.  If we take what we are told, and if we take the Attorney General's advice, we are now in the position where, under the law, the Minster can request a huge and fundamental reorganisation, but if she changes her mind, she does not have power to revoke that.  It is either a very peculiar law or a very peculiar interpretation of the law.<\/p> <p>  There are various references in the report to governance and oversight issues.  They are not spelled out.  I would have expected a report of this nature to spell out the alleged governance and oversight issues and how precisely they will be dealt with.  I have read the report very carefully.  I cannot find that.  There is a good deal of confusion in the report, as I understand it.  For example, there is reference to a principal agent problem and misaligned incentives between the board and the people on the ground.<\/p><p>The assumption is of course made straight away that the misalignment comes from the people on the ground.  Broad, general statements are made such as those claiming that these local companies value their independence.  It is not a question of local companies valuing their independence.  The people for whom the taxpayers are providing this service value the fact that the present institutions are independent and this is where any misalignment comes from.  The other thing I notice in this report is that the analysis is discussed as being opposed to a no-change option, a classic example of setting up a straw man just so as to knock him down again.  There was no suggestion from any quarter, including from the organisations themselves, that a no-change option was the only alternative to reorganisation.  The organisations themselves recommended very specific changes.  What we are comparing here, then, are things there is no point comparing because nobody is in favour of a no-change option.  <\/p><p> I have had communication from the trade unions representing some of the staff in these organisations.  They have informed me that they have recently been contacted by KPMG in respect of the current reorganisation and requesting some detailed information which, according to the unions' legal advice, is contrary to data protection.  The unions are very clear on this.  If the legal advice is that this information is contrary to data protection, what steps does the board then propose to take in this regard?  Will it withdraw this request?  It has also been brought to my attention that views articulated at a recent board meeting seemed to indicate that development managers would not be expected by the board to carry out information provision.  Part of the cost-saving mentioned in the report, in fact, is that information managers would do just that and yet the board is apparently not of this view. <\/p><p> I would like to have these preliminary matters clarified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017112300002#B00500","speaker":"1227","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511433900,"counter":1981,"content":"<p>First, Deputy O'Dea should not have any information about what took place at a board meeting on 20 September.

We have the statutory responsibility to implement the decision.  The executive is bound by the decision of the board and it is currently implementing that decision.  While I absolutely accept that this Oireachtas joint committee has an oversight role, I simply do not accept that it has a role in every detailed aspect of the implementation of that decision.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to the other issues.  Deputy O'Dea drew attention to the fact that the cost-benefit analysis report points out that there was a request from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Both this committee and the Minister can request that we do something but neither has the power to ensure that we do so.  I happen to be a lawyer myself and my understanding is that the Minister does not have the power to intervene directly in the affairs of the Citizens Information Board, CIS, other than on very specific issues.  It is the Oireachtas, however, that is the lawmaker.  If Members of the Oireachtas decide, as lawmakers, to change the law then we as citizens and as members of boards will of course implement that law.  It is the Members of the Oireachtas who make the law so if they wish to change the law on this matter, then by all means they can change it.  It is not up to us to do so; it is up to them.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is critical of a number of the terms in the report.  I sympathise with this as I do not like some of the terms myself, but they are standard economic terms.  This report was carried out by a professional economic organisation and uses standard economic terms that come from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines on how services are to be assessed. They simply are what they are: standard economic terms.  I accept that they are not part of common language but when a professional economic body is asked to carry out this kind of exercise then it has to use the terms that are accepted in the economic sphere, be it lawyer-speak, doctor-speak or whatever else you might like to call it.  What it is is economic-speak.  <\/p> <p>  In response to the other issues raised, I want to say quite clearly that the people who are using the services of CIS and MABS will be in no way affected by this change, a point I made repeatedly the last time I was here.  The only change taking place here is in governance and not in the delivery of services.  I hope, in fact, that there will be a change in the delivery of services in the future, only because I hope to be able to improve that delivery.  With regard to the no-change option mentioned by the Deputy, there was no agreement among the parties concerned as to what any other option might be.  One can carry out economic analysis from here to eternity and we did in fact consider various options other than the one that we decided upon.  I have never suggested that what we decided upon was the Holy Grail, but we have decided upon it and we are now going for it.  We have carried out the economic analysis on that.  <\/p> <p>  I agree that opposition to the reorganisation is coming from some of the boards rather than the staff of the organisation.  These boards have not been in agreement on an alternative to what is currently in place.  I am certainly not going to start getting involved in trade union negotiations but I make the point that what KPMG is doing at present is going through the legal processes around what is known as the transfer of undertakings - protection of employment, TUPE, legislation and that this requires that it gathers all of the information on individual employees.  I also point out that as all of the personal information involved here is redacted, there is no question of a breach of data protection.  It would be impossible to carry out a transfer of any undertaking, be it in the area of commerce or of government, without going through the proper channels for TUPE.  TUPE is the legal mechanism by which undertakings are transferred and it is a process that has to be gone through to change the structures.  Many big companies in Ireland have gone through this process without data protection ever having been raised as an issue.  It is not an issue in this instance.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017112300002#C01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Ita Mangan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511433900,"counter":1992,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Mangan.

She writes in the last line of that letter that she cannot see what benefit could be derived from the attendance either of herself or of the chief executive, Ms Black.<\/p><p>This attitude stinks.  There was an exhaustive process carried out by this committee, with a thorough examination of the proposed changes.  We published a comprehensive report, which seems to have fallen on deaf ears.  I wish to put on the record that I think it is very concerning.  The fact that the Citizens Information Board, CIB, could not or would not even submit an opening statement in advance of this meeting this morning is regrettable.  In the contributions to us at this hearing, witnesses said that the opposition to these changes seemed to be coming from board members, not staff on the ground.  That is totally contrary to the evidence that this committee has heard.  It is also contrary to what I have found, particularly during my engagement with the Money and Budgeting Service, MABS, offices and staff across the State, who are not just concerned, they are fearful.  We have heard evidence that volunteers have walked away from offices that had provided excellent services to the community.  Ms Mangan must rectify this.<\/p><p> I wish to raise the issue of the last board meeting.  It was said that the minutes of that meeting have only been signed off on in the last couple of days.  Was the cost-benefit analysis signed of on by the board at its last meeting?  Was there any opposition from board members to the cost-benefit analysis?  Surely we do not need to wait for that information to be put on a website.  Surely our witnesses can provide information now on whether the minutes have been signed off.<\/p><p> I have a couple of specific questions on the cost-benefit analysis and I hope the witnesses can provide some answers.  The rationale for the proposed re-organisation states that the CIB had been requested by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to come into line with best practice.  What concerns did the Department raise with the CIB, and when were those concerns raised?  The rationale also states that the current structures are resulting in a poor use of resources at local level.  Where exactly is the evidence of that?  If the witnesses have that evidence, can they please let us know?  <\/p><p> There were also set-up costs of &euro;1.9 million.  That is an estimate.  How can those set-up costs be justified, and how do they compare with initial estimates given to this committee in our hearings?  In addition to the initial costs, I ask the witnesses for a breakdown of the additional annual running costs under the restructuring.<\/p><p> I have some more questions that I think are important, if the Chair will bear with me for a couple of minutes.  The cost-benefit analysis projects costs over an eight-year period.  It is very difficult to understand these projections, let alone make any sense of them.  Is it now accepted that the restructuring will not be cost-neutral?  Having regard to the substantial additional cost to the Exchequer, what additional benefits will accrue to the end user?  Why did the consultants not consult with anybody other than the CIB?  Consultations with existing service providers would have been very beneficial.  Can the witnesses elaborate on how a figure of &euro;14.97 million can be achieved and 50% of managers' time can be freed up through restructuring?  What work are they doing now that they will not have to do?  Will there be no requirement to manage the local offices?<\/p><p> The cost-benefit analysis suggests that the only additional cost will be the employment of 16 new regional managers, at yearly salaries of roughly &euro;65,000 each, plus pay-related social insurance, PRSI, contributions and pensions, etc.  Can the witnesses confirm that no additional staff will be required? Will these regional managers incur any additional costs other than their salaries?  The cost-benefit analysis suggests that there will be no additional cost.<\/p><p> I will leave it at that for the moment.  There are other questions that I will hopefully have an opportunity to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017112300002#C01400","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511433900,"counter":1995,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.

If voluntary input within the organisation is lost, how will the organisation replace those people?

We outlined all the background papers in detail and gave copies to the committee.  This included all of the background details of how the decision was reached.  We covered all the issues about regional managers.  We covered more or less every question that has been asked by Deputy Brady here this morning.  As I already said, I am not going to talk about the board meeting, because it is contrary to the code of conduct on state boards to talk about board meetings outside of the board meeting, and I do not intend to break that code.  I have already explained that to Deputy O'Dea.<\/p> <p>  Addressing deputy Carey's issue on volunteers, I have no evidence that volunteers are walking away.  There are two sets of volunteers involved in delivering our services.  One of these groups consists of the volunteers who are members of boards.  In the case of MABS, the service is entirely professional.  The boards are voluntary, but the actual deliverers of the service are all employees.  Some of those boards, I think about 4 out of 51, actually do the management themselves, in the sense of paying the staff and so on.  In all the other cases, it is the staff who do the administration.  One of the things that will improve when we undertake this re-organisation is that there will be centralised administration, so that the staff will be able to advise people on their money problems, rather than spending their time on administration.  <\/p> <p>  The other group of volunteers that people are concerned about are those who volunteer to provide information in Citizens Information Board services.  There are no similar people in the MABS services.  In fact, tomorrow Ms Black and I, with the Minister present, will be presenting awards to volunteers of long standing, because we value their input.  We have seen no evidence that any of the volunteers in that category are in any way concerned about the re-organisation because in general, they liaise with the staff of the Citizens Information Services and provide the services when required.  The change in governance will not make any difference to them.  They will simply be responding to a different voluntary board, because the new boards will all be voluntary as well.  All we are doing, in effect, is reducing the number of boards from more than 90 to 16.  The participants in those boards will all be volunteers.  There will not be an affect on services, or and issue around volunteers at the Citizens Information Board losing out.   As I have said, the volunteer staffing of MABS is entirely on the board side. <\/p> <p>  Deputy Carey was critical of our attitude.<\/p><p>I am absolutely sure that I cannot see the point of having a detailed discussion on what is a very technical document given that at the previous hearing, we provided all of the information and then commissioned this document because the committee requested it.  As I said already, and I keep repeating, we were not doing this for financial reasons.  We were doing it for other reasons, mainly governance and improved services.  As the committee will see, the cost-benefit analysis actually provides that there will be a financial improvement for the Citizens Information Board when this reorganisation is implemented but there is a six to one benefits-cost conclusion in this report.  We could discuss forever the details of whether the savings would accrue in year one or year eight but in all honesty, I do not really see the point of it.  <\/p><p> Regarding Deputy Carey's point about the rent, we pay rent at commercial rates virtually everywhere.  There are a few places where we have access to offices that are other public sector offices.  We will still have exactly the same arrangement.  There will be no change in any of that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017112300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Ita Mangan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511433900,"counter":1998,"content":"<p>The transfer of the leases-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017112300002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Angela Black"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511433900,"counter":1999,"content":"<p>The transfer of the leases will be transferred to the new boards and that will be it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017112300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Ita Mangan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511433900,"counter":2000,"content":"<p>Could Ms Mangan clarify one point for me because she touched on it a few times?

I often go on first impressions and my first impression is that there is a huge irony in having the chairperson of the Citizens Information Board being very reluctant to give information to those elected by the citizens.  That is my impression of it.  I understand what Ms Mangan is saying, which is that this KHSK document is very technical and that it is one of economic-speak, which is like lawyer-speak and doctor-speak.  If that is the case, and I have not read it, I will have real difficulty reading it if that is what it is full of.  An explanatory document attached to it would be very helpful not just to Deputies and Senators but to those at the front line of delivering the services.  That is just my view.  Could Ms Mangan tell me about KHSK because she also mentioned KPMG?  Are they the same?  Is KHSK a branch of KPMG?  I have never heard of KHSK before and am just asking the question.  It may have been asked of Ms Mangan previously by other Deputies in the past but it strikes me as quite an unusual selection.  Did the Citizens Information Board put it out to tender?  Why was KHSK chosen?<\/p> <p>  As somebody who is on the ground and has been talking to MABS services in Dublin South Central, my observation is that the concern about this restructuring goes beyond the members of the boards.  It extends to the staff and is an issue about which the wider community which avails of the services is concerned.  They are not kicking up a stink and will not have a revolution and I doubt they will upset the Citizens Information Board's plan but there is a concern that is wider than that indicated by Ms Mangan.  If this concern runs deep and is widespread, naturally, information about minutes will leak.

We came in here in February and gave every background document.  This has been going on for years.  We gave every background document to it.  This committee disagrees with our decision to ahead with the reorganisation.  I accept that.  This committee is entitled to disagree with it.  However, we have the statutory responsibility and are going ahead with the reorganisation.  This committee asked us to have an economic or cost-benefit analysis done.  We went out to tender in the normal way.  This company, which, to be perfectly honest, I had not heard of previously, tendered for this contract.  It is not part of KPMG.  It is a reputable firm of economic consultants and this is the form that a cost-benefit analysis takes.  I accept that it is difficult enough to understand.  I think I understand it myself but it is not an easy read, any more than any other cost-benefit analysis would be an easy read.  However, it is what this committee asked for, it was properly procured, the normal procurement considerations were taken into account and the company in question won the tender.  It is as simple as that.  I cannot say any more about it than that.<\/p> <p>  The interaction between Citizens Information Board staff and the staff of the various services would suggest to us that, in general, the staff are actually quite well-disposed towards this - although I am sure there are some who are not - because, among other things, it greatly enhances their career prospects.  They will be able to have opportunities to progress through the different services.  At present, each member of staff is employed by a small organisation.  When this is implemented, they will have a much wider possibility of progressing through the organisation so all in all, this is very good for staff.

I would simply note that it is not a matter of the committee simply disagreeing with the decision of the Citizens Information Board.  It is that we raised concerns about the public interest, including the concern that an appropriate cost-benefit analysis had not been done.  I will only touch on the two other issues because Ms Mangan has raised them.  They are the questions of good governance and improvement in services.  It seems that the only area where any potential improvement in services is being posited is if there is a freeing up of local managers to carry out more front-line work.  I will come back to the question of whether that improvement in services might have been agreed in others but that is a very narrow proposal in terms of improving services.  In terms of governance, the beginning of this cost-benefit analysis stated that concerns were raised by internal sources such as the Department of Social Protection, which, again, seemed to be a major influencer, and the Comptroller and Auditor General that this is a highly inefficient structure that does not optimise the use of available resources.   We did request and were provided with documentation and I thank the Citizens Information Board for sharing documentation with us.  We saw nothing from the Comptroller and Auditor General that suggests that office had a concern with the existing structure.  It was very clear that anything we saw from the Comptroller and Auditor General related to the under-resourcing of internal compliance at the Citizens Information Board.  That seemed to be reinforced by the comment in Ms Mangan's introduction to this new document where she spoke about difficulties coming to the fore as the number of staff in the Citizens Information Board reduced in recent years.  It seems that it was the issue of internal capacity that was being flagged by the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p><p>Even though the terms were no-change, something nobody has looked into, there is a little bit of moving around.  The report's cost benefit analysis talks about no-change but then throws in a hypothetical compliance unit that would cost &euro;433,000 as something that could be done.  This is no-change plus a compliance unit.  When one says there is to be no-change, and then adds in a change, one is actually talking about an alternative.  It is described in a couple of places as an alternative.  Let us put the &euro;433,000 compliance unit as an alternative.  It is mentioned in the beginning of the report in respect of the costs but disappears in terms of the benefits.  It really should have been followed through if it is an alternative.  It should have been followed through as an alternative to which the restructuring should be compared, throughout this full document.  Let us keep that &euro;433,000 compliance unit figure in mind.<\/p><p> I want to dive in to the figures.  I do not believe we have a problem with the language.  I do not believe that we are intimidated by the economics.  We have a concern around the fact that the logics in place here are flawed and inconsistent, and a real concern with the fact that the figures double up and sometimes do not add up.  I shall not going to spend time on the key point at the beginning but I might come back in later on the wider question of accountability, which I believe is crucial.  I shall dive in to the figures.  The section on costs shows a figure for set-up costs of &euro;1.94 million.  Within that there is some talk-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017112300002#E01600","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511433900,"counter":2014,"content":"<p>To which page is the Senator referring?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017112300002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Ita Mangan"},{"type":"speech","time":1511433900,"counter":2015,"content":"<p>On page 13, in respect of the assignment of premises, a figure of &euro;727,545 is given but it does not really address the concern that Deputy Carey rightly raised that there are cases where the organisation is not paying a market value rent and a very significant example is the extraordinary high value that is given in the discounted level for the premises in Dublin for the Dublin citizen information services, and in particular the very high profile property in O'Connell Street.  There is a concern there about whether the board assume these favourable and preferential rates and costs for property will be carried through in the new structure.  This seems to be an assumption.  If this was not the case it will be a further significant cost in set up.  I do not want to spend too much time on that.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to the running and operational costs.  The operational costs are estimated in the report at &euro;7.47 million over eight years.  That is &euro;1.25 million additional operational costs every year.  Added in is the &euro;9.4 million cost for the proposed restructuring.  It is not an inconsiderable amount.  It is quite reasonable that this committee - and perhaps other committees in the future such as the Committee of Public Accounts - would want to know how this money is being allocated and spent.  This &euro;1.25 million is the cost of the proposed restructuring, but the board has previously told the committee that a compliance unit, which would do the minimum, would cost &euro;433,000.  The board's proposed restructuring is costing three times the cost of introducing a compliance unit that would satisfy governance concerns.<\/p> <p>  When we consider the costs that are not figured, with regard to the 16 new regional managers the report states \"it is assumed ... that no travelling or other expenses would arise\".  Will these regional managers never visit local offices?  Is it good governance if we have no travelling expenses and no assumption of travelling from these regional managers to all of the local offices?  Can we say that is good governance?  Will the board members of these companies not travel for longer distances?<\/p> <p>  The section of the report that deals with the cost, to reduce the &euro;1.25 million, we see a very extraordinary assumption.  I need to know about this because it is a very unusual move.  On figures for the HR bill, which may be a certain amount, we see that income tax, PRSI and USC are to be taken out.  Is it the case that miraculously, these items that go from payroll are suddenly no longer costs, that they are in fact benefits as it goes back to Revenue and the Exchequer?  We do not know what tax reliefs or tax allowances people are using.  It is a very unusual practice to take a direct payroll cost and just try to subtract it from the equations.  This is very important because it appears a number of times in the report; costs become benefits, benefits become costs and they are swapped around.  This is what I meant by doubling up on how things are calculated.<\/p> <p>  In the final calculations the report puts a compliance unit, not required, in as a saving but it is not happening at the moment.  If we remove that cost, and do the calculations properly, and even allowing for the savings on board member expenses, audit fees, legal and professional fees, this restructuring is still costing &euro;923,000 per annum.  This is still more than twice the cost of a compliance unit.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of concerns but I want to move to the section of the report on the benefits of the restructuring.  It is extraordinary, highly unusual and not normal economic practice that when the report looks at the benefits it switches to an entirely new economic frame.  The report looks at the reorganisation from a socio-economic frame.  It is an extremely unusual practice to have two completely different methodologies for each half of an equation.  I wonder if Ms Mangan can answer this when we come to it.  It is extraordinary.  If the report was to use this socioeconomic frame when it looked at the costs I imagine that there would be many, many socioeconomic costs - which this committee has heard outlined and raised as concerns - that could be brought through.  The report looks at three key figures within this socioeconomic frame.   I refer the committee to page 25.  The three key benefits under the socioeconomic frame, and the case being made for value for money and the cost benefit, are extraordinary.  Ms Mangan was asked about volunteers.  A reference to volunteers does appear in the report because the time given by volunteers - which anybody can see is a benefit to the organisation in respect of board members - is now flipped around.  The report says it will be a benefit to society in not having volunteers and by losing all these volunteer hours.  There is absolutely no capacity to say - and the report authors are in no position to say - what may happen to the people who are volunteering when they go out in to the world, freed from the arduous duties of contributing to the important work they do.  We do not know what they will do and they may, for example, never volunteer again because they may be disheartened by their experience.  That is not the main concern.  It is, however, useful that the report quantifies the value of board members' voluntary contribution.  That quantified value is &euro;4.92 million, which is lost.  We need to go right back to the section of the report on costs and say that now there is a cost - the loss of &euro;4.92 million - in voluntary contributions by volunteers board members.  It might not be as full as that because there will potentially be some board members in the new boards.  If we leave it, however, at the &euro;4.92 million per annum - or even &euro;5 million - we are suddenly right back to a situation where the restructuring is costing us close to &euro;2 million.  In that case we would nearly be at four times the cost of a compliance unit.<\/p> <p>  I will address my final two points.  It is crucial because we are here to discuss the cost benefit analysis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017112300002#F00300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511433900,"counter":2016,"content":"<p>I want to get some answers to the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017112300002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1511433900,"counter":2017,"content":"<p>I want to come to the conclusion.  I will be briefer when addressing the other two questions, but they are important.  The reduced volunteer time is a key issue.  On the new salaries, it is really unusual that having first of all said the payroll does not count the report says that by paying people it is somehow a benefit to society.<\/p><p>As a result, those who compiled the report have managed to make some of the &euro;7 million cost of the new salaries disappear on the basis that the money is paid to people.  If I buy something in a shop, it is of benefit to the owner but I have less money because I have paid for what I bought.  Extraordinarily, the new salaries are included as a benefit even though they represent a cost.<\/p><p> In the conclusion to the report, it is noted that the position needs to be monitored and reference is made to the 50% increase in front-line availability and an information provision availability on the part of development managers.  That is the only solid figure provided.  The  &euro;14.9 million figure assumes 50% new availability but the narrative of the report says that we could look at other assumptions.  In other words, it could be 30% or there might be no efficiency gain and there will be no freeing-up of time in the context of the provision of front-line services.  The 50% can be questioned because it is envisaged that 16 regional managers will take up the work of 50% of 42 posts - namely, that of 21 people - and deal with any compliance issues for Citizens Information Board centrally.  There is a huge amount of work that is supposed to be taken on by these new regional managers.  Then there are the terms and conditions of the existing development managers.  Is information provision included in their terms and conditions?  I know that Ms Mangan does not manage them directly but she cannot assume that this work will be taken on by them.  There is a concern in this regard.  How solid is the figure of 50%?  Can Ms Mangan confirm whether she expects that 50% of front-line time will be freed up?<\/p><p> A huge amount of front-line work is currently being done by volunteers.  As we discussed earlier, 1,080 volunteers are delivering services.  We do not have to guess or speculate about these people because we have the figures.  Very conveniently, the Citizens Information Board produced a report in 2010 which indicated that volunteers on the front line were contributing 2,700 hours per week.  Using the board's estimate of volunteer time at being valued at &euro;22.25 per hour, this means that volunteers are making an annual contribution to the value of &euro;24 million in respect of front-line services.  If even 20% of those volunteers leave, we loose &euro;5 million worth of front-line service delivery.  It seems that this missing figure should be in the mix.  Giving the volunteers awards is all very well but we have not seen a risk assessment and concerns have been expressed, not only by the boards but also by staff representative organisations that have spoken to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017112300002#F00500","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511433900,"counter":2019,"content":"<p>As I said at outset, this is a technical, economic analysis done in accordance with the standard economic analysis techniques.

The purpose of today's meeting is to challenge and understand the assumptions that were made, the analysis that was carried out and the findings that were reached.

The report was undertaken for a purpose, and the purpose of today's meeting is to analyse it, examine its assumptions, understand where it is going and assess whether the committee is satisfied that its recommendations represent the best way to proceed.  The outcomes in the report are based on a range of assumptions of which we are quite well aware.

We could argue about every one of the assumptions in it.  We could argue about the outputs in all cases but I do not know if we would ever reach any consensus.  What I consider to be important is the best services that we can provide.  I will address the matter of establishing a compliance unit.  The Citizens Information Board was told by the Comptroller and Auditor General that it would have to carry out 31 audits annually on its 93 services.  If we were to do that, we would need a compliance unit.  I would regard a compliance unit as an incredible waste of money.  All it would do would be to visit individual services to ensure that each was doing its accounts properly.  A far better way would be to have a much smaller number of companies, we have opted for 16, which would require five audits annually, according to the Comptroller and Auditor General, and then we would not need a compliance unit because we could do that from existing resources.<\/p> <p>  On the use of the local managers' time and so on, as I said earlier in the case of MABS, the money advisers are doing some of the administrative work.  That will not happen under the new structure.  They will be providing money advice on a full-time basis, which is what they are qualified to do.  The regional managers, the administration, the back-up, the HR and so on will be centralised so that the staff who deliver the services - including the volunteers who provide services within the citizens information services - will all be freed up to do nothing other than deliver those services.  That is the thinking behind all of it.  I keep repeating that we never did this for financial gain, but to improve governance and services.  We provided the committee with our estimated costs in February.  There are some minor differences between those and the figures contained in this cost-benefit analysis but we did not outline benefits in any financial sense because we did not consider that to be the major issue.  All the other reports, including the Pathfinder report, dealt with these issues but I cannot see the value of our getting into the minutiae of the benefits of having regional managers available to do front-line work and so on.  I do not see how the members of the committee or I can challenge all the figures without merely substituting our assumptions for those made by the professionals.  This is a professionally produced report.  Members can criticise it - I can criticise it myself - but the overall finding is that there are financial benefits, although, as I keep saying, we are not unduly concerned about that.

We are seeking a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;10 million for the 2017 budget in order to fund the Christmas bonus, which is due to be paid to Vote 37 social assistance recipients next week.  Overall, the Christmas bonus is estimated to cost &euro;219 million.  As Deputies will be aware, we are providing for an 85% bonus this year, the same as last year.  The bonus will be paid to approximately 1.2 million customers over the course of next week.  It will provide a significant boost for people in the run-up to the festive season and for local economies throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  The overall cost is broken down into &euro;100 million for Vote 37 recipients and &euro;119 million for Social Insurance Fund recipients.  The Social Insurance Fund will fund, in its entirety, the cost of the bonus that is to be paid to people on contributory payments, such as the contributory State pension, invalidity pension and so on.  Accordingly, this element of the bonus does not impact in any way on the Supplementary Estimate.  As Deputies may be aware, the Social Insurance Fund is in surplus this year.  Income from PRSI receipts during 2017 will result in Social Insurance Fund income estimated at &euro;9.86 billion.  It will be over &euro;262 million, or 2.7%, ahead of profile for this year and will be &euro;653 million, or 7.1%, ahead of the position in 2016.  I imagine Deputies will agree that this is a positive development.  Thankfully, it is clear evidence of the significant improvements in employment levels in recent years.<\/p> <p>  Expenditure on Social Insurance Fund schemes and administration, including payment of the Christmas bonus, is estimated to cost &euro;8.897 billion.  This is &euro;86 million, or 1%, ahead of profile.  Even with the payment of the Christmas bonus to social insurance schemes, the surplus of the fund is expected to be approximately &euro;1.4 billion at the end of 2017.  In so far as is possible, I intend to keep running surpluses in the coming years in light of the need to prepare, on foot of our ageing population, for the rising cost of pensions.<\/p> <p>  Overall expenditure on the Department's schemes, services and administration in 2017 is expected to be &euro;19.951 billion.  This will be &euro;96 million, or 0.5%, more than provided for in the original 2017 Revised Estimate.  The higher expenditure is due solely to the payment of the Christmas bonus.<\/p> <p>  The numbers on the live register are expected to average at approximately 260,300 for 2017.  This is a reduction of 43,800 on the average for 2016.  The estimated cost of paying the Christmas bonus of &euro;23 million to jobseekers is being offset by underspending elsewhere in the jobseeker's allowance allocation.  Consequently, there is no additional allocation required for jobseekers in the Supplementary Estimate.<\/p> <p>  The briefing provided to Deputies in respect of the Supplementary Estimate lists the schemes for which additional sums are being sought as well as some information on underspending.  We can go through the position of individual schemes, if required, during the meeting.  In any event, Deputies should note that almost all the expenditure incurred by the Department is demand-led.  This demand is driven by demographic trends and economic factors such as developments in the labour market.  An estimate of expenditure for any scheme for the following year is published in December as part of the annual Revised Estimates Volume.  The individual estimates are constructed on a scheme-by-scheme basis using data on trends in recipient numbers, average payment values and other relevant factors available for that portion of the year in which the Estimate is calculated.  Trends can and do change over the course of each year, resulting in expenditure being higher or lower than provided for in the original Estimate.  Actual expenditure on most schemes will never be precisely on target as a result of these factors.  The extent of any overspend or underspend only becomes fully apparent at the end of the year when the outturn for the year has been confirmed.  Thus, for example, we expect an overspend on schemes such as disability allowance and other illness schemes this year.  This is primarily due to the continuing increase in the number of applications.  In the first half of this year, for example, the number of new applications for disability allowance increased by 8.2% compared with the same period last year.  We should assume that the spend in this area will increase.<\/p> <p>  I hope my opening statement has given Deputies a broad overview of the Department's expenditure in 2017 and the reason underlying the necessity to ask for a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;10 million.  I look forward to engaging with committee members presently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017112300002#B00200","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511429400,"counter":2061,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

Like the Cathaoirleach, I have no wish to frustrate the payment of the Christmas bonus.  Many people rely on the payment desperately at this time of year, especially old age pensioners.  They view and use this payment as a way to get out of many financial difficulties.<\/p> <p>  I did a rough calculation some years ago when the payment was completely stopped.  My calculation was based on one town, Bray.  Predominately, the payment goes directly to the local economy.  It is not for going off on shopping trips to New York or anywhere else.  It goes directly into the local community.  The loss of the payment to Bray amount to between &euro;3 million and &euro;4 million.  That is the impact of it.<\/p> <p>  The bonus must be welcomed, although it would be better if it were a 100% payment.  Given the fact that there are savings within the Department in respect of various schemes and that there is surplus in the Social Insurance Fund, is it possible at this point to give out a 100% payment?  Let us consider some of the savings across the Department.  There is a saving in the fuel allowance.  A whole range of savings can be made.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I reckon increasing the payment to 100% would cost in the region of &euro;32 million.  Would it be possible to increase it to 100%?<\/p> <p>  It is positive that we are ahead of the position that obtained in respect of the Social Insurance Fund in 2016.  I appreciate what the Minister has said in terms of the need to continue building the fund.  My question is on the issue of bogus self-employment.  Has the Department carried out analysis of how much we are missing out on through bogus self-employment and employer PRSI contributions?  The fact is that the fund is ahead of profile but it could be far healthier.<\/p> <p>  The Minister says that the figure for disability payments and disability allowance is up 8.2% compared with 2016.  Of all the payments, this is the largest increase.  There has to be a reason.  I understand this may be because JobPath has now come on the scene and many people are having their payments changed.  I am unsure whether there is a reason for that other than an increase in applications.<\/p><p>There has to be another reason for it so perhaps the Minister could provide a breakdown of the position.

Where does that figure come from or why would people be applying for that now?<\/p> <p>  The other issue is the yield relating to employer PRSI.  The Government is always saying it cannot afford certain things.  We are discussing the pension anomaly whereby people find themselves at a loss to the tune of &euro;1,500 per year.  The 1% increase in the 8.5% and 10.75% rates of employer PRSI would bring in &euro;707.1 million.  That would be a significant amount of money in terms of re-examining the position and giving something back to people.

That is, in turn, &euro;653 million ahead of the position for 2016.  The Minister and her officials have indicated that this is correct.  In last year's Social Welfare Act and budget, the Minister provided for the extension of invalidity pensions to the self-employed.  A number of people have been in contact with me at constituency level about that and I made inquiries with the Department as recently as last week.  I was told that the rules, forms and arrangements are not yet in place.  I understood that this was supposed to start on 1 December, which is only a week away.

The figure for disability allowance is striking.  Two questions must be asked because it is significant.  Is the Department carrying out a review to understand what is happening?

How many people were in receipt of that at the start of the year and how many are currently receiving it?  Is it still the intention that it will finish at the end of this year and will not be paid next year?<\/p> <p>  Finally, I had not intended to raise this matter but Deputy Joan Collins mentioned it.  In her opening statement, the Minister referred to the Social Insurance Fund being ahead of target.  It is the issue of the changes that were made in 2012 to the State contributory pension.  When the Minister was before us a couple of weeks ago, she indicated - she did so in the D&aacute;il as well - that she did not want to bring forward something half-baked and that she was nearly finished.  We had expected that she would have had an announcement regarding what she was working on, or we were led to believe that she almost had something ready.  That was in the interim to the roll-out of the proposals for the total contribution system.  Will the Minister provide a further update on the position since she was before us two weeks ago?<\/p> <p>  Perhaps the Minister will address those questions.

Almost all of them raised the same matters so instead of answering them individually, I will speak in general terms.<\/p> <p>  Of course, one would love to be able to give a bonus of 100% given where people have come from in recent years.  To be fair, however, Deputies must accept that the reason I am here today is that I am looking for more money.  If I were to provide a 100% bonus, I would be seeking a hell of a lot more money.  Some Deputies suggested that because there are underspends under certain subheads we could use the money involved.  While there are underspends under certain subheads, there are overspends under others.  The reason I am here is that I am short &euro;10 million to pay the 85% bonus.  As the economy improves one would hope to be able to return to a situation where one can give people what they used to receive in previous years.  I agree with Deputy Brady that they spend it.  It does not go into a box somewhere or to the Bahamas.  They spend it so it is of value and contributes to the local economy.  Hopefully, as the country recovers, the Department might be in a position to consider that next year.  Some Deputies referred to the fact that the Social Insurance Fund is in surplus and suggested that perhaps it should have been used to pay a 100% bonus.  The way the system works is that the Christmas bonus from the Social Insurance Fund can only be paid to those in receipt of contributory benefits.  The deficit does not relate to that fund, it relates to the people who are receiving allowances.<\/p> <p>  Another question was in respect of the Social Insurance Fund and bogus self-employment.  The Deputy can bet his bottom dollar that if I had that extra &euro;750 million or so, I would be well able to spend it.  I am not sure the figure is anywhere close to that.  However, I am sure there are some people - perhaps not in the large numbers that one might expect - who are in precarious situations whereby they are being made to declare themselves as being self-employed when they truly are not.  A report is being considered by the Department, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners, to pursue that element of the Social Insurance Fund contributions, which probably does not exist in reality today.  While we are working closely with the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, I only have the joy of spending the money in the Social Insurance Fund.  I do not have responsibility for collecting that money.  It is only by working with different Departments that we can influence how that position is reached.  However, given that I am in charge of employment rights and employment affairs, we are anxious to extend those same rights to people who are not necessarily self-employed in a self-employed world, if the Deputy understands what I am trying to say.  I hope to be in a position to issue the report on bogus self-employment and our views on it before Christmas.  If not, it will be issued very early in the new year.  I will revert to the Deputy and have a fuller conversation in that regard if possible.<\/p> <p>  The next question was about the 8.2% increase in the number of disability applications.  The main reason for it is that there has been a change in our demographics.  In fact, that is the only reason.  However, I believe there probably are some people on the live register who should not be on it.  We might conduct an analysis of that next year.<\/p><p>If there is a view that maybe there is a draw from one scheme to the other just because of this, it definitely is not just because of this.  There is a change in our demographics.<\/p><p> I assure the members that there are strict medical conditions to qualify for receipt of a disability allowance payment.  One cannot just arrive and say whatever one wants to say.  There are strict medical conditions that have to be adhered to and supporting documentation.  Those who apply and are successful and who are in receipt of disability payments genuinely have a disability that proves that they cannot work in the profession in which they would have been able to work and enjoy employment heretofore.  We will obviously keep an eye on that.  We do not look at rises in schemes and merely say it is well and good.  We conduct deep analysis and investigations.  However, we are quite satisfied that those in receipt of disability payments are adhering to the strict criteria that were set out beforehand.<\/p><p> At the start of this year 2,000 families were receiving mortgage interest relief.  At the end of this year, there are 1,400.  We will continue to pay those 1,400, but as the economy improves, I anticipate that number will continue to go down.  As long as people satisfy the conditions to receive that payment, they will receive it.  We are here to provide income supports for people when they need them.  If they need them, they will continue to get them.  As I said, I hope and envisage that as the economy recovers and people's personal finances recover, they might not need them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017112300002#C00600","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511429400,"counter":2070,"content":"<p>The indication from the Department in previous  replies to parliamentary questions was that it would expire on 1 January 2018.

To be clear, the paper compiled by my Department on the anomalies and the working suggestions to resolve it will be sent to the next Cabinet sub-committee.  That will happen before Christmas or immediately after Christmas.  So as the Deputy does not think I am misleading him, there is a Cabinet sub-committee meeting today.  The paper is not quite ready to be put on the agenda today, but if there is another one next week or next month, it will be on that agenda and what the paper is and what the options are will be made public to the Deputy.

If I did have the money, we would most likely not have to ask for money.  We in the Department do not have the money to fix it within the finances allocated to us for next year.  It has to go through the normal methods of seeking the cross-departmental commitment that it is agreeable that this is how we fix it and to determine how best to find the money to fix it.  Deputy Collins is not the only person who will get calls afterwards.  That money does not currently exist in anybody's Department which is why it has to go to the Cabinet sub-committee to try to determine if the options we are going to provide are agreeable to other Departments, and then to determine how quickly we can fix it based on the resources we have.  That is the commitment and roadmap.  That paper and the options in it will go to the next Cabinet sub-committee meeting, and once that committee has considered it, I assume it will then allow us to bring it to a full Cabinet meeting and it will be made public as soon as I can do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017112300002#E00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1511429400,"counter":2092,"content":"<p>Deputy Brady wants to speak, but before that, I thank the Minister for her comments on the anomalies.
