It was agreed that the Greek government would, on Thursday 9 July at the latest, present proposals for a comprehensive and specific reform agenda for assessment by the three institutions and presentation to the Eurogroup.  The Eurogroup considered these proposals at meetings on 11 and 12 July, prior to the meeting of the Euro Summit.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout all of the European Council and Euro Summit negotiations, I expressed Ireland's understanding and empathy with the difficult situation faced by the Greek people.  I highlighted our willingness to negotiate a way forward and achieve a sustainable solution that took account of the realities of the situation in Greece, while also respecting existing commitments.  I stressed our determination to ensure that Greece can continue as a member of the euro area.  At both of the Euro Summits in July, I intervened along these lines, and participated in the Summit&rsquo;s negotiations on the texts of the Conclusions. <\/p>  <p>  The negotiations were undoubtedly difficult and Greece remains in a very challenging situation.  However, if the agreed measures continue to be taken forward swiftly in accordance with the commitments made, as they have been to date, I believe that there is a real basis for Greece, with the support of partners, to return to stability and growth within the euro area.  That is the objective towards which we have all worked and will continue to work. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200061#WRB00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Strategies","counter":79,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200061#WRB00950"},{"type":"question","counter":80,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[30487\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200061#WRB01000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"his Department's priorities for the remainder of this D&aacute;il; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1206","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","counter":81,"content":"<p>The priority for my Department is to support the Government in implementing the commitments set out in the Programme for Government and the more recent Statement of Government Priorities which set out the key priorities for the remainder of the Government's term of office:<\/p><p>- Strengthening the Domestic Economy &amp;amp; Prioritising New Jobs for the Unemployed <\/p><p>- Delivering Better Living and Working Standards <\/p><p>- Improving Housing Availability &amp;amp; Affordability <\/p><p>- Responsible and Sustainable Management of the Public Finances <\/p><p>- Rebuilding Trust in Politics &amp;amp; Public Institutions <\/p><p>- Protecting &amp;amp; Enhancing Peace in Northern Ireland <\/p><p>Progress on the implementation of these priorities is included in the Programme for Government Annual Report published each March.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200061#WRB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":82,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200061#WRB01150"},{"type":"question","counter":83,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[30488\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200061#WRB01200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the cost of issuing hard-copy payslips to staff or retired staff by his Department and by agencies under the control of his Department, in 2013; and in 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","counter":84,"content":"<p>As a matter of policy my Department and the National Economic and Social Development Office issue electronic payslips to staff.

In its reports the Unit makes recommendations to management based on &lsquo;Best Practice&rsquo;.\r\n\r\n2.3The Unit will also act in an advisory capacity to projects under development to ensure the adequacy of control measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0Internal Audit Committee\r\n\r\n3.1The Accounting Officer is the person responsible for appointing the membership of the Internal Audit Committee.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that an individual can maximise their entitlement to an SPC, all contributions paid over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. <\/p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Under this system, the rate of the SPC is related to the average contributions paid (or credited) over their working life.  For example, someone with a yearly average of 52 contributions (i.e. 100%) would generally receive a full rate pension (personal rate &euro;230.30), whereas someone with a yearly average of only 30 contributions paid or credited would have an entitlement, under the SPC, to a weekly personal rate of &euro;207, which is 90% of the maximum rate.  If such a pensioner was paid the same rate of contributory pension as someone who had paid into the social insurance system all their working life, it would mean there was no benefit derived from the much greater contribution made by that person.  As it is, the benefit derived from paying PRSI is greater, in relative terms, for those with limited contribution records and who receive lower rate pensions, than it is for full-rate pensioners.<\/p>  <p>  Where an older person qualifies for the reduced rate SPC of &euro;207, but they do not have other income (such as a private pension), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support.  In such cases they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate of which is &euro;219, which amounts to just over 95% of the maximum rate of the SPC.  <\/p>  <p>  If a person does not believe that my Department has calculated their pension entitlements correctly, they may request that the decision be reviewed in the first instance, or they may appeal it to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200062#WRC02600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Application Forms","counter":172,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200062#WRC02650"},{"type":"question","counter":173,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[30634\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200062#WRC02700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"in view of concerns by post offices, if her Department has reviewed application forms for Department payments and updated them to ensure that a more neutral wording in relation to payment options is provided; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1194","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":174,"content":"<p>My Department updates and reviews its application forms on a regular basis, to take account of evolving requirements.

These measures were further extended in 2014. Reduced JA rates for jobseeker&rsquo;s who are under 26 years of age is a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency. It aims to incentivise young jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients to avail of education and training opportunities.  If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160. <\/p>  <p>  To guard against the development of welfare dependency I believe that it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If they do not improve their skills, it will be much more difficult for them to avail of job opportunities as the economy recovers and they are at risk of becoming long term unemployed from a young age.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is through policies to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity.  Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of employment for young people.  This strategy has been succeeding, with an increase of over 80,000 in employment over the last two years. <\/p>  <p>  Reflecting the improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall.  For example the youth unemployment rate in Ireland as estimated by EUROSTAT was 20.7% in August 2015 as compared to 30.8% in December 2011.  However, the Government recognises that there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.<\/p>  <p>  Any change to the reduced rates of JA for people under 26 is a matter for Government to consider in a Budgetary context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200066#WRG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":359,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200066#WRG00800"},{"type":"question","counter":360,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[31338\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200066#WRG00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will examine an application for carer's allowance by a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":361,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance from the person concerned on 5 June 2015.

A key driver in reducing income poverty among children is social transfers, which reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children from 45.5 per cent to 17.9 per cent, thereby lifting a quarter of all children out of poverty. This equates to a poverty reduction effect of 60.7 per cent. Ireland is amongst the best performing member states in the EU in this regard.In Budget 2015, the Government committed a further &euro;96 million for children. This provided for an increase of &euro;5 per month in child benefit, the introduction of the Back to Work Family Dividend worth &euro;29.80 per child for eligible families returning to work, and an additional &euro;2 million on the School Meals Programme. <\/p><p>Government policy around tackling poverty for children and families is articulated in <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures<\/i><i>The national policy framework for children &amp;amp; young people 2014-2020. <\/i>This includes the adoption of a child-specific social target for poverty reduction aiming to lift 70,000 children out of poverty by 2020, equivalent to a reduction of two-thirds on the 2011 rate.  In line with this target, the Government has committed to implementing a whole-of-government approach to tackling child poverty, building on the lifecycle approach in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion, 2007-2016 and informed by the European Commission Recommendation on &lsquo;Investing in children: Breaking the cycle of disadvantage&rsquo;.

The scheme was first introduced on 1 July 2011, with the objective of bringing unemployed jobseekers on the Live Register closer to the labour market by providing them with the opportunity to develop new skills as well as enhancing existing ones, through the provision of a quality work experience placement.  As of 17 September 2015, more than 42,700 internship placements had commenced and there are currently 4,613 participants on the programme.<\/p><p>Eligibility for participation on the JobBridge Scheme was initially confined to people in receipt of unemployment payments (i.e. Jobseekers Benefit\/Jobseekers allowance) or signing for credits for at least 78 days within the last 6 months, the criteria for which included the requirement that a person must be available for work.<\/p><p>However, on 28 May 2012, the eligibility criteria for participation on JobBridge was extended to include customers in receipt of Disability Allowance (DA) and One Parent Family Payment (OPFP), schemes for which payment was not dependent on recipients being available to work. On 1 May 2015, the scheme was extended further to include individuals in receipt of Blind Persons Pension\/ Deserted Wives Allowance\/ Deserted Wives Benefit<b><i>\/<\/i><\/b>Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s contributory\/non-contributory Pension. Recipients of these payments are not counted on the Live Register but are eligible to participate on the JobBridge scheme.<\/p><p>In addition, unemployed persons not in receipt of qualifying payments may be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, for example through ETB training for unemployed people (at present there are 1,009 upcoming day courses and 552 upcoming evening courses). Although not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course, they may receive some support for expenses on travel, meals and accommodation. Springboard and Skillnets courses for unemployed people, funded through the Department of Education and Skills, are also open to people regardless of their social welfare status. <\/p><p>Many other services are also available to people who are not in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment. For example employment services, such as advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices regardless of their social welfare status.<\/p><p>An unemployed person who does not qualify for a social welfare payment due to the assessment of their means may be eligible to sign for social insurance contribution credits. Persons who sign for credits for three months (78 days) of the last six months are eligible to participate in the JobBridge programme. Persons signing on for credits for 12 months or longer over the previous 18 months are entitled to participate on Momentum courses through Solas, provided that they have been actively seeking work, however they will not receive any payment. Persons signing for credits for six months or more are entitled to participate on ETB-run VTOS courses subject to availability. In the case of VTOS courses, participants do not receive a training allowance but may receive travel and lunch allowances.<\/p><p>In short, the Government is committed to supporting as many people as possible to participate more fully in employment and to become more self-sufficient by providing supports that address barriers they may encounter in finding and sustaining employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200068#WRJ02400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Insurance","counter":492,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200068#WRJ02450"},{"type":"question","counter":493,"qnumday":267,"qnumall":"[31862\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200068#WRJ02500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the issues raised by the Social Welfare Branch Managers' Association and her response to same; if the Revenue Commissioners have given their opinion; if her Department has met with the representatives of the BMA; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":494,"content":"<p>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to certain PRSI issues which have been raised by the Social Welfare Branch Managers Association.

The functions of the Pensions Ombudsman, who is independent in the exercise of his functions, are set out in Section 131 of the Act.<\/p><p>The Pensions Ombudsman has authority to adjudicate on certain disputes arising under occupational pension schemes and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs).  The legislation does not confer authority on the Pensions Ombudsman to adjudicate on employment or industrial relations issues, such as redundancy agreements.  The determinations of the Pensions Ombudsman are legally binding on the parties to the complaint\/dispute, subject to appeal to the High Court.<\/p><p>With regard to complaints referred to the Pensions Ombudsman it should be noted that the circumstances and complexity of each complaint can differ and contribute to the length of time taken to complete investigation and adjudication.  It is also worth noting that the time taken to deal with a complaint runs from the date of first contact with the Office even where such contact was on the basis of a preliminary phone call or email query and a detailed submission from the complainant was not supplied until much later.  In addition, it can happen that, in the course of an investigation, additional complaint issues are introduced or that the Office is asked to put its investigation on hold while alternate settlement or resolution proposals are being explored.  Furthermore, cases appealed to the High Court are not considered closed by the Office until the date of judgement and the court process can take several years in some cases.

The report is available at www.finance.gov.ie. The issue of USC applying to occupational pensions of retired public servants who entered the public service before April 1995 was examined as part of that review.\u00a0 However, the Government decided not to exempt the occupational pensions of these individuals from the USC charge as it would be very costly and difficult to achieve, and it would involve all income earners with the equivalent income benefiting from the exemption.\u00a0 In addition, it would also undermine the principle of the USC being applied to income with few exceptions. <\/p>  <p>  However, as a result of the review of the USC, the Government decided in Budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the Universal Social Charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum.

An estimated further 87,000 individuals have been exempted from the charge as a result of the further extension of the threshold to &euro;12,012 in Budget 2015.

The second assessment is compliance with the expenditure benchmark.<\/p>  <p>  Under this second pillar, public expenditure, in the absence of discretionary revenue measures, should grow in line with the potential growth rate of the economy, the latter estimated as an average over a ten-year horizon.\u00a0 Furthermore, if a Member State is not at its MTO expenditure should grow at a rate that is sufficiently below the potential growth rate (allowing for a so-called 'convergence margin') in order to ensure rapid convergence towards the MTO.\u00a0 The benchmark rate for expenditure growth is then calculated, taking into account projections for inflation in order to preserve the real value of expenditure. <\/p>  <p>  The applicable benchmark reference rate for Ireland in 2016 is 1.9%.

If there is\u00a0demand or support for the equality impact of budgetary proposals and packages being put to the independent budget office to be\u00a0considered, then it can be incorporated in the Bill.<\/p><p>I want to make it clear that budgetary proposals and legislation being put to the D&aacute;il by the Government will not be a matter for the new office.<\/p><p>Under the Constitution, budgetary allocation is a fundamental responsibility of the D&aacute;il and its individual members and the Government is responsible to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.\u00a0It follows that it is up to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to consider the Government's budgetary proposals and legislation and decide upon them. The extent to which it wants to take equality\u00a0impacts into account is a matter for it to decide. However, Government's budgetary proposals are presented to the D&aacute;il first and this will continue to be the case.<\/p><p>Having said all of the above, I want to assure the Deputies that Government takes equality very seriously. This starts with the fact that Cabinet procedures require a whole range of impacts to be covered in every decision proposed to Government. This ensures that the impact of policy proposals on gender equality, rural communities, North-South\/East-West Relations, employment, persons experiencing or at risk of poverty or social exclusion, people with disabilities and industry costs are taken into account.<\/p><p>The Department of Finance carries out distributional analyses of budgetary options using the Economic and Social Research Institute's (ESRI) Simulating Welfare and Income Tax Changes (SWITCH) model. For Budget 2015, the Department produced analysis of the distributional impact of tax measures. These are contained in the Tax Strategy Group papers and inform the budgetary decision process.\u00a0 These papers are subsequently made public after the Budget and are available here .\u00a0 Further distributional analyses are carried out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Social Protection including distributional analysis of Budget measures and social welfare changes. Indeed, for this year's budget, it is also planned\u00a0that the Departments of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Social Protection will conduct a social impact assessment of the main tax and welfare measures contained in the final Budget package.<\/p><p>Finally, the Budget book contains illustrative examples of the impact of taxation changes on different income earners.\u00a0 Overall, the analysis and transparency of the decision making process has been undergoing constant improvement over recent years and I would envisage this continuing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200070#WRL02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":592,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200070#WRL02550"},{"type":"question","counter":593,"qnumday":301,"qnumall":"[30534\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200070#WRL02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he consider a proposal (details supplied) for a bike to school scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1076","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":594,"content":"<p>The Cycle to Work scheme is essentially an environmental measure.

In this regard, the Commissioners advise that property owners who receive income from the provision of occasional guest accommodation should make a return of their taxable profits to Revenue and pay the resultant income tax, if any, under self-assessment rules in the normal manner.<\/p><p>Finally, I should say that in relation to calls from a number of quarters to extend rent-a-room relief to income earned from the provision of short term guest accommodation to occasional visitors, I am mindful that acceding to such requests could lead to unfair competition in the guest accommodation sector generally, by placing B&amp;amp;B and guest house operators who provide accommodation in the course of a trade at an unfair disadvantage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200071#WRM03300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Exemptions","counter":666,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200071#WRM03350"},{"type":"question","counter":667,"qnumday":326,"qnumall":"[31149\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200071#WRM03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason a daycare centre (details supplied) in County Clare has been excluded for VRT and VAT refund on the purchase of a minibus which is used for transporting severely incapacitated senior citizens to attend the daycare centre; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"976","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":668,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that legislation governing the Drivers and Passengers with Disabilities Scheme is provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994 (S.I. 353 of 1994).

There are, in all, three separate Group Thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer. These are:<\/p><p><b>Group A: tax free threshold &euro;225,000<\/b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer.

These dates are used for different purposes and are mutually exclusive. Firstly, the date of death of a disponer is the date by reference to which the Group Thresholds and tax rates are determined. Therefore, whatever thresholds and rates are in force on this date apply for the purpose of taxing the value of an inheritance. These rules are based on statute and are strictly applied. There is no provision for marginal relief in circumstances where, for example, a disponer dies within a short time of a change in the statutory thresholds and\/or rates.<\/p><p>Secondly, the date on which probate or administration is granted is generally used as the 'valuation date'. This date has no effect whatever on the applicable Group Thresholds and tax rates. The valuation date is the date on which the market value of the assets\/property comprising the inheritance is established. This market value is then compared to the relevant Group Threshold and the tax rate applied as appropriate on any excess of the market value over the threshold. This date also determines when any inheritance tax must be paid and a tax return must be submitted to Revenue.<\/p><p>Inheritance tax is a self-assessed tax and tax returns are processed on this basis.

The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. In this regard, the rate of VAT that applies to a particular good or service is determined by the nature of the good or service, and not by the status of the customer. Children's clothing and footwear are subject to the zero rate for children up to 11 years. Section 46(1)(b) Schedule: 2 Paragraph: 10(1) of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010, clarifies the zero rate of VAT applied to children's clothes. The zero rating applies according to the following criteria:<\/p>  <p>  Clothing described, labelled, marked or marketed as being for children under 11 years of age up to &amp;amp; including chest size 32; waist size 26; height 152 cm or other equivalent sizes. Children's footwear up to and including size 5&frac12; (38 continental or equivalent).<\/p>  <p>  Under the EU VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services. As school uniforms for people over 11 years of age and children's footwear above size 5&frac12; were not subject to the zero rate on 1 January 1991 it is not possible to apply the zero rate to them now.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Member States may apply a reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the EU VAT Directive. As clothes and shoes are not listed under this Annex the reduced rate cannot be applied to the supply of school uniforms or shoes. Therefore the only rate of VAT that can apply to the supply of school uniforms for children over 11 years of age or children's footwear above size 5&frac12; (38 continental or equivalent) is the standard VAT rate of 23%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200072#WRN04200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Central Bank of Ireland","counter":741,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200073#WRO00150"},{"type":"question","counter":742,"qnumday":351,"qnumall":"[31493\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200073#WRO00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has received a request from the Central Bank of Ireland to approve an increased levy on financial institutions to deal with a deficit on the Central Bank of Ireland pension scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":743,"qnumday":354,"qnumall":"[31496\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200073#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the total levies collected by the Central Bank of Ireland from financial institutions in the past five years to cover its costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":744,"qnumday":359,"qnumall":"[31552\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200073#WRO00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will be approving the proposed increases in the 2015 industry levy; if he has considered the points raised by the Professional Insurance Brokers Association and the Irish Brokers Association regarding the impact of these increases on their members; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":745,"qnumday":381,"qnumall":"[32049\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200073#WRO00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the proposed increase in the industry funding levy imposed by the Central Bank of Ireland; if he is aware of the impact the proposed increase will have on small independent brokers, intermediaries and financial advisors; his views that it is fair to increase the levy in order to contribute towards a deficit in the Central Bank of Ireland defined benefit pension scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":746,"qnumday":392,"qnumall":"[32283\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200073#WRO00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason the Financial Regulator wants the small and often single operator broker to fund their pension shortfall in the context of concerns expressed about the banking sector (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":747,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 351, 354, 359, 381 and 392 together.<\/p><p>Under Sections 32D and 32E of the Central Bank Act 1942, the Central Bank is required to seek my approval for the Regulations prescribing levies and fees to be paid by entities subject to regulation by the Central Bank.<\/p><p>I am aware that the Central Bank consulted industry on their proposed 2015 levies which I understand would in some cases amount to a significant increase on the 2014 levies.

This issue has been under\u00a0observation for some time by my Department.  Indeed, the economic review and outlook that accompanied Budget 2015 contained a detailed explanation of the issue.  <\/p><p>().<\/p><p>Exports grew by 13.6 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter of this year, with goods\u00a0exports up over 16 per cent.  Part of the strong performance in goods exports can be attributed to what is known as 'contracted manufacturing'.  <\/p><p>This contracted production occurs when an Irish-resident (though not necessarily Irish-owned) enterprise contracts a plant abroad to produce a good for supply to a third country.  The sale of the good is recorded as an Irish export as the economic ownership of the good prior to sale is regarded as belonging to the Irish-resident enterprise.  Imports\u00a0(for example patents and royalty fees) used in the production process are also recorded as Irish imports.<\/p><p>It is important to stress that the contribution of contracted production to overall exports cannot be calculated with precision with the publicly available data.  It is also important to note that this phenomenon involves very little employment effect or second-round impact on the wider economy.  In fact, the CSO confirmed that last year contract manufacturing had a negligible impact on GDP growth; this is because the phenomenon involves an increase in the level of both exports and imports, with little net impact.  <\/p><p>Notwithstanding these developments\u00a0relating to contracted production,\u00a0there is no doubt that the recovery has gained momentum this year and that it has broadened to include a recovery in domestic demand.

Up to end of August this year, some 44.1 million cigarettes have been seized. Notable seizures have included quantities of 7.68 million, 10.3 million and 9 million.  <\/p>  <p>  Combating the illegal tobacco trade has been, and continues to be, a priority for Revenue.  Their actions include a range of measures to identify and target those who are engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those involved.  Their multifaceted strategy also includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, development and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, use of analytics and deployment of technologies and optimising the deployment of resources.  <\/p>  <p>  A combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages contribute to the effectiveness of Revenue's goal to intercept the supply of illicit tobacco products.  Revenue also target the illicit trade at post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.  <\/p>  <p>  Revenue co-operates extensively with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in acting against the illicit trade, and the relevant agencies in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market.  In addition, cooperation takes place with other tax administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to tackle the illicit trade.  <\/p>  <p>  The extent of the illegal trade in cigarettes is estimated through annual surveys of smokers that are carried out for the Revenue Commissioners and the National Tobacco Control office of the Health Services Executive by Ipsos MRBI.  Assuming that the illegal cigarettes consumed displaced the equivalent full tax paid quantities of cigarettes, the results of these surveys indicate that the loss to the Exchequer in excise duty and VAT in 2014 was of the order of &euro;210 million.  <\/p>  <p>  I have introduced a number of measures in recent years to assist Revenue in dealing with tobacco smuggling and illegal tobacco sales.  Measures in the Finance Act 2012 clarified the legal basis for Revenue officers to open and examine the contents of postal and courier packets that are reasonably believed to contain untaxed excisable products.  <\/p>  <p>  In the Finance Act 2013,\u00a0I introduced new offence and forfeiture measures relating to the illicit production of tobacco, including offences of keeping materials and equipment for the purposes of illicit tobacco production, and provision for forfeiture of any equipment, materials, or unmanufactured tobacco used for illicit production.   <\/p>  <p>  In the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013, I strengthened the obligation on a person suspected of dealing in unstamped tobacco products to provide information to a Revenue officer or a Garda and to present any tobacco products concerned for examination.  This measure also allows the officer or Garda to search any bag or other receptacle that he or she reasonably believes to contain tobacco products that are concerned in the offence.  <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current legislative framework provides an effective basis for action by Revenue against the illegal tobacco trade.  I\u00a0will consider any proposals for additional measures that are shown to be of assistance to Revenue in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200074#WRP01400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":807,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200074#WRP01450"},{"type":"question","counter":808,"qnumday":375,"qnumall":"[28666\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200074#WRP01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he and his officials have considered the introduction of an additional public banking pillar; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1080","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":809,"content":"<p>I assume the Deputy is referring to the concept of local public banking.

The lower full year yield reflects that in a full year (compared to the first year) the cost of reducing the existing 11% surcharge for self-assessed cases to 10% weighs more heavily on the net yield.  <\/p>  <p>  These estimates assume that all existing USC rates and bands remain unchanged.\u00a0 They are based on 2016 estimated incomes from the Revenue tax forecasting model using latest actual data for the year 2013, adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim.\u00a0 They are provisional and may be revised.  <\/p>  <p>  The proposal suggests that the yield from the revised system is ring-fenced for social investment purposes, such as improving healthcare.  The yield from USC is estimated to be &euro;4.2 billion in 2015, and it is used to fund the State generally.  If it were to be\u00a0ring-fenced, the expenditure currently financed by the yield from USC that is not social investment, as defined, would have to be financed by alternative means, which could require additional taxation.   <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, I will bear the proposal in mind in the context of my preparations for the upcoming Budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200074#WRP02600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":825,"content":"<p>Question No. 381 answered with Question No. 351.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Tax Exemptions","counter":826,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200074#WRP02750"},{"type":"question","counter":827,"qnumday":382,"qnumall":"[32069\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200074#WRP02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of properties that have been granted an exemption from the Local Property Tax because they are affected by Pyrite; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":828,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that Section 10A of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for a temporary exemption of at least three years from the charge to Local Property Tax (LPT) for residential properties that have been certified under Regulations made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (S.I.

In summary, when a member dies after retirement, a spouse's pension of up to one-half of the former member's pension is payable.\u00a0 Dependent children are also entitled to a child's pension.  <\/p>  <p>  Changes in legislation following the introduction of civil partnerships in 2011 and the proposed legislation to allow for same sex marriages do not necessitate a scheme member revising their superannuation arrangements as these are automatically catered for under the existing Revised Scheme rules.  <\/p>  <p>  The original pre-1984 scheme did not allow for the payment of a spousal pension\u00a0where the scheme member\u00a0married or had children post retirement.\u00a0 Thus, the scheme allowed a refund of contributions if the scheme member had not been married up to the point of retirement. <\/p>  <p>  In 1984, a Revised Scheme which extended eligibility for benefits to spouses of members who married or had children after retirement was introduced and membership was\u00a0compulsory for all new appointees after that date.  Members of the original scheme, certain retirees and those who had not joined the original scheme\u00a0were given the option of transferring to the Revised Scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  The Revised Scheme allowed for payment of spousal pension where the marriage occurred\u00a0post retirement.  Therefore scheme members do not have to make special arrangements to have their civil partner or same sex spouse made a beneficiary as it will happen automatically.\u00a0 The Scheme\u00a0did not contain the\u00a0facility for repayment of contributions on retirement if the scheme member concerned did not have a spouse and would not therefore be in a position to avail of any benefit under the Scheme.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  For members who remained in the Original Scheme there was an entitlement to claim a refund of contributions in the event that the member remained unmarried at the date of retirement.\u00a0 Many members of the Scheme availed of this option and received a refund.  <\/p>  <p>  Across the entire public service approximately 30,000 staff who were not members and an unquantified number who had been members of the Original Scheme\u00a0opted not to join the new Revised Scheme.\u00a0 Their reasons for doing so were presumably varied, including not\u00a0expecting to get married, being in a relationship with a separated person\u00a0who was not then able to\u00a0divorce\u00a0or that it was personally more beneficial to them not to join the scheme.\u00a0\u00a0For example, prior to 1981 women were not\u00a0entitled to join the pension scheme and therefore did not pay any contributions.\u00a0 Some of those may have decided that continuing that arrangement\u00a0was\u00a0better financially for them.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In recent years, some individuals have sought to reverse the decision they made at that point and have sought a new opt-in.  More specifically, a number of people have argued that they could not have envisaged that same-sex civil partnerships would be legalised in the state.\u00a0 While I understand that the number of\u00a0enquires in this area is relatively low, I do not have precise statistics to hand.\u00a0 My Department's position has always been that if decisions freely made about pensions or other matters could be reversed at any time this would have grave consequences for public administration.\u00a0 Where changes have been made to pension schemes, individuals have only been allowed to opt in to the new arrangements at the time of the introduction of the new scheme.\u00a0 This approach is in line with that of the Commission on Public Service Pensions.

While booking fees are not regulated, the same is not true of payment fees. The European Union (Consumer Information, Cancellation and Other Rights) Regulations 2013, which give effect to Directive 2011\/83\/EU on Consumer Rights, provide that the fees charged to consumers for the use of a given means of payment, such as a credit card, must not exceed the cost of that means of payment to the trader.

The model instrument aims to help ease access to finance for farmers and other rural businesses. Member States and regions can adapt and use this model to set up financial instruments funded by their rural development programmes (RDPs) under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). Financial instruments can take the form of loans, guarante e funds or equity investments. The funding for any such financial instruments would have to draw on Ireland&rsquo;s existing RDP allocation of European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development funding as well as National Exchequer funding. It is also possible to incorporate funding from other sources for such instruments.  In our RDP, we have made a commitment to examining the potential for the use of financial instruments. However, the inclusion of financial instruments by way of a modification to the RDP is required by EU regulation to be based on an ex ante evaluation which must assess:<\/p>  <p>- The existence of a market failure;<\/p>  <p>- The potential for added value;<\/p>  <p>- The resources required to implement a proposed financial instrument; and<\/p>  <p>- The proposed strategic approach to financial instruments.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, I have asked my officials to engage with the European Commission, the EIB and other stakeholders in order to identify areas where financial instruments could be implemented to best strategic effect, and to explore the practical steps which are required in order to i mplement financial instruments.

Other key elements of the Commission Aid proposal include an advance of 70% for next year&rsquo;s Single Farm Payment which will assist with cash flow difficulties.

The longer term perspectives remain very positive.<\/p><p>Having witnessed dairy market developments affecting milk and dairy commodity prices in Ireland and the EU, I presented a six-point plan offering possible solutions to the Commissioner and my EU ministerial colleagues earlier this month. These were presented on the basis of my belief that they were appropriate for consideration by the Council and as a response to the market issues that had developed. This list was not exhaustive and I sought to reach common ground with other Ministers regarding a suite of appropriate solutions.<\/p><p>I am pleased to note that the final decision at Council on the aid package, including the 100% in the case of the PSA scheme for SMP, took account of significant elements in Ireland&rsquo;s six point plan.

Other key elements of the Commission Aid proposal include an advance of 70% for next year&rsquo;s Single Farm Payment which will assist with cash flow difficulties. I also welcome the almost &euro;14 million in direct aid for Ireland, a new PSA scheme for cheese and an increase in funding for the promotion of dairy products.

The use of financial instruments specifically designed to take account of the cash flow impact of downward price cycles in commodity markets requires further examination also.<\/p><p>In addition to measures at EU level, I have also been proactive in other areas in terms of ensuring the right balance of measures are in place to ensure that Irish dairy farmers will remain confident for the future. Among the Government&rsquo;s initiatives in this area are provisions allowing dairy and other farmers to use income averaging over five years when it comes to paying income tax bills. This also offers respite to the sector from a cash flow perspective. Furthermore, I have also ensured that priority has been given to measures for the dairy sector in the Rural Development Plan.

As with any new market it takes time to build reputational brand and a customer base and the real time to assess its value is when these are bedded down.

Exports to the UK are up 4,000t compared with the same period in 2014 which was already up 9,000t on 2013.

In this context, the cost of veterinary care is primarily a commercial matter between owners of animals and service providers. It is important that people acquiring animals ensure that they have the capacity to take appropriate care of them. While the cost of veterinary care would be factored in to animal ownership, I am aware that, occasionally, persons owning pet animals do not have the means to ensure their animals&rsquo; health and welfare. Accordingly, my Department has provided funding since 1995 to animal welfare bodies to assist with their work in caring for animals. These organisations provide much needed assistance to animals (and by extension the owners of animals) in their local communities including providing appropriate and necessary veterinary care to animals at subsidised rates. Funding amounting to &euro;1.867m was allocated in December 2015 to 142 animal welfare charities. Applications for 2015 are currently being processed by my officials and a decision on funding levels will be made in December.<\/p><p>I should also mention that, in the context of recently introduced dog microchipping legislation which makes it compulsory as of 1<sup>st<\/sup>September 2015 to microchip all dogs born after 1 June 2015 and which will apply to all dogs post 31 March 2016, I have made funding available to animal welfare charities to subsidise the cost of microchipping for any dog owner who finds it difficult to afford the full cost of complying with the legislation i.e. social welfare recipients, those on state pensions etc. Details of how to make an application for funding is available on my Departments website at .<\/p><p><i><\/i>The financial assistance provided by my Department to animal welfare bodies assists in reducing incidences of animal cruelty. Such incidents of animal cruelty are totally unacceptable in a civilised society and my Department devotes considerable resources to protecting animal welfare and for dealing with breaches of animal welfare legislation. The new Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 provides for increased levels of  penalties for offences of animal cruelty. The Act sends a clear message to all that cruelty and maliciousness to animals is unacceptable and I believe that the increased penalties provided for under the Act will act as a deterrent to perpetrators of such actions. For major cases taken on indictment, the maximum penalty on conviction is up but not exceeding &euro;250,000 with a maximum custodial sentence of five years imprisonment.<\/p><p>My Department continues to work very closely with animal welfare and farming organisations, local authorities and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in order to minimise incidences of animal cruelty and to provide for early intervention in cases of suspected animal neglect or cruelty.

The payments audited covered the period from 2008 to 2012 during which over &euro;9 billion was paid to farmers in Ireland under the Direct Payment Schemes. I have always been opposed to the imposition of flat-rate penalties and particularly so in this case. I strongly refuted the application of this proposed correction as disproportionate to the true level of risk involved and my Department accordingly sought a hearing with the Conciliation Body.  Further to the Conciliation hearing in December 2014 the report of the Conciliation Body concluded that conciliation seemed within reach and that the Commission and my Department should continue discussing the matter with a view to an agreed settlement. On foot of this advice my Department maintained regular contact with the Commission, and carried out additional requested verification work, with a view to bringing the matter to a conclusion.<\/p><p>The Commission Audit services carried out a verification visit to Ireland in May 2015 and further to same advised my Department in July of their intention to exclude a total of approximately &euro;67.6 million from EU<b><\/b>funding of various agricultural Direct Payment schemes for the seven year period from 2008 to 2014.\u00a0This represents 0.7% of the &euro;12 billion in EU funding for these schemes in this seven year period.\u00a0 This proposal means that the complete period of the Single Payment Scheme will have the Clearance of Accounts procedure concluded.<\/p><p>The proposal consists of two elements - &euro;64 million exclusion for the period 2008 &ndash; 2012 and &euro;3.6 million for the period 2013 &ndash; 2014. It must be noted that there is a decrease of almost 86% in the average annual level of correction for the 2013 &ndash; 2014 period relative to the correction for the 2008 &ndash; 2014 period. This clearly illustrates the very positive impact of the 2013 LPIS review carried out by my Department.<\/p><p>As can be seen, these outcomes have come further to a prolonged process of intensive communication and effort by my Department and the significant reduction from the original proposal of &euro;181 million reflects on same and the very detailed case presented to the Commission in strong opposition to the original proposal, including the examination of over 900,000 land parcels throughout the country.<\/p><p>It is noted that the proposed correction of &euro;67.6 million relates mainly to Commission findings in relation to the exclusion of ineligible lands from payments to farmers under EU funded schemes. I would, therefore, highlight that there is an onus on all farmers to ensure that the area of land declared by them as eligible for payment under the Direct Payment Schemes is accurate. I would urge them to ensure that all ineligible areas and land that they are no longer farming is excluded from the areas claimed for payment under the Direct Payment Schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200081#WRX02900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Appeals","counter":1239,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200081#WRX03000"},{"type":"question","counter":1240,"qnumday":530,"qnumall":"[31593\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200081#WRX03100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of appeals that are at hand in his Department; if he will provide in tabular form a breakdown of the schemes that are been appealed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1241,"content":"<p>The Agriculture Appeals Office has indicated that 406 appeals have been received by that office to date in 2015.

These companies have already proven their capability on international markets and I am confident they will continue to do so.  Planning in terms of marketing activities for the post quota period has been ongoing for a number of years. Developing a unique selling point for Irish dairy produce is a critically important element of the national strategy . It remains clearly evident, from engagement with potential customers for Irish dairy products, that the sustainability message associated with the sector in Ireland has a strong resonance. This is borne out in trade statistics that show substantial year on year increases in Ireland&rsquo;s dairy sector exports from the turn of the decade. Data for the first six months of 2015 indicate that the overall level for dairy exports, at &euro;1.9 billion approx, remains consistent with the same period for 2014, a record year.<\/p>  <p>  As a support to this effort, in 2012 I announced a proposal for a new national sustainability programme for the dairy sector. This programme, the Sustainable Dairy Assurance Scheme (SDAS) was launched in December 2013 and is a key element in Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for marketing and promotion of dairy products on international markets, particularly in the context of expanded milk output following the abolition of milk quotas in April of this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Sustainable Dairy Assurance Scheme was developed in cooperation with milk producers, processors and regulatory authorities. It has been designed to provide a platform for measuring quality and sustainability on Irish dairy farms and to assist in securing new and existing markets for Irish dairy produce as farmers look to increase milk production in a post quota era.<\/p>  <p>  To promote the SDAS to customers of Irish dairy, the industry provides a promotional fund to Bord Bia and this will be focussed across 3 primary target regions, namely Europe, China and the Middle East at a business to business level. It is worth noting that exports to China in the dairy sector were up 25% approx compared to the first 6 months of 2014, which was a record year. Exports to Saudi Arabia, the predominant market in the Gulf, was up 48% in the same period.<\/p>  <p>  Bord Bia also has a central budget from Government which is used, inter alia, for the promotional activities in relation to dairy through attendance at trade fairs, market research in developing markets and consumer research. This funding has increased by 14% in 2015, and includes funding for Bord Bia to assist in the marketing of Irish food and drink including dairy at this year&rsquo;s Expo in Milan. I have also led Trade Missions to a variety of destinations in recent years, including China, the United States, Algeria, Japan and the Gulf States, in order to promote Irish Food and Beverages and dairy promotion has been a significant feature of such missions. I intend to lead missions to China, Vietnam and Africa in the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  Taken together, I am satisfied that the foregoing measures as outlined reflect the strong ongoing commitment to making resources available to ensure developing and exciting markets in the dairy sector can be appropriately pursued.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200081#WRX03500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":1245,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200081#WRX03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1246,"qnumday":532,"qnumall":"[31624\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200081#WRX03700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 267 of 10 March 2015, when a person (details supplied) in County Clare will receive their payment under the agri-environment options scheme for 2013 and 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

However I have on-going contact with Minister Noonan to ensure that taxation policy reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture, as evidenced by our co-operation on the &lsquo;Agri-taxation Review&rsquo;, which was published as part of Budget 2015. The Agri-taxation Review is a comprehensive taxation strategy for the sector and the Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture was evidenced by the immediate implementation of the majority of its recommendations, including two recommendations aimed at addressing income volatility: <\/p><p>- retaining and enhancing Income Averaging by increasing the averaging period from 3 to 5 years; thus giving more scope for income smoothing within a commodity price cycle; <\/p><p>- allowing averaging to be availed of where a farmer and\/or their spouse receive income from an on-farm diversification trade or profession.<\/p><p>Income averaging allows a smoothing of the tax liability in any given year to balance out the income effects of fluctuations in commodity prices that occur from year to year. <\/p><p>However, taxation measures alone will not deal with the issue of income volatility.<\/p><p>I believe that moving up the value chain where possible, in terms of the type of products sold and how they are produced, is a key insulation against volatility. More efficient and sustainable production systems are also important to improving profitability.

These were presented on the basis of my belief that they were appropriate for consideration by the Council and the as a response to the market issues that had developed. This list was not exhaustive and I sought to reach common ground with other Ministers regarding a suite of appropriate solutions.<\/p><p>Whilst welcoming the steps previously taken by the Commission, including extensions to the dates for Aids to Private Storage and Intervention, I noted that having regard to the acute downturn in global milk prices over the past several months, and the severe impact this is having on farm incomes, that a number of further steps were urgently required including:<\/p><p>i. Utilising the provisions of Article 219 of the CMO Regulation to <i>temporarily<\/i>increase the threshold prices, with particular reference to skimmed milk powder.<\/p><p>ii. Restoring the scheme providing Aids to Private Storage for cheese which was introduced by the Commission in September 2014 but discontinued shortly after. In addition I called for the existing aid rates in the PSA schemes for butter and SMP to be reviewed immediately.<\/p><p>iii. Increasing the EU budget for market supports in light of the fact that the assigned revenues deriving from super levies will be some &euro;400 million higher than originally foreseen in the draft budget for 2016.<\/p><p>iv. Using exceptional promotion measures to promote the consumption of dairy products on EU, but especially on 3<sup>rd<\/sup>country markets.<\/p><p>v. Increasing the advance of the Basic Payment and other elements of Direct Payments Scheme and from 16<sup>th<\/sup>October 2015 to 70%, to alleviate cash flow difficulties.<\/p><p>vi. I also called for the reopening of the scheme on Private Storage for Pigmeat which was closed in May of this year.<\/p><p>In the longer term, I also made it clear that from my perspective, it will be necessary to give consideration at EU level to responses to volatility issues in the future such as more price transparency through the EU&rsquo;s Milk Market Observatory, further consideration of the role that might be played by futures markets, and the use of financial instruments specifically designed to take account of the cash flow impact of downward price cycles in commodity markets. <\/p><p>I am pleased to note that of the final decision at Council on the aid package, including the 100% in the case of the PSA scheme for SMP, took account of Ireland&rsquo;s six point plan.. Unfortunately a temporary top-up in the intervention price for SMP did not enjoy the support of all Ministers or the Commission. However the improved PSA scheme for SMP, which will include longer periods for storage as well as the improved aid rates, the re introduction of PSA for cheese, the provision allowing 70% advance in the single farm payment, the provision of increased funding for promotion and the provision of almost &euro;14m in targeted direct aid for farmers can go some way towards alleviating the worst effects of the current market downturn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200083#WRZ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pigmeat Sector","counter":1331,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200083#WRZ01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1332,"qnumday":562,"qnumall":"[32320\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200083#WRZ01300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the proposals, he put forward at the recent EU Agriculture Council in relation to the need to provide support for the pigmeat sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1333,"content":"<p>The development of the pigmeat sector is a priority for me given the crucial role which the industry plays in supporting approximately 7,000 jobsincluding production, slaughter, processing, feed manufacture and services. In 2014 export volumes increased by approximately 7%, with growth to the UK, Continental Europe and International markets. Export values increased by some 3% and are in the range of &euro;570 million, continuing the growth seen in recent years. Pigmeat prices tend to be cyclical in nature with periods of lower prices and production followed by recovery. My Department carefully monitors developments in the pig sector, both domestically and internationally.  I am conscious of the fact that prices have come under pressure over the last year and the difficulties that this is causing for producers. Having said that, Irish prices have been on par with the EU average for 2015. However I would also add that like any other EU Minister I do not have a role in the setting of prices. This is a function of the market.<\/p><p>Earlier this year I called on the European Commission to monitor the developments on markets and where necessary, to quickly activate safety net provisions such as public interventions and\/or private storage aid. This resulted in the introduction of the Aids to Private Storage scheme for the pigmeat sector which opened in early March of this year. However due to the fact that EU pigmeat market prices stabilised somewhat over recent weeks and the uptake of the scheme by operators dropped to minimal volumes, the Commission closed the scheme as of the end of April. <\/p><p>In the run-up to the recent Council of Ministers&rsquo; meeting, I put forward specific measures for the pigmeat sector as part of my six-point plan. Key amongst these was the re-introduction of the APS scheme for pigmeat. I am pleased to say that the Commission agreed to introduce such a scheme and will be coming forward with such a proposal in the coming weeks, which will include support for storage of fresh lard for the first time, I am confident that these improved aid rates and conditions can help to bring the markets back into balance. I also called for additional measures to promote the consumption of pigmeat on international markets and the EU Commission package includes enhanced promotion measures for pigmeat. <\/p><p>In relation to the<b><\/b>Russian ban on EU pigmeat exports, I am fully aware of the concerns Irish pig farmers have as a result of the closure of this market. My Department has met with the Russian authorities on a number of occasions to impress upon them the importance we attach to the normalisation of trade with Russia. I have also called on the EU Commission to re-engage with Russia with a view to re-opening that market to pigmeat products that are not subject to the Presidential Decree. Last week the EU Commission agreed to resume these discussions with Russia. <\/p><p>Support continues to be provided by my Department for the pig sector in a number of ways. Firstly I have included provision in the Rural Development Programme for an on-farm capital investment scheme, TAMS II, with an overall budget of &euro;395 million across all sectors. Some &euro;37 million has been allocated for 2015. \u00a0Amongst the areas identified for initial funding are investments on pig farms for energy, water meters and medicine dispensers.\u00a0Other elements of the RDP, such as a targeted on farm animal health and welfare scheme will also be of benefit to the pig sector. <\/p><p>Other supports for the sector come through Teagasc which, through its Moorepark pig research facility and courses in pig production, plays an important role in improving production at farm level. <\/p><p>I am also conscious of the need to promote the consumption of Irish pigmeat in domestic and overseas markets. Bord Bia provides assistance to the pigmeat sector through its marketing and promotional activities, and the pigmeat quality assurance scheme helps to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and to expand its presence on EU and third country markets. <\/p><p>For my part I have undertaken to ensure that as many alternative markets as possible are open to Irish Pigmeat processors since the closure of the Russian market last year. In this regard I was pleased to announce the opening of the markets in Vietnam and the Philippines for Irish pigmeat which will serve as valuable alternative markets to Russia for Irish pigmeat exports. My Department will continue in its efforts to develop access to international markets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200083#WRZ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Functions","counter":1334,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200083#WRZ01500"},{"type":"question","counter":1335,"qnumday":563,"qnumall":"[32544\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200083#WRZ01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of internal audit across his Department; internal audit's relationship with external auditors and audit committees, as well as internal audit's adherence to professional standards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1034","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1336,"content":"<p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is committed to maintaining the highest standards of financial management and controls and to this end it is the policy of the Department to maintain and support a quality internal audit function.

Accordingly, the vetting process demands rigorous procedures to ensure its integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of the service.  Full vetting checks are conducted by the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available in respect of an individual is taken into account.  In respect of cases such as that which the Deputy raises the current procedures for vetting are designed to ensure the integrity of the system.  Once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original Garda Vetting Disclosure must be revised to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the Data Protection Acts, any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date.  The general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service.  Such procedures are in line with best practice internationally.<\/p>  <p>  There are, however, certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.  For example, persons involved in voluntary work may be doing work with more than one voluntary organisation at the same time, and may agree with the vetting applicant to share a single vetting disclosure.  Similar arrangements arise in the health sector in regard to persons working as locums, agency nurses or other temporary employees in a number of different organisations, or in the education sector where substitute teachers are on panels for substitute teaching in more than one school.<\/p>  <p>  The current average processing time for vetting applications is four weeks.

The objective of the review was to identify opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation. There were 12 station closures in County Kerry in 2012 and 2013 and Garda management inform me that the policing service provided by them to the Kerry Division through the restructuring of the Garda station network is delivering greater efficiencies in the deployment of personnel and other resources.  <\/p><p>I am further informed that the restructured station network continues to provide the necessary levels of policing services through a centralisation of services which in turn has facilitated the introduction of enhanced patrolling systems that are operational and intelligence led.  This helps ensure that a high visibility and community oriented policing service continues to be delivered throughout Divisions nationwide, including Kerry and yields the following benefits:<\/p><blockquote>-  Increased Garda visibility and patrol hours<br \/><br \/>-  Increased mobility and flexibility within an area resulting in an improved policing service to the public<br \/><br \/>-  Enhanced co-ordination of Garda activity resulting in a greater visibility and presence in the communities<br \/><br \/>-  More effective use of limited resources across a wider area<br \/><br \/>-  Continued Garda presence in communities<\/blockquote><p>In accordance with Section 22(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, any further organisation development initiatives will be outlined in future Policing Plans. <\/p><p>Figures provided for August 2015 for the same offence shows a Divisional figure of 36 Burglaries, which is a 43% decrease on the June figure of 63.  Of the 63 burglaries that occurred in June 2015, only two of these were committed in areas in which Garda Stations have closed &ndash; namely Moyvane and Cloghane.<\/p><p>I can assure the Deputy that tackling organised crime in all its guises is a key ongoing priority for both the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and this is clearly reflected in the Policing Plan for 2015.  Garda management advise that they are continuing to vigorously tackle organised crime through a range of targeted activities designed to disrupt and dismantle the operations of criminal organisations.  This includes the use of advanced analytical and intelligence methods in support of operations that enable early intervention and the prevention of such crimes.  <\/p><p>While we should not underestimate the difficulties which the Garda authorities face in tackling organised crime activity, we continue to see the significant results of their efforts in the arrests made and persons being brought before the Courts.<\/p><p>Finally I have been assured by the Garda authorities that local Garda Management closely monitors the allocation of all resources in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  In that regard, ten newly appointed Probationer Garda&iacute; have been allocated to the Kerry Division since May 2015.  As additional personnel and resources become available, the needs of the Kerry Division will continue to be reviewed within the context of the overall needs of the Garda organisation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200085#WRBB04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Accommodation Standards","counter":1481,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200085#WRBB04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1482,"qnumday":611,"qnumall":"[30747\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200085#WRBB04700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason she has not requested the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment to publish the report of its visit to prisons here in September 2014; if she will request immediate publication of same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1192","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1483,"content":"<p>I can confirm that the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) submitted its formal report on 18th March 2015 following its sixth visit to Ireland in September, 2014.

Local Garda&iacute; play a significant role in disrupting, preventing and detecting suspects and groups engaged in these criminal activities through focused and targeted roles and community policing initiatives including visible policing.

A multifaceted approach is being adopted including the following measures:<\/p><blockquote>-  establishing the Irish Refugee Protection Programme which will provide international protection for up to 4,000 persons overall under Resettlement and Relocation Programmes. It is expected that these numbers will be augmented by further family reunifications. The first arrivals under the Programme are expected by year end. The number of persons in need of international protection will be kept under review;<br \/><br \/>-  establishing a new cross-departmental Taskforce, chaired by my Department, to deal with the operational and logistical aspects of the support programme.  The Taskforce, which has already had its first meeting, will adopt a whole of Government approach and will work with NGOs, religious bodies, local authorities and the Red Cross to implement the Government's response to this crisis;<br \/><br \/>-  engaging with the public on their pledges of support. The Red Cross will lead this task;<br \/><br \/>-  establishing a network of Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres for the initial reception of those arriving under the relocation programme;<br \/><br \/>-  introduce the International Protection Bill as a major priority; and<br \/><br \/>-  providing an additional package of processing resources to deal with major increases in asylum and other immigration cases, including the relocation measure, preparation for the Single Protection application process and increased enforcement across a number of areas, including removals.<\/blockquote><p>The resettlement programme for those coming from mostly Lebanon and predetermined as refugees by the UNHCR has already commenced and the first Syrians have arrived. The first group of Relocation asylum seekers from Italy and Greece are expected to arrive later this year. Of the first overall allocation of 40,000 formally approved at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 14 September 2015, Ireland has agreed to take a total of 600.<\/p><p>Further discussions are ongoing at EU level and I will be attending a further emergency meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council today in advance of an EU Summit to be held tomorrow. At today's meeting it is hoped that agreement at EU level can be reached on the relocation of a further 120,000 asylum seekers from countries in Southern Europe.

The changes announced will address issues in the short term but also map out the longer term future for a licensing system which balances the rights of those who wish to pursue their interests with public safety, which has to be the paramount consideration.<\/p>  <p>  I have announced my intention to make fundamental long term reforms in this area by proposing legislation for a Firearms Assessment and Appeals Authority. The primary function of the Authority will be to determine, on the basis of an objective assessment of all the issues, with safety of the public being paramount, whether particular forms of firearms may be licensed in the State, whether there should be any limit on the number of such firearms and what safety conditions might properly be applied to their licensing.  Individual licensing decisions will continue to be made by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the light of the determinations made by the Authority but it is intended that the Authority will adjudicate on appeals from decisions by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This will offer an alternative to the current system of court appeals.<\/p>  <p>  I have signed secondary legislation re-defining what constitutes a non-restricted handgun. The purpose of this legislation is to ensure persons who currently hold licences for handguns will be able to reapply for a license in the current licensing round. This legislation will clarify for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na what firearms may be considered by them for licensing. <\/p>  <p>  I intend to monitor the number of 0.22 inch rim fire calibre handguns being licensed. In line with my commitment to prevent any proliferation of handgun availability in Ireland, if there is a significant increase in the number of applications for new certificates or import licence applications for these handguns, I will introduce priority legislation for a future cap. <\/p>  <p>  I have also introduced an immediate temporary cap on the licensing of any new centre-fire semi-automatic rifles pending the establishment and determination of the Authority. Legislation will provide for the revocation of any licences issued between 18 September 2015 and the enactment of the legislation. The current arrangements introduced in 2008 whereby no new licences will be issued for centre fire handguns will remain in place.<\/p>  <p>  I have also announced my intention to ask the Garda Inspectorate to review the administration of firearms licensing by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when the Firearms Assessment and Appeals Authority is in place for a period of 12 months.<\/p>  <p>  I also intend to re-establish the Firearms Consultative Panel to examine general issues of common concern which could include issues such as the establishment of a ballistic record of certain firearms, updated storage conditions for firearms and the reloading of ammunition.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Garda Commissioner intends to establish a centralised licensing system for restricted firearms, pending the establishment and determination of the Firearms Assessment and Appeals Authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200086#WRCC05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Anti-Social Behaviour","counter":1555,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200086#WRCC06000"},{"type":"question","counter":1556,"qnumday":634,"qnumall":"[31218\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200086#WRCC06100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the funding provided in each of the past three years and to date in 2015 in respect of CCTV monitoring anti-social activities in urban areas; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":1557,"qnumday":635,"qnumall":"[31219\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200086#WRCC06150","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to provide funding for a CCTV programme at junctions off the national motorways in view of concerns that persons exit the motorways and carry out crime in rural areas (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":1558,"qnumday":636,"qnumall":"[31220\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200086#WRCC06175","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to provide funding to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for CCTV monitoring for key locations in urban areas where there is anti-social behaviour with a view to the detection of crime, preventing crime and acting as a deterrent; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1559,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 634, 635 and 636 together.<\/p><p>CCTV systems installed for the purposes of crime prevention and as aids to policing in areas to which the general public routinely have access, such as town centres, fall into two distinct categories: Garda CCTV systems and community-based CCTV systems.  <\/p><p>Garda CCTV systems are planned and implemented on the basis of the identified operational needs and priorities of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Accordingly, decisions in relation to the introduction or extension of such systems are a matter for the Garda Commissioner.

In this regard the most recent information I have from the Garda Commissioner is that there are no plans to extend existing Garda CCTV systems at present.  The amount spent from within the Garda vote on Garda CCTV systems over the past three years is as follows:<\/p><blockquote>2012 - &euro;1.256m<br \/><br \/>2013 - &euro;1.200m<br \/><br \/>2014 - &euro;1.157m<br \/><br \/>2015 -&euro;0.696m (as at end of August 2015)<\/blockquote><p>As regards community-based CCTV, a scheme was launched in 2005 which provided financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of a local community CCTV system.  Two rounds of funding were advertised under that scheme, most recently in 2007.  All of the funding provided under the previous two rounds has been fully allocated.<\/p><p>I am, however, very conscious of the value that communities place on CCTV and with this in mind I am giving consideration to having a review of the effectiveness of current community schemes carried out in conjunction with the Garda authorities.

This process also takes account of the Law Reform Commission Report on the Limitation of Actions published in December 2011 (LRC 104 - 2011). In this Report, the Commission expressed the view that the principal legislation governing limitation of actions, the <i>Statute of Limitations 1957 <\/i>(as amended), is unnecessarily complex and in need of fundamental reform and simplification (Paragraph 1.21). The Commission made a series of recommendations in relation to enhancing the coherence of the broader limitation of actions regime including the introduction of a uniform two-year basic limitation period for common law actions.  The basic limitation period is recommended to run from the 'date of knowledge' of the plaintiff, which should be calculated by reference to the date on which the plaintiff first knew, or ought reasonably to have known, the salient and actionable points in relation to the injury, loss or damage in question (Paragraph 2.67). <\/p><p>It will also be recalled that, along with this ongoing process of consideration of the broader limitation of actions regime, the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act 2000 made important changes to the 1957 Statute of Limitations in relation to the bringing of an action arising from acts of sexual abuse done to a person while a child. As a result, the three-year limitation period in such cases does not start to run until the victim concerned has recovered sufficiently from the psychological injury to be able to decide whether to bring the action.<\/p><p>In my Department's ongoing consideration of the operation of the law in relation to the limitation of actions, be that at the broad systemic level or in relation to specific areas of action, the core objectives of the Law Reform Commission Report will continue to apply, namely, that &quot;a balance is struck between the competing rights of the plaintiff and the defendant, as well having regard to the public interest; in particular the right of the plaintiff of access to the courts and the right to litigate, the right of the defendant to a speedy trail and to fair procedures, as well as the public interest in the avoidance of delayed claims and the timely administration of justice.&quot; (Paragraph 1.85).  As part of the ongoing review of the operation of the law in relation to the Statute of Limitations at my Department I will, therefore, continue to take account of the Commission's recommendations and other relevant developments in the bringing forward of any future proposals for legislation in this area including, possibly, as part of any new programme of legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200086#WRCC08600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Accommodation Standards","counter":1576,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200086#WRCC08700"},{"type":"question","counter":1577,"qnumday":643,"qnumall":"[31411\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200086#WRCC08800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on whether standards in the E wing in Portlaoise Prison are acceptable; her plans for the damp and leaking cells, the continued practice of slopping out, the poor ventilation and the fact that there is no regular doctor on duty, which has caused a number of concerns among prisoners; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1192","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1578,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that the issue of eliminating slopping out within Portlaoise Prison has been included in the proposed 2017 refurbishment project for the prison.<\/p>  <p>  At present,  there are significant works in train to address water problems in the toilet areas including a deep clean of all areas affected by dampness and water leaks.

The primary objective of the programme was to identify opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation. In its review of the Garda Station Network that informed the rationalisation programme, Garda management concluded in relation to certain stations that Garda resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if those stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.  In reaching these conclusions, Garda management reviewed all aspects of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.   <\/p>  <p>  The Garda authorities advise me that policing services in all areas continue to be provided as required through the revised structures.  In addition, the  centralisation of services will facilitate the introduction of enhanced patrolling systems that will be operational and intelligence led.  This patrol system will ensure that a high visibility and community oriented policing service continues to be delivered throughout the country and will yield the following benefits:<\/p>  <p>-  Increased Garda visibility and patrol hours<\/p>  <p>-  Increased mobility and flexibility within an area resulting in an improved policing service to the public<\/p>  <p>-  Enhanced co-ordination of Garda activity resulting in a greater visibility and presence in the communities<\/p>  <p>-  More effective use of limited resources across a wider area<\/p>  <p>-  Continued Garda presence in communities.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to providing the best possible policing service to the people of Ireland within the resources available.

This can be extended until the completion of a course of education and training in which a young person who has left care, or is leaving care, is engaged, up to the age of 23 years.<\/p>  <p>  Section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991 provides that Tusla - the Child and Family Agency may assist a child leaving its care if it is satisfied that the person has a &ldquo;need for assistance&rdquo;. The provisions have been interpreted and applied on the basis that young people who have had a care history with the Agency are entitled to an assessment of need, from which an aftercare plan may be prepared and an aftercare service may be offered (based on the assessed needs).<\/p>  <p>  Current aftercare provision incorporates advice, guidance and practical (including accommodation and financial) support.  Advocating on behalf of young people to support their development as fulfilled adults in their community and, when necessary, to link them to targeted adult services, are also crucial elements of an aftercare service.  Accordingly, in instances where a young person leaving care has experienced trauma and\/or a developmental delay and is not yet ready to embrace independent living, due regard will be given within the aftercare planning process to linkages with appropriate, specialist, adult services.<\/p>  <p>  Between 450 and 500 young people leave care annually upon turning 18.  According to Tusla, at the end of March, 2015, there were 1,720 young people aged 18 to 22 years inclusive in receipt of an aftercare service.  Of those, 1,012 (59%) were in full time education.  <\/p>  <p>  A significant number of these young people are supported financially to remain living with their foster carers, in addition to having access to an aftercare worker.  The most vulnerable group of young people are those leaving residential care or short term foster care placements.  Children, who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that help them achieve good outcomes.  <\/p>  <p>  Young people who do not have family support from a foster carer or family base are assisted in finding accommodation in supported lodgings, sheltered housing or independent accommodation and encouraged and supported financially in furthering their training and education.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, in respect of my plans to amend Section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991, as the Deputy is aware, it has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare.  This is in response to concerns that there was insufficient focus in this area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis.  The approach adopted is to impose a statutory duty on the Child and Family Agency to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person.  The aim is to create an explicit, as opposed to implicit, statement of the Agency&rsquo;s duty to satisfy itself as to the child&rsquo;s or young person&rsquo;s need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports.<\/p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the Aftercare Bill will be published shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200089#WRFF03400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1686,"qnumday":683,"qnumall":"[31354\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200089#WRFF03600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will provide support to the Irish Network of Foster Carers in their efforts to protect vulnerable children (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1687,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the pre-legislative scrutiny process is designed to help improve legislation by allowing Oireachtas Committees to discuss the Heads of legislation at an early stage, to consider issues raised by stakeholders, and to prepare a short report for the relevant Minister.  While carried out on behalf of the Government Department responsible for the legislation, all such processes are conducted by the relevant Oireachtas Committees independent of the associated Departments.<\/p>  <p>  I have been advised by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children that the general process for pre-legislative scrutiny is that upon receiving the Heads of a Bill, the Committee receives a briefing paper \/ advice from the independent Library and Research Service, which includes suggestions with regard to the most appropriate approach for stakeholder consultation.  The Committee may also wish to invite stakeholders to discussions based on submissions and \/ or concerns already expressed.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children has assured me that it does not exclude any stakeholder from the consultation process.  <\/p>  <p>  Some 93% of children in State care today are cared for in foster homes, many of whom are supported to continue living with their foster parents after reaching 18 years of age.  Without doubt, the commitment and dedication demonstrated by foster carers towards the children in their care profoundly impacts the lives of those children as they become young adults and embark upon life after care.  As such, I recognise that the insights of those caring for them are extremely valuable and insights that I welcome.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the implementation of the National Leaving and Aftercare Policy, 2011, Tusla &ndash; the Child and Family Agency has advised me that the policy, which provides a framework for the delivery of aftercare services nationally, was signed off in April, 2011.  An implementation plan was developed outlining key work to be undertaken by Tusla in order to ensure full compliance with the National Leaving and Aftercare Policy.  That implementation plan has resulted in the introduction of several new practices, including the establishment of steering groups, the development of dedicated teams, and the standardisation of the aftercare allowance.  Tusla continues to review its current policy to reflect new legislative changes.  In so doing, Tusla will continue to work in partnership with agencies that represent the views of children in care and foster carers.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla is in the process of establishing full dedicated teams nationally along with operational steering groups in each area.  Tusla has also advised that at the end of March, this year, 78% of 18-22 years olds in receipt of an aftercare service had an aftercare plan while 81% had an aftercare worker.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of homelessness for care leavers, Tusla reports that at the end of March, 2015, the vast majority of 18-22 years olds in receipt of an aftercare service were residing in some form of stable accommodation.  In fact, 45% of those care leavers remained living with their foster carers, 23% were living independently, 11% returned home, 4% were living in supported lodgings and 5.5% were living in residential centres.  Only a small minority (11.5%) were living in other types of less stable accommodation.  While significant progress has already been made, work continues in my Department and Tusla to reduce the risk of vulnerable young care leavers finding themselves homeless or in unstable or unsuitable accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200089#WRFF03700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"After-School Support Services","counter":1688,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200089#WRFF03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1689,"qnumday":684,"qnumall":"[31588\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200089#WRFF03900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he is considering the introduction of any financial assistance for parents wishing to avail of the increasing number of out-of-hours care provision in primary schools in the upcoming budget; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"994","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1690,"qnumday":708,"qnumall":"[31583\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200089#WRFF04000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the steps he is taking to assist with the introduction of out-of-hours care services beginning to operate in schools; if he will consider bringing to Cabinet any financial incentives as part of Budget 2016 to further assist working parents with subscribing to such programmes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"994","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1691,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 684 and 708 together.<\/p>  <p>  My Department administers a number of programmes which provide after-school and out-of-school childcare, including: <\/p>  <p>  The After-School Childcare (ASCC) Programme, which provides after-school childcare for primary school children of eligible parents for a period of 52 weeks.

Advice, guidance, support and signposting are key elements of this service and these supports are available to all care leavers.  For those young people who are not in training or education, aftercare services have a key role in providing support to them in liaising with the relevant departments and agencies in accessing financial assistance, employment opportunities, training or supporting them to return to education.<\/p><p>I have been advised by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, that following consultation Tusla has introduced a Standardised National Aftercare Allowance for young people who have been in care for 12 months on their 16th birthday or for 12 consecutive months prior to their 18th birthday.  This weekly standardised allowance of &euro;300 per week ensures equality for all care leavers engaged in training and education.<\/p><p>This allowance is the first step in a phased development of aftercare services and will provide certainty and consistency for care leavers for the first time.  Each care leaver as part of their leaving and aftercare planning will have an Individual Financial Support Plan.  This plan forms part of an assessment of need which takes account of all sources of financial support from Tusla, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Social Protection and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p><p>The introduction of this aftercare allowance is a step in demonstrating Tusla's commitment to an aftercare service that offers consistent supports to ensure that young people leaving care and aftercare reach their potential in adult life.  <\/p><p>Tusla will issue a number of frequently asked questions in relation to this matter on its website, in the coming days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200090#WRGG01500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":1725,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200090#WRGG01600"},{"type":"question","counter":1726,"qnumday":697,"qnumall":"[30813\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200090#WRGG01700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if the proposals in the heads and General Scheme of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2015 will have any impact on the availability of birth certificates from the General Register Office, in view of the proposed statutory declaration requiring adopted persons to commit to not contacting their birth parents if they do not wish to be contacted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1727,"content":"<p>The Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2015 provides, that where an adoption was effected prior to the commencement of this Bill, the information required to apply for a Birth Certificate will  be provided to an adopted person, when they have signed a statutory declaration agreeing to respect the privacy of their birth parent and not to contact their birth parent or ask anyone else to make contact on their behalf.

It is this recognition that underpins both the current aftercare provision as well as the forthcoming Aftercare Bill.  Such awareness has been due to analyses of a range of reports, both State sanctioned and from a range of advocates for young people in and leaving care, and also as a result of my own Department&rsquo;s direct communication and research undertaken with young people in State care. <\/p>  <p>  Aftercare is a term used to describe the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person who is leaving statutory care at 18 years of age, to assist him\/her in making the transition to independent living.  It is essential that all young people leaving care are provided with the type of transitional support that their individual situation requires. Aftercare is available to all those eligible irrespective of which care sector they have been in i.e. foster care or residential care.<\/p>  <p>  The Child Care Act 1991 provides that the core eligible age range for aftercare is from 18 years up to 21 years.  This can be extended until the completion of a course of education and training in which a young person who has left care, or is leaving care, is engaged, up to the age of 23 years.<\/p>  <p>  Section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991 provides that the Child and Family Agency may assist a child leaving its care if it is satisfied that the person has a &ldquo;need for assistance&rdquo;. The provisions have been interpreted and applied on the basis that young people who have had a care history with the Agency are entitled to an assessment of need, from which an aftercare plan may be prepared and an aftercare service may be offered (based on the assessed needs).<\/p>  <p>  Current aftercare provision incorporates advice, guidance and practical (including accommodation and financial) support.  Advocating on behalf of young people to support their development as fulfilled adults in their community and, when necessary, to link them to targeted adult services, are also crucial elements of an aftercare service.<\/p>  <p>  Between 450 and 500 young people leave care annually upon turning 18.  According to Tusla - the Child and Family Agency, at the end of March, 2015, there were 1,720 young people aged 18 to 22 years inclusive in receipt of an aftercare service.  Of those, 1,012 (59%) were in full time education.  <\/p>  <p>  A significant number of these young people are supported financially to remain living with their foster carers, in addition to having access to an aftercare worker.  The most vulnerable group of young people are those leaving residential care or short term foster care placements.  Children, who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that help them achieve good outcomes.  <\/p>  <p>  Young people who do not have family support from a foster carer or family base are assisted in finding accommodation in supported lodgings, sheltered housing or independent accommodation and encouraged and supported financially in furthering their training and education.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, as the Deputy is aware, it has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare.  This is in response to concerns that there was insufficient focus in this area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis.  The approach adopted is to impose a statutory duty on the Child and Family Agency to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person.  The aim is to create an explicit, as opposed to implicit, statement of the Agency&rsquo;s duty to satisfy itself as to the child&rsquo;s or young person&rsquo;s need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports.<\/p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the Aftercare Bill will be published shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200090#WRGG03700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HIQA Reports","counter":1747,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200090#WRGG03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1748,"qnumday":704,"qnumall":"[31284\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200090#WRGG03900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the steps he has taken to address the issues identified in the HIQA report on the Ballydowd special care unit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1010","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1749,"content":"<p>The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) carried out an unannounced inspection of Ballydowd Special Care Unit on 10 and 15 July 2015 following a concern relating to the practice of single separation.  The Inspection Report was published on 31 August 2015.  In Ballydowd Special Care Unit, single separation means the removal of a child to a separate locked room for as short a period as possible during times of challenging behaviour which poses a significant risk to themselves or others. <\/p>  <p>  The inspection report indicated that decisions to initiate single separation generally complied with national guidance and that children's Guardians ad Litem and social workers were informed when they took place.  However, it found that the practice was used for excessive lengths of time in a small number of cases, record keeping and notification to senior management was inadequate and there was a poor response to complaints made by children regarding the events. <\/p>  <p>  Following on from the inspection HIQA requested an immediate review of single separation that lasted for excessive periods of time. The outcome of the review led to an improvement in authorisation of single separation to ensure it is for the shortest time necessary and also enhanced recording and information sharing. Incidents of single separation that are longer than three hours are to be escalated to senior management and  improvements have also been put in place to have single separation in Special Care reviewed as part of the national significant event notification system. <\/p>  <p>  Restrictive practices and children's rights has been placed as a standing item for Tusla Managers.  Significant issues are also to be reviewed with a focus on rights.  An action plan, approved by HIQA, to address the standards identified as requiring improvement and at significant risk was published with the report.

These include: more flexible rules regarding access to the free pre-school year, the provision on a limited ad hoc basis by the HSE of funding towards the cost of pre-school support assistants in some areas, elective modules on special needs in mandatory courses for early years practitioners, and various initiatives by City and County Childcare Committees, HSE\/HSE funded services, and by Better Start&rsquo;s Early Years Specialist Service to support providers who need expert advice and guidance.

Under the scheme, the Government then set up a range of payments of up to &euro;100,000 along with supports, for the women who worked in these institutions.  In his report, Mr Justice Quirke recommended, inter alia, that legislation be introduced to give effect to his recommendation on the provision of a comprehensive suite of health services to Magdalen women.  The Health (Amendment) Act 1996 provides health services to persons who contracted hepatitis C in the State from a blood product or blood transfusion.  It should be noted, however, that Judge Quirke&rsquo;s report acknowledged that the HAA services were reproduced for illustrative purposes and recognised that not all of the HAA services described may be relevant to the Magdalen women and that the scheme for the Magdalen women would require suitable adaptation.<\/p><p>Eligibility for health services for the Magdalen women is now provided by the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Act 2015 which sets out the primary and community health services available in Ireland, free of charge, effective from 1 July 2015.  Those services are as follows: GP services; prescribed drugs, medicines, aids and appliances; dental, ophthalmic and aural services; home nursing; home support; chiropody; physiotherapy; and counselling services.  As Justice Quirke recommended, the women are entitled to a greater range of entitlements than those provided under the standard medical card.  As a result, a specific card has been issued to the women so that they can access the enhanced health services they require without charge, as set out in the Act.<\/p><p>While the Quirke report did not make a recommendation that health services should be provided to women residing overseas, the Government has decided that practical administrative arrangements should be put in place to support women residing overseas for the same services.  The Department of Health and the HSE  are exploring the practical arrangements to be put in place for the overseas women as it is an important but complex matter.

In 2008, the then Government decided, in the light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  However, in light of legal advice following a ruling of the High Court, children born after 1 June 2002 are being treated by the Health Service executive as eligible to apply for an assessment under the Act.  Part 2 of the 2005 Act provides for an assessment of the needs of eligible applicants, occasioned by their disability, to be commenced within three months of receipt of an application and completed within a further three months.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process, given the number and complexity of cases, and has taken a number of measures to address the issue.  While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, it should be noted that the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.  The HSE has issued guidance to its staff that where there is a delay in the assessment process, this should not affect the delivery of necessary and appropriate interventions identified for a particular child.<\/p>  <p>  Following the publication of a National Disability Authority report commissioned by the Department of Health and the HSE, a major emphasis is being placed on reconfiguring children&rsquo;s disability services into integrated multi-disciplinary geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams under the HSE&rsquo;s Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme.  The key objective of this Programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities, including autism, and their families to services, regardless of where they live, where these children go to school or the nature of the individual child&rsquo;s difficulties.  Implementation of the Programme is a key priority for the HSE in 2015.  In 2014 an additional &euro;4 million was specifically allocated to drive implementation of the Programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts.  A further additional &euro;4m has been allocated to the Programme this year.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has requested the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy on the issues he has raised.

In addition, the HSE is planning to recruit over 500 nurses across a number of nursing disciplines.  There is significant work being undertaken to achieve this.  This includes recent and ongoing national and local interviewing of all categories of nurses and midwives.  The HSE has also developed an International Nurse Recruitment Project for filling posts.  This initiative is a targeted recruitment drive in the UK primarily focused on Irish trained nurses who left during the moratorium.  In order to facilitate this the services of a recruitment agency has been secured.  At least 90 interviews have taken place and over 30 posts have been offered to candidates.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a significant increase in the number of consultants (Whole Time Equivalents) since 1st January 2015:<\/p>  <p>  - 72 doctors have been nominated to hospital consultant posts, by the Public Appointment Service (this includes some doctors who were interviewed by the PAS in 2014), and<\/p>  <p>  - 65 doctors have accepted offers of contract (this includes some doctors who were offered contracts in 2014).<\/p>  <p>  The number of consultants has also grown significantly in recent years to 2,700.  This includes 700 more consultants in the last decade and 320 in the last five years, in spite of the economic crisis.  The Government is committed to future growth.  However, there are some specialties in which there is an international shortage and which have been traditionally difficult to fill, regardless of the salary scale.  There are also some hospitals to which it has historically been difficult to attract applicants, in particular smaller hospitals.  The establishment of Hospital Groups will help to address this difficulty, as this will allow doctors to be appointed as group resources.  The number of NCHDs has also increased significantly in recent years, by over 600 since the end of 2010, and now exceeds 5,000. This increase will help to address service needs and progress EWTD compliance, thereby improving the working conditions of doctors.<\/p>  <p>  The ability of the HSE and the health service to attract and retain high quality frontline staff shapes the extent to which the HSE can maintain and develop the range of health services required.  The MacCraith Group was established  to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structures.  The Group made a series of recommendations in its three reports aimed at improving the retention of medical graduates in the public health system and importantly, planning for future service needs.  The implementation of the Group's recommendations is being actively pursued and monitored.  It is noted in particular that revised pay rates for new entrant consultants, incorporating incremental credit for relevant experience and qualifications, were proposed by the LRC in January this year to address the barrier caused by the variation in rates of remuneration between new entrant consultants and their established peers that had emerged since 2012 and that these are now being implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200095#WRMM03800","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":2039,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200095#WRMM03900"},{"type":"question","counter":2040,"qnumday":801,"qnumall":"[30725\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200095#WRMM04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if consideration will be provided to restoring the mobility allowance in budget 2016; the cost in the years 2008 to 2013; the number of persons who benefited from the allowance in each of these years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In our statement of Health priorities for 2015, the Minister for Health and I have reiterated our commitment to implementing the Strategy.<\/p><p>The National Positive Ageing Strategy provides a vision for an age-friendly society and includes four National Goals and underpinning Objectives to provide direction on the issues that need to be addressed to promote positive ageing. As Minister of State with responsibility for older people, I am driving implementation at the political level. The Strategy is a cross-Departmental one and my Department has an overall coordinating and collating role and a more direct role for the health-related objectives.<\/p><p>A key objective of this Strategy is to change the mindsets of decision makers across Government agencies and to raise the priority that is given to the concerns of older people. The first step in doing this is to establish a system of regular reporting on actions and initiatives that impact on older people, and these reports are regularly sought and collated by my Department. The fact that such reports are already and will continue to be required will in itself increase the focus that is given to older persons' issues, and these reports will be submitted for consideration by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Sector Reform chaired by An Taoiseach.  Implementation is accordingly an ongoing process.<\/p><p>It is important to point out the many initiatives already in train which contribute to the Strategy's goals. For example, in the health sector, in the area of older people&rsquo;s services and supports, the Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme was published on 20th July 2015 and implementation of the recommendations contained therein will commence shortly.  The Single Assessment Tool, which will allow for a systematic assessment of need and allocation of services to older people, is being developed by the HSE; measures are being taken to ensure integrated care for older patients, and palliative care services are being improved. The Deputy will also be aware that &euro;25m<b><\/b>was allocated in Budget 2015 to support services that provide alternati  ves to, and relieve pressures on acute hospitals.  In April 2015, an additional &euro;74m was allocated to further tackle the ongoing issue of delayed discharges in acute hospitals. The majority of these patients are older people, and these funds are being applied across both long term and short term residential services and at community level.  As a result the waiting time for funding of approved patients under the Nursing Home Support scheme has fallen from 11 weeks to the previous norm of 4 weeks for the rest of the year.<\/p><p>A Healthy and Positive Ageing  Initiative (HaPAI) has also been established to implement the research objective of the National Positive Ageing Strategy. It is a joint initiative between the Department of Health, the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies and will run from October 2014 to December 2017, with a commitment to Department of Health funding for a further two years. The Initiative will monitor changes in older people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing linked to the Goals and Objectives of the Positive Ageing Strategy. This will be done primarily through the development of positive ageing indicators to be published every two years. A preliminary positive ageing report has been published and provides an overview of current evidence available on the lives of older people.The HSE will also develop a physical activity communications campaign under the Initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200097#WROO01600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Data","counter":2123,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200097#WROO01700"},{"type":"question","counter":2124,"qnumday":829,"qnumall":"[30833\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200097#WROO01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a breakdown in tabular form of funding allocated to home help in each county for the years 2011 to 2015.","asker":"1066","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":2125,"qnumday":830,"qnumall":"[30834\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200097#WROO01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a breakdown in tabular form of hours allocated for home help packages by county for the years 2011 to 2015.","asker":"1066","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":2126,"qnumday":831,"qnumall":"[30835\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200097#WROO02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide an update in respect of the Health Service Executive progressing a range of measures aimed at improving home care provision and if he will outline these measures and indicate the outcomes that have been measured to date.","asker":"1066","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":2127,"qnumday":832,"qnumall":"[30836\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200097#WROO02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide an update on the review of home care services undertaken; the stage which the review is at; and when it is expected to be completed.","asker":"1066","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2128,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 829 to 832, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>As these are service matters they have been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.

Additional funding of &euro;12 million, was allocated by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to meet the needs of around 1,500 young people who will require continuing health-funded supports on leaving school or rehabilitative training this year, of which &euro;6 million is available to provide services from September.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2015, a National Project Group was established by the HSE to develop and oversee a national process to responding to the needs of these young people and to ensure a consistent approach is taken across the country to meeting those needs.  This initially involved identifying all individuals who would require a day service in 2015.  Some young people with disabilities progress to vocational training, which is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills, or to further education, or employment and do not require a health-funded service.  Other young people attend mainstream schools and are not in contact with the health services until they require health-funded supports on leaving school.  Once individuals are identified and their individualised needs are assessed, the capacity of the existing services to meet those needs is determined.  It is not until this process is completed that the number, location and type of additional support needs and resources can be finalised.  <\/p>  <p>  Finding the resources and the physical capacity to meet the needs of a growing number of new service users every year is a challenging task.  When this year&rsquo;s support requirements were identified, the cost of meeting those needs in full exceeded the amount available, therefore, an additional &euro;1.5 million was added by the HSE to the overall allocation, making a total of &euro;13.5 million full-year costs available to meet those needs.  A further &euro;1.5 million once-off capital funding was also allocated by the HSE for the provision of suitable buildings, premises and accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  The approach adopted by the National Project Group from the outset was that a cost banding structure would be developed to inform the allocation of the available funds.  The costing bands were then applied to the identified need in each of the county&rsquo;s nine regions so that a nationally consistent approach would be applied, which was needs-based as opposed to population-based.  Based on this cost-band structure, five support levels were identified and the following amounts were allocated for new placements at each support level: intensive support (&euro;34,000); high (&euro;16,000); moderate (&euro;11,000); low (&euro;7,000) and minimum (&euro;5,000). <\/p>  <p>   Most young people have been offered a placement from September which meets their needs.  Only a small minority of placements remain to be finalised.  The HSE is in contact with these young people and their families in order to resolve matters as quickly as possible.  Over the coming weeks, the HSE will continue to actively work with service providers and families until placements are finalised for all young people at this important transition point in their lives and they will ensure that resources available for specialist disability services are used in the most effective manner possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200099#WRQQ03700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Policy Planning","counter":2245,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200099#WRQQ03800"},{"type":"question","counter":2246,"qnumday":879,"qnumall":"[30927\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200099#WRQQ03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his Department publishes all data available for the purposes of health policy planning; the format and location of where it is published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2247,"content":"<p>My Department publishes a broad range of health data on its website which can be accessed at and is available in a number of formats, including Excel.

There is only one licensed supplier of BCG vaccine to Ireland and to other countries within the EU.  <\/p>  <p>  The vaccine has not been available since the end of April 2015.  Babies born after the last day of April have not been immunised, this equates to approximately 5,500 babies a month, so around 24,000 to-date.  It is anticipated that the vaccine will be available near the end of the year so if vaccinations begin in January there will be approximately 44,000 babies to immunise.  The exact backlog will clearly be dependent on when the vaccine becomes available.<\/p>  <p>  Since this problem became apparent, the HSE National Immunisation Office has been in regular contact with the manufacturer of BCG and with the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) who licenses vaccines in Ireland as well as with other relevant stakeholders.  The HPRA have been seeking to find an alternative supply of BCG that meets safety, quality and effectiveness standards and that could be used in Ireland.  To date no appropriate alternative manufacturer of BCG vaccine has been found.<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA confirmed that it was contacted by an Irish company in August 2015, which advised that it could procure some Infant BCG Vaccine from InterVax in Ontario, Canada.  The HPRA highlights that the company InterVax is a distributor for this product rather than a manufacturer or marketing authorisation holder.  The vaccine in question is currently not authorised for use in Ireland.   <\/p>  <p>  The HPRA followed up with both the Irish company and contacts within the regulatory network.  The information which was made available to the HPRA in relation to this BCG vaccine was extremely limited and was not considered to be sufficient to allow for the assessment of the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicine.  Consequently, the HPRA was not in a position, without further data, to undertake a comprehensive review or to approve the use of this medicine (which is primarily used for the vaccination of infants) in Ireland.  The HPRA subsequently outlined its concerns to the Irish company involved, which acknowledged them.<\/p>  <p>  This company was also advised that should it submit a regulatory submission, providing the necessary data on this BCG vaccine, the HPRA would be happy to assess the medicine for safety, quality and efficacy, in an expedited timeframe.  The company indicated that it did not wish to pursue this option.<\/p>  <p>  In early 2015 the HSE asked the HPRA to look at extending the shelf life of BCG vaccine from 12 months to 18 months.  The HPRA reviewed the necessary documentation and agreed to extend the shelf life of any new delivery of BCG vaccine to 18 months.  Any new deliveries of BCG will have an 18 month shelf life.<\/p>  <p>  The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and the National TB Advisory Committee have recommended stopping routine BCG vaccination of newborn babies and instead provide a selective vaccination of babies in high-risk babies groups.  The Department of Health have requested the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to conduct a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) to review the implications of this change.  HIQA commenced a public consultation on proposed changes to the BCG vaccination programme in Ireland on September 9th 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Tuberculosis (TB) is a notifiable disease under the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 452 of 2011).  In 2014, 328 cases of TB were notified to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, giving a national TB notification rate of 7.1 per 100,000, the lowest rate reported since surveillance commenced.  According to the World Health Organisation, the definition of a low incidence TB country is one with a national TB notification rate of less than 10 cases per 100,000, Ireland is in this category.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland the number of cases of TB has been falling and there were no cases of TB in young children in 2014.  Most European countries, including the UK, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland do not give BCG vaccine to all babies.  Babies are not at risk of TB because of the delay in getting BCG vaccine in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Resolving the issue of the shortage of BCG remains a priority for the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200100#WRRR02200","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2273,"content":"<p>Question No. 886 answered with Question No. 885.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":2275,"qnumday":887,"qnumall":"[30962\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200100#WRRR02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of cases of TB that have occurred in the State each year for the past five years; the outcome for the patients concerned; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2276,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly.

It is also noteworthy that access to healthcare abroad under the Directive is based on patients following public patient pathways; that is, a referral is required in order to be eligible for reimbursement.  This referral is not limited to Irish health professionals but nevertheless the great majority of patients are likely to have consulted an Irish health professional who then referred them for treatment here or, if they wished, within the EU\\EEA.  As a consequence, a general information campaign regarding the Cross Border Healthcare Directive, Directive 201\/24\/EU, has not been undertaken.  It is also noteworthy that Recital 4 of the Directive states &ldquo;the transposition of this Directive into national legislation and its application should not result in patients being encouraged to receive treatment outside their Member State of affiliation&rdquo;.

Additional funding of &euro;12 million, of which &euro;6 million is available from September, was allocated by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to meet the needs of around 1,500 young people who will require continuing health-funded supports on leaving school or rehabilitative training this year. <\/p>  <p>  In January 2015, a National Project Group was established by the HSE to develop and oversee a national process to responding to the needs of these young people and to ensure a consistent approach is taken across the country to meeting those needs.  When this year&rsquo;s support requirements were identified, the cost of meeting those needs in full exceeded the amount available, therefore, an additional &euro;1.5 million was added by the HSE to the overall allocation, making a total of &euro;13.5 million full-year costs available to meet those needs.  A further &euro;1.5 million once-off capital funding was also allocated by the HSE for the provision of suitable buildings, premises and accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  The approach adopted by the National Project Group from the outset was that a cost banding structure would be developed to inform the allocation of the available funds.  The costing bands were then applied to the identified need in each of the county&rsquo;s nine regions so that a nationally consistent approach would be applied, which was needs-based as opposed to population-based.

The Minister for Health has no role in the day to day operations of any health insurance company. <\/p>  <p>  Minimum benefit is one of the key principles on which the Irish health insurance regulatory system is based. Minimum Benefit Regulations, made under the Health Insurance Acts, require insurers to provide a minimum benefit to every insured person. The key purpose of the Regulations is to ensure the continued availability of the type of broad hospital cover traditionally held as a minimum by the insured population and to ensure that individuals do not significantly under-insure. Minimum Benefit Regulations were introduced in 1996, under Section 10 of the Health Insurance Act, 1994 and cover in-patient, out-patient and day-patient services provided by publicly funded hospitals, private hospitals, registered nursing homes and hospital consultants. <\/p>  <p>  In the public hospital system, there is no statutory requirement for the HSE to provide Patient Transport Services (PTS). PTS are provided by the HSE on a discretionary basis as opposed to there being a mandatory requirement for provision. It is expected that, as a rule, patients should be in a position to make their own arrangements for journeys unless there are clear medical and\/or mobility factors involved. An individual who is transported from one hospital to another hospital for a specific treatment or care is transferred medical advice. It is not intended to amend the Minimum Benefit Regulations to require health insurers cover the cost of such transport. This is consistent with the treatment of a public patient, where no statutory charges apply for such a transfer. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200103#WRUU01100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service Provision","counter":2408,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200103#WRUU01200"},{"type":"question","counter":2409,"qnumday":942,"qnumall":"[31179\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200103#WRUU01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the amount of funding that was spent in County Kerry from January 2010 to January 2011, from January 2011 to January 2012, from January 2012 to 2013, from January 2013 to January 2014 on hiring private ambulances to transfer patients in public hospitals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":2410,"qnumday":944,"qnumall":"[31181\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200103#WRUU01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding community hospitals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2411,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 942 and 944 together.<\/p><p>As these are service matters, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

","asker":"1049","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2421,"content":"<p>Immunisation is regarded as one of the safest and most cost-effective of health care interventions.  International studies and scientific assessments suggest that the best way to prevent most disease due to human papillomavirus (HPV) is to vaccinate as many girls and women as possible.  The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school.  This is in accordance with the recommendation received from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) which indicated that the HPV vaccine should be offered on an annual basis to all girls aged 12.  The advice, based on public health considerations and supported by the cost-effectiveness analysis, is that HPV vaccines confer maximum benefit both individually and on a population basis if administered prior to HPV exposure.  <\/p><p>In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>is a medicinal product which has been authorised for use across the European Union since September 2006 following a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) at the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  With this authorisation, the vaccine can be marketed in all EU Member States.  Since first authorisation the HPRA has continuously monitored the safety of Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>.  This monitoring includes a review of global safety data in addition to national experience with use of the vaccine.  The EMA is responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the European Union.<\/p><p>While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  This is done by both monitoring of individual adverse reaction reports received by competent authorities across Europe (including the HPRA) and Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (i.e. license holder) for the vaccine on a regular basis.  The most recent EU review of cumulative global safety update data completed in December 2014 concluded that the benefit\/risk profile for Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>remains positive and concluded that no updates to the product information (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL)) were considered necessary.<\/p><p>Up to the 15 July 2015, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has received 901 reports of suspected adverse reactions\/events notified in association with the use of HPV vaccines (Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>899 and Cervarix<sup>&reg;<\/sup>2).  National monitoring experience has been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects known to occur with the vaccine, as outlined in the approved product information (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL)) for Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>.  The majority of the reports received to date involved events\/reactions related to injection site reactions, malaise, headache, myalgia, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms and skin reactions.  Vaccination related events such as dizziness and syncope (fainting) was also reported and would not be unexpected in this patient population.<\/p><p>Healthy Ireland, the Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013 - 2025, is the national Framework for action to improve the health and wellbeing of the population of Ireland over the coming generation.  Vaccination against HPV types 16 and 18, which protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults, is a long-term investment as the initial costs of vaccination will be offset by improved health outcomes and treatment savings 15 to 30 years in the future.<\/p><p>The vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.<\/p><p>In the trials that led to the approval of Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>and , these vaccines were found to provide nearly 100 percent protection against persistent infections with HPV types 16 and 18 and the cervical cell changes that these persistent infections can cause.<\/p><p>To date, protection against the targeted HPV types has been found to last for at least 8 years with Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>and at least 9 years with Cervarix<sup>&reg;<\/sup>.  Long-term studies of vaccine that are still in progress will help scientists better understand the total duration of protection.<\/p><p>The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is to evaluate data from a on the safety of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines, Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;<\/sup>.  The study conducted jointly by the French medicines agency (ANSM) and the French national health insurance fund (CNAMTS) compared the incidence of autoimmune conditions in girls given HPV vaccines with the incidence in girls not given the vaccines.  In the meantime, the EMA have advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of these vaccines.  Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;<\/sup>in accordance with the current product information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200103#WRUU02500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":2422,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200103#WRUU02600"},{"type":"question","counter":2423,"qnumday":947,"qnumall":"[31188\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200103#WRUU02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will review the application for a medical card by a person (details supplied) in Dublin 12; the other options open to the person; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

There are currently 3 adrenaline autoinjectors authorised and marketed in Ireland. Brands include Anapen&reg;, Epipen&reg; and Jext&reg;.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that there are shortages of supply of the adult preparations of all 3 brands at a wholesaler level. There may still be supplies within the system at a pharmacy level. Unfortunately, individual pharmacies and their patients may be experiencing difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has been working with the suppliers to try to restore continuity of supply. The HPRA employs a number of procedures which help to reduce the occurrence, impact and length of medicines shortages.  One such mechanism, used in the case of adrenaline autoinjectors, is to facilitate Batch Specific Requests (BSRs). BSRs enable the company to temporarily supply, essentially identical, medicines from other countries to the Irish market to alleviate shortages. BSRs are typically processed within 24 hours of submission by a company to the HPRA.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the HPRA is working with the companies concerned to facilitate the provision of further stock in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Adrenaline autoinjectors are complex systems due to both the characteristics of the adrenaline active substance, which is chemically unstable, and of the delivery device, which is designed to be as patient friendly as possible. The manufacture of these products is also complex. For these reasons supply shortages can occur from time to time.<\/p>  <p>  The availability is also impacted by the shelf life of these 3 autoinjector products (which ranges from 18 to 24 months). This is short compared to some other medicinal products.<\/p>  <p>  The HPRA has recently granted a Marketing Authorisation (MA) for a fourth adrenaline autoinjector, Emerade&reg;. This has a 3 year shelf life. The HPRA is proactively working to ensure that supplies of this product can be made available as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  There is no franchise, per se, for supply of adrenaline autoinjectors in Ireland. Each of the 4 products referred to above is the subject of a separate MA, granted by the HPRA, which entitles the holder to place the product on the Irish market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200106#WRXX00700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":2552,"qnumday":999,"qnumall":"[31428\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200106#WRXX00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"to set out the status of the promised legislation regarding availability of epinephrine injectors for anaphylaxis in view of the fact he stated nine months ago that this issue may be resolved within a six-month period; and if he will indicate a clear timeframe for this legislation.","asker":"1066","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2553,"content":"<p>Earlier this year I launched a review to explore how we might make certain prescription only medicines more available for use in emergency situations.

It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable. It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences.  Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need. Patients with the greatest level of need i.e. Grade 5 or Grade 4 are provided with treatment by the HSE.

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Intellectual Disability; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI scheme.  Under the LTI scheme, persons suffering from these prescribed conditions are provided free of charge with the drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances required for the specific treatment of those conditions. Drugs and medicines required for other associated conditions are not covered under the scheme.  <\/p><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme is a system of financial support for those in need of long-term nursing home care.  Participants contribute according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.<\/p><p>Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held. In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets.  The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment.  The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care.<\/p><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme has a number of important safeguards built into the financial assessment which ensures that:-<\/p><p>- Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care;<\/p><p>- An applicant will keep a personal allowance of 20% of his\/her income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;<\/p><p>- If an applicant has a spouse\/partner remaining at home, he\/she will be left with 50% of the couple&rsquo;s income or the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;<\/p><p>- If both members of a couple enter nursing home care, they each retain at least 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is greater;<\/p><p>- Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account for the financial assessment, including health expenses, payments required by law, rent payments and borrowings in respect of a person&rsquo;s principal private residence;<\/p><p>- A person&rsquo;s eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drug Payment Scheme, is unaffected by participation in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme or residence in a nursing home.<\/p><p>In addition to these safeguards, where an applicant&rsquo;s assets include land and property held in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate.  A nursing home resident can apply for this deferral at any stage.<\/p><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme covers the cost of the standard components of residential care which are:<\/p><p>- Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;<\/p><p>- Bed and board<\/p><p>- Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living<\/p><p>- Laundry service<\/p><p>A person&rsquo;s financial assessment can be reviewed, at their request, if 12 months have passed since the initial financial assessment or the most recent review, or if the HSE is satisfied that there has been a material change to the person&rsquo;s financial circumstances.<\/p><p>The applicant&rsquo;s local HSE Nursing Homes Support Office will be able to provide further details in relation to the financial review process (HSE Nursing Homes Support Office, Oak House, Millennium Park, Naas, Co.

In accordance with the Act, the assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants. <\/p>  <p>  Following publication of the Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility and the Medical Card Process Review in November 2014, Minister Varadkar and I announced a series of measures to enhance the operation of the medical card scheme and make it more sensitive to people&rsquo;s needs. These included changes to the governance and organisational structure of the medical card assessment function within the HSE to increase the focus on customer service in the assessment process. The HSE  has also taken steps to ensure greater interaction between the medical card central assessment office and the Local Health Office and\/or Primary Care Team to see if there are further circumstances or needs that would support a medical card application, and to ensure that assistance is provided to meet the individual's needs as far as possible (where they don't have a medical card). <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold, where deemed appropriate. Where the HSE invokes discretion, they must do so in a consistent manner and are cognisant of the potential range of circumstances that might prevail in individual cases. The relevant factors in assessing undue hardship may require the HSE to take a number of issues into account and may require the applicant, or the HSE, on behalf of the applicant to interact with a number of sources to establish eligibility which may often be a timely process.  The HSE guidelines governing the application of discretion were developed to ensure that fairness and equity is applied to all applicants under these schemes in accordance with the legislation and endeavours to ensure that all persons who are entitled to a medical card or a GP visit card, are facilitated to avail of their entitlement. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE is exercising greater discretion, as is evident in the increase in the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation - by about 76% - from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 92,000 at the end of August this year. <\/p>  <p>  Also as part of the reform, a Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) was established by the Director General of the HSE to provide clinical oversight and guidance to the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system. The Group is working on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions, so as to take account of the burden involved and the needs arising from the condition and to ensure that appropriate services are provided to people who need them.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200114#WRFFF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Provision","counter":2972,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200114#WRFFF00750"},{"type":"question","counter":2973,"qnumday":1153,"qnumall":"[32330\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200114#WRFFF00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding an application for a hearing aid by a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2974,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.

The &lsquo;Addis Ababa Action Agenda&rsquo; specifically welcomed the decision by the European Union to affirm its collective commitment to those targets.  <\/p>  <p>  The Addis agreement, together with the very successful agreement at the UN on new Sustainable Development Goals, which will be formally adopted by world leaders in New York this week, and the agreement currently being negotiated under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), have the potential to transform the approach to sustainable development globally and end extreme poverty and hunger in our lifetime.   We are currently at an advanced stage of the 2016 Estimates process.  While final allocations for Budget 2016 are ultimately a matter for Government, I can assure the Deputy that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and I will be making the strongest possible case for an increase in the allocation to Official Development Assistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200114#WRFFF02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consular Services Representations","counter":2996,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200114#WRFFF02450"},{"type":"question","counter":2997,"qnumday":1161,"qnumall":"[30431\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200114#WRFFF02500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will support a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1055"},{"type":"question","counter":2998,"qnumday":1163,"qnumall":"[30440\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200114#WRFFF02600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the assistance and consular services made available to a person (details supplied) from County Cork who has been sentenced to 12 years in jail in the Philippines, and how he proposes to assist this person who claims to be the victim of a miscarriage of justice.","asker":"1192","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":2999,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1161 and 1163 together. <\/p><p>The Embassy of Ireland in Singapore, which is accredited to the Philippines, as well as the Honorary Consulate General in Manila and the Consular Assistance Unit of my Department in Dublin have provided ongoing assistance to this citizen and their family since July 2013.

I also raised a number of specific cases with the Vice-Minister.  Officers from our Embassy in Mexico regularly discuss human rights issues with government interlocutors during their visits to Colombia and meet with international and local civil society organisations working on human rights issues there, including on environmental rights. <\/p>  <p>  Irish Aid provides funding to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia which is specifically targeted to their work in the south-west of Colombia. The Embassy of Ireland in Mexico also oversees Irish Aid funding to a number of civil society organisations in Colombia, with a focus on the protection of human rights defenders and raising awareness of violations.  <\/p>  <p>  Human rights in Colombia are a major concern for the EU, including Ireland and other member states, and are addressed in detail in the context of the EU-Colombia Human Rights Dialogue. Through this mechanism, which addresses the subject directly with the Colombian authorities at official level, the EU engages in a structured manner across the full range of human rights issues, including human rights defenders and trade unionists, prisoners, land restitution and environmental issues.  I believe that our policy of regular engagement, dialogue, and scrutiny within this structured framework is the best way to promote human rights in Colombia.<\/p>  <p>  The EU-Colombia\/Peru Free Trade Agreement contains mechanisms for stakeholder consultation in relation to initiatives that could have consequences for labour and\/or the environment.

Through the formal framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, which was established in 1995, the EU continues to share with China its experience in the field of human rights protection and promotion, and to urge China to take clear steps to improve the human rights situation.  The latest session of this dialogue took place on 8-9 December 2014 and provided the EU with the opportunity to express its concerns about a wide range of human rights issues in China, including the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities, deprivation of liberty, and criminal and administrative punishment. The next round of the Dialogue is due to take place in November 2015, and this will allow the EU to raise matters of concern.  In 2013, officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade held a series of meetings with representatives of the Irish Falun Dafa Association and human rights lawyers.

There are now more than 59 million people globally who have been displaced, more than at any time since the Second World War.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is firmly committed to responding to the humanitarian needs of those affected by these crises.  Since 2012, the Government has contributed over &euro;24 million in flexible funding to UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, to support its critical work in safe-guarding the rights and well-being of refugees worldwide.  This is in addition to the targeted assistance Ireland provides in response to specific severe crises.  So far in 2015, our humanitarian support has reached people in South Sudan, Somalia, Central African Republic, and Yemen, among other places. Ireland has a particular commitment to &lsquo;forgotten crises&rsquo;, which may not receive much media attention but where the humanitarian needs are chronic. <\/p>  <p>  Our most significant humanitarian contribution in recent years has been for people affected by the appalling conflict in Syria.  The ongoing war in Syria, which is now in its fifth year, has created the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian crisis.  Some 240,000 Syrians have been killed, 7.6 million are displaced within Syria, and over 4 million have had to leave the country in search of safety.  Some 12.2 million people, over half of Syria&rsquo;s population, are in need of humanitarian assistance.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is particularly mindful of the impact of the crisis on Syria&rsquo;s immediate neighbours &ndash; Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq &ndash; which have been generous hosts to hundreds of thousands of desperate people, putting huge strain on their own resources. <\/p>  <p>  We have been supporting efforts to assist refugees affected by the Syria crisis since 2012.  At the &ldquo;Kuwait III&rdquo; Pledging Conference in March 2015, Ireland pledged &euro;12 million in humanitarian assistance for the Syrian crisis this year.  Since 2012, Ireland has provided over &euro;37 million in support for the Syrian people both within Syria and in neighbouring countries.  The fulfilment of our 2015 pledge will bring that total to &euro;41 million by the end of this year.  Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian aid is implemented by our UN, NGO and Red Cross partners, and has helped to provide food, shelter and medical care to those who need it.  I am very conscious of the difficult living conditions of Syrian refugees and displaced people, and I am determined that Ireland will continue to provide appropriate humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people over the next year. <\/p>  <p>  With so many humanitarian emergencies, of such size and severity, the effort to provide sufficient relief to those who need it has become an overwhelming global challenge.  The World Humanitarian Summit, which the UN Secretary General has convened for May 2016 in Istanbul, will examine how the world can respond more effectively.  Ireland is already playing a significant international role in preparing for this crucial Summit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200115#WRGGG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Syrian Conflict","counter":3026,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200115#WRGGG01350"},{"type":"question","counter":3027,"qnumday":1171,"qnumall":"[31477\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200115#WRGGG01400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on possible military action by European states in Syria; if he will oppose this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The cost of the scheme was some &euro;172 million in 2014 which included grant payments, payments for escorts to accompany children with special educational needs as well as the cost of direct school transport services.  In 2014 a total of &euro;4.3 million in savings was achieved in the reorganisation of services.  However, in the same year 274 new services and 561 other service enhancements were approved by my Department - which added &euro;8 million to the cost of the scheme over a full year.  Most of the new services were introduced to cater for children with special educational needs.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Bus &Eacute;ireann is responsible for the procurement of contractors to provide transport services under the School Transport Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the tendering procedure used by the Company for the provision of school transport services is a competitive procurement process conducted in accordance with the negotiated procedure under Directive 2004\/17\/EC.  Tenders are evaluated on the basis of the award criteria and scoring tables.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is satisfied that the current \/ Price \/ Quality ratio of 60% \/ 40% is appropriate for the school transport tender process.  Due to the nature, volume and complexities of the School Transport Scheme, there is a requirement to establish panels of suitably pre-qualified potential service providers in each School Transport local office so that they may be invited to tender for the provision of services on School Transport Scheme routes in an efficient and effective manner.  Five year contracts are awarded, providing additional security to contractors where previously contracts terminated at the end of each school year.  Qualification to each Panel each year is also for a 5 year period where heretofore it was for 1 year.  Each office follows the procedures set out by Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s Procurement Department in the conduct of the tendering arrangements nationally.<\/p>  <p>  Almost 90% of the vehicles used to deliver school transport services are provided by private operators under contract to Bus &Eacute;ireann, which consist predominantly of smaller vehicles - and includes over 800 taxis.  Bus &Eacute;ireann uses large capacity school buses found mainly on services to primary and post primary schools.  The Bus &Eacute;ireann school bus fleet is also used as a safety net to maintain full service coverage and to provide a strategic balance between public and privately owned services on behalf of the State.<\/p>  <p>  The Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme, conducted by an Inter-Departmental Committee and published in 2011, recommended that Bus &Eacute;ireann should continue to be the national organiser of the scheme and concluded that &ldquo;no existing organisation is operating in Ireland with the range of expertise in place, other than Bus &Eacute;ireann.&rdquo;  <\/p>  <p>  All Bus &Eacute;ireann buses and those owned by operators contracted by Bus &Eacute;ireann are required to have a valid annual roadworthiness test certificate in order to be used to provide school transport services.  The inspections conducted by Freight Transport Association on behalf of the Company complement the annual statutory vehicle examinations as an additional measure designed to ensure that vehicles and maintenance records are maintained to appropriate standards, consistent with RSA guidelines, in the period between annual statutory tests taking place.  These vehicle inspections assess vehicle condition, safety, and maintenance standards of both Bus &Eacute;ireann buses and buses owned by private operators employed as Contractors to provide services under the School Transport Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann school transport vehicles are generally maintained within a 20 year age limit and the Company is in the process of procuring an additional 20 school buses for delivery in 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200115#WRGGG06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1078"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Provision","counter":3089,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200116#WRHHH00150"},{"type":"question","counter":3090,"qnumday":1193,"qnumall":"[32066\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200116#WRHHH00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if school transport will be provided to an individual (details supplied) in County Kilkenny, who currently cannot attain a place on a school bus from their locality to their school; her views that in light of this case, sufficient school transport arrangements are in place across the country for secondary school students, particularly outside Dublin; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1204","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":3091,"content":"<p>Under the terms of my Department's Post Primary School Transport Scheme children are eligible for school transport where they reside not less than 4.8 kilometers from and are attending their nearest education centre as determined by my Department\/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.

This rationale has been adopted as it is the basis of the ECtHR judgment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200116#WRHHH02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3118,"content":"<p>Question No. 1203 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"University Legal Fees","counter":3120,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200117#WRJJJJJ01250"},{"type":"question","counter":3121,"qnumday":1204,"qnumall":"[30576\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200117#WRJJJJJ02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the legal costs to date of University College Dublin in Record No. 2006\/07275 (Circuit Court) and Record No. 2007 52 CA (High Court).","asker":"1011","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":3122,"content":"<p>University College Dublin is a party to ongoing litigation arising from and in connection with these named proceedings.

This resource was allocated in accordance with pupil enrolment. 42% of second-level schools at the time were allocated at least 22 hours per week in respect of guidance (22 hours being the equivalent of one teaching post) while the remainder of the schools were allocated between 8 and 17 hours of guidance per week.<\/p><p>  Since September 2012 at post primary level guidance provision is organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. Guidance is a whole school activity and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students. This operates at local school level and therefore the detailed information requested by the Deputies is not available centrally within my Department. <\/p><p>  The net reduction in guidance provision as a consequence of this budget measure was of the order of 500 posts. The annual budget saving from this measure is over &euro;30 million. This gives an indication of the cost involved if this budget measure was not in place. The Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations.<\/p><p>  The representative organisations for School Principals and school management developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation.  This approach puts a greater emphasis on group-work and class-based activity at senior cycle and maximises the amount of time available for those pupils that need one to one support. <\/p><p>  There are also a range of other supports available to promote and support the wellbeing of students. NEPS psychologists are available to offer their advice and support to schools in establishing and developing School Support Teams. The extension of the NEPS service to all mainstream schools since September 2013 also puts it in a good position to provide advice to the Teams in regard to students with particular difficulties and on onward referral or liaison with other community based services that also have a role in providing service to schools. Student Support Teams in Post-Primary Schools (DES 2014) is a NEPS booklet to promote the well-being of pupils in post-primary schools.<\/p><p>  Wellbeing Guidelines for Post-Primary and for Primary Schools have been produced by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. The guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of current research. They provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour. <\/p><p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE, Health Promoting Schools Process. Information is also provided on how to access support from the SPHE Support Service and other external agencies and support services.<\/p><p>  It should also be noted that the proposals on the reform of the junior cycle envisage a new subject on &quot;wellbeing&quot; being studied by all pupils.<\/p><p>  I have no plans to return to a situation where there would be a separate allocation for guidance in schools. If economic recovery continues I hope the Government will be in a position to improve the standard staffing allocation to schools. However, I believe that it is desirable to give schools discretion on how to use those increased resources.<\/p><p>  Enhancing supports for schools, including guidance, are among a number of issues raised in discussion with me as priorities within the school sector. The last Budget included an increase in spending on education for the first time in recent years, amounting to additional funding of &euro;60 million during 2015. <\/p><p>  I am determined that education should be prioritised for investment as our economy recovers and I will be seeking to agree a set of priorities for such increased investment into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200120#WRMMMM01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3296,"content":"<p>Question No. 1274 answered with Question No. 1237.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Abuse","counter":3297,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200120#WRMMMM01650"},{"type":"question","counter":3298,"qnumday":1275,"qnumall":"[31343\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200120#WRMMMM01700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will provide a response to matters (details supplied) raised by persons who have taken cases having been victims of abuse in schools here.","asker":"984","askee":"1061"},{"type":"question","counter":3299,"qnumday":1276,"qnumall":"[31344\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200120#WRMMMM01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she is aware that since a ruling on the case of a person (details supplied) the State Solicitor has rejected cases similar to theirs; and the reason this has happened.","asker":"984","askee":"1061"},{"type":"question","counter":3300,"qnumday":1277,"qnumall":"[31345\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200120#WRMMMM01900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of settlements offered by the State to cases coming within the terms of the European Court of Human Rights decision in a case (details supplied); the number of cases currently being considered by the State Claims Agency where there was a prior complaint about a teacher concerned; and the number of cases previously being pursued that were originally dropped.","asker":"984","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":3301,"content":"<p>I propose to take questions Nos. 1275 to 1277, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  In its response to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) judgment, the Government agreed in December 2014 that out of court settlements be offered in those extant cases of school child sexual abuse being brought against the State where the cases come within the terms of the ECtHR judgment and satisfy the Statute of Limitations. In this regard, the State Claims Agency (SCA) has made settlement offers in 7 of the 35 cases and has written to the other 28 litigants advising that the circumstances do not appear to come within the parameters of the judgement and inviting them to revert with any contrary evidence. Where a litigant does not accept the offer in settlement of his\/her case or where the SCA is not satisfied that the case comes within the terms of the judgment, the case will proceed before the domestic Courts. <\/p><p>Subsequently, in July of this year, the Government approved proposals to offer ex-gratia payments up to a maximum of &euro;84,000 to those who initiated legal proceedings in cases of school child sexual abuse against the State but who subsequently discontinued their claims against the State where, similarly, the circumstances of the claims come within the terms of the ECtHR judgment and where the claims were not statute barred prior to the proceedings being discontinued.  It is not possible to assess at this stage how many cases in this category will satisfy these criteria. Persons who believe that their cases come within the criteria can contact the SCA and provide supporting evidence. Where there is a disagreement between the SCA and the individual as to whether their circumstances come within the terms of the ECtHR judgment, provision will be made for the application to be reviewed by an independent assessor.In cases where settlements are agreed, the State will pay, in addition to the settlement amount, such reasonable costs as agreed by the SCA. In the context of settling abuse victim compensation claims, the SCA has advised that it is not its practice to seek to impose a confidentiality clause on Plaintiffs in abuse related cases. In offering these settlements, the State will not be covering the liabilities of the perpetrators, school managers or patrons or other co-defendants.<\/p><p>To be eligible for the above settlement or payment arrangements, cases must involve sexual abuse of a school child by a primary or second level school employee in respect of whom there was a prior complaint of sexual abuse to a school authority (including an authority of a school in which the teacher had previously taught), prior to the issue of the Department of Education guidelines to primary and post-primary schools in 1991 and 1992 respectively. This rationale has been adopted as it is the basis of the ECtHR judgment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200120#WRMMMM02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3302,"content":"<p>Question No. 1278 answered with Question No. 1250.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Administration","counter":3303,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200120#WRMMMM02150"},{"type":"question","counter":3304,"qnumday":1279,"qnumall":"[31365\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200120#WRMMMM02200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of school bus services that were due to be withdrawn this year and where the decision was reversed due to the fact that adequate formal notice was not provided in relation to the withdrawal of the service for the year 2015 to 2016; the schools in question, providing the name and full postal address of each school; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":3305,"content":"<p>Under the terms of my Department's Primary and Post Primary School Transport Scheme a minimum number of 10 eligible children residing in a distinct locality, as determined by Bus &Eacute;ireann, are required before consideration may be given to the establishment or retention of school transport services, provided this can be done within reasonable cost limits. <\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that an Island service which had fallen below this minimum number requirement was retained for the 2015\/16 school year as it was felt that families did not receive sufficient notice regarding this withdrawal; Bus &Eacute;ireann has confirmed that this was the only service retained on this basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200120#WRMMMM02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1078"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Data","counter":3307,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200121#WRNNN00150"},{"type":"question","counter":3308,"qnumday":1280,"qnumall":"[31394\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200121#WRNNN00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the level of participation of men and women, respectively, in third level education in each of the past ten years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1006","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":3309,"content":"<p>The table contained in the attached document outlines the proportion of undergraduate new entrants to higher education from 2005\/06 to 2014\/15 by gender.

The Department adopts a holistic and integrated approach to supporting the work of schools in promoting positive mental health and to supporting those with a broad range of problems, behavioural emotional and social. <\/p>  <p>  The process spans the curriculum in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care and the provision of professional development for teachers. It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and guidance and counselling services, and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally. <\/p>  <p>  Schools are assisted by Well-Being in Post-Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2012), which was developed to implement Action 2.1 of Reach Out: the National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention 2005-2014 (HSE, 2005).<\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines are for all members of the school community, boards of management and in-school management teams who play a central leadership role in mental health promotion. They are also useful for parents' associations, student councils, health and other personnel who are seeking an understanding of how to work in and with schools.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important that this message is conveyed to pupils at an early age.  To this end, Wellbeing Guidelines for Primary Schools have been recently produced by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. The guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of current research. They provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in primary schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE, Health Promoting Schools Process. Information is also provided on how to access support from the SPHE Support Service and other external agencies and support services.<\/p>  <p>  The new Framework for Junior Cycle (2015) also places a clear emphasis on overall student health and well-being. This Framework is underpinned by eight principles, one of which is \"Well-being\". It also has eight key skills which are to be embedded in every new Junior Cycle subject and short course including the key skills of \"Managing Myself\" and \"Staying Well\". In addition, the 24 'Statements of Learning' that a student should experience during their Junior Cycle programme involve the student taking action to safeguard and promote their own well-being and that of others.<\/p>  <p>  One of the innovative features of the Junior Cycle Framework is the introduction of short courses that schools can choose to implement. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) has developed a new short course in SPHE, which may be delivered for certification purposes and will involve an increase in the time allocation for SPHE at Junior Cycle up to 100 hours over the three year cycle. The new short course is now available to implement in post-primary schools, should they wish to do so, as part of their Junior Cycle programme. It includes strands such as \"Minding Myself and Others\" and \"My Mental Health\", and deals with issues such as mental health and mental ill-health, dealing with tough times, loss and bereavement. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also working with the Department of Health to promote participation by primary and post-primary schools in the 'Health Promoting Schools' initiative, which is supported by the Department of Health. This European-wide programme aims to strengthen schools' capacity to be a healthy setting for learning and working by focusing at whole-school level on all the conditions that affect health and well-being.<\/p>  <p>  All schools are required to develop and implement a Relationships and Sexuality (RSE) programme at junior cycle and senior cycle in post-primary schools. RSE includes the acquisition of knowledge and understanding, and the development of attitudes, beliefs and values about relationships, sexual identity and intimacy, and includes the topics of pregnancy, and unplanned pregnancy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200122#WROOO03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Patronage","counter":3408,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200122#WROOO03450"},{"type":"question","counter":3409,"qnumday":1318,"qnumall":"[31874\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200122#WROOO03500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if and when the necessary steps will be taken to enable the education and training boards to become patrons for community national schools.","asker":"980","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":3410,"content":"<p>Community National Schools (CNSs) represent a new policy initiative approved by Government to deal with increasing societal diversity and demand for greater choice in education provision at primary school level in Ireland.

The agreement reached between the parties found expression in the two circular letters issued in 2005 detailing the contracts of employment for SNAs.<\/p><p>Links to the SNA Contracts of Employment are as follows:<\/p><p>Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 12\/05 (Post-Primary) <\/p><p>Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 15\/05 (Primary)  <\/p><p>This contract of employment is augmented by all of the relevant Departmental Circulars governing Special Needs Assistants which detail the standardised terms and conditions of employment for SNAs. These Circulars are amended and new Circulars are issued by the Minister for Education and Skills from time to time.<\/p><p>The position regarding the working hours of full-time SNAs is as outlined in these standard SNA contracts of employment. In that context, the standard SNA contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools. No set hours were agreed but instead full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc. These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school. <\/p><p>In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total. Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days. <\/p><p>Accordingly, DES Circular 71\/2011 was issued on 15 December 2011 which outlined that these 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and\/or the normal school year. <\/p><p>Link to DES Circular 71\/2011 is as follows:<\/p><p>SNAs who are employed in a part-time capacity are paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment. Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours. I should point out that this divisor was also agreed with both the Management Authorities and the Trade Unions (IMPACT and SIPTU) that represent SNAs.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the contract of employment for SNAs in the post primary sector specifically requires that SNAs in the post primary sector are required to work the month of June.<\/p><p>Turning to the specific query regarding that of an SNA employed on an Infant day.  An Infant day is regarded as being 0.83 of a full-time SNA position.  Accordingly, SNAs employed on an Infant Day basis are paid 0.83 of a full-time SNA salary and similar to full-time SNAs are obliged to work the full Infant hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school.  Similar to all SNAs these times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school. <\/p><p>However, if any SNA believes that the working hours as laid out by their employer are not in line with the nationally agreed contracts for an SNA, then that is a matter that they should raise directly with their employer (the school\/ETB).  If an SNA remains unhappy with the response received from their employer, then the Department has implemented a nationally agreed set of Grievance procedures for SNAs (DES Circular 72\/2011) which can be invoked by an SNA with their employer where matters such as this are in dispute.  <\/p><p>Link to DES Circular 72\/2011 is as follows:<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200124#WRQQQ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"question","counter":3476,"qnumday":1341,"qnumall":"[32142\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200124#WRQQQ01000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her views on concerns expressed regarding circular 0041\/15 (details supplied).","asker":"1192","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":3477,"content":"<p>Firstly, I am pleased to inform you that my Department recently received approval for an additional 610 Special Needs Assistant (SNA) SNA posts from September 2015 to reflect the Government's commitment to ensure that every child with an assessed need has access to a SNA.  This is an important principle and will continue in the 2015\/16 school year.  This increase in SNA posts is in addition to the additional 220 SNA posts for 2015 already provided for last autumn.  The overall result of this is that from September 2015 there will be 11,820 whole-time SNA posts available in our primary and post-primary schools.

This was done with a view to addressing the issue of casualisation of employment amongst SNAs.<\/p><p>This circular will go a long way to address concerns about casualisation that have arisen within the profession and which I addressed at the IMPACT education sector conference at Easter. This circular builds on the introduction of a supplementary assignment panel process for SNAs which was introduced two years ago, giving SNAs the alternative of redeployment instead of redundancy. Both measures have operated in advance of the 15\/16 school year giving SNAs greater stability and a better chance of a full-hours contract.<\/p><p>The purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school\/ETB.  Furthermore, it means that, before an employer opts to recruit a further person as an SNA(s), they must ensure that all existing part-time SNAs in their employment, in order of seniority, have been offered a full-time position in the school or, in the case of ETBs, a full-time position in a school within the ETB scheme.<\/p><p>The only exception that can be made to this rule is where a school\/ETB has a determination in writing from the NCSE \/ SENO stating that their allocation must be split amongst a specific number of SNAs and\/or stating that the allocation must be implemented in a specific fashion to address the care needs of the pupil(s).

The agreement reached between the parties found expression in the two circular letters issued in 2005 detailing the contracts of employment for SNAs.<\/p><p>Links to the SNA Contracts of Employment are as follows:<\/p><p>Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 12\/05 (Post-Primary) <\/p><p>Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 15\/05 (Primary)  <\/p><p>This contract of employment is augmented by all of the relevant Departmental Circulars governing Special Needs Assistants which detail the standardised terms and conditions of employment for SNAs. These Circulars are amended and new Circulars are issued by the Minister for Education and Skills from time to time.<\/p><p>The position regarding the working hours of full-time SNAs is as outlined in these standard SNA contracts of employment. In that context, the standard SNA contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools. No set hours were agreed but instead full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc. These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school. <\/p><p>In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total. Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days.<\/p><p>Accordingly, DES Circular 71\/2011 was issued on 15 December 2011 which outlined that these 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and\/or the normal school year. <\/p><p>Link to DES Circular 71\/2011 is as follows:<\/p><p>SNAs who are employed in a part-time capacity are paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment. Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours. I should point out that this divisor was also agreed with both the Management Authorities and the Trade Unions (IMPACT and SIPTU) that represent SNAs.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the contract of employment for SNAs in the post primary sector specifically requires that SNAs in the post primary sector are required to work the month of June.<\/p><p>If any SNA believes that the working hours as laid out by their employer are not in line with the nationally agreed contracts for an SNA, then that is a matter that they should raise directly with their employer (the school\/ETB).  If an SNA remains unhappy with the response received from their employer, then the Department has implemented a nationally agreed set of Grievance procedures for SNAs (DES Circular 72\/2011) which can be invoked by an SNA with their employer where matters such as this are in dispute.  <\/p><p>Link to DES Circular 72\/2011 is as follows:<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200124#WRQQQ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Funding","counter":3481,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200124#WRQQQ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":3482,"qnumday":1343,"qnumall":"[32146\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200124#WRQQQ01400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her plans to increase the current school funding for primary schools from 92 cent per pupil up to the secondary school level rate of &euro;1.77 per student, due to increasing running costs for insurance, electrical, and so on and the financial demands and burdens it places on boards of management and parents; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":3483,"content":"<p>It is extremely difficult to make precise comparisons between the levels of grants paid and the actual costs of running schools at primary and post primary levels.

However, I intend to keep this matter under review as the budgetary situation improves in the years ahead.<\/p><p>In taking this view, I am conscious that the natural environment, uniquely amongst the broad range of areas funded by my Department, also receives funding from the Environment Fund, which was established under the Waste Management (Amendment) Act 2001. The Environment Fund comprises of the revenues from the environmental levy on the supply of plastic bags, collected by the Revenue Commissioners, and the environmental levy on the landfilling of waste, collected by local authorities. <\/p><p>The Environment Fund is used for activities or initiatives in a range of areas such as, <i>inter alia, <\/i>schemes to prevent\/reduce waste and waste recovery activities; research &amp;amp; development into waste management; support of education and training and promotion of awareness of the need to protect the environment, including national and regional campaigns; and initiatives undertaken by community groups and others for protection of the environment.<\/p><p>From 2011 to 2014, in excess of &euro;255 million was disbursed to the environment sector from the Environment Fund. This is in addition to some &euro;146 million provided to the environment sector by way of Exchequer Voted expenditure by my Department. In 2015, I made Fund allocations totalling &euro;825,000 to the Irish Environmental Network and the Environmental Pillar. The total allocations from the Fund in 2015 amount to in excess of &euro;44 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200126#WRSSS03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Provision","counter":3619,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200126#WRSSS03450"},{"type":"question","counter":3620,"qnumday":1390,"qnumall":"[30515\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200126#WRSSS03500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number and names of all operating voluntary housing bodies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1013","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":3621,"content":"<p>Section 6(6) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992 makes provision to grant approved housing body (AHB) status to housing associations.

This will address the needs of all households on the housing waiting list, with flexibility to meet potential future demand.  The Strategy also includes a commitment to increase the regularity of the Summary of Social Housing Assessments by undertaking it on annual basis from 2016 onwards, which will support the continuous monitoring of social housing delivery against need.<\/p><p>On 1 April 2015, I announced provisional funding allocations totalling &euro;1.5 billion for all local authorities, to meet an ambitious delivery target of 22,882 social housing units out to 2017.

HAP is now available to all qualified households in 13 local authority areas. Consideration is currently being given to the sequencing of a further cohort of local authorities to commence HAP in the coming months. <\/p><p>With regard to financial initiatives, the Strategy includes a commitment to commence work on a financial vehicle, to be known as the Strategic Housing Fund, to raise funding for the social housing sector.\u00a0 Work on the development of this new funding model has commenced and is being progressed under the Finance Work Stream of the Strategy&rsquo;s governance structure.

A protocol was put in place in March 2015 under the auspices of the Finance Work Stream to facilitate individuals and entities seeking to engage with the State to provide investment for the delivery of social housing.\u00a0A single point of contact for submitting proposals, the Social Housing Proposals Clearing House Group has been established, operating through my Department, under the oversight of the Finance Work Stream.\u00a0 Interested parties may contact the Clearing House at <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>The Strategy also provides for a &euro;300 million programme of investment in social housing via the Public Private Partnership model, which is expected to deliver 1,500 housing units; work is advancing with site selection well underway.<\/p><p>Finally, the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, a key deliverable for my Department under <i>Construction 2020<\/i>, was commenced with effect from 1 September 2015.

Details of the properties entered into under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme in 2015 for the local authorities referred to in the Question are outlined in a table.<table><tr><th>Local Authority <\/th><th>*Rental <br \/><br \/>Accommodation <br \/><br \/>Scheme <\/th><th>**Social Housing <br \/><br \/>Current Expenditure Programme <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin City <\/td><td>44 <\/td><td>190 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown <\/td><td>9 <\/td><td>10 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Fingal <\/td><td>39 <\/td><td>7 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South Dublin <\/td><td>121 <\/td><td>50 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare <\/td><td>46 <\/td><td>13 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath <\/td><td>23 <\/td><td>51 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow <\/td><td>40 <\/td><td>3 <\/td><\/tr><\/table>*To end July 2015<\/p><p>**To end August 2015<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200131#WRXXX00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing","counter":3825,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200131#WRXXX00800"},{"type":"question","counter":3826,"qnumday":1472,"qnumall":"[31839\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200131#WRXXX00900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if his Department has instructed local authorities not to submit proposals for funding for social housing of more than 50 units; and if so, the reason why.","asker":"1008","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":3827,"qnumday":1473,"qnumall":"[31840\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200131#WRXXX01000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if his Department will consider applications from local authorities for social housing developments in excess of 50 units where the authority has available land for developments larger than 50 units.","asker":"1008","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":3828,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1472 and 1473 together.<\/p><p>No direction has issued from my Department to local authorities restricting the development of social housing schemes in excess of 50 units.

Within each zone, air quality is assessed and classified with respect to these thresholds, based on measurements over the previous five years. The results of this assessment help to inform decisions on the extent of monitoring. The greatest monitoring effort applies where concentrations are above the upper assessment threshold, i.e. where they approach or exceed the limit value. Where concentrations are between the two thresholds, less intensive measurement combined with other assessment methods, such as air quality modelling, will generally suffice. Monitoring sites are located in accordance with CAF&Eacute; Directive requirements. <\/p><p>In relation to mobile monitoring, the EPA currently possesses three units. Two of these units are used for assessment and reporting purposes in accordance with the Directive. These are mainly used for assessing air quality in Zone C towns but on occasion have been used in other zones as required. The units usually monitor for a period of 1 &ndash; 2 years at any one location before being re-assigned to a new location.

This approach to ensuring households in the group water sector receive equivalent support, while allowing for any transitional issues, to sustain improvement in quality in the sector, was reiterated on 19 November 2014, following a review of the water charging regime undertaken by the Government, the outcome of which was the announcement of a revised charging system for Irish Water customers. <\/p><p>Following completion of the review of the subsidisation of group water schemes the following revised subsidies are operative with effect from 1 January 2015;<\/p><p>- Subsidy A towards the general operational and management costs of group schemes served from a public source is &euro;40 (down from &euro;70);<\/p><p>- Subsidy A towards the general operational and management costs of group schemes served from a private source is &euro;95 (down from &euro;140); and<\/p><p>- Subsidy B towards the operational and maintenance costs associated with &ldquo;bona fide&rdquo; Design Build Operate contracts for schemes which have their own water treatment facilities remains unchanged at &euro;220. <\/p><p>The revised subsidies represent fair treatment between drinking water consumers in the public and group sectors having regard to the inherent differences in structure, funding and organisation between the sectors.<\/p><p><i>The annual savings from the introduction of the changes in subsidies are currently estimated to be in the region of &euro;1.2 million.

The Strategy is a comprehensive response to the need for social housing and targets the provision of over 110,000 social housing units to 2020, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme. This will address the needs of the households on the housing waiting list with flexibility to meet potential future demand.<\/p><p>Under the Strategy, on 1 April 2015, I announced provisional funding allocations totalling &euro;1.5 billion for all local authorities, to meet an ambitious delivery target of 22,882 social housing units out to 2017. Details of the individual targets set for local authorities can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at:.<\/p><p>To date in 2015 some &euro;493 million has been allocated, to local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies, for the construction and acquisition of over 2,900 units, full<b><\/b>details of which can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links:<\/p><p>.<\/p><p>Furthermore, over &euro;91 million worth of housing investment, across a range of housing schemes to bring vacant social housing units back into productive use and to improve housing for people with disabilities, as well as retrofitting homes to improve energy efficiency, was also announced in May. Full details of the allocations made to local authorities are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:.<\/p><p>Further announcements in relation to project approvals, in line with the Strategy targets, will be made in due course.<\/p><p>The implementation of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is also progressing at pace, with almost 4,000 households now in receipt of HAP across the local authority areas taking part in the statutory pilot scheme. HAP is now available to all qualified households in 13 local authority areas. Consideration is currently being given to the sequencing of a further cohort of local authorities to commence HAP in the coming months.<\/p><p>In relation to homelessness, a range of specific measures are being taken to secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation to house homeless households and mobilise the necessary supports in order to deliver on the Government's target of ending involuntary long-term homelessness. These measures have been identified in the Government's <i>Implementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness <\/i>(May 2014) and in the <i>Action Plan to Address Homelessness<\/i>(December 2014).<\/p><p>Progress in implementing these plans is reported through the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform. The plans and progress reports are available on my Department's website at the following link:<\/p><p>These Plans represent a whole-of-Government approach to dealing with homelessness and the implementation of measures identified in these plans is being overseen by a group of senior officials drawn from key State agencies concerned including my Department; the Departments of Social Protection; Health; and Children and Youth Affairs; the Health Service Executive; Tusla (the Child and Family Agency); the Irish Prison Service; and local authorities. <\/p><p>In addition to ensuring that appropriate emergency responses are put in place, it is of critical importance that steps are taken to prevent, as far as possible, families presenting as homeless in the first instance. In that regard, I am determined to achieve stability and sustainability in the private rental market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole. The regulation of rent raises many complex economic and legal issues and I have to be satisfied that any measures proposed are balanced and have the desired effect on the rental market while being fair to landlords and tenants alike.\u00a0 Ultimately, any decision in relation to rent certainty is a matter for Government and it is my intention to bring proposals to Government for consideration as soon as the necessary preparatory work has been completed.<\/p><p>Finally, the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, was recently enacted and was commenced with effect from 1 September 2015. The Act revises Part V arrangements on social and affordable housing to maximise the opportunity for the delivery of social housing units and to secure the principle of integrated mixed tenure developments. Importantly, the practice of developers making cash payments in lieu of housing units is no longer an option under the new legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200133#WRZZZ02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Finances","counter":3920,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200133#WRZZZ02050"},{"type":"question","counter":3921,"qnumday":1519,"qnumall":"[32237\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200133#WRZZZ02100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if his Department received any formal request for financial assistance from Sligo County Council in respect of road strengthening works costing &euro;174,212, which the council incurred in preparing for the recent visit of members of the British royal family to Sligo; his plans to provide funding to Sligo County Council to cover any of the costs associated with the royal visit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1193","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":3922,"content":"<p>My Department received an enquiry from Sligo County Council but has not received a formal request for financial assistance in respect of costs associated with the recent visit of members of the British royal family.

IFI manages salmon stocks on an individual river basis as each of Ireland&rsquo;s 143 salmon rivers has its own genetically unique stock of salmon <\/p>  <p>  IFI is supported in its management role a statutorily independent Standing Scientific Committee (SSC) on Salmon comprising scientists from IFI, Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM), the Loughs Agency, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Marine Institute, the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI- Northern Ireland) other State bodies and third level institutions. Scientific and management assessments of each of the distinct stocks are carried out every year, with IFI engaged in an extensive monitoring of stock status which feed into the scientific committee's annual reviews.<\/p>  <p>  The scientific committee estimates the number of salmon likely to return to each river in the next fishing season based on estimates of salmon runs over the most recent five years. Each river has an individual conservation limit (CL) which is essentially the number of salmon required to spawn to maintain a healthy population. If the estimate of returning salmon is above this limit then salmon from that individually genetic river population may be harvested commercially or by rod and line. <\/p>  <p>  For rivers, such as the Suir, Nore and Barrow, where a counter is not in use, the primary index for evaluation of likely returning numbers is the recorded rod (harvest or catch and release) and commercial catch averaged over the previous 5 years. The scientific committee applies a range of rod exploitation rates for recreational fishing activity and adds the commercial catch to calculate the total run of salmon. In the case of the River Slaney, the fish counter data is used to estimate the salmon run. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, information on juvenile abundance indices derived from electro-fishing surveys carried out annually by IFI is also evaluated as an indicator of stock status. This information is used primarily where new information has not been available for rod catches.<\/p>  <p>  Harvest fisheries are only considered in rivers where the estimated returns are above the conservation limit for the river. I am advised by IFI that a Risk Analysis is undertaken on any estimate of returns expected to be above the conservation limit. <\/p>  <p>  IFI have confirmed that, using the recorded salmon rod catch and any commercial salmon catch, the estimate of returning salmon in 2015 was below the individual conservation limits for the rivers Barrow, Nore and Suir and no surpluses of salmon was available. No salmon surplus was also available using fish counter data for the Slaney averaged over the past five years.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed that IFI is currently investigating the possibility of installing a fish counter on the river Barrow for salmon stock assessment. This process will depend on locating a suitable site and acquiring all planning and other relevant permissions. <\/p>  <p>  The salmon assessment methodologies used in Ireland is considered internationally as best practice with many other countries moving towards the development of similar scientific assessment models for salmon stock conservation.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the issue off salmon hatcheries, IFI have advised that there are significant genetic and ecological concerns when the progeny of wild salmon reared in a hatchery environment are released back into the wild and guidelines have been prepared by the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) with regard to applying the precautionary approach to any proposed stocking of hatchery reared Atlantic salmon into the wild.<\/p>  <p>  There are many possible causes for decline of Atlantic salmon populations and stocking may not be an appropriate solution. IFI&rsquo;s advice for enhancement of salmon stocks nationally, including the River Nore, is to continue with single stock salmon management to achieve individual river spawning targets while also supporting habitat enhancement and removal of artificial barriers to migration rather than artificial stock enhancements which have potentially detrimental genetic impacts. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200134#WRAAAA01500","answer":true,"speaker":"997"},{"type":"question","counter":3956,"qnumday":1535,"qnumall":"[30497\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200134#WRAAAA01600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he envisages that the estuary to the Rivers Barrow, Nore, and Suir will ever be re-opened for drift-net fishing; if not, if he will consider a voluntary buy-out scheme for current licence holders; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1199","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":3957,"content":"<p>As each of Ireland&rsquo;s 143 salmon rivers has its own unique stock of salmon, Inland Fisheries Ireland manages salmon stocks by individual river based on the river's conservation limit.

The Scheme is open to independent producers and all &lsquo;free to air&rsquo; commercial, community and public service broadcasters.

The management of the radio spectrum is a statutory function of the Commission for Communications Regulation under the Communications Regulation Act, 2002 as amended. Licences issued by ComReg apply terms and conditions on Mobile Network Operators, such as quality of service and minimum population coverage obligations.<\/p>  <p>  However, given that mobile services are a radio based technology, services can be affected by several factors. These include topography, the capacity of the network and more generally the level and quality of access customers have to mobile phone antennas. Difficulties for service providers in erecting masts and antennas due to planning issues can also impact negatively on the quality of coverage experienced by consumers.<\/p>  <p>  Neither I nor my Department has any role or responsibility in the monitoring of coverage or the quality of service being provided by licensed operators. In terms of improving the quality and coverage of mobile services in all areas throughout the country, there are however various initiatives under way. <\/p>  <p>  The telecommunications sector has invested some &euro;850m in acquiring spectrum under ComReg's 2012 Multi-Band Spectrum Auction. Since then, the mobile operators have all continued to invest in rolling out 4G and enhanced 3G services nationwide. These investments are improving both the coverage and quality of voice and data services throughout the country, although I understand that some temporary disruptions to service have been encountered when upgrades are taking place. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the National Broadband Plan, a working group has also been established to address infrastructure issues which were identified by industry as creating barriers to deployment of services generally, which may include mobile services. The group is chaired by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and includes representatives from my Department, the Local Government Management Agency, the National Roads Authority (NRA) and Local Authorities. The Group is currently consulting with industry on a range of issues relating to the siting of telecommunications infrastructure. My Department will continue to actively engage on this issue with a view to facilitating the removal of barriers and the improvement of mobile services nationwide. <\/p>  <p>  Local Authorities also have an important role to play in terms of facilitating the siting of necessary infrastructure such as masts and antennae etc. The Telecommunications and Internet Federation (TIF, which is part of IBEC) has been proactive in seeking to meet with Local Authorities and public representatives to fully discuss the various issues around mobile coverage and the factors that can impact on the quality of service consumers experience.<\/p>  <p>  I would encourage all Local Authorities and public representatives to engage with the TIF on these important issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200135#WRBBBB03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mining Licences","counter":4044,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200136#WRCCCC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":4045,"qnumday":1566,"qnumall":"[32296\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200136#WRCCCC00200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the extent to which commercially viable discoveries of oil, gas or other minerals have been made in the past five years to date on or offshore; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1024"},{"type":"question","counter":4046,"qnumday":1573,"qnumall":"[32303\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015092200136#WRCCCC00250","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the number of oil, gas or other exploration licences issued in each of the past five years to date; the number of commercially viable discoveries arising therefrom; the number of such licences activated by way of actual exploration; the number still outstanding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":4047,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1566 and 1573 together. <\/p><p>Details of all authorisations granted by the Department are published in the six monthly reports to the Oireachtas, which I am obliged to lay before the Houses under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1999 and the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960, respectively.

The aim of the network is to assure the long-term survival of Europe's most valuable and threatened species and habitats.  It is comprised of special areas of conservation designated by Member States under the Habitats Directive and also incorporates special protection areas under the 1979 Birds Directive.  The criteria for selecting sites eligible for identification as sites of community importance and designated as special areas of conservation are set out in Annex III of the Habitats Directive.<\/p><p>The Habitats Directive has been fully transposed into Irish law by means of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010, as amended, and by the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011, as amended.<\/p><p>A natural heritage area is considered important for the habitats present or for the species of plants and animals it holds whose habitat needs protection.  Natural Heritage Areas are designated under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 and are legally protected from negative impacts from the date they are formally proposed for designation through a requirement to obtain Ministerial consent before certain potentially damaging activities are undertaken. <\/p><p>Persons, whose interests are affected by a proposed designation and wish to object, must lodge an objection within three months of the advertisement of a proposal to designate a site.  All objections must be made in writing and be accompanied by a good quality map with the boundary of the area relating to the objection clearly outlined.  Adjustments to boundaries are made only on scientific grounds. <\/p><p>Further information in relation to the site designation process is available on the website of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department at www.npws.ie.<\/p><p>There are currently 155 natural heritage areas.  75 raised bogs, which are located mainly in the midlands, have been given legal protection as natural heritage areas, covering some 23,000 hectares.  A further 73 blanket bogs, covering 37,000 hectares, mostly in western areas, are also designated as natural heritage areas.  In addition 7 natural heritage areas, identified as of particular importance to birds, have also been designated.<\/p><p>While some natural heritage areas exist entirely or partly within candidate special areas of conservation or special protection areas, pursuant to the EU Nature Directives, my Department estimates that some 45,873 hectares of land is solely designated within natural heritage areas.<\/p><p>In addition, there are 630 proposed natural heritage areas.  While a review of these sites is foreseen, this will not take place in the immediate future, having regard to the available resources.<\/p><p>In January 2014, the <i>Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network <\/i>was<i><\/i>published and concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network.  This entails the phasing out of turf-cutting on certain raised bog natural heritage areas by 1 January 2017 and the partial or complete de-designation of certain natural heritage areas.  46 raised bog natural heritage areas (including parts of 7 sites) are scheduled for de-designation.
