Under the Government&rsquo;s planned Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill, which was recently published, those sectors of the economy with significant carbon emissions are required to produce plans to lower these emissions. The Bill and the associated National Policy Position, which were recently published, envisage Ireland aiming to achieve at least an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions in aggregate across the electricity generation, transport and built environment sectors by 2050. A National Low Carbon Roadmap for how these reductions will be achieved will be approved by Government and published in 2014. Achieving such a reduction in CO2 emissions will be very difficult. The Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s most recent report on greenhouse gas emissions projections shows that there is significant risk, even under the best case scenario, that Ireland will not meet its 2020 targets and that we face considerable challenges to becoming a low carbon economy.   Late last year I published a scoping report on a low carbon roadmap for the electricity generation sector and undertook a public consultation on the matter. Over the coming months my Department will continue to work on evaluating options that can lower emissions from electricity generation while maintaining economic competitiveness and ensuring that everyone can afford to heat and power their homes.<\/p><p>  The first milestone towards achieving a low carbon economy by 2050 is the delivery of the 2020 targets set by the EU and the corresponding national targets. Ireland has a requirement to achieve a binding target of 16% of energy demand coming from renewable sources. Currently, over 7% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy now comes from renewables and this includes 20% of electricity demand. <\/p><p>  Ireland has also set a challenging target of delivering 20% energy efficiency savings by 2020, with a 33% target for the public sector. This will reduce our CO2 emissions by approximately 5.7 million tonnes, saving some &euro;1.6 billion per annum in avoided energy costs. The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan sets out in detail the actions that will be taken to achieve this goal.<\/p><p>  Negotiations are now getting underway on the Climate and Energy Framework 2030 published by the European Commission in January of this year. The current EU proposals foresee a reduction of 40% Greenhouse Gas emissions and an increase in renewable energy to 27% across the EU. While Ireland is supportive of a high level of ambition, our contribution must be based on an approach that is equitable, cost efficient and technically feasible.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200046#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":9,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 4 to 9, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":10,"content":"<p>Question No.10 answered with Question No. 7.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":11,"content":"<p>Question No. 11 answered with Question No. 6.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Exports","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200046#WRA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[24673\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200046#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the recent communications or reports his Department has had on the Dublin array wind farm project; if in the view of the postponement of the planned deal with the UK on the export of wind energy from Ireland and the very serious questions being asked about the environmental and social value of large scale wind farms geared towards export, if any decision to allow the Dublin array project to proceed should now also be put on hold.","asker":"1003","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>It is important that Ireland's energy policy ensures that we sustainably capture the potential economic benefits of our abundant, indigenous, clean energy resources. Ireland&rsquo;s position at the Atlantic edge of Europe provides an unparalleled offshore energy resource, with suitable conditions available for the development of the full range of current offshore renewable energy technologies. The offshore renewable energy sector has been consistently identified in recent years as a potential source of sustainable employment and economic growth, especially in those coastal communities where job creation is particularly challenging. The Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP), which I published earlier this year, identified export as the optimal path to market for offshore wind projects. Such export would require an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA). However, the economic, policy and regulatory complexities involved, and some key decisions required to be taken by the UK to facilitate any IGA, mean that post-2020 delivery is more realistic given project lead times.    By way of context to this longer time horizon, earlier this year the European Commission published proposals for a 2030 Climate and Energy Framework. As we now look towards 2030, and consider Europe's trajectory for achieving a low carbon economy by 2050, opportunities to develop renewable energy technologies &ndash; such as offshore wind &ndash; and greater cross border trade in renewable energy, are likely to present over the coming years. <\/p><p>  In addition, the Communication on Blue Energy, recently published by the European Commission, estimates the ocean energy sector could create tens of thousands of jobs over the medium to longer term.

The six priority themes are: empowering energy citizens; markets, regulation and prices; planning and implementing essential energy infrastructure; ensuring a balanced and secure energy mix; putting the energy system on a sustainable pathway; and driving economic opportunity.The process includes a full public consultation and a targeted stakeholder consultation on the priority areas. The public consultation runs to 31 July and I would urge all stakeholders, including members of the public, to engage with the consultation.

The key benefit to homeowners of the Better Energy Financing (BEF) mechanism is that it will allow them to secure upfront financing for energy efficiency upgrades to their homes. In designing the new mechanism, my Department worked with SEAI under the direction of a Project Board representing State and industry stakeholders. As well as accessing expert technical, legal and financial advice, detailed analysis of similar schemes in other jurisdictions was undertaken and a public consultation was also carried out. The SEAI will now be tasked with drawing up a detailed implementation plan for the design, development and execution of the Better Energy Financing scheme, which I anticipate will lead to a number of elements of the scheme being piloted later this year.    There are a number of reasons for the revision of the Pay-As-You-Save model principally that homeowners are reluctant to take on new loan products when deleveraging is the common practice. This is in keeping with the international experience as is the additional difficulty in attracting applicants beyond the cohort of early adopters. Experience has also shown that the Pay-As-You-Save Model would not deliver savings adequate to meet the cost of Retrofit as originally anticipated. For these reasons government has maintained the grants-based incentive scheme that has seen over 261,000 homes retrofitted to date. I have already advised government that, in parallel with the new Better Energy Finance initiative, I intend to maintain the grants-based incentives for 2015.<\/p><p>  My Department has responded to the decline in applications for domestic Retrofit by re-channelling funding to meet the surge in applications under the Better Energy Areas and Communities Scheme which provide grant funding for community based projects.

Ireland is currently heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels to meet our energy needs. While it is acknowledged that fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix for some time to come, progress is being made towards increasing the share of renewable energy in our generation portfolio. The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020, to be achieved through 40% renewables in electricity, 12% in heat and 10% in transport. In 2012, renewable energy in electricity was 19.6%, in heat it was 5.2%, and in transport it was 3.8%. Analysis of options for increased use of renewable energy as we approach 2020 and beyond is ongoing, with a view to ensuring that our ambition is both sustainable, and economically and technically feasible. For example, analysis is being undertaken by my Department, the SEAI, EirGrid and the CER to further assess the costs and benefits associated with achieving 40% renewable electricity generation in 2020, compared to a scenario where renewable electricity remains at 2013 levels.

In terms renewable electricity generating options raised by the Deputy, to date wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. Provisional figures for 2013 indicate that 16.4% of electricity demand was met by wind generation. At the end of 2013, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid was 2,300 MW. It is estimated that a total of around 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target. Currently, over 3,000 MW of renewable generation has taken up connection offers under the Gate 3 grid connection programme.<\/p><p>Our electricity system must be planned and developed so that it is adequate to meet future demand. Furthermore, energy infrastructure projects typically have long lead in times. Therefore, forecasts of economic growth are a critical factor in determining the on-going process of network planning and development carried out by EirGrid. EirGrid also uses this information to monitor the outlook for generation adequacy on a rolling ten year basis. In addition, the National Renewable Energy Action Plan, in which Ireland had to set out its trajectory for meeting its EU 2020 target, set out initial forecasts of demand for the years to 2020 to illustrate the amount of renewable generation that would be required to meet our EU target. In light of the economic downturn those figures have been revised in the second NREAP progress report produced by my Department earlier this year. <\/p><p>Looking out to the period beyond 2020, it is clear that there is potential to increase the diversity of our renewable generation portfolio. To this end, the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP), which I published in February, identifies the sustainable economic opportunity for Ireland in the period to 2030 of realising the potential of our indigenous offshore wind, wave and tidal energy resources. The Strategic Environmental Assessment carried out for the OREDP found that 4,500 MW of offshore wind and 1,500 MW of wave and tidal generation could be sustainably developed in Irish waters.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200046#WRA02300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Prices","counter":33,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200046#WRA02350"},{"type":"question","counter":34,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[24785\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200046#WRA02400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his Department's role in tackling fuel poverty; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1083","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":35,"content":"<p>Government policy on energy affordability is founded on the fundamental principle that everyone should be able to afford to adequately light and heat their home.

This will be achieved by providing:-<\/p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and<\/p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. <\/p><p>As a result of this accelerated investment the addressable area required by the State-led intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While these commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. Consequently, the speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. <\/p><p>On 25 April last, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment, as part of the State-led intervention under the National Broadband Plan. This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way.   <\/p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users. The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department which will identify those areas that will require a State intervention. I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. This list is available on my Department's website . Currently a total of 78 areas in County Donegal, 84 areas in County Galway and 48 areas in Co Limerick have been identified as requiring an intervention. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the mapping exercise. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. I expect that this mapping exercise will be concluded in the autumn. <\/p><p>I would point out that the EU Commission's guidelines on State aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude Member States from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out infrastructure within the following three years. <\/p><p>In tandem with the completion of the mapping exercise, intensive design and planning work is ongoing in my Department with a view to producing a detailed end to end implementation strategy for the State led intervention. It is my intention to conduct a full public consultation on the outcome of the mapping process and the proposed implementation strategy. EU State aid clearance will also be required for the intervention once finalised. This will be followed by a detailed procurement process with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in identified areas as quickly as possible. <\/p><p>Government is determined to ensure that all citizens and businesses have access to quality and reliable broadband, as well as the skills to maximise the benefits such access brings. The proposed State led intervention acknowledges that broadband is the key infrastructure of the 21<sup>st<\/sup>century and its implementation will allow the full potential of a digitally enabled economy and society to be realised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200046#WRA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inland Fisheries","counter":46,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200046#WRA03350"},{"type":"question","counter":47,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[24556\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200046#WRA03400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will provide details of the engagement that his Department has had with representatives of salmon and trout anglers on the concerns that they have on the sustainability and future stock levels in inland waterways; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":48,"content":"<p>Ireland manages salmon stocks generally on an individual river basis.

However, as also highlighted in the OREDP, a route to market is critical for the development of each of the technologies in this sector.    It has been established that Ireland has sufficient onshore renewable energy resources to allow us to meet our 2020 target of meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable generation. Therefore, the route to market identified for offshore wind is that of export. Intensive discussions took place over the last year with the UK to establish if it would be possible to export renewable energy, both onshore and offshore, in order to allow the UK meet its 2020 target. While this work established that, with the appropriate policy and regulatory framework, renewable energy trading could deliver benefits to both Ireland and the UK, the complexities involved and the decisions yet to be taken by the UK, make post 2020 delivery more realistic given project lead times. Nevertheless, given the move towards an Internal Market for Energy, I am of the view that trade in renewable electricity is virtually inevitable post 2020. <\/p><p>  In common with the state of play internationally, the ocean energy sector in Ireland is at the pre-commercial stage. To support developers in bringing their devices from prototype to full scale commercial viability, requires a range of policies. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) provides support to developers in a number of ways from its ocean energy development budget of &euro;6.5 million for 2014. Initial device development and testing is supported through the Prototype Fund. Developers must satisfy a range of technical criteria to indicate potential viability in order to receive funding. Funding has also been allocated to SEAI for the development of the Atlantic Marine Energy Test Site (AMETS) off County Mayo. From 2016, this facility will provide a grid connected test site with some of the most demanding conditions for wave energy in the world. Currently SEAI and the Marine Institute provide quarter size test facilities off the Galway coast. <\/p><p>  The Irish Maritime and Energy Research Centre (IMERC) provides initial device testing facilities and critical research and development capacity. My Department is contributing &euro;3 million in co-funding between 2013 and 2016. In total, my Department has allocated at total of &euro;26.3 million for ocean energy in the period 2013 to 2016. This funding, which will benefit from increased cross government coordination through the implementation of the OREDP, is vital if the ocean energy sector is to reach the array demonstration stage envisaged by projects such as Westwave. The fact that this level of funding has been retained for ocean energy despite the budgetary constraints of recent years indicates the level of Government commitment to realising the potential of our abundant, indigenous, offshore energy resources.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200046#WRA04300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Exports","counter":59,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200046#WRA04350"},{"type":"question","counter":60,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[24722\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200046#WRA04400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he has made any further contact with his British counterpart with regard to the export of energy from Ireland to the UK; if he is considering supporting an interconnector between Ireland and France; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":61,"content":"<p>Following extensive engagement between my Department and the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change over a sixteen month period following the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation in the Energy Sector in January 2013, it is clear that given the economic, policy and regulatory complexities involved, and the key decisions yet to be taken by the UK, delivery of the envisaged wind energy export project is not now a realistic proposition. I conveyed this view to my British counterpart in April. There is ongoing contact between my Department and the Department of Energy and Climate Change on a range of energy issues, including in the context of the British Irish Council. These contacts will afford both parties to explore longer term trading opportunities that will arise post 2020 in the context of a European Internal Energy Market and the need for greater energy integration.  In terms of supporting interconnection, it is EU policy is to encourage greater integration and interconnectivity between Member States. Enhanced security of supply, increased competitiveness, and the ability to integrate greater quantities of variable renewable generation resources are some of the potential benefits of further interconnection between the transmission grids of Ireland, Great Britain and mainland Europe. Eirgrid is the Transmission System Operator (TSO) for the electricity transmission system in Ireland. The functions of the TSO include the operation of a safe, secure, reliable, economical and efficient electricity transmission system, and to explore and develop opportunities for interconnection of its system with other systems, with a view to ensuring that all reasonable demands for electricity are met and having due regard for the environment.

Under the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs, provision is made for &euro;57 million in Exchequer supports to further stimulate energy-saving activity in the residential sector. This is estimated to sustain approximately 3,500 jobs. A further &euro;35 million is being invested in the creation of an Energy Efficiency Fund to invest in appropriate projects in the commercial and public sectors.  SEAI estimates   that the renewable and sustainable energy sector could create at least 30,000 jobs by 2020. As I have stated previously, all relevant State agencies, particularly in the enterprise area, will have to co-ordinate their activities to ensure Ireland maximises this job creation potential. This opportunity has already been identified by the IDA and Enterprise Ireland in their clean technology growth strategies. SEAI is currently working with Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and Forf&aacute;s to examine what sectors and sub-sectors in the supply chains of energy efficiency and renewable energy offer the most opportunities for Irish firms in order to inform strategies to maximise job creation.

The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is, in the first instance, a matter for commercial services providers. These service providers operate in a competitive commercial market reporting to the independent market regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  ComReg publishes data on customer access to high speed broadband at the national level only. This data shows that between 2011 and the end of 2013 the proportion of broadband customers accessing marketed speeds of 30 Mbps or more increased from 3% to 35%. It also indicates that the proportion of customers contracted at speeds of 2 Mbps or less reduced from 11% to 5%. ComReg does not publish any similar material by a county or regional basis.    The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and<\/p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. <\/p><p>As a result of this accelerated investment the addressable area required by the State-led intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. Consequently, the speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. <\/p><p>On 25 April last, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment, as part of the State led intervention under the National Broadband Plan. This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way. <\/p><p>Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users. The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department which will identify those areas that will require a State intervention. I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. This list is available on my Department's website . Currently, a total of 108 areas in County Cork have been identified as requiring an intervention. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the mapping exercise. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. I expect that this mapping exercise will be concluded in the autumn. <\/p><p>I would point out that the EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on State aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude Member States from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years. In this regard, I understand that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out 103 fibre-based broadband networks in County Cork by July 2016.<\/p><p>In tandem with the completion of the mapping exercise, intensive design and planning work is ongoing in my Department with a view to producing a detailed end to end implementation strategy for the State led intervention. It is my intention to conduct a full public consultation on the outcome of the mapping process and the proposed implementation strategy. EU State aid clearance will also be required for the intervention once finalised. This will be followed by a detailed procurement process with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in identified areas as quickly as possible<\/p><p>With regard to the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), I am pleased to advise that of the four MANs in West Cork, Bantry, Dunmanway and Skibbereen are in operation and are being used by a number of telecommunications operators, providing services to businesses in those areas. The fourth MAN, Kinsale, was recently completed and is expected to be in operation in the next few weeks.<\/p><p>I fully share the concerns of local representatives about the quality of broadband in rural areas. It is my intention to ensure that rural Ireland enjoys similar opportunities to urban areas by delivering an end-to end market intervention with fibre as a core component. In committing to a fibre build-out at the heart of this strategy, Government is determined to ensure that all citizens and businesses in the State have access to quality and reliable broadband.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200046#WRA06100","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hydraulic Fracturing","counter":84,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200046#WRA06150"},{"type":"question","counter":85,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[24546\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200046#WRA06200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will keep Ireland fracking free; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":86,"content":"<p>In November of last year the EPA launched a call for tenders, with the selection process to conclude shortly, to appoint the relevant expertise to conduct detailed research into the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on the environment. <\/p><p>The key questions, that this research programme needs to answer are:<\/p><p>- Can unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects and operations be carried out in the island of Ireland whilst also protecting the environment and human health? and<\/p><p>- What is &lsquo;best environmental practice&rsquo; in relation to such projects and operations?<\/p><p>In addressing these questions, I understand that the research programme will include identification and a detailed examination of potential impacts on the environment and human health, as well as potential successful mitigation measures to counteract the impacts of such projects and operations that have come to the fore worldwide, using published reports and other sources.

democracy and human rights.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains and administers a roster of observers for such missions.   The aim is to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international observation missions for both elections and constitutional referendums.   The Department carried out a comprehensive review of the election observation roster in 2013.   A public call for applications to the roster was issued, with all applications being required to submit a detailed application form, setting out their relevant qualifications, knowledge and experience in a number of areas.  These areas included: experience of election processes and election observation; knowledge of human rights and \/ or governance issues; experience of living in challenging environments and language and computer skills.  Applicants were asked to indicate their proficiency or experience and to provide concrete written examples, where appropriate.  An independent appraisal, based only on the information contained in the application form, was subsequently undertaken.  Arising from this, the 200 individuals who achieved the highest scores were selected to serve on the new election observation roster.  This new roster came into effect on 15 May 2013.  Due to the high quality of applications received, a reserve panel of the next 10 highest scoring individuals was also established.   The reserve panelists were assessed on the same basis as the 200 other election observation members, with no additional information, being requested as part of this process.  Full details of the criteria against which all election observation applicants were assessed were set out in the Information Note, which was published with the election observation application form, on the Department&rsquo;s website.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200047#WRB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Applications","counter":105,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200047#WRB01150"},{"type":"question","counter":106,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[25179\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200047#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the reason difficulty is been experienced in obtaining an Irish passport in the case of\u00a0a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":107,"content":"<p>When a person renews his\/her passport, s\/he is required under the Passports Act, 2008 to submit the previous passport which was issued to him\/her.

Each application received by the Passport Service must, therefore, contain relevant evidence that clearly demonstrates that person&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship before a passport can issue to him\/her. The child in question was born in the State in 2010.  His entitlement to Irish citizenship is, therefore, subject to the terms of section 6A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended (the Act).<font color=\"#004080\">  <\/font>This provides that a person, born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction at the time of that person&rsquo;s birth, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for an Irish passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four years preceding that<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>person&rsquo;s birth.   In line with guidelines provided by the Department of Justice, Equality and Defence, which is responsible for immigration and citizenship, the proofs of lawful residence of a non-EU parent, which are accepted and considered by this Department for the purposes of passport applications are immigration stamps in passports or the registration cards\/books, which are given to persons registering with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).  In some cases, letters from GNIB which provide details of issued immigration stamps, are also accepted.  These are official documents which can be objectively verified by the Department.  <\/p><p>A passport application for this child was received by the Department on 11 April 2014.  However, it could not be finalized for passport issue because the amount of his mother&rsquo;s lawful residence, which was calculated from the submitted evidence, was insufficient to demonstrate his entitlement to Irish citizenship. <\/p><p>It should be noted that the evidence of the mother&rsquo;s lawful residence, which was taken into account by the Department, was stamps in her passport, her registration card and a letter, dated 8 October, 2013, from GNIB.  (The latter detailed the stamps which were issued to her.)   <\/p><p>The Department wrote to the applicant&rsquo;s mother on 2 May, 2014 to inform her of this problem and to give her notice of the proposed decision to refuse a passport to the applicant under the Passports Act, 2008 on the grounds that he is not an Irish citizen.  This letter set a deadline of 30 May for the receipt of representations and\/or information that may be relevant to the proposed decision.  No reply has been received to this letter.<\/p><p>In terms of additional information\/evidence that may be relevant to this case, the following should be noted: <\/p><p>(i) no evidence has been presented in the submitted application that shows that the applicant&rsquo;s mother was an Irish citizen at the time of the applicant&rsquo;s birth.  If such evidence exists, it would prove that the applicant is an Irish citizen and that his entitlement is not subject to section 6A of the Act; and<\/p><p>(ii) in a recent ruling of the Supreme Court, letters from the Department of Justice, Equality and Defence, which sanctioned a parent&rsquo;s residence in the State, could be accepted as evidence of lawful residence from the date of the letter.  This was an important ruling in that a period of residence between the date of the letter and the date of a subsequent stamp, issued by GNIB, was reckonable for the purposes of section 6A of the Act.<\/p><p>If evidence in regard to the above exists, it should be submitted to the Department for consideration.  This may help to finalise this application to passport issue.<\/p><p>I have asked the Passport Service to extend the deadline for receipt of any such information up to the end of June 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200047#WRB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":112,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200047#WRB01600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Property Sales","counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200047#WRB01550"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[25023\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200047#WRB01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding a property that was sold by the National Asset Management Agency (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":113,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[25022\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200047#WRB01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding a property that was sold by the National Asset Management Agency (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":114,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 55 together.<\/p><p>  I am advised that the sale of this property is being managed by Keenan Corporate Finance (KCF) as the appointed Administrator.\u00a0 The property was placed on the open market in March 2012 with the marketing process closing in late April 2012.\u00a0 The highest bidder was Granard Motte Community Enterprise Ltd.

These reviews take into account all of the relevant issues in regard to the exemption, including any matters which may have been brought to Revenue's attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200047#WRB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget Measures","counter":118,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200047#WRB02050"},{"type":"question","counter":119,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[24999\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200047#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the impact on the budget deficit if there was no reduction in expenditure or increases in taxation in budget 2015 and there were growth rates of 1.5% and 2.0% in 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":120,"content":"<p>The fiscal forecast for 2015 contained in April's SPU is predicated on a consolidation package of &euro;2.0bn which has been well flagged over recent years and is estimated to deliver a general government deficit of 2.9% of GDP. \u00a0The no-policy change scenario sought by the Deputy will, as is the norm, be published in advance of Budget 2015.<\/p><p>  In terms of economic growth underpinning this forecast, real GDP is forecast to grow at 2.7% in 2015 and nominal GDP, which is the driver of taxes and the denominator used in the deficit \/ GDP ratio, is estimated to grow at 3.6%.

In economic terms, the demand for Irish duty paid cigarettes has moved to become much more elastic in nature, this implies an increase in price will lead to a proportionately larger decrease in consumption of Irish duty paid cigarettes resulting in an overall decrease in cigarette Excise receipts. <\/p><p>The likely reduction in consumption of Irish duty paid cigarettes (and fall in receipts) from higher duty on tobacco will arise from a combination of factors.  Some people will reduce their smoking levels; others will simply substitute their consumption to non-Irish duty paid cigarettes.  These can be either illicit or legally brought into the country.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the extent of the illicit cigarette market in Ireland is estimated through annual surveys.  These surveys are undertaken for Revenue and the National Tobacco Control Office of the Health Services Executive by Ipsos MRBI.  The analysis of the results of the survey for 2013 are not yet fully finalised but preliminary analysis indicates that 11% of cigarettes consumed in Ireland in 2013 were illicit and a further 5% of cigarettes were non Irish duty paid which were legally brought into the country.  The comparable figures for 2012 and 2011 were 13% and 14% respectively with the legally imported non Irish Duty paid cigarettes at 6% and 7%.<\/p><p>In relation to the second Question, the Revenue Commissioners advise that the annual increases in the retail price of the most popular price category (MPPC) of 20 filter tipped cigarettes since 2001 to end 2013 (the most recent period for which accurate information exists), together with the requested breakdown by tax and trade contents, are shown in the table.

The basic LPT rate can be increased or decreased by up to 15%. This is referred to as the \"local adjustment factor\" (LAF) and the earliest year that this can apply is 2015.

The Deputy will also appreciate that the contents of the confidential correspondence with the Commission may, in the event of an unfavourable decision at a future date by the Commission on foot of the State Aid investigation announced yesterday, become the subject of litigation between Ireland and the Commission.<\/p><p>  The Commission has been advised that Revenue advance opinions are non-binding and seek to clarify the tax treatment of proposed transactions or business activities under the applicable legislation, so that companies can file a correct tax return and comply fully with their tax obligations.<\/p><p>  It is normal Revenue practice to provide an advance opinion on the application of tax legislation in circumstances where there might otherwise be uncertainty and the taxpayer requires clarification of the matter. As stated above, Revenue opinions are designed to provide clarity in relation to the applicable tax rules so that taxpayers can file a correct tax return and comply fully with their tax obligations. Advance opinions set out the correct application of the law as applied to specific transactions or activities. They do not provide any 'special deal' or special treatment. <\/p><p>  As I have outlined on numerous occasions, Ireland does not do deals with multinational companies on corporate tax. Ireland's corporation tax system is statute-based and Revenue has no authority to do deals, to which the Deputy refers, with multinationals or any other taxpayers. In providing advance opinions as outlined above, Revenue has not done any deals or granted any special or favourable treatments.<\/p><p>  The European Commission announced yesterday that it will open formal State Aid investigations in a number of Member States as part of its on-going wider enquiries in relation to tax rulings and patent box regimes in a number of member states. In the case of Ireland, our understanding of the particulars of this case is that the Commission is focussing on advance opinions, provided a number of years ago in respect of the Irish operations of one company, which address the calculation of the taxable base of profits for those Irish operations. I am confident that there is no state aid rule breach in this case and we will defend all aspects vigorously.\u00a0 However, we understand that the European Commission has a responsibility to investigate potential breaches of state aid rules and, accordingly, we will continue to do everything we can to ensure that they have the full information they require.<\/p><p>  At present the Commission is not saying that there is state aid, merely that they are formally examining this case.

Ireland does not have a statutorily-binding tax ruling system.\u00a0 As stated above, advance opinions do no more than set out the correct application of the law as applied to specific transactions or activities. Advance opinions do not provide special treatment. There was no special deal in this or any other case. As there was no special treatment, we do not believe that there was any state aid. We will be providing a detailed, technical legal rebuttal of the Commission's concerns and, if necessary, will defend our position in the European Courts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200048#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Property Sales","counter":157,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200048#WRC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":158,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[25107\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200048#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the criticism in the Comptroller and Auditor General's recent report regarding off-market sales conducted by the National Asset Management Agency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":159,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to the NAMA Chief Executive's evidence before the D&aacute;il Committee of Public Accounts (PAC) on the 29<sup>th<\/sup>of May during which it was confirmed that all NAMA-related property disposals subject to review by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;amp;AG) were fully openly marketed.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the C&amp;amp;AG, as part of its recent review of NAMA, examined a sample of 144 property disposals with a gross disposal value of &euro;1 billion.\u00a0 The C&amp;amp;AG concluded &quot;overall, almost all had been sold through an open competitive process or with testing of disposal prices against market valuation&quot;.\u00a0 The C&amp;amp;AG went on to state that this provides reasonable assurance that the prices obtained by NAMA were the best on offer in the market at the time a property was sold.<\/p><p>In 4 of the 144 cases sampled, with a combined gross disposal value of &euro;500,000, the C&amp;amp;AG stated that there was no evidence at the time of the report that the properties were openly marketed.\u00a0\u00a0 However, having looked in detail at the 4 cases post publication of the C&amp;amp;AG report, NAMA has provided the C&amp;amp;AG with evidence that the 4 properties were in fact openly marketed.\u00a0 This evidence includes written confirmation from the selling agents that the properties were fully advertised through the normal channels, including on property websites such as and .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200048#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Collection","counter":160,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200048#WRC01700"},{"type":"question","counter":161,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[25108\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200048#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide full details, including all relevant statistics, of the Revenue Commissioners' efforts to collect any unpaid household charge and local property tax liability; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":162,"content":"<p> I am advised by Revenue that it has collected over &euro;291m to date in 2014 in respect of Local Property Tax (LPT) and Household Charge (HHC). This figure is approximately 8% ahead of target up to 31 May 2014.<\/p><p>  In regard to HHC, Revenue has collected over &euro;20m in respect of more than 122,000 properties since it assumed responsibility for securing the outstanding liabilities. Approximately &euro;18m of this amount, in respect of almost 112,000 properties, has been collected since Revenue launched its compliance campaign earlier this year. Revenue has also largely dealt with 70,000 items of HHC related correspondence which was received since the compliance campaign started.\u00a0 On that basis, Revenue is in a position this week to move on to debt collection\/enforcement action against those who have still not complied, as previously advised to property owners.<\/p><p>  In regard to LPT compliance, the Deputy will be aware that Revenue has to date achieved a compliance rate of 94% in respect of 2013 and a 91% rate in respect of 2014 and will, in tandem with HHC compliance action, move on to debt collection\/enforcement action against LPT non-compliers over the coming weeks.<\/p><p>  The actions to be deployed against HHC\/LPT non-compliers will include deduction from employment income for PAYE workers or from occupational pensions or certain Government payments where appropriate. The actions to be deployed against self-assessed taxpayers, some of which have already been used, will include withholding of Tax Clearance Certification, surcharges on Income Tax, Corporation Tax and Capital Gains Tax returns and withholding\/offset of any other tax refunds. The actions will also include referral to a Sheriff or Solicitor or the use of Attachment where it is appropriate to do so. Interest on late payment at a rate of 0.0219% per day, may also be included in any enforcement action, which will be calculated from the relevant due date up to the date of payment.\u00a0 The Deputy will agree that these actions have been well flagged by Revenue.<\/p><p>  Revenue has advised me that approximately 50,000 letters will issue this week to property owners who are taxed under the PAYE system informing them that notifications are issuing to their employers instructing them (the employers) to deduct the &euro;200 HHC liability from salary over the remaining pay periods in 2014. These amounts will be in addition to any deductions that may already be in place in respect of LPT. Following the issue of the letters to the property owners, Revenue will then issue the instruction to their employer or occupational pension provider to deduct the amount due over the rest of the year. Revenue has advised me that the production schedule for the employer instruction takes a seven day turnaround from the issue of the letter to the property owner and if the property owner pays (or makes payment arrangements) or can show Revenue that they are not liable within 5 days of the date of the letter, Revenue will be able to stop the issue of the instruction. If the owner pays (or makes payment arrangements) or can show Revenue that they are not liable after the instruction is issued, Revenue will cancel the instruction immediately, depending on the employer's payroll cycle. \u00a0If deductions have started credit will be given for any payment taken. These arrangements are set out in the letters to property owners.<\/p><p>  A further 20,000 letters will issue towards the end of this week to property owners who have not paid the HHC and whose only source of income is from the Department of Social Protection. The letters will advise the owners that they are likely to be eligible for a deferral of the &euro;200 charge which will be granted automatically unless they contact Revenue to pay the amount due (or make payment arrangements) or advise why they may not be liable. The deferral will be liable to the reduced interest charge of 4% per annum (compared to c. 8% in non compliant cases).<\/p><p>  Further tranches of letters will issue to non-compliant property owners taxed through the PAYE system in respect of combinations of HHC, 2013 LPT and 2014 LPT liabilities (as relevant) over the remaining weeks of June and the first week of July. These letters will again confirm that notices are issuing to employers\/pension providers to start deductions at source as soon as possible within the payment cycle.<\/p><p>  Revenue has also advised me that payment demand letters in respect of combinations of outstanding HHC, 2013 LPT and 2014 LPT liabilities will issue to all property owners taxed under self-assessment system during June and early July. The demand letters will confirm that the outstanding liabilities will be referred to Sheriffs or Solicitors for collection or will be the subject of Attachment orders unless payment is immediately received. It is important to realise that once a debt is referred to a Sheriff or Solicitor the property owner must deal with that body rather than Revenue in regard to issues such as phased payments, etc. In addition the property owner will be liable to pay the Sheriff's costs which will increase the overall liability by something in the region of 10% of the amount due.<\/p><p>  In total Revenue anticipates that in excess of 200,000 compliance letters will have issued by early July, though this number will most likely reduce as property owners decide to pay their outstanding liabilities to avoid the additional expense and embarrassment that comes with Revenue debt collection\/enforcement activity.<\/p><p>  Finally, I want to commend Revenue for the job it has done to date in achieving such high collection and compliance rates in respect of both LPT and the arrears of HHC. This is particularly the case in regard to HHC, where the liability doubled from &euro;100 to &euro;200 if not paid by 1 July 2013, which obviously increased the collection\/compliance challenge. I have no doubt that the increased liability has also placed a strain on property owners that could have been avoided if the original charge had been paid on time. I am concerned that this unnecessary increased liability and stress of dealing with Revenue arose, in some instances, on foot of poor advice to citizens by some commentators. \u00a0While I fully support political debate in the design and development of our laws, I would urge all those advising citizens to bear in mind that the consequences, for example in the case of the Household Charge, is an increased liability. \u00a0I strongly recommend anyone who receives one of these letters from Revenue to act now and pay or make arrangements to pay any outstanding liability by following the instructions included on the letter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200048#WRC01900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Data","counter":163,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200048#WRC02000"},{"type":"question","counter":164,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[25109\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200048#WRC02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"for each State-supported bank, if he will provide details of the amount of principal dwelling house mortgage debt written off so far this year including agreements to write off mortgage debt in the future subject to conditions being met; the number of mortgages affected; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":165,"content":"<p>I have been\u00a0provided\u00a0with the following information by\u00a0AIB and permanent tsb.<\/p><p>AIB<\/p><p>All relevant data in relation to AIB s mortgage portfolios, including arrears data, for December 2013 are made on pages 71 to 119 of AIB s 2013 Annual Financial Report, published on 5 March 2014.<\/p><p>Permanent TSB<\/p><p>PTSB\u00a0for the year to end May 2014 has charged off\/written off circa &euro;55m of Home Loan Mortgage Debt representing 349 cases. \u00a0In addition, it has entered into insolvency and voluntary disposal arrangements with customers that will result in debt write-off of a further circa &euro;0.5m (4 cases) subject to customers meeting the terms of these agreements.Separately in relation to\u00a0Bank of Ireland I would draw your attention to\u00a0the disclosures on its Irish mortgage portfolios, including mortgage arrears,\u00a0in its Annual Financial Report on pages 381-398, while there is additional asset quality data on pages 79 to 98 which is relevant.

The contents of the report will be considered as part of\u00a0deliberations for Budget 2015.<\/p><p>  To address the specific points raised in the details supplied by the Deputy;-<\/p><p>  1. The figures quoted by TASC regarding the achievement of a net increase in pay for employees at certain income levels relates to the step effect in the PRSI system which brings all income into charge once the relevant threshold is reached. While such an effect is\u00a0never ideal, it is necessary to achieve the desired yield, which\u00a0in itself contributes to keeping\u00a0workers on\u00a0incomes lower than the threshold to remain outside\u00a0the charge to\u00a0employee PRSI entirely.<\/p><p>  2. A single person on income of &euro;40,000, while subject to a marginal rate of income tax of 41%, may\u00a0pay an effective rate of income tax of 10%, when tax credits, bands and reliefs are taken into account. Effective tax rates are calculated by dividing the amount of income tax paid (excluding PRSI and USC) by the total income of an individual, and would usually take account of any tax reliefs, incentives or deductions claimed. This differs from the marginal tax rate paid on the last euro of income.\u00a0The availability of tax credits, standard rate bands and other tax reliefs means that the effective rate of income tax paid by an individual will always be lower than the marginal rate payable. For example, tax credits for single employees ensure that the first &euro;16,500 of income is not liable to income tax at all.<\/p><p>  3. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they\u00a0estimate that just over\u00a017% of income earners were liable to\u00a0Income Tax at the 41% rate in 2013. These figures are provisional. It is incorrect to state that the remainder of taxpayers would not benefit from rate or band changes. A reduction in the lower (20%) tax rate would benefit some of these taxpayers, while an increase in the standard rate band could ensure that those workers that are on the brink of paying\u00a0the higher rate of income tax currently, could benefit from a pay increase, without becoming subject to the higher rate of income tax going forward.<\/p><p>  4. I can confirm to the Deputy that Ireland does indeed have the lowest tax wedge of all EU members, for those\u00a0on average wages, as calculated by the OECD. The Tax Wedge is defined as the sum of personal income tax plus employee and employer social security contributions together with any payroll taxes less cash transfers, expressed as a percentage of labour costs. It is the difference between what an employer has to pay in terms of gross wages plus taxes to hire an employee and the net revenue received by that employee after deduction of all taxes on their wages. These figures also take into account social insurance payments made by employers. A competitive tax wedge is considered vital in encouraging employment growth across all income categories and to incentivise individuals to remain in or return to the labour market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200049#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Application","counter":188,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200049#WRD01350"},{"type":"question","counter":189,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[25165\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200049#WRD01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will introduce concessions on the local property tax for pensioners who are in receipt of the household benefits package; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":190,"content":"<p>The Government decided that a liability to the Local Property Tax (LPT)\u00a0should apply to all owners of residential properties with a limited number of exemptions.

However Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis, regardless of what title is given to them.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment, on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees.  For example; the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000 requires any persons under a contract of employment to be paid the statutory National Minimum Wage.  For the purposes of this Act, this means a contract of service or apprenticeship, or any other contract whereby an individual agrees with another person to do or perform personally any work or service for that person.<\/p><p>Au pair is a cultural term used to describe a student or young adult who travels to a foreign country to live with a family, learn the local language and culture.  The use of this term to define a relationship between a host family and an individual does not in itself mean that an employee\/employer relationship does not exist; this will be decided based on employment law and the individual characteristics of the relationship.  Non-EEA nationals who wish to take up a role as an au pair in Ireland require a visa from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), which comes within the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality.  With regard to student visas issued by INIS, I would point out that non-EEA nationals attending designated full-time courses of study are normally allowed under the terms of the visa to take up casual employment of up to 20 hours part-time work per week during academic terms or up to 40 hours per week during normal college vacation periods.  <\/p><p>Where the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), which comes within the remit of my Department, receives a complaint involving somebody described as an au pair, NERA will investigate with a view to establishing the person&rsquo;s statutory entitlements under employment law (including whether the term &ldquo;au pair&rdquo; is being used to avoid statutory obligations).  NERA has encountered individuals, described by their employers as au pairs, who have been found to be domestic employees.  In such cases NERA will seek to vindicate the rights of all workers in accordance with its mandate and powers under employment legislation. <\/p><p>As part of the ongoing NERA campaign on the rights of domestic workers, NERA will shortly be launching an information leaflet to raise awareness of the rights of domestic workers and of employers&rsquo; obligations in this area. As part of that process the issue of working hours and wages of domestic workers will be highlighted, as will avenues for redress where workers feel they are not getting their rights.<\/p><p>Given that Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis, I have no plans to make changes to the existing body of employment rights legislation in this context.  An opinion regarding the question as to whether a person is an employee or not is formed by NERA and\/or the relevant employment rights dispute settlement body within the provisions of existing employment legislation and established contract law based on the facts of each case and not based on whether the term au pair is used or not.<\/p><p>Where a person has concerns that employees may be exploited or are receiving less than their statutory entitlement, the matter can be reported to NERA for investigation.  Cases for redress on matters relating to employment rights legislation can be made on the workplace relations complaint form available from NERA or online at .  NERA has a dedicated information service, Workplace Relations Customer Service, which provides information on all aspects of employment rights.  This service operates from 9.30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays and can be contacted on Lo-Call 1890 808090.  Workplace Relations Customer Service also provides extensive information on employment rights on its website www.workplacerelations.ie.   <\/p><p>I would urge the Deputy, if he is aware of any case where an employee is being exploited in this context, to report the specifics to NERA for investigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200052#WRG01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":263,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 102 and 103 answered with Question No. 99.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":264,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200053#WRH00250"},{"type":"question","counter":265,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[25125\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200053#WRH00300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will provide a detailed list in tabular form of all staff vacancies, within his Department and in each agency under his Department's remit, at Principal Officer grade or above, including the title of the vacant post and the functional area to which it belongs; the length of time the post has been vacant; the salary attached to the post in question; in respect of agencies where Civil Service grades do not apply, if he will include vacancies where the post attracts a salary equivalent to or greater than a Principal Officer grade; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Hence, as I have previously outlined in relation to this matter in the Oireachtas, the new amalgamated Competition and Consumer Protection Commission will be the independent body assigned responsibility for overseeing and enforcing these regulations which I will make under this Act.  This new body will be given the powers to enforce the regulations and will build on the considerable enforcement and investigative powers that the two current bodies have built-up over the last few years rather than start afresh with a new body.  Contravention of the regulations will be an offence as will failure to comply with any contravention notice issued by the new Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  That body will also have the power to publically list all undertakings that have contravened either the regulations or failed to comply with the contravention notices: this will inform consumers on which undertakings are not abiding by the regulations.  It will also be able to act on its own initiative or on the basis of information supplied to it.

As Minister with responsibility for co-ordinating the Decade of Centenaries, I have been following the historical timeline closely, marking key stages in the progress of the 3<sup>rd<\/sup>Home Rule Bill through the parliament at Westminster. To mark the centenary of the introduction of the Bill, an exhibition was prepared that was hosted at Westminster in London, at the Houses of the Oireachtas and the National Library of Ireland in Dublin, and at Stormont in Belfast. This exhibition set the 3<sup>rd<\/sup>Home Rule Bill in its historical context and provided an insight into the political forces that drove, and restricted, the progress of the Bill. As the Bill was introduced in April 1912, I arranged, on its centenary in April 2012, the 'Redmond Memorial Lectures' in Waterford delivered by Frank Callinan SC and Dermot Meleady (see for further information). <\/p><p>My Department also supported the production of a supplement to the Irish Times <i>&quot;Home Rule and Ulster's Resistance&quot;<\/i>that was distributed free of charge to schools.  The provision of information, resources and primary source material has been a cornerstone of my strategy to commemorate important events and I am pleased to note that this week the RT&Eacute;\/<i>Century Ireland<\/i>project, supported by my Department, is publishing details of John Redmond's moves to forge close links between the Irish Parliamentary Party and the Irish Volunteers in June 1914.<\/p><p>I have attended a number of events in Westminster highlighting the historical importance and the enduring significance of the Home Rule campaign and legislation. In January 2013, in partnership with NIO Minister Penning and Lord Bew, we arranged for a special presentation to mark the centenary of the second passing of the Bill. <\/p><p>Indeed, I am pleased to say that on 1 July next, I will be attending again at Westminster for a commemorative event arranged by the Speaker of the Commons, John Bercow, MP.  With contributions from John Bruton, Baroness Shirley Williams, Lord Paul Bew and Professor Michael Laffan, the event will attended by over 100 invited guests from parliament, media and academic life.  I hope to arrange that the proceedings will subsequently be available online.<\/p><p>While I am keen to ensure that the life and work of John Redmond is given appropriate recognition in the Decade of Centenaries, the role of other distinguished members of the Irish Parliamentary party should also be reflected. Initiatives rooted in the areas and communities from which they were elected would be particularly welcome. The specific arrangements for the anniversary of the legislation on 18 September and the address by John Redmond at Woodenbridge on 20 September 2014 remain under consideration and will include publication of historical resource material.<\/p><p>As indicated in the recent announcement of capital expenditure on commemorative projects, I consider it appropriate that provision is being made to restore the burial vault of John Redmond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200057#WRM00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Parks Projects","counter":361,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200057#WRM00650"},{"type":"question","counter":362,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[25082\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200057#WRM00700","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"noting the recent welcome allocation of &euro;100,000, when works on repairing roads in Killarney National Park will commence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":363,"content":"<p>My Department continually reviews the condition of infrastructure, including roadways, in the National Parks and, where funding is available, priority maintenance and upgrading is carried out.

These changes must be managed and, in this context, it was necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the Local Property Tax to be retained in each local authority for 2014.<\/p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and, therefore, a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates. A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.<\/p><p>  In 2015, in addition to the changes in water services funding, local authorities will be required to implement changes to their budget process arising from EU obligations, which will require them to prepare draft budget strategies by the end of September 2014 and will also have the power to vary Local Property Tax rates by up to 15%. Together, these are further significant changes to the current local government funding model and it is essential that the impacts are fully assessed and that the effect on overall Exchequer funding is managed appropriately. <\/p><p>  My Department is currently considering the local government sector funding model for 2015, including the legislative implications, if any, in consultation with all relevant Government Departments. We will continue to work with local authorities to ensure that they have an appropriate level of information in a timely manner that facilitates their budget process for next year.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200058#WRN01600","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Leader Programmes Expenditure","counter":401,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200059#WRO00075"},{"type":"question","counter":402,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[25087\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200059#WRO00100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the amount allocated for projects under the current Leader programme; the amount spent to date, including to date in 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I have no immediate plans to introduce a formal determination procedure but will keep the matter under review, having regard also to developments in other jurisdictions and the nature of their determination procedures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200062#WRR00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":473,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200062#WRR00550"},{"type":"question","counter":474,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[25066\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200062#WRR00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to legislate in order to ensure  there is passport-free travel for qualifying persons travelling within the common travel area; her views on a Bill regarding this issue (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":475,"content":"<p>I have no plans to introduce legislation of the nature proposed by the Deputy and I consider that such legislation is not necessary at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200062#WRR00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Order Offences","counter":476,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200062#WRR00750"},{"type":"question","counter":477,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[25075\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061200062#WRR00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the laws that prevent a member of the public who is of a different political persuasion from videoing, following and harassing a public representative who is out in a housing estate canvassing and calling door to door to meet with members of the public and to listen to their complaints and problems; the penalties and remedies for those subject to this type of bullying and harassment by professional protestors; her plans to improve the law in this area; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":478,"content":"<p>While I can not speculate as to what, if any, legislative provision is applicable to the circumstances of any particular incident, I would note that there are provisions of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Non Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 which may be relevant to the general issue which the Deputy raises.

Intervention is provided as appropriate ensuring at all times that it is proportionate and in accordance with an assessment of the child's needs.
