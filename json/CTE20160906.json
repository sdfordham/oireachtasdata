While a wide range of available indicators confirm that the economy is performing well, two factors have made it more difficult to get a clear picture of the performance of, and the outlook for, the economy.  I refer first, to the recent large revisions to the Irish national accounts, particularly the very large upward revision to the values of GDP and GNP in 2015, and second, to the outcome of the Brexit referendum in the UK, which has introduced significant risk and uncertainty to the outlook for the economy.<\/p> <p>  Although recent GDP and GNP measures significantly overstated the growth of domestic economic activity in Ireland in 2015, this should not overshadow the tangible improvement that has taken place.  A wide range of more reliable domestic spending and activity indicators suggest that the domestic economy is continuing to expand at a reasonably healthy pace.  In particular, consumer spending has continued to grow at a relatively strong pace, supported by solid gains in employment and increasing earnings.  Investment, net of intangibles and aircraft, has also been contributing to strong domestic demand, with both core machinery and equipment and construction investment recording double-digit annual growth rates.<\/p> <p>  A better reflection of what is happening in the domestic economy is provided by the underlying domestic demand indicator that was developed recently by economists in the bank.  This is defined as the sum of personal expenditure on goods and services, net government expenditure on goods and services and investment excluding aircraft and intangible assets.  This measure grew at a strong pace, close to 5%, in 2015.  The strength of the domestic economy was also reflected in an increase of 2.5% in employment.  These underlying developments present a more accurate picture of the underlying growth dynamic of the domestic economy.<\/p> <p>  However, estimates and indicators such as these are merely rough approximations.  In view of the distortions now associated with the conventional GDP and GNP aggregates, there is a need to develop more meaningful commonly agreed measures of the level of Irish economic activity that accurately mirror developments in the economy.  In this context, the bank welcomes the CSO's initiative in establishing a consultative group that will consider, among other things, the potential for the development of new indicators that will enhance our understanding of the Irish economy.  This group will be chaired by the Governor of the Central Bank.<\/p> <p>  Looking ahead, any assessment of the outlook for the economy is further complicated by the outcome of the Brexit referendum in the UK.  The economic impact of Brexit on Ireland is difficult to estimate with precision.  It is clear, however, that the impact on the Irish economy will be negative and material in the short and longer terms.<\/p><p> The long-term economic impact of Brexit on Ireland will be influenced by the nature of the withdrawal agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  The nature and scale of the eventual macroeconomic impact will reflect the extent to which the exit arrangements bring about changes in free movement of goods, services, capital and labour.  Trade, foreign direct investment and the labour market are the key channels for the macroeconomic effects of Brexit.  Any agreement which keeps UK access to the Single Market largely intact would have a more limited impact but the scale of the impact could be much more significant under more restrictive agreements.<\/p><p> In the short term, adverse effects on the Irish economy, as well as the UK and broader European economies, arise mainly from the macroeconomic, financial and currency market effects of Brexit-related uncertainty.  An important element of this uncertainty revolves around the nature of the long-term relationship between the UK and EU, how long it will take to work out that relationship and how it will impact in the interim.  This heightened uncertainty is likely to dampen consumer demand and, in particular, investment decisions by firms.  While the economy has become less reliant on the United Kingdom for trade over recent decades, the UK remains a particularly important market for many indigenous firms.  Some sectors, particularly agrifood, clothing and footwear, and tourism, continue to have a high dependency on the UK and, consequently, could be affected disproportionately.<\/p><p> The Central Bank&rsquo;s latest forecast was published in our quarterly bulletin on 27 July and covers the years 2016 and 2017.  As well as taking into account information from the latest economic indicators, the forecasts are based on a set of technical assumptions regarding variables such as exchange rates and foreign demand.  Importantly, the forecasts incorporate an estimated negative effect of Brexit on the economy, amounting to -0.2 percentage points in 2016 and -0.6 percentage points in 2017.  Overall, we forecast GDP growth rates of just under 5% in 2016 and 3.6% in 2017.  We see continuing employment growth, with total numbers employed expected to rise by around 70,000 over the two years.  Unemployment is expected to decline towards 7%.  Supported by continued solid gains in employment, underlying domestic demand is projected to grow by 4% this year and to slow to 3% in 2017.  This slowdown reflects a projected negative impact from Brexit-related factors, some normalisation of the catch-up growth seen in earlier years and a fading of the positive effects of lower oil prices on household real incomes.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding this slowdown in domestic demand, the outlook for the economy remains broadly favourable, with unemployment set to continue to fall further.  While the forecasts I have presented are deemed to be the most likely outcome given the available information, they are subject to risks.  At the current juncture, the risks are clearly weighted to the downside.  This reflects the possibility of a more adverse Brexit impact on the UK economy, a larger spillover to the broader international economy or the potential for more negative domestic confidence and labour market effects than we have incorporated into the forecasts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016090600002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Fagan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1473163200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Dr. Fagan places great store in consumer spending as a measure of real growth in the economy.

It is not a widely used international measure.  However, from the available data, we could construct such a measure but I am pretty sure that when we do that, the comparison of Irish growth with the growth elsewhere in the euro area will clearly show much stronger growth performance using this indicator than in the rest of the euro area.  With regard to credibility, we are at an early stage.

The slightly weaker VAT receipts are a little bit surprising given the strength in retail sales, car sales, etc.  Similarly the income tax receipts from the labour markets are performing quite well and there is quite strong growth in employment.  The VAT receipts are a little bit surprising but I would not be overly concerned.  The profile that is published around the time of the budget is a guide and an estimate.  One can get timing issues that can sometimes mean that revenue grows a little bit faster than expected at some points in the year and slower than expected at other points.  I think it is too early in that one needs to look at the underlying indicators which are still quite positive.  It may not be the case that VAT is behind target at the end of the year.  The VAT target for this year is just under &euro;13 billion so the slippage in that context is not huge.  I would not be too worried about it.  Overall actual tax receipts are growing strongly.

Clearly, we require a lot of investment in schools, third level, training and skilling people and productivity to grow the economy in the future.  We also have enormous difficulties and huge unmet demands with regard to housing.  I was a little bit taken aback by the letter, published last evening, from the Governor of the Central Bank to the Minister for Finance.  While I understand the tone of prudence in the letter, I was very surprised to see the Governor suggesting that because of risk factors, we would lower the requirement in relation to reducing debt levels below the EU standard of 60%.  The Governor did not pick a figure but if this was adopted as an immediate policy in this budget, quite a lot of people would describe it as putting a noose around our neck at a time when we have significant population and demographic pressures and when we have real needs that can only be met partly by a sustained cycle of capital investment.

They do not dictate the level of public expenditure.  That is a matter of choice for the countries.

First, the 60% is not a target, it is a ceiling.  If the country has a lower debt, it is still meeting that ceiling.  The main motivation in the Governor&rsquo;s mind was that judging from the experience of the economy in the past ten to 20 years, this is a very volatile economy and, therefore, there is a need to have in place sufficient buffers so that when an adverse shock hits the economy, we are in a position to respond to that with fiscal policy.  In the past when adverse shocks hit the economy, we had to have fiscal contraction, tightening of fiscal policy, which exacerbated the cyclical situation, worsened unemployment and so forth.  That is the underlying motivation for the idea of a long-term debt target, to put in a buffer so that when adverse events happen to the economy, we can respond with fiscal policy without violating the rules.<\/p> <p>  The second point is that this is not a short-term suggestion.  We already have our fiscal rules and budgetary plans.  This is more a case of asking what we can do over the long term.  Once we have reached a budget, which is more or less balanced in structural terms, the 60% target, where do we go?  It comes in there.  It does not say next year take fiscal measures to hit a debt target.  Third, it should be noted that under reasonable assumptions on growth, which are very reasonable, simply maintaining a balanced budget will lead to significant falls in the debt ratio over time, so it will not necessarily require any additional fiscal consolidation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016090600002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Fagan"},{"type":"speech","time":1473163200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>The point of my question is the impact on low levels of capital investment arising out of the crisis which almost everybody is anxious to see increased in the context of demographic pressures.

If one looks back, even before the last revision from the CSO we were having problems with a whole range of things, including contract manufacturing and redomiciled firms.  Back in the 1980s I was working in the bank as an economist and we were also encountering difficulties with transactions relating to multinationals.  It is a longstanding problem.  It became very acute with the release we saw relating to 2015, but this problem results from the fact that the rules that are written for the standard economy, like the US, may give rise to indicators that may be less useful, if not sometimes unhelpful, for understanding what is going on in an economy like Ireland.

First, the target stock of public debt naturally varies across countries in line with different risk exposures: the volatile nature of the Irish macro-financial system and the history of crises suggests a debt target that should be materially below the appropriate level for a larger, more stable economy.<\/blockquote> <p>Dr. Fagan gave his answers to this point earlier on.  We know the debt-GDP ratio but if he is suggesting a lower percentage of GDP, on what GDP figures would it be based?  Would the GDP figures include aircraft leasing and intangible assets or would they exclude them?  I want to be fair to the Governor but I read from the letter that he is saying we should lower borrowing in excess of the rules.

If GDP does not give an accurate reflection of production in the economy, debt-GDP may be a misleading indicator.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has addressed this issue and come up with alternative denominators.  Instead of looking at debt to GDP they look at another indicator which is linked to the revenue-generating capacity of the economy.  I am sure the group chaired by the Governor can make further progress in the area of alternative indicators.<\/p> <p>  In his letter on the medium-term debt target, the Governor is talking about the longer term.  He is not talking about the next few years but about what happens to the economy after we achieve a balanced budget and the 60% target.  He is not saying there has to be fiscal contraction but that we need to bear in mind the fact that the economy is subject to severe volatility in comparison with other countries.  What is right for Germany may not be right for Ireland and that should be borne in mind.  To achieve a lower debt ratio than 60% in the circumstances that are likely to prevail would not require major cutbacks or fiscal consolidation.  Maintaining a balanced budget for a period of time would allow for a fall in the debt-GDP ratio towards the medium-term target.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016090600002#AA00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Fagan"},{"type":"speech","time":1473163200,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I understand that Dr. Fagan is limited in what he can say about the Apple ruling.

We have the Apple case, a massive revision of our GDP figures and a third lesser, but not insignificant, issue was the failure of some of our clearing banks to pass the EU stress tests.  They were among the few banks on the warning lists in the stress tests which took place earlier in the summer.  In its economic analysis, had the Central Bank expected the situation of our banks to be as it was in the stress tests?  In the letter the Governor of the Central Bank sent to the Minister for Finance, he states the credit cycle remains subdued and this is reflected in the current zero value of the countercyclical capital buffer.  I would appreciate if the witnesses would explain what exactly is a zero value of a countercyclical capital buffer?  In the Central Bank's economic analysis, how does it see the state of our banks and the credit environment affecting our economic prospects?  I will ask more questions later if possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016090600002#CC00900","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473163200,"counter":91,"content":"<p>The Deputy's second question is more straightforward.  The countercyclical capital buffer is part of the new macro prudential framework which now exists in Europe and the essential idea is to act against the credit cycle.  When credit is booming banks are required to have higher capital ratios and when credit is weak it is possible to lower these ratios.  The Central Bank, as the macro prudential authority, is responsible for setting these countercyclical capital buffers for Ireland.  On the basis of all of the analysis we have up to now, we have set these capital buffers at zero.  We are stating that on the basis of our evidence there is no sign of credit overheating in the Irish economy, which would warrant a requirement for banks to hold much more capital against it.<\/p><p>I do not know whether that explains the question.  Of course, all over Europe countries are required to set counter-cyclical capital buffers.  Most have set it at zero.  I think, prior to Brexit, the UK set its counter-cyclical capital buffer at 0.5, but it has since reduced it to zero.  Therefore, this is part of the new European macro-prudential framework which it is hoped aims at least to mitigate the problems that were seen with credit cycles in the past.<\/p><p> On the stress test, it is important to say that there was no pass or fail, in contrast to previous stress tests.  The relative performance of the Irish banks in the stress test reflected two or three facts.  One was that the shocks implemented in Ireland were higher than elsewhere.  That reflects the methodology of calibrating the shocks, which is based on historical performance.  Ireland is a volatile economy so one would have larger shocks in Ireland than in other countries.<\/p><p> The second element is that, despite the enormous improvements that have been made in terms of restoring bank profitability and reducing the level of non-performing loans, NPLs, the level of non-performing loans in Irish banks is still high relative to those in other countries.  In a stress test that would have the implication that Irish banks would be more severely affected.  The last consideration is that technically it is a static balance sheet exercise, based on the balance sheet at the end of December 2015.<\/p><p> Were the banks surprised?  Not necessarily because we are all aware of the issues of the very high level of NPLs.  In the context of the IMF's financial sector assessment programme, FSAP, we had also carried out a number of stress test exercises which were published.  In that sense, we were not surprised or shocked by the results.  However, the important point to understand about the stress test is that, as I said, there is no pass or fail.  There is no automatic response.  The stress test provides information to supervisors who will use that along with a whole pile of other information they use, in the context of what is called the supervisory review and evaluation process, SREP.  Basically, it is dealing on a bank-by-bank basis, looking at what actions banks need to take in terms of securing their capital position, capital guidance and so forth.  That is the status of the stress test.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016090600002#CC01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Fagan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1473163200,"counter":93,"content":"<p>One of the other interesting thrift figures in the summer was the returns being ahead or behind profile in some cases.

Are there any risks that the Central Bank assesses itself, or indeed potential that there would again be further above-profile incomes coming on the Central Bank's own balance sheet?<\/p> <p>  I have one final question on that.  I heard Dr. Fagan say to Deputy Doherty that he cannot advise political decisions around individual tax measures.  From his economic assessment, however, on a broader outline if the investment choice, let us say, was between either investing in capital infrastructure here, current spending or reductions in tax income, is there one that he would favour, given the macroeconomics and given that we have a zero value counter-cyclical capital buffer in our banking system?

That is one component.<\/p> <p>  The second component, and a very important one in the past year or so and maybe looking forward, is the capital gains made by disposals of part of the special portfolio, the IBRC related bonds.  There have been quite significant capital gains as we disposed of parts of that portfolio.  These are then passed on to the Exchequer as part of the surplus income.  There is a restriction in the rules at to what the Exchequer can do with that, so it cannot necessarily finance current expenditure from those capital gains, but that is part of the EUROSTAT rules.<\/p><p>The nice thing, in a way, is that the surplus income of the bank is remitted to the Exchequer in the following year.  So, in a way, for the year 2016, we know what the surplus income is, so there should be no particular shocks there.  For 2017, that will depend on the 2016 surplus income.  We are not finally through the year so we cannot give the committee a definitive answer there but it is very unlikely that it will turn out lower than it was in 2016.  Basically, in the short term -  2017 and 2018 - we would not be seeing significant risks but having said that, it has to be stressed that a lot depends on the policy with regard to the speed of sales of the special portfolio.  Depending on how fast sales take place and the price at which the sales take place, that will influence the capital gains.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016090600002#DD00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Fagan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1473163200,"counter":96,"content":"<p>In terms of the broad macro-economic assessment, is it capital, current or tax reductions we should favour?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016090600002#EE00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473163200,"counter":97,"content":"<p>If one is looking at the macro-economic impacts of different measures, there are model simulation results.

I have a few questions which I will rattle through now and then the witnesses can address them.  The first is on the Anglo Irish Bank promissory note which I believe has budgetary implications.  The Central Bank has taken a different payment schedule to the minimum that was agreed or the profile that was negotiated on the night it was voted through.  I appreciate that the witnesses will not have the figures with them today but I ask them to supply to the committee the figures showing the minimum profile that was agreed as part of the Anglo Irish Bank promissory note deal in terms of &euro;500 million per year that had to be sold off and so forth as well as figures on what the Central Bank has actually done.  My understanding is that it has been turned into sovereign debt significantly ahead of requirement.  I also ask the witness to provide the committee with data on the implications for the fiscal space if Ireland were to take the decision to pause these payments.<\/p> <p>  I pose my second question in the context of the vulture funds and the decision that has been taken to close down the section 110 status they are using to avoid paying taxes on economic activity and profits generated on such activity in Ireland.  I know the Central Bank has written a paper on shadow banking and has raised various concerns because, as Deputy Boyd Barrett said earlier, nobody really knows what is going on.  Neither the Central Bank nor anyone else knows the risks.  We do not really know what is happening in the shadow banking world.  The Central Bank is beginning to collect data on the special purpose vehicles, SPVs, but obviously there is a whole other piece to it which the bank, as I understand it, has not even started looking at as it is currently focused on trying to get its head around the SPV area.<\/p> <p>  One very serious area of potential tax avoidance, again on economic activity entirely within Ireland, is the real estate investment trusts, REITs.  I am being told that while local landlords are paying an awful lot of tax on rental income, which is subject to PRSI, USC and so forth, some REITs are using similar tax avoidance mechanisms essentially to offshore all their profits.  I imagine this is something the Central Bank has an opinion on, certainly within the context of its examination of the shadow banking sector.  Does the Central Bank have a view on this?  Is it something the bank is looking at and can it advise this committee on it?  I and my colleagues will be looking for data on the projected impact of closing down the vulture fund loopholes on the fiscal space.  I would like to know if the Central Bank has a view on the same question for the REITs.<\/p> <p>  My third question is on lending rates in Ireland.  The commercial sector is paying significantly more for loans here than in Germany or France.  The banks have told the finance committee in previous years that this was because of their own costs of lending and that the margin that Irish banks are making is no higher than anywhere else.  If lending rates can be brought down, I imagine we will see significantly more private sector investment, economic growth and job creation.<\/p><p>Does the Central Bank have a view on how the State can help the commercial banks reduce their average costs of capital so they can pass on those reductions to businesses in Ireland for lending?<\/p><p> I will finish with a technical question.  Dr. Fagan referred at some length to the new calculation and to the fact that we try to understand what is going on in the Irish economy.  GDP is \"C+I+G+(X - M)\".  We are using \"C\", consumer spending; some of \"I\", commercial investment minus aircraft leasing and intangible assets; and \"G\".  So \"C+I+G\" is there with \"I\" adjusted.  If I understand correctly, the bank has taken out the \"(X-M)\" bit, which is net exports.  That makes sense to me if they are multinational net exports because they do not necessarily reflect what is happening in the real economy in Ireland.  Why has the bank taken out \"(X-M)\" for the indigenous sector?  It seems that this piece is a legitimate area for consideration for real economic activity in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016090600002#FF00600","speaker":"1230","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473163200,"counter":110,"content":"<p>In respect of the special portfolio, the minimum schedule is publicly available information so we can certainly make that available to Deputy Donnelly.  I am not sure about the extent of sales from the portfolio but I will put Deputy Donnelly's request to my colleagues who work on that and see if they can put together information for him that would address his question.  I am not sure if we can have much analysis on the impact of these portfolio sales on the fiscal space but I would not want to promise Deputy Donnelly something we could not deliver.<\/p> <p>  The last question raised by Deputy Donnelly concerned GDP and the underlying domestic situation.  His point is correct.  If we were trying to construct a measure underlying GDP, it would be wrong to exclude all exports and imports or net trade but that is not what we are trying to do with this measure.  This is a measure of underlying domestic demand.  Domestic demand is defined as consumption, investment, change in stocks and Government consumption.  That is the usual measure and we are saying that it is completely distorted.  It is misleading when one looks at that number.  One gets a more accurate picture when one extracts these components so that is what we are trying to do.  We are not saying that it is an alternative measure of GDP.  Rather, it is an alternative measure of domestic demand - what sort of demand is in the domestic economy.  <\/p> <p>  The other questions on shadow banking are slightly beyond what we were thinking of here.  The Central Bank is engaged with the Financial Stability Board in Basel as part of a global effort to identify and monitor the shadow banking system not just in Ireland but worldwide so it is part of an ongoing international engagement.  As Deputy Donnelly said, we have made major progress in terms of SPVs but that still leaves other elements that need to be addressed.  This is an ongoing project that is targeted in collaboration with international partners.

It is possible there are opportunities.  I am interested to hear the thoughts of the witnesses on the risks in this regard.<\/p> <p>  A number of committee members have referred to the figure for headline GDP, which is an important accepted indicator.  With due respect to ourselves as a country and the Central Bank, working on our own model is an important exercise but I presume that some of the many other open vulnerable small economies must have experienced similar situations to ourselves, including among our EU partners.  Has any collaborative work been done?  There would be much more strength in a model devised collectively by small open economies such as our own as an alternate statement of GDP.  Let us face it, the headline GDP figure has been devised by the big boys for the big boys, which most reflects the way in which their economies work.<\/p><p>Given our current circumstances, however, we might not be successful in selling a formula that we devise for ourselves regardless of how good it is.

Regarding GDP, the Central Bank is involved in a number of international committees within the context of the ECB, including the statistics committee, and the CSO is closely engaged with EUROSTAT in discussing statistical issues.  In a way, the Deputy's question is one for the CSO, as it relates to how the CSO might make colleagues from other countries aware and link with them in developing indicators, given the international statistical institutional set-up.  At this point, we need to develop our own indicators.  If we assess them and they turn out to be effective, we will have a strong case in telling other countries that are facing similar problems that they can use them.  Regarding EUROSTAT and other international organisations, if one is to understand economies, one needs supplementary indicators.  That would be the way to go, but the first step is to try to get our own indicators up and running.<\/p> <p>  On currency and movement in the exchange rate, the depreciation of sterling is undoubtedly a negative factor in the Irish economy.  To some extent, we have incorporated this and our Brexit estimates in our forecasts of, as Mr. Quinn mentioned, -0.2% this year and -0.6%.  These include foreign demand and exchange rate effects.  I agree with the Deputy that this is adverse for the economy.  We have tried to take it into account in so far as we can.  In future, there may be even more dramatic movements in sterling, for example, further depreciations.

Given the state of the economy in 2011, being back to where we are now is a miracle.  A factor that brought about a transformation in business was the reduction in the rate of VAT in the tourism sector to 9%.

It is not too long ago that thousands of people from the Republic were crossing the Border every week to do their shopping in Northern Ireland.  I remember that well.

These are important indicators in assessing the safety and sustainability of the public finances but we are not precluded from looking at the composition of spending and making a judgment as to the appropriate allocation of those resources.  It is beyond our remit to comment further and we are reluctant to do so.<\/p> <p>  On pensions, to the extent that there are long-term demographic pressures on the public finances, they have implications for budgetary planning and keeping the public finances safe and so, obviously, account must be taken of them.

First, the 60% is not a target but a ceiling.  Therefore, one could have a figure lower than 60% and meet the EU obligations.  The second point to bear in mind is that the Governor is talking about a longer-term target.  He is not saying do this in 2017 or 2018.  He is basically saying, \"once we make progress\".  It looks very likely that we will have a budget balance in 2018 and a falling debt ratio.  I do not know when we would reach 60% but it may not be that far away.  It might be 2019, 2020 or thereabouts, so we will have achieved those rules.  The question then is, where do we go from there given that we have met those targets?  The point the Governor is making is that if we look at the experience we have had, the volatility of the Irish economy, and at what happened during the crisis, we want to have a margin of manoeuvre if a very bad shock hits the economy in the future, which will happen at some point in time.  We will be in a good position to say we can stimulate the economy, relax fiscal policy and tackle the problem without violating European rules.  That is where the Governor is coming from.  He suggests we get a level of debt which is sufficiently low that will provide a buffer so that the fiscal policy can respond to adverse shocks.  In the past, there was no such buffer and, as a result, one had to have a contractionary fiscal policy at a time when the economy was going into recession, so one was making things worse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016090600002#NN01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Fagan"},{"type":"speech","time":1473163200,"counter":160,"content":"<p>There was also the fact the Central Bank did not do its job.

Following the recent upward revision in Ireland's GDP, the Nevin Economic Research Institute's next set of macroeconomic projections is likely to forecast a 2016 general government deficit of close to 0.8% of GDP and a gross debt ratio of close to 75%.  Our autumn forecast has not yet been completed but our summer forecast was for real GDP growth of 4.6% this year and 3.7% next year.<\/p><p>Our summer forecast was for real GDP growth of 4.6% this year and 3.7% next year. <br\/><br\/>While it is true that the headline GDP figures give a misleading picture of economic activity in Ireland, there is much evidence that the real economy grew strongly in 2015 and continues to grow strongly, although growth may have been softening in recent months.  Personal consumption increased 4.5% in volume terms in 2015 and 5% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to last year.  The growth in spending is being driven by the strong growth in employment.  Other factors boosting consumption include the reversal of fiscal austerity, the ongoing decline in household debt, pent-up demand, loose monetary policy, the fall in energy prices and Ireland&rsquo;s position within the economic cycle.<br\/><br\/>Employment increased by 2.6% in 2015 and is up 2.7% in the first half of 2016 compared to the previous year.  Total employment is now in excess of 2 million for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2008, although this is still more than 130,000 below peak employment levels.  All regions remain below their pre-crisis employment totals, with recovery relatively strongest in Dublin, at 97% of second quarter 2008 employment, and relatively weakest in the west, namely, counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, at 89%.<br\/><br\/>The unemployment rate was 8.6% in the second quarter of 2016.  Unemployment rates are lowest in the mid east - the area around Dublin - and highest in the south east.  Long-term unemployment has fallen below 100,000 for the first time since the third quarter of 2009 and now stands at 4.4%.  However, it is three times as large as it was in the first quarter of 2008. <br\/><br\/>Average weekly earnings were up 0.5% in the second quarter compared to the previous year while average hourly earnings increased by 0.2%.  Average hourly earnings are essentially unchanged over the past five years.<br\/><br\/>Consumer prices in July were up 0.5% over the previous year and 1.3% when energy products are excluded.  The consumer price index is now broadly at 2008 levels and is up almost 3% since 2011.<br\/><br\/>In considering the fiscal context, the parameters for budget 2017 are set by the requirements of the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.  Adherence to the fiscal rules limits the net fiscal space, as we estimate it, for new commitments to between &euro;900 million and &euro;1 billion in 2017.  The recent upward revision to GDP will have a minimal impact, if any, on the 2017 fiscal space.  The Government estimates the net fiscal space available over the next five years at &euro;11.3 billion.  However, this estimate is based on an assumption that the economy is running a structural deficit of 2% of potential output in 2016 and that the economy is overheating.  However, a strong case can be made that the economy is not overheating.  This analysis is based on the economy&rsquo;s still high unemployment rate; the evident lack of domestic price and wage pressure in the economy; the current account surplus even after correcting for multinational restructurings; the low underlying investment ratio, excluding intangibles and aircraft purchases; and lack of housing supply.  If this analysis is correct, it implies scope for increasing the fiscal space in 2018 as structural deficit targets will have been achieved.<br\/><br\/>The fiscal space is sensitive to the potential growth rate of the economy.  The Nevin Economic Research Institute's baseline estimate is for real GDP growth of close to 3% extending out to 2030.  Potential GDP growth could well be higher than this in the short to medium term given the potential for above trend employment growth over the next five years.  However, a structural shock to the economy, a secular productivity decline, sustained underinvestment or an underperformance of employment growth would damage the economy&rsquo;s growth potential.  An average reference rate of real potential growth of 3% over the next five years, as opposed to 3.5%, would reduce the cumulative net fiscal space by around &euro;1.8 billion over the next five years.<br\/><br\/>Not all fiscal measures have the same impact on potential output.  In the long run, sustainable growth can only come from productivity gains.  Given Ireland&rsquo;s relatively low levels of spending by advanced economy standards on education, research and development and capital expenditure, there appears to be scope to use fiscal policy to enhance future productivity by increasing <i>per capita<\/i>investment in education and skills; increasing <i>per capita<\/i>investment in research and development, the production, diffusion and use of new knowledge and ideas, and the development of a strong innovation system; and increasing investment in productive infrastructure.  Long-run investments in these three areas could increase the fiscal space available to government in the long term because these types of investment increase the productive capacity of the economy. <br\/><br\/>The future of the universal social charge, USC, has come under question in recent years.  The USC has a simple and highly progressive structure.  Average rates of combined income tax and employee social security contributions in Ireland are significantly below OECD averages for both low and middle income earners.  Dismantling of the USC would be regressive and extremely costly.  While there would be a short-term boost to demand and, therefore, real GDP growth, there would be no increase in the economy's long-term productive capacity.  Ireland is not a high tax or a high public spending economy.  Given our ageing population, it is likely we will have to increase taxes in the future.  Cutting taxes now is not a prudent long-term budgetary strategy.  I will be pleased to answer Deputies' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016090600002#QQ00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1473163200,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McDonnell for his submission and taking time to appear before the committee.  It is very much appreciated.  I agree with his analysis in which he identified three areas of investment for growth, namely, education and skills, research and development and productive infrastructure.<\/p><p>The first question I have is where he thinks the money for that - the best place or the least bad place - will come from.  Could we obtain it by increasing taxes, by not eroding the tax base any further, by reducing expenditure elsewhere, or by breaking the fiscal rules?<\/p><p> My second question relates to the expenditure benchmarks, which this committee will be poring over for years.  It is my understanding that they are set at the starting point.  The benchmarks provide that a country cannot raise its average spending more than X percent based on all of the factors we have spoken about today.  However, they do not suggest that a reasonable amount of expenditure is X or Y or a percentage of X or Y.  The indicators just say that wherever a country is at, it is coming from that point.  Other countries spend more on education, be it per capita or as a percentage of GNP, than we do.  This has been referenced in the witnesses' document.  We invest considerably less in education than some other European countries.  If we follow the benchmark and increase by a percentage per year, as other countries do, and because we are coming from a lower base of investment, unless we do something quite different, is it the case that we are perpetually locked into less investment than our competitors?  If that is the case, does Dr. McDonnell think that is something we should change and, if so, how would he change it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016090600002#RR00200","speaker":"1230","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473163200,"counter":174,"content":"<p>The Deputy has asked two related questions which pertain to the three areas of productive investment and where and how they should be funded - by increasing taxes, by not cutting existing taxes, by cutting from other areas  of spending, or indeed by breaking the fiscal rules.  The Deputy's second question was whether we are locked into moving from where we already are and moving a certain percentage more than that each year, which is equivalent to the reference rate plus inflation once the structural target has been achieved.  I will answer the two together.  Essentially, the expenditure benchmark restricts growth in spending, while discretionary increases in revenue allow countries to expand the envelope for spending.  Similarly, cuts in spending allow an expansion of the envelope for tax cuts.  The expenditure benchmark and the structural balance rule, which will also affect us in 2017 and 2018 - that is the convergence margin, which I am also happy to talk about - affect the stance.  They affect what the structural deficit will be over time if the rules are adhered to.  We can talk about the appropriateness of those rules, but that is what they do - they affect the stance.  They do not, however, affect the ability to invest in the economy, provided one is willing to pay for it.  This means that cuts in taxes and radical investment cannot be achieved at the same time.  It means that we have to choose.  With &euro;900 million to &euro;1 billion of fiscal space - and the way capital spending is treated means that it is a little bit more than that, because capital spending is done over a multi-year envelope - a country can only increase that amount.  It can only increase the space for education, infrastructure, innovation and so forth by increasing revenue or by cutting areas of public spending such as justice or defence - areas that are less associated with long-term inclusive growth.  It does not preclude us from investing in the economy and it does not preclude us from investing any less than Denmark invests in its economy.  It precludes us from adopting a fiscal stance that the European Commission does not particularly like.  Obviously, with the fiscal stance and the convergence margin that is applied, particularly for 2018, the fact that we are allowed to spend only &euro;1 billion instead of &euro;3 billion is because the European Commission's methodology says that Ireland is overheating.  We are not overheating at the moment.<\/p><p>I would argue that the fiscal space for 2018 should be closer to &euro;3 billion.  This is something that the committee could argue, perhaps, with the Commission and could challenge.  I suspect the Department of Finance and the ESRI agree with me in that regard, which is that the methodology is flawed.  There is scope for increasing the fiscal space in 2018 and potentially even in 2017.  That is my point about the fact that Ireland's economy is not overheating.  We will probably have a deficit in 2016 of approximately 0.8% of GDP.  If we were overheating, our structural deficit would be worse than our actual deficit.  If a country was underheating - that is, if it did not reach its long-term average - one would expect the country's actual deficit to be worse than its structural deficit.  Our actual deficit will be approximately 0.8% of GDP.  We are not overheating.  It seems unlikely that our structural deficit is more than 0.8% of GDP.  It certainly is unlikely that it is much more than 1%.  That means that one more year of application of this convergence margin, which reduces the fiscal space from approximately &euro;3 billion to &euro;1 billion, improves our structural deficit sufficiently to get us down to approximately 0.5%, which is all we have to do.  If all of that is true, it means we can increase our fiscal space in 2018, giving us more money for infrastructure, tax cuts or whatever it is we want.  What the fiscal rules do is to modify a country's fiscal stance and constrain what it can do with that fiscal stance.  However, we are not at all precluded from spending as much as we want on infrastructure, education or research and development.  However, we have to pay for it through revenue or cut other areas of public spending.  That really is what it is.<\/p><p> In terms of the options that were outlined, we are concerned that the overall level of spending relative to output in previous years has been moving along a very low trajectory compared to other European countries.  It is true that GDP is a very bad metric to use in terms of the ratios for Ireland.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council came up with a hybrid measure, which was reasonably applicable for previous years although it will not be applicable at all for future years because of what happened to GDP in 2015.  However, even by that metric, we are still quite a low spender compared to our Western European peers.<\/p><p> In our opinion, if we wish to have Western European standards of public services, infrastructure, education spending or research and development, we will have to pay for it.  The implication is that rather than cutting things like the universal social charge we should be looking at ways to expand the tax base, which is another question.  One could look at tax expenditures or one could look at various types of property tax.  There are different types.  I was listening to the previous session.  One of the comments was that 40% of tax revenues come from income tax.  We are a little above the EU average in terms of income tax as a proportion of overall revenue, but the revenue base in Ireland is actually quite low.  Let us consider implicit tax rates, which are shown in one of the tables I included in the presentation on labour.  In terms of the implicit tax rate on labour - that is, the effective tax rate over the potential tax base - we are actually a little bit low, but not dramatically so.  The point is that we are not over-emphasising income tax.  In fact, we are a little bit over in terms of consumption taxes.  That would be the long-winded answer.  We are not precluded from investing in infrastructure, education and research and development.  However, we have to pay for it, which means reducing other areas of public spending or increasing the revenue base.  On balance, I would be inclined towards the second option but, again, it is more complicated than that because there are reforms on taxation and the public spending side that should be progressed at the same time.  One could look at reforming the overall tax system to be more growth-friendly and equity-friendly at the same time.  Tax expenditure is an area we could examine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016090600002#SS00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1473163200,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I have two questions.  I will ask them separately because they are not related.  I am not sure if Dr. McDonnell was here during the first set of exchanges.  He may have been.  I saw him at the back of the room for some of it.  I will ask him for his view on a number of the issues that were raised.  The first relates to the distorted GDP figures.  In his statement, the chief economist from the Central Bank referred to the exclusion of aircraft and intangible assets when making calculations.  He also argued that we should invent some sort of bespoke Irish methodology for calculating growth and GDP.<\/p><p>In Dr. McDonnell's view, how tenable is that?  If we were to do that, would those figures be accepted internationally or by EUROSTAT?  Would they fly or would they be seen as us trying to disguise a problem that might exist?  Given the headlines that have gone around the world about leprechaun economics and so on, how tenable would it be to come up with a new formula or way of calculating growth?  The chief economist made the point that we could then try to sell that as a new way of doing it.<\/p><p> There was a discussion on lowering borrowing in excess of the fiscal rules to below 60% of GDP.  This was in response to a letter that was sent from the Governor of the Central Bank to the Minister for Finance.  He seemed to be indicating that this would be a good thing.  Again, the response from the chief economist was that this was long term.  In his response long term is 2019, but the letter was sent in the context of this year's budget.  That was the context in which the letter from the Governor went to the Minister for Finance.  Even taking at face value that response, it would have an impact on the ability of the State to invest.  Would Dr. McDonnell agree with that?  Is that something he would support?  Would he support the view that, whether it is short-term or long-term, we should look at reaching a debt target below the appropriate level?  The Governor explained that the ceiling at the moment is 60% of GDP.  That is the first part.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016090600002#TT00200","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473163200,"counter":178,"content":"<p>The first question was on the distorted GDP figures.  It is extremely frustrating having to forecast these things.  Many of the tools available to us are not really useable now.  I think it will be difficult for the Central Bank and the Central Statistics Office to come up with an alternative metric that will be accepted internationally.  I think no such broadly based figure exists to capture perfectly the activity in the domestic economy, which is what people are really thinking about.<\/p> <p>  The corporate restructuring in 2015 polluted the data to such an extent that it is of arguable value anymore.  I agree with the Central Back in that it was a level effect.  My baseline assumption is that we will go back to having reasonably normal growth levels from now on, albeit from that higher base, but I cannot guarantee that.  There may be more corporate restructuring in 2016 and beyond related to tax planning.<\/p> <p>  I do not believe that Ireland trying to peddle an alternative metric internationally would fly particularly.  If we were to use the figures based on domestic demand, it would be highly problematic because net exports are such a sizeable part of the Irish economy.  I understand the motivation to remove intangibles, the intellectual property assets and aircraft.  One reason I sympathise with this approach is that, historically, in an advanced economy we would consider an investment ratio of between 20% and 22% as being pretty standard.  We have been well below that for a long time now.  If we exclude intangibles, aircraft intangibles and so on, investment was approximately &euro;31 billion in 2015, which is a small proportion of the economy.  I would be keen to have some kind of metric which would allow us to have investment appropriately as a proportion of economic output.  Clearly, we have an investment problem in the economy at the moment.  It is probably one of the reasons we are not overheating, as it happens.  Obviously, we have a major problem in terms of public capital investment, which is at extremely low levels.  It is barely more than depreciation.  We have low levels of private sector investment as well.<\/p> <p>  I do not believe the Central Bank and the CSO will succeed.<\/p><p>I do not believe they will come up with a better figure.  I think in the end they will come up with a dashboard of measures which will include GDP, GNP, underlying investment and so on and employment, which will attempt to create a picture of how healthy the economy is and allow people like me and those in the Central Bank to try to determine the structural position of the economy.  That is important for fiscal policy and so on and indeed for the Central Bank's macro-prudential rules.<\/p><p> In terms of the 60% target, those figures are not particularly scientific.  They are ceilings but they are fairly arbitrary ceilings.  Provided Ireland adheres to the structural balance rule, the expenditure benchmark rule and, in 2019, the debt brake rule, it will be doing more than enough in terms of how far it goes in adhering to fiscal rules.  It is quite likely that the debt-to-GDP ratio will fall to around 60% by the end of the decade unless there is a negative shock to the economy.  The cost of borrowing at the moment is quite low.  There is still scope for the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, to re-profile the debt in order that it is all at a very low interest rate, which means the debt servicing costs will be very low.  It is the debt servicing cost, rather than the debt, that really matters over the long term.<\/p><p> Going further than 60% reduces our ability to do everything in terms of fiscal policy.  It means that the fiscal stance will be tighter over future years if we aim for lower targets.  I do not think the debt rule will be particularly onerous for Ireland in the future but adherence to the expenditure benchmark rule shows Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to fiscal prudence and I do not see the need to go any further than that.  I think Ireland&rsquo;s debt-to-GDP ratio will probably go below 60% anyway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016090600002#UU00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1473163200,"counter":180,"content":"<p>My second question was related to this year&rsquo;s budget which we are focusing on as well.

It is very simple, extremely progressive, there are a minimum of reliefs and it brings in &euro;4 billion per year.  We are looking at an ageing population.  At the beginning of the next decade there will be increasing calls on spending for pensions and health care.  The &euro;11.3 billion in fiscal space over the next five years looks like a lot of money but price and demographic pressures will eat into that.  Given, as I have said, our already low levels of spending on infrastructure, research and development and other areas, such as child care, which is extremely important for labour force participation, particularly for women and lone parents, and all the other calls on spending and tax cuts, and given that maximum effective tax rates for low and middle earners are not particularly onerous by international standards, it is not clear to me what the economic rationale is for dismantling the USC.<\/p><p>Moreover, with all these other calls on spending - as well as potential calls in terms of tax cuts - and given that maximum effective tax rates for low and middle earners are not particularly onerous by international standards, it is not clear what is the economic rationale for dismantling the universal service charge, USC.  As I pointed out in the presentation, there would be a stimulus to the economy from getting rid of it because it would increase disposable income.  It would not do anything necessarily to increase the productive capacity of the economy, which is from where long-term economic growth over decades comes.  It is the long-term picture at which one must look.  It is how does one inculcate growth in ten, 20, 30 or 40 years' time.  Consequently, early learning education and so on are areas with much greater returns.  In the case of research and development, for example, Ireland is very low.  Countries such as the United States that are supposed to be market economies essentially have built their economies over the past 150 years by public capital investment and investing in those areas.  These are much more important calls.<\/p><p> As to whether the levels of investment increase are credible, it obviously is positive that they are increasing but I believe the mid-term expenditure report that came out in the middle of the year envisages capital spending as being &euro;7.1 billion in 2021.  One is talking about GNP being approximately &euro;260 billion by then and GDP will be more than &euro;300 billion.  While I acknowledge those figures are polluted, even so, one is looking at quite a small amount, even as a ratio of GNP.  In our view, which is shared by a number of organisations including IBEC and even the European Commission - and which has been pointed out by the IMF and the London School of Economics - one thing that has been holding back growth and generating secular stagnation in the West is very low levels of public capital spending.  Obviously, politically they are the easiest things to cut because one simply does not do the next project but the returns in respect of medium-term economic growth probably are higher for infrastructure spend than they are for anything else.  Research and development, child care and education can be more long-term.<\/p><p> It is not necessarily a good idea to aim for a particular percentage of economic output because it depends on where one is in the economic cycle.  One would do less when one's economy is overheating and more when it is under heated.  The idea of a rainy-day fund was mentioned.  That could be an alternative to cutting USC, for example, whereby the money allocated for that would go into a rainy-day fund which would be spent on infrastructure when the next recession came.  However, I certainly would not be contemplating rainy-day funds or infrastructure spends as alternatives; infrastructure spend should happen.  The correct number is not 3%, 4% or 5%, although 2% certainly is low.  It will depend on the cyclical position of the economy.  It should be above 3% when the economy is doing poorly and it could be as low as 3% or even 2.5% when the economy is doing very well.  One uses it as a Keynesian demand management metric.  A rainy-day fund potentially would allow one to get around the fiscal rules, were it set up properly and independently run.  If, let us say, the Government had equity stakes in a special purpose vehicle, that perhaps would allow one to massage it long-term.  However, I agree that infrastructure spending certainly has been disproportionately targeted in the austerity measures and must be disproportionately restored as the recovery takes hold.  Even if we do start overheating to a certain degree, there still must be a certain minimum level of infrastructure spending on the public side.  We must address the fact that we have a growing population, which means we must increase our infrastructure spend and not be in a position, as we are now, in which we are just maintaining what we have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016090600002#VV00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1473163200,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McDonnell.

I would be very happy to do that, though it would take a period of time.  Perhaps we would try to produce it before the budget.<\/p> <p>  In terms of education and skills, the growth literature talks extensively about education.  There has been much work done in this area by people like James Heckman and others, as well as the OECD which has attempted to develop a theoretical framework connecting education spending with long-term economic growth.  It relates to the concept of human capital development.  The early years are particularly important because that is the point at which there is the greatest capacity for human capital development.  Human capital is the ability to learn, question and think for oneself.  That is much easier to do in the early years than it is in later years.  Also, if one loses a child in the early years, it is extremely difficult to get that person back.  Obviously, it is a tragedy for the child and the family, but it is also a loss to the economy in terms of the human capital base we have.  The early years are particularly important to ensure no one falls behind because once one starts to fall behind, it is extremely difficult to catch up.  When I refer to early years, I am talking in particular about pre-primary education as well as primary education.  I am talking about bespoke solutions, which can, unfortunately, be expensive, being available to deprived communities or households that would be considered at risk of their children falling behind.<\/p> <p>  On a related matter, there is also literature that shows that things like family income support and measures that prevent child poverty are linked to long-run economic growth because they protect the child and they serve as a barrier, potentially protecting the ability to grow and develop that human capital.  Often, teachers will talk about how once a child has fallen behind, it is very difficult, expensive and costly to bring the child up to speed or to re-engage him or her.  Learning needs to be inculcated very early, both in the home and within the education system.  The evidence and research I have seen, including that from the OECD, suggests that the returns are largest during the early years.  They are also large in the fourth level sector for very different reasons due to high potential start-ups becoming businesses, inventions, innovations and so on, but that is a very different dynamic.<\/p> <p>  Again, the figures that I cite are percentages of GDP.  We know that the GDP figures are polluted.  The reason I present those figures is to show that education spending, despite a young population, is off base compared with the best performing countries, generally the Nordic countries, in terms of education spending and to advocate moving in that direction in terms of the overall education spend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016090600002#XX00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1473163200,"counter":186,"content":"<p>Regarding the suggestion that we need to increase investment in productive infrastructure, if the witness was to set out a list of priorities for budgets 2017 and 2018, what would be the priorities for infrastructure?

Parts of Canada had broadband in the late 1990s but parts of Ireland still do not have broadband.  <br\/><br\/>One of the areas on which we have not focused is the labour market, which includes the issue of regional employment trends.  One of my findings was that, while it may be appropriate to let the market do its thing in areas with a high population density such as Dublin, Cork and Limerick, it is less likely that the market will provide it in rural areas.  It is unlikely it will find there is a commercial return because of the very expensive network infrastructure associated with broadband.  In this scenario, those rural areas fall even further behind.  One of the policy measures that can be pursued to open up regional employment opportunities is high-speed broadband infrastructure everywhere in the country.  That is expensive but it has its advantages.  Some of my friends have been able to leave Dublin and go back to the mid-west because broadband has improved and they can do their IT jobs from home.  They do not need to be living in Dublin for those jobs.  Such examples, if a little bit unusual, show that opportunities can be created.  Another obvious point is that local SMEs will find it very difficult to be part of the global market and to sell their goods and services online without broadband.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy's broader point was about productive infrastructure and much of the infrastructure in this case will be beneficial.  There might not be a productivity-enhancing aspect to social housing but there is a competitiveness aspect because more housing means lower rental costs, which improves competitiveness in wage demands <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>other economies.  There is an economic dimension to it and it is extremely important for inclusive growth.<br\/><br\/>The education sector is another area that needs to be looked at.  We have regional hubs for many areas of the economy and we need to develop alternatives to Dublin on the west coast, though not to the exclusion of Dublin.  We need to prioritise urban hubs on the west coast in Cork, Limerick and Galway and extending to Sligo and Donegal.  There needs to be a regional dimension and we need to build up regional powerhouses so that they can become employment hubs which people can reach.<br\/><br\/>Other areas where productivity could be boosted include public transport, which can reduce the costs of getting to work.  The road network reduces costs for business, and investment should increase at least in line with demographics.  We are ranked very poorly by the World Economic Forum in terms of our infrastructure and bottlenecks have built up so competitiveness is relevant to this.<br\/><br\/>I was asked whether there were areas of infrastructure that were not productive.

It is a type of chicken and egg situation.  Given the investment rate in the economy is low now, excluding intangibles such as aircraft purchase and so on, which is essentially tax planning, I would not be concerned yet about getting to the point where we are bidding up costs, although one gets there eventually.  The Deputy may recall that I said that for an advanced economy historically the investment rate would have to be 20% to 22% of GDP.  Obviously, we cannot use GDP for Ireland any more but as a percentage of economic output we are still well below 20%.  Even taking away the level effect from, say, 2015, we would still be well below in terms of the investment rate.  I agree we need to be cautious.  The point at which the economy starts to overheat is the point at which the ramping down of infrastructure spend as a percentage of economic output commences.  When the economy is doing less well, spend can be ramped up.  The purpose of rainy day funds and so on is to protect spend against the economic cycle and from short-term political considerations, which are the same everywhere in the world.<\/p> <p>  In regard to what all of this means at this point when the economy is probably close to capacity but still not quite overheating, given private investment is low and there is a lack of credit in the economy, there is certainly scope for increasing infrastructure.  One area I did not mention is renewable energies in terms of potentially building up new industries never mind reducing imports or our carbon footprint.  Bidding up costs over the economic cycle is a problem.  The solution to that is, again, Keynesian management in terms of ramping up or down infrastructure spend to reflect the economy's position in the cycle.  In other words, if the view is that infrastructure spend should be 3% to 3.5% on average over the economic cycle and if the economy is not underheating or overheating at a particular point in time, then the public spend on infrastructure should be 3% to 3.5%, with the percentage being adjusted depending on the level of overheating.  In regard to long-term bidding up costs, I do not think it is an issue now.<\/p> <p>  In regard to construction employment, as I said earlier, employment in construction is 55% of what it was in the second quarter of 2008.<\/p><p>It is true that the figure for 2008 was not remotely sustainable.  Even if one considers that only two or three out of five of those jobs might come back, one is still looking at scope for another 25,000 jobs on a two-out-of-five basis or 55,000 jobs on a three-out-of-five basis.  Therefore, there is still scope for employment gains in that sector.<\/p><p> The income tax structure, including USC, is extremely progressive in Ireland.  However, the pre-tax distribution of income in Ireland is very inequitable relative to many of our western European peers.  Therefore, our income tax system is designed to do that much extra work to bring us back to the middle of the table in terms of Gini coefficients, the metric use for inequality of income.  Ireland is in the middle of the pack in terms of inequality of income.  If we reduce the progressivity of our taxation system, we will start to fall into the bottom half in terms of income distribution and that is obviously not an outcome that presumably anyone around the table wants.  We must have a more progressive income tax system to compensate for the fact that the distribution of pre-tax income is so inequitable in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016090600002#ZZ00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1473163200,"counter":194,"content":"<p>May I ask the witness why that is?

We are above average in certain types of professional jobs associated with the IFSC, FDI, lawyers, accountants and so on.  We have a larger percentage of those jobs and they tend to be highly paid.  We also seem to have a large proportion of low-paid workers in Ireland.  That seems to be the pattern in English-speaking economies compared to continental economies.  It is not unique to us.  There may be other aspects associated with the structure of the economy.  For example, IT jobs are very highly paid and we tend to do reasonably well in that area.  However, I do not have a full answer to that, although I would note that part of our research programme in 2017 and beyond will be looking at enterprise policy and the overall structure of the labour market.  Hopefully, in future years I will be able to give a much more informed response.<\/p> <p>  There are issues of broadening the tax base, tax compliance and additional resources for the Revenue Commissioners.  We are concerned about and wonder why, when there is a housing crisis, the Government would be looking at increasing thresholds for inheritance and gift tax, for example, which would be extremely regressive.  In the hierarchy of taxes, other property taxes along with current property taxes and VAT tend to be the least damaging to growth.  If we are looking for inclusive growth, there are no arguments that increasing thresholds from capital acquisitions tax will stand up from a growth or equity perspective.  The business and agricultural reliefs, as they stand, also do not stand up from a growth perspective.  We have written in our summer quarterly observer, will write further in the autumn observer and will be producing more working papers on the subject of the debilitating impact of tax expenditures from an equity perspective and an economic growth perspective.  My colleague, Miche&aacute;l Collins, who I do not wish to pre-empt, has a paper on pension tax reliefs coming out in late September that will look at the distribution of the benefits of those reliefs.  The most recent work done on this showed that 80% of the benefits went to the top 20% of earners.  Standard rating in respect of or reforming those types of reliefs would allow for a reform of the tax base.  The latter would allow for a reform of marginal rates or provide an opening in respect of them on a tax-neutral basis.  Potentially, it could also open up additional space for public spending.<\/p><p> We have identified other areas.  We note it is not so much that Ireland is a low-tax economy, as it actually is not; Ireland is a low-revenue economy.  As to what I mean by that, it means social security contributions are very low in Ireland.  Again, labour taxation is not particularly low but if one looks at the implicit tax rate, which is the effective tax rate over the base in the economy, taxes on labour are low overall but not necessarily those paid by employees.  The contribution paid by employers was 3.3% of GDP in 2014, that is, before the GDP numbers went haywire last year, compared with 7.7% for the EU.  This is quite a difference and in the context of labour force participation, the type of additional welfare benefits could include things like child care subsidies, which would have advantages in preserving second earners and lone parents, for example, in the workforce.  Obviously, it would be necessary to work out the details of policies like that and perhaps that is something at which the committee could look.  If targeted at employments of more than &euro;100,000 only, it would affect only 50,000 employments and yet could bring in well over &euro;100 million.  Consequently there is scope in this regard and it would not affect the marginal tax rate.  Obviously, part of the incidence would fall on the employee, as well as the employer.<\/p><p> We are concerned about the non-indexation of property tax bands.  The property tax as it currently is structured is not fully progressive and the Department of Finance's own research has pointed that out.  It could be progressive, however, and one could deal with the situation whereby someone on a very low income must pay property tax - or indeed a wealth tax for that matter - by putting a lien on the property.  Consequently, when it was transferred or inherited, Revenue would get first call whereby the property tax due would then be paid to Revenue with an interest carry on that.  Therefore, over the long term, Revenue would be getting those receipts and would be able to pencil them in.  I refer to situations of hardship, which would be quite rare, but obviously it would be possible to apply a more progressive structure in respect of the rates applied to different valuations.  We know, from an economic growth perspective, that the recurrent property tax is one of the best taxes - land tax arguably is even better - and if one can construct a property tax which does not cause inequity and does not cause hardship, there then is a strong rationale for developing such a tax.  Perhaps the committee could look at ways to reform the property tax and make it fairer and more growth-friendly.  It certainly is not something that should fall behind a couch as a revenue-raising measure.<\/p><p> Another area that rarely gets touched upon is that of a wealth tax.  It would not generate a huge amount of income but has advantages in terms of tax compliance.  Were one to pursue it, I would set it with a minimum of reliefs and a very high threshold of possibly &euro;1 million.  That would only affect 1% to 2% of households and would be likely to be a highly popular tax.  Obviously, as there would be much resistance to it, it should be set against the household in order that it then has no effect on foreign direct investment, FDI, those particular structures and so on.  Basically, when I refer to sources of revenue, I am considering those within the literature that would minimise the hit to economic growth but which also would be consistent with social fairness.  The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, has identified these types of taxes and the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, itself has done so in the past.  These are the kinds of areas at which we would be looking and again, this is not about billions and billions but about reforms that still could open up additional space.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016090600002#AAA00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1473163200,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I have two short questions.

As a result, we moved to the middle of the table in terms of overall Gini coefficients after tax and benefits.  It is essentially the workhorse we use to reduce poverty and inequality within society and it is doing a good job.  We would be concerned, if there was tax reform, that it would move away from that model and, by and large, it would be difficult to construct cuts to income taxes in such a way that they would not be regressive.  As Deputy Burton has pointed out, the income tax ratio compared to GDP and the implicit tax rate on labour are not high in Ireland and we have to be cautious in terms of an ageing population not to undermine the tax base.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the Governor's letter, I think that it would be sufficient to adhere to the expenditure benchmark.  The expenditure benchmark will be reasonably tough for this year and next year and even from 2019 onwards.  We are really only talking about &euro;3 billion per year in the context of an economy that is growing very fast and increasing by multiples of that year on year.  The debt to GDP ratio will incline anyway and we will have to adhere to the debt-brake rule, which actually will not matter in the case of Ireland.  I, therefore, think the Governor's concern will be assuaged anyway if Ireland adheres to the expenditure benchmark.  One could argue that the forecast for potential GDP and the reference rate are too high.  If that is true, and actual growth does not materialise as is hoped, then the dynamics could deteriorate.  However, we update the fiscal space every year, so if there is such a deterioration, it should be caught reasonably quickly.

That would impose an additional constraint, which obviously has the potential to reduce fiscal space in future years.  It is my view that the approach currently being followed, which is to follow the expenditure benchmark, is sufficiently conservative and one need not go any further than that.  Therefore, looking strategically at what he is doing, the Governor is taking a particularly austerian approach to essentially act as a kind of tug-of-war push-back against rhetoric that might build up over the next five or six weeks that attempts to move it in a different direction.  In a sense, it might be a degree of smoke and mirrors but that is not to say that the Governor does not believe what he is saying.  I am quite sure that he does.<\/p><p>It is true that GDP is now a polluted metric, but I would say that the expenditure benchmark - difficult as it will be to deal with the 26% from 2016 in terms of the reference rate for future years - will potentially increase the fiscal space in future years.  One option is to essentially set aside that year or to use a figure that would probably be more accurate, such as 5%, for that particular year to take forward.  The latter might be a more suitable approach.  Simply to decide that the rules are not tight enough and we must have even more rules - people acknowledge that the rules are already fairly tight in terms of Keynesian demand management - would be perhaps going too far.

I agree with the ESRI position on child care.  Child care costs in Ireland as a proportionate of the disposal income of the average earner are the second highest in the OECD, which is a massive barrier to labour force participation by second earners and by lone parents.  It is one of the reasons, historically, that Ireland, in comparison with other north-west European economies, has had a low employment rate.  We are essentially deciding through policy that this cohort of the population is not going to be in employment and because to be in employment does not make sense for them we are losing extremely educated human capital and tax receipts and all of the economic benefits that come from that.  I would certainly regard child care as one of the major potential policy reforms that could unlock economic growth and employment growth over the next five to ten years.  Child care spend as a proportion of GDP is extremely low by OECD standards.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that marginal tax rates kick in at a high rate, which is a little above the average industrial wage.  There is room for reform of the overall structure.  I have spoken about moving to a two taxation system.  For example, if various tax expenditures were abolished tax rates could be reduced.

One area where one could consider cutting taxes is by moving to the American model of refundable tax credits, for example.  That is effectively an in-work benefit.  By moving to that model, one essentially increases the incentive for low-paid workers to work additional hours.  That is likely to increase employment rates and work intensity at the bottom in terms of the income scale.  At that expensive margin, taxes and take-home pay matter but it is rare - certainly at the half of income rates we are talking about - that somebody on a marginal rate will work fewer hours because of that.  Show me the evidence; it is just not there.<\/p> <p>  Tax rates used to be much higher throughout the OECD.  The golden age of capitalism was 1945 to 1973 when marginal tax rates were never higher.  Marginal tax rates were over 90% in the United States.  I am not advocating that as a policy but I am pointing out that there is no - I will be happy to direct attention to the some of the research on this - empirical evidence in terms of meta-analysis, that is, studies of studies and bringing them all together, that marginal tax rates reduce long-run economic growth.  That is not where the focus should be if one is interested in inculcating GDP growth over the long term but it is on infrastructure, child care, things like refundable tax credits and education spend, particularly for early years and fourth level.  Building up our national innovation system means increasing the research and development budget, which means increasing linkages between universities and employer groups, are the areas that one needs to focus on, while tapering up welfare benefits, for example, and being an extremely open economy that encourages migrants in.  The evidence, even in the UK, is that they tend to be net contributors to the budget, so their decision is something that we could perhaps benefit from.  <\/p> <p>  Reducing income taxes when our revenue to GDP ratio is already low is unwise and not conducive to good policy in the long run.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016090600002#FFF00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1473163200,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I wish to ask Dr. McDonnell a couple of other brief questions.  I introduced the issue of child care which the ESRI had flagged up in that context.

What is Dr. McDonnell's view on that?<\/p> <p>  Can he also discuss another policy option which will take shape in this budget, that is, the help to buy scheme, which will assist people to purchase new houses and will be backdated to a point in June or July?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016090600002#FFF00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1473163200,"counter":214,"content":"<p>The easier of those questions is the help to buy scheme.  The problem in the property sector is clearly one of supply, not demand, so I would be extremely reluctant to support policies that would probably increase house prices and simply act as a subsidy to existing property owners.<\/p> <p>  The issues in the housing sector, particularly in Dublin, are fundamentally about supply.  There is obviously a private sector dimension to that, whether it be access to credit or land, and regulation.  However, there is also a public sector dimension to this.  If one looks at the figures - I am sorry I did not include them in the submission - public provision of housing collapsed post 2010.<\/p><p>We need to start going back to those kinds of levels.  Obviously, for approximately &euro;1 billion per year, one gets approximately 5,000 units.  Based on population, we are aiming for 25,000 or arguably 30,000 builds per year, because we have a housing waiting list and consequently must have more than 25,000 builds.  There is a market failure in the private sector for various reasons and there is, therefore, a role for the Government to use its own capacities in a fiscal context to intervene directly and to start building houses.  That would be where I would direct my energies and by increasing supply, we also will reduce rental costs, house prices and the cost of purchasing.  This will help first-time buyers by reducing the debt they will take on in respect of mortgage costs and so on and that helps with macroprudential sustainability and so on.  Consequently, in the housing sector, the policy response should be on the supply side, not the demand side.<\/p><p> As for tax breaks versus direct subsidies in child care, our view generally on tax expenditures is one should only go there when there is a proven case that subsidies or direct spending will not work and where there is clear evidence of a market failure.  For example, one might give tax expenditures for research and development because there is a general market failure and there are knock-on benefits for the economy.  In the case of child care, it probably is more complicated than simply talking about tax breaks versus direct subsidies.  It ultimately is about bringing down child care costs for the parents and ensuring there is a quality of care.  It is about educating and upskilling people to be able to fill those roles and making sure there are enough people.  This is what I am talking about when I refer to child care, that is, they are in place, are providing good care and there are enough of them.  In addition, it is about them being regulated by the State and that - possibly through the social security system - the State would be providing as a benefit a contribution as a direct subsidy to the pay and maintenance of those centres directly and that it would be a much more regulated sector.  Unfortunately, there are too many stories about the child care sector.  As this is not an issue or area on which I am particularly expert, my comments therefore are general from a macroeconomic point of view in respect of the cost of child care and from a macroeconomic perspective in terms of the deadweight losses that tend to be associated with tax expenditures.  It is not a sector on which I would comment at a micro level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2016090600002#FFF00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1473163200,"counter":216,"content":"<p>Finally, I refer to the table provided on page 3 of the research in brief document by the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, on the fiscal space.

Essentially, to even begin to calculate it, one has to come to a judgment on the extent to which the economy is overheating.  One also has to calculate what the output gap is and whether it is positive or negative.  The Commission's methodology is pro-cyclical.  The reason for that is because it overly emphasises recent unemployment rates.  The Commission had an equilibrium unemployment rate of over 10% quite recently, which I would argue was a figure that even the Commission itself knew was wrong.  What is the equilibrium unemployment rate?  There is no answer to that because it is policy dependent.  Since the Second World War, we have had unemployment rates as low as 3.5% or 4% in some advanced economies.  In other countries, it has been much higher and in double figures.  It is currently at about 5% in the US and the UK.  If Ireland is able to get down to those levels, then we are clearly underheating at the moment.  Again, that has implications for the available fiscal space.  Our point is that we disagree that the economy is overheating and, therefore, the fiscal space figure for 2018 is overly conservative.

I would argue that the structural deficit is certainly not worse than the actual deficit.  The actual deficit in 2016 is probably not likely to be worse than 0.8% of GDP.  As it happens, the fiscal space of less than &euro;1 billion will sufficiently improve our structural balance, I would argue, to get us to the 0.5% level that we need to be at, and, therefore, simply maintaining that and applying the expenditure benchmark in future years will be sufficient.<\/p><p> That does not mean I am correct.  It is possible that the economy is overheating.  It is possible that potential growth rates will not manifest.  It is true that the potential growth rates being talked about by me, the Department of Finance and others are based upon assumptions for productivity in excess of 1% per year.  It is true that productivity growth in the west has been less than 1% for over a decade, although there may be measurements associated with that, and it is possible that the reference rates are much lower, the structural dynamics of the economy are much worse than we think and, therefore, we need to be particularly prudent.  That argument can be made, but in our view it is sufficient to apply the convergence margin, which is the structural deficit rule, for 2017 as a precautionary measure.  We can then look at it again, not to pre-empt 2018, but to look at whether we are overheating, look at what the deficit is likely to be, attempt to come up with some methodology for determining the degree of overheating and the structural deficit, and to determine independently of the Commission where we are in terms of the fiscal position and, therefore, what fiscal space is available.
