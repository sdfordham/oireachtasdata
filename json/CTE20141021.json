This meeting is timely for a number of reasons, not least that I am speaking to the committee at the time of Bord na gCon&rsquo;s response to the Indecon report which was published in July last.<\/p><p>  The greyhound industry is a significant one, with a footprint in every county in Ireland.  It has an important economic dimension and employs several thousand people, directly and indirectly. There are many dimensions to the greyhound industry.  It is variously a sport, a business and a community-based activity that has a value beyond the exclusively commercial.  We know that as a fund-raising vehicle, greyhound racing is hugely important to sports clubs, charities and the voluntary tier and makes an enormous contribution at that level.  By way of context, the Irish Greyhound Board licenses a total of 17 tracks, nine of which are owned by the board and ten of which are operated by it.  The remainder are owned and operated by private companies.  We are funded through a combination of income generated by our own racing-related activities, including the operation of Tote wagering from which we retain a share of the receipts.  Exchequer funding comes through the Horse and Jockey Racing Fund.  The recent budget decision to provide an additional &euro;2.8 million to the greyhound industry through the fund is most welcome, particularly given the 30% reduction in funding to the industry through that mechanism over a six year period.  <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the difficult trading environment for the industry, there has been steady progress on a number of fronts.  In recent years, Bord na gCon has discharged a &euro;2.5 million commitment to Dundalk stadium undertaken in 2006, has invested &euro;1 million in Clonmel stadium and refurbished Youghal Track at a cost of &euro;150,000.  The board formulated a new five year strategic plan, which is currently being updated in the face of current trading conditions and the Indecon report.  It has also put in place new arrangements with its bank and introduced a much more streamlined organisational structure reporting to the chief executive.  We have put in place a basis for the exploitation of the commercial potential of co-mingling and the streaming of Irish greyhound racing to an international audience.  The board has also introduced and implemented a new animal welfare code.<\/p><p>  Greyhound racing and coursing are minority sports competing for space in a very crowded marketplace.  We have been badly hit by the recession - of that there is no question.  Traditional patterns of attendance are changing.  In this regard, new technology is a double edged sword.  It presents commercial opportunities but also diminishes the need for attendance at race tracks. The business model going forward must take account of this transition.  The capital investment that has been made, and which is sometimes criticised, will allow the industry the capacity to market greyhound racing with consideration for changing consumer tastes, higher spectator expectations and new demographics.<\/p><p>  The Indecon report provides an independent review of the industry and the work of the board.  The Irish Greyhound Board enthusiastically supported the Minister's decision in directing the review to be undertaken.  It was necessary and desirable in light of the radically changed trading landscape, under-resourcing of the industry caused by severe cost cutting in IGB in recent years and the massive changes in the wagering environment, both positive and negative, that an informed independent view of the industry be taken.  We welcomed the report and regard it as a defining moment for the industry.<\/p><p>  Indecon made 27 recommendations on finance, governance, regulation and animal welfare.  The committee now has our response in a series of time-lined proposals to implement the recommendations.  While our chief executive, Ms Geraldine Larkin, will deal in more detail later with the Indecon report, I would like to offer some thoughts at this point.  The Indecon report is a pretty prescriptive document but in fact deals with issues on which the board was already very clearly focused.  We have already implemented its recommendations on strengthening the audit and risk management functions in IGB.  Our immediate priority is to stabilise the finances of Bord na gCon while allowing it to breathe and to improve its commercial performance.  All of this will involve an aggressive programme to improve attendances, develop additional sources of income and the sweating and sale of assets.<\/p><p>  We face a serious financial situation, caused by significant decline in most categories of our turnover since 2008.  Indecon references the negative developments in the Irish economy as contributors to that decline.  In the middle of a recession, people have to make choices and they do not have to go greyhound racing.  The more recent positive economic indicators and the pick-up in employment numbers will help but there will be a lag period before we see significant impacts.  There is no doubt that decisions which will be taken in the coming years will be difficult for some stakeholders to accept.  All stakeholders will have to accept that the decisions taken can only be on the basis of what is good for the industry as a whole.  There is a radical cultural change required in how we manage the industry and how we go forward.  The notion of poorly performing tracks having financial subsidy and support in perpetuity is gone.  Individual stadia will have to stand on their own two feet and be able to demonstrate a capacity to perform under certain headings.  There is likely to be rationalisation of tracks over a period and Harolds Cross will be sold at the appropriate time.  <\/p><p>  There will be a significant ramping up of governance and controls at IGB.  This process has already commenced.  Improvement of governance at IGB will be assisted by an external review of all corporate governance procedures and the establishment of a new code of governance appropriate to it.  These are important steps forward, as is the facilitation of board members to focus on significant, macro issues in IGB through the end of their board involvement in local tracks and stadia to which they have tremendous commitment but which is hugely time consuming.  Likewise, there will be changes with regard to regulation and welfare.  The board wants absolute transparency in these areas and where there are gaps in information for stakeholders, we are committed to addressing those and enforcing the regulations, as evident from our response to Indecon.<\/p><p>  I am sure the joint committee will wish to deal in more detail with these issues.   I again thank the committee for the invitation to address it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014102100004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Meaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1413896700,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Meaney for his opening statement and now invite Ms Larkin to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014102100004#D00300","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413896700,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I am pleased to give the joint committee a sense of the Irish Greyhound Board&rsquo;s response to the Indecon report.  We are a very challenged industry at present, the reasons for which are quite complex.  Some derive from legacy issues and some have been alluded to by the chairman in his opening commentary.  We have significant commercial and business issues to face and serious levels of debt to manage.  We operate in a rapidly changing and fast moving entertainment space.  At the same time, we are in receipt of public moneys and are, therefore, accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas and this committee.  That said, I see great opportunities to restore the sport and generate a thriving industry.  The industry is at a crossroads and while the Indecon report has highlighted many challenges and difficulties it is also a time of opportunity.<br\/>One of the main conclusions of the Indecon report is one from which all those with an interest in the industry should take confidence.  It states: &quot;If action is taken on the recommendations presented, Indecon believes that the organisation will be able to move to a position of higher surpluses and lower debt and provide a platform for the successful development of the sector.&quot;<br\/>Indecon, which focused on four core areas, governance, finance, regulation, and welfare, provides the IGB with a roadmap.  It does not represent the only perspective on the industry but we would be foolish to ignore what it has to say.<br\/>In terms of giving a high level overview of our response to Indecon, the following points are important<font color=\"#FF0000\">.  <\/font>Our response is grounded on measurable activity. <\/p> <p>Our financial strategy is based on generating &euro;3.5 billion operating profits by 2017.  This will be achieved through cost-cutting measures within the organisation, calibration of racing, and greater focus on the effectiveness of the money we are spending.  A significant contribution will also be realised from our work on the  internationalisation of our racing product and through new streaming, new co-mingling and fixed odds partnerships.<\/p><p> As our response says, we will be disposing of non-core and core assets in an orderly way to maximise commercial return from their sale.  These assets include buildings in Limerick, land in Cork and Limerick and, as the Chairman said, the Harold's Cross stadium.  The Irish Greyhound Board cannot keep funding tracks which are not giving a return on the money spent.  Any decision on future funding will take into account the multiplicity of factors impacting on a stadium&rsquo;s performance.  These will not be exclusively commercial metrics, although financial performance is critical and will include, for example, the strength of the local dog pool, the level of sponsorship achieved, the attendance levels and tote performance.<\/p><p> Similarly, there will be significant reforms to the regulatory framework of the IGB, both from an operational and legislative perspective.  These reforms will be based around the introduction of new and enhanced control measures in all regulatory processes and procedures.  In particular,  these include monitoring the use and misuse of substances in the racing greyhound, establishing a clear policy to provide an effective deterrent to licensed parties subject to our disciplinary system and, above all, ensuring integrity services in the greyhound industry are aligned with international best practice.  There will also be greater regulatory transparency with more detail published, including the publication of details of control committee hearings.  Excellence in the regulation regime and alignment with best international practice is very much a priority for the IGB.  In that context, the board is pleased to note that, following its recent presentation to the independent control committee, it has increased financial penalties for breaches of regulation. <\/p><p> Discussions have commenced between the IGB and Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine officials to identify changes that need to be made to primary legislation to underpin regulation and integrity.  Compliance with the 2011 Welfare of Greyhounds Act is also a requirement for all those in the industry.  Sanctions for welfare breaches will include a greater use of existing powers, endorsement of trainers' licences, issuing of fixed payment notice and exclusion of non-compliant owners and trainers from all events licensed by the IGB and the Irish Coursing Club.  Additional supports will be  provided by the IGB to re-homing greyhounds when resources permit.<\/p><p> Whatever criticism might be levelled about the past, we have a greyhound industry now with an infrastructure of stadia of which we can be proud.  The new facilities that have been created have averted the kind of decline apparent in other markets.  The challenge now is to use that infrastructure to grow attendances and build the leisure aspect of the industry.<\/p><p> The Chairman has referred to the much more challenging economic environment that exists for businesses like ours which depend on discretionary consumer choices for attendances and tote income.  Our aim must be to position the organisation and industry for strong recovery when consumer confidence returns.  A strong unified collective effort is required from everyone in the industry if we are to restore it as a sport, leisure activity and business.<\/p><p> The industry has also been something of a lightning rod for controversy and disagreements among stakeholders, and that is not helpful.  I can understand the impact these have had on the confidence of those in the middle ground who want the industry to be put on a clear path to gain momentum and prosper.  A priority for me and for the board is to improve relationships with all stakeholders, to communicate better and to set out a clear programme for recovery to ensure the industry survives and thrives into the future.  We have a good deal of work to do.  While we will consult all industry stakeholders and strive to work in concert with them as we move forward, that does not remove the obligation on the board and the IGB to take difficult and unpopular decisions if they are necessary.  I am optimistic about the future.  The Indecon report and the board&rsquo;s response to it are important first steps to achieving our goals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014102100004#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Larkin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413897300,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Following today's meeting, will we be making a submission to the Minister?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014102100005#E00200","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1413897300,"counter":16,"content":"<p>While not wanting to discuss the business of the committee, we can do that or we can decide if we want to have further hearings with stakeholders before we do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014102100005#E00300","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1413897300,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Sooner or later we will do that because we will not just let this matter lie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014102100005#E00400","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1413897300,"counter":18,"content":"<p>No.  We agreed that before bringing in any stakeholders, we would invite in the representatives of Bord na gCon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014102100005#E00500","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1413897300,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe as ucht an cur i l&aacute;thair inniu.  The Indecon report  makes horrendous reading.  The industry got &euro;103.4 million to invest, yet it has still managed to find itself in a dire financial position.  No doubt the downturn in the economy will be cited for that, but many businesses that should have been more directly affected by the downturn have survived much better than Bord na gCon.  A comparison of figures in terms of the number of people involved in the greyhound industry in 2006 and the number currently involved in it shows there has been a total failure.<\/p><p>  The turnover from racing facilities has dropped from &euro;63.4 million to &euro;28 million.  I would interested to have sight of the figures for the period prior to the height of Celtic tiger years but we have not been given those.  Did the turnover suddenly increase in the period from 2002 to 2006 from &euro;28 million to &euro;63 million?  That is the measure of how much the tiger economy impacted on the revenue accruing.  I suspect that did not happen.  There was a massive operating loss in 2013 of &euro;9.6 million on a turnover of &euro;28 million.  That is disastrous in business terms.  I understand the preliminary results for this year show that despite the upturn in the economy and revenue, the tax take and economic activity having increased, as the Government would advise us, attendance levels are down.  The number of active owners has dropped dramatically from 14,000.  I doubt if they all suddenly jumped out, as it were, in 2007.  Therefore, it is not as if the Celtic tiger economy accounts for all this.  The number has decreased from 14,000 to 8,000, which is almost halved.<\/p><p>  What we have got from all this investment on behalf of the taxpayers is a massive debt.  I am not an expert on greyhounds as I am not involved in the industry.  I could count on two hands the number of greyhound races I have attended, and those I attended were mainly charity events.  From reading the reports, having listened to what has been going on and reading between the lines of what the new chief executive had to say, it seems the regulatory regime and the integrity services have been deficient.  I have heard many stories about what was going on in terms of tests and various things that were happening and matters not being pursued.  Various allegations have been made and I would not like to repeat some of them, even under the protection of the privilege of the  House.  The Indecon report indicates failure of the regulatory regime and of all the integrity services.  In fairness to the new chief executive, she pointed out in her statement that this must all change, that it has been deficient and that one of the reasons this industry has declined so dramatically is that people lost faith in it.  That is very sad because, as pointed out by many people, greyhound racing is the poor person's horse racing.  It has a low capital investment compared with getting involved in thoroughbred racehorses.  It is something people like to do, but no one wants to be involved in an industry that cannot say it has the highest standards.<\/p> <p> There are many questions to be answered and I am not happy.  Someone new will be left with a legacy and while I do not have problem with this, I am not happy because we have not been given an explanation as to why Indecon had to come in, and taking into account that these reports must always be careful in what they state, this report appears to be quite blunt about deficiencies.  The chief executive spoke today about significant reforms to the regulatory framework of the IGB from an operational and legislative perspective.  If it was working fine, why would it need reform?  He spoke about the introduction of new enhanced control measures in all regulatory processes and procedures, in particular monitoring the use and misuse of substances in greyhound racing.  We are speaking about a litany of failures to deal with the issue.  How many of the six people on the board, including the chairman, were on the board during this period?  Does the chairman not think, in view of the indictment in the Indecon report and what the chief executive has had to say to us, that the honourable thing would have been for the board members to state they had served their time and that it was time for a full new brush with a clean sweep of everything in order that others could pick up?  Unfortunately, the term of office of those members in place during the period has led to the devastating report we have in front of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014102100005#E00600","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413897900,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I welcome the members of the board and staff.  In 2014, Bord na gCon received &euro;10.84 million in State funding.  I have discussed this matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, who has responsibility for Bord na gCon.  He initiated the Indecon report, which was due out earlier this year but eventually came out in recent months.  Many issues with regard to Bord na gCon about which we were concerned have arisen during this discussion.  When the report came out, the credibility of Bord na gCon was shot dead because the report is horrendous, not alone with regard to the financial situation in the organisation but also with regard to the governance and regulation of the greyhound industry, the doping of dogs and the follow-up on it, the performance of the organisation as a business entity, and the procedures put in place by Bord na gCon.<\/p><p>  Where would Bord na gCon be as an organisation if the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, had not initiated the report and if Indecon had not brought out the damning report in front of us for discussion today?  Would we be rumbling along as we have been for the past five or six years, seeing it going down the tubes?  I come from Carrick-on-Suir in Tipperary, a couple of miles from Clonmel which, as everyone knows, is the home of coursing.  I am a regular attendee at race meetings.  I am the former owner of some bad dogs.  I have seen the industry fall asunder in front of our eyes and nothing has been done about it.  The two statements we have heard are quite encouraging as stand-alone statements, but the big problem is the history which preceded them.  I do not believe this can be turned around by what has been presented to us in the statements we have heard today and in the response from Bord na gCon to the Indecon report.  It is the job of the witnesses to convince me it will happen.<\/p><p>  I bring everything down to basics, and the basics are that people will not go to dog racing any more because of the doping.  When doping is found, the investigations are not followed up and ordinary people who have paid for dogs will not go to the track on a Friday or Saturday night because they do not believe their dog will have a chance.  This is the basic nuts and bolts of what is going on.  All pious platitudes of what will be done in future are torn asunder by the fact it has not been done until now.  If the Indecon report had not been written, would we be here today?<\/p><p>  With regard to the decision to sell the various landbanks, specifically Harold's Cross, what business case has been made that it should be the first track to be sold?  Prize money is small enough in its own right at present.  Was any alternative to reducing it examined?  It is the bread and butter of the small breeder and trainer.  Will the witnesses give specifics on how they will turn around the financial disaster that is Limerick?  Will they make a credible case that Limerick will be dealt with properly?  I understand that two years after a stud dog dies, the sperm is taken out of use.  Will the witnesses clarify whether this is happening?  Both speakers referred to a control committee.  How was this put together?  Who are the members?  To whom are they answerable for the decisions they make?  Will the witnesses clarify who decides on the staff at tracks under the control of Bord na gCon?  How are they monitored with regard to the need for numbers and from where does the money come to pay them?  Is it directly from the board or does it come through other mechanisms?<\/p><p>  I have many other questions but I am conscious other members wish to speak.

To follow to a certain extent Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's concluding remarks on the length of time the board has been in place, from the presentations the peak of capital expenditure was in 2010, which was the same time as the turnover collapsed from &euro;63 million to &euro;33 million.  When did the chairman take up his position?  How many people have had their board membership renewed since 2010?<\/p><p>  It is quite obvious that IGB is in serious financial difficulty.  A significant issue which has not been mentioned is the pension deficit, which seems to have been a noose around IGB's neck for quite a while.  What specific methods have been put in place to try to address this matter as well as the other issues mentioned?  There has been much talk about asset disposal.  Anyone in difficulty must think about how to get out of the hole.  A decision seems to have been made on asset disposal but debt sustainability is very important.

I was interested to hear the presentation made by the board of the Irish Greyhound Board.  I wish the new chief executive officer well with the daunting and unenviable task of trying to restore public confidence in the board.  The Indecon report made it clear that the organisation has seen a drastic fall of 55.6% in revenues over the period covered by the report.  The witnesses are here today because the taxpayer provides annual funding of over &euro;11 million to the industry.  That figure will increase next year.  One can argue whether it is right or wrong for the taxpayer to fund greyhound racing while children are waiting for treatment in our public hospitals.  That is a debate for another day.  The question we need to consider today is whether we are obtaining value for money.  Is the corporate governance in the organisation receiving this funding up to scratch?  Is the money being spent by the taxpayer bringing an output for the taxpayer?  The simple answer to that question is \"No\".  The Indecon report clearly highlights that.  It clearly identifies a number of shortcomings to which I will come in a moment.<\/p><p>  I agree with my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, that the Indecon report is extremely damning about an industry that is currently not fit for purpose.  I have looked over the Irish Greyhound Board's annual report for 2012, the most recent year for which such a report is available.  It shows that the debt-to-equity gearing ratio increased from 26% in 2006 or 2007 to 66.6% in 2013.  Surely, by anyone's standards, that raises massive governance questions for the board of the Irish Greyhound Board.  What was happening in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012?  It is unbelievable that the board did not take corrective action when the net debt-to-equity ratio from a gearing point of view was moving in that direction.<\/p><p>  I agree with Senator Landy that the Minister stepped in here because the disquiet coming from breeders and owners was being raised with Members of the Oireachtas.  I know I certainly raised it in the Seanad and perhaps also at this committee.  The Minister has had to undertake an independent investigation, which has proved that the board was simply not fit for purpose.  I would like to know whether the current chairman of the board believes these issues were discussed at board level.  What corrective actions, if any, were taken?  If such actions were not taken, why not?  In the view of the chairman, is an appropriate mix of expertise represented on the board?  I refer to the financial competence and expertise of the individuals on the board.  Does the chairman agree with my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, that the board is no longer fit for purpose?  Given that a new chief executive officer is in place, perhaps a new board should be allowed to take over to freshen the image of the Irish Greyhound Board at a governance level.  I would contend that a new board is required.  That is a matter for the current board members and-or the Minister.<\/p><p>  I would like to touch on a few other issues.  If we look at the figures for the private and public tracks, we will see that the private tracks are losing money hand over fist.  I have gathered figures on the performance of the private tracks in 2013.  It seems that the income of those tracks was approximately &euro;3.4 million.  When costs of approximately &euro;8.1 million, including prize money grants, are factored in, it is clear that these tracks lost approximately &euro;4.5 million in 2013 alone, from an economic point of view.  Surely that is not a sustainable position.  We can blame the economy and everything else, but every organisation, regardless of whether it is publicly or privately funded, must react to internal and external economic factors in Ireland and elsewhere.  There seems to have been no reaction here whatsoever.  It seems that no action was taken to cut costs or improve performance.  It appears that a decision has been made to let the taxpayer foot the bill.  It is simply not good enough for those involved in the board to think they will be okay because the grant they get is increasing next year.<\/p><p>  I have many examples of things that are going on in the industry and many questions about them.  I know time is against us.  The asset sales have been mentioned.  How long have those properties been on the market?  Has there been any negotiation on them?  Have any offers been made?  I would like to delve into many other financial matters.  I might have an opportunity to do so during the question and answer session.  Regarding the issue of drugs in the greyhound industry, the witnesses might help me out with the name of a drug that is being tested for.  I know it is the same form of drug for which Ben Johnson was banned in 1988.  My understanding is that two types of test can be carried out for the drug in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014102100007#G00200","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413898500,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Is the Senator referring to stanozolol?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014102100007#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Hilary Forde"},{"type":"speech","time":1413898500,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Yes.  I understand that both of the available tests for stanozolol - an oil-based test and a water-based test - are undertaken in the UK but the water-based test is the only one that is undertaken here in the Republic of Ireland.  It seems this is based on the Australian model that is used here.  It appears that when Irish dogs are tested for this drug when they go to race in England, the test results are predominantly positive for this drug.  I understand this can be attributed to the new testing methods that are in place in England.  I can point the witnesses in the direction of various examples.  I am absolutely certain that they are aware of these examples.  Following a hearing held by the disciplinary committee of the Greyhound Board of Great Britain on 16 September last, a professional trainer, George Gibbinson, was found to be in breach of UK rules.  I would like to know why, in cautioning Mr. Gibbinson, the disciplinary committee felt the need to urge all trainers to exercise due diligence in assessing the drug status of greyhounds purchased from Ireland.  When did the chairman and the board last discuss this issue?  Have they discussed it?  I understand steps may be afoot to bring in new standards of testing that would include oil-based testing.  How many of the tests that were carried out on Irish dogs by the Irish Greyhound Board over the past three years were sent to laboratories in England for further testing to clarify the authenticity of the tests carried out here?<\/p> <p>How many of those tests were sent to laboratories in England for further testing to clarify the authenticity of the tests carried out in this country?  What were the results of the tests?  If a positive result is shown at any Irish greyhound meeting, what is the board's protocol with regard to publishing the outcome of that test?  Is it published immediately or within 24 hours, for instance?  Drug abuse in sport cannot be accepted or condoned.  We are talking about an animal which does not drug itself to achieve greatness, even if athletes sometimes do so.  The trainers are culpable.  The governing structures and regulations in place are questionable.  What is being done to bring them up to standard?  We can talk about the Australian standard or any other standard but our nearest neighbour, England, has questions about the greyhounds being purchased or raced.  I refer to a recent case where a very famous jockey was part of a syndicate which owned a dog which also tested positive in England.  Such instances are having a negative effect on the Irish greyhound industry.  What is being done to rectify that?<\/p><p> I have a question for the chief executive and the chairman.

Charity nights were very successful during the golden years.  We must encourage the staff to make an effort, to get up and out, so to speak.<\/p><p>  Mullingar is my local track although I live in Trim.  Many people in the Meath area do not know anything about the Mullingar track because it is not advertised well enough.  We need to encourage community and voluntary groups in the area to come to Mullingar for their fund-raising charity nights.  There is no reason Mullingar greyhound track or other tracks should not host charity nights every week of the year to bring in large attendances.  Many charities were overcharged on track rental and this issue must be examined.<\/p><p>  The staff wages bill is at &euro;8 million which is far too high.  Ms Larkin will examine this cost and I ask her to say how she intends to deal with it.  What is the benefit in selling Harold's Cross track and how will the money be spent?  The Government is giving another &euro;2.6 million along with the &euro;11 million from last year.  Could this funding be used to pay off the debt and the sale of Harold's Cross be deferred?  I know the debt must be repaid but I do not think selling Harold's Cross immediately is the right way to go.  I know Shelbourne Park keeps the whole show going.<\/p><p>  With regard to the drugs situation, most owners and breeders say the fines do not fit the crime and the system used on the track and at coursing meetings will have to change.<\/p><p>  Land around Shelbourne Park was sold many years ago but the price was never published.

One man and a small staff run the whole show.  It is a private operation with funding from the IGB.  It attracts very large attendances along with a significant bookmaker turnover.

I suggest we examine that model.<\/p><p>  I welcome the effort made by Mr. Meaney and Mr. Lewins to sell the picture rights into England and further afield which will provide a new revenue stream.

I will deal with the existing structures of the Irish Greyhound Board, IGB.  I am very comfortable with the ability of the able team in place to my right and my left to deal with the issues raised today.  I was appointed chairman of the board three years ago.  I neither sought nor lobbied for the position but, having taken it up, I have given it everything I possibly could in the three years.  Two members of the current board were in place when I became chairman.  Indecon recommended an increase in the size of the board from six with a chairman to eight with a chairman.  That is a good idea which we have taken on board in our response to Indecon.<\/p><p>  It is important to clarify that the position of chairman and his colleagues are non-executives roles.  Our functions must be taken into the equation.  When I became involved, the structure that existed in Bord na gCon was not operational.  I do not for a moment criticise my predecessors, who were all good people and, like myself, did things to the best of their ability.  It was a very flat structure with 19 people reporting to a CEO.  I had come from the private sector where we had functional directors and my immediate task once I got my feet under the table was to bring the greyhound board to a similar scenario, where each of the functions, namely, finance, wagering, commercial, which is not with us today, regulations and racing governance would be all headed up by an expert in the field.  The executive was completed a couple of months ago.  I freely admit that it took longer than I had planned or hoped.  Things tend to happen a little more slowly in the IGB than in private industry, but we now have a full executive in place.  I can confidently say that each member of the executive is very well qualified in his or her field.  That takes a huge onus off the board.  While board members have very definite skills ranging from legal to finance, we do not run the business on a day-to-day basis.<\/p><p>  When I became chairman of Bord na gCon, our borrowings were &euro;22 million.  There was an outstanding IOU for Dundalk since 2006 that had to be honoured.  We were faced with either closing the stadium in Clonmel due to health and welfare issues or investing money in it.  We invested &euro;1 million there and similarly in the stadium in Youghal.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v spoke about hiding behind the economic collapse.  Whether he accepts it or not, without doubt in the same period it was a very difficult time for trading in Ireland, in particular in the leisure sector where people can decide whether to go racing.  Despite having to honour the commitment on &euro;2.5 million, the finances of the IGB have remained static.  There was a massive reduction of more than 30% in State support since the economic downturn.<\/p><p>  If I felt that I or the board were not doing an appropriate job, we would stand aside.  I am confident that with the new skills we have on the board and the new executive that is in place, we can and will turn this business around in a short period.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and another speaker described the Indecon report as damning.  It clearly states, however, that if the industry follows the recommended path, it can and will be very successful.  I will leave it to my executive to get into the nitty-gritty.  That is probably the best way.  I would like to deal personally with many of the issues raised, but it would be wrong not to let the functional directors deal with them.  I am more than happy to take a question on any point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014102100009#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Meaney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413899700,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I have quite a number of questions and I ask members to forgive me if I do not respond to everything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014102100009#J00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1413899700,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I will remind Ms Larkin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014102100009#J00500","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413899700,"counter":42,"content":"<p>Senator Landy asked a number of questions on the sale of Harold&rsquo;s Cross greyhound stadium, the decision to cut prize money, issues relating to artificial insemination, our staff allocation and the control committee.  I will deal with that group of questions first, which might impact on some of the other questions raised.<\/p><p>  Senator Landy inquired about the analysis that was done on the stadium in Harold&rsquo;s Cross.  Apart from the analysis carried out by the board on that stadium and the suite of stadia owned by the IGB, the matter was examined separately by Indecon.<\/p> <p> It was the conclusion of the independent analysis by Indecon and the board's deliberations that the Harold's Cross stadium be put up for sale.  It was not an easy decision and was not taken lightly by the executive or the board.  Among the factors contributing to that decision is the debt, which is not sustainable.  We have to address that.  We want to maximise the value we get from disposing of the Irish Greyhound Board, IGB stadia.  The potential value realisable from any sale is a crucial factor.  Another factor is the proximity of other tracks and the impact on the dog pool and the owners and trainers in an area if a track is to be disposed of.  For those multiple reasons the Harold&rsquo;s Cross track was nominated for sale.  There is a commitment in our response to Indecon that it will be ready for sale by the end of next year.  That means that in the meantime we will secure planning permission for the site.<\/p><p> Some committee members asked when the other property we have for sale was put up for sale in the first instance and what is the process for the future and the properties we have yet to sell.  Those for sale are those in Limerick.  They have been for sale since the IGB moved into its new headquarters.  The main properties yet to sell are the land in Cork and Harold&rsquo;s Cross.  We will maximise the value from those properties by seeking planning permission and the relevant zoning necessary on them.  We will not be giving them away to the first bidder who comes along.  We are very clear on that.<\/p><p> There have been several questions about how we will turn this industry around and get back to growing attendance.  My focus as the new chief executive officer is on looking forward rather than backwards and using Indecon as a key driver for that.  We have already started, in advance of Indecon having commenced, considering the branding of all tracks such that we have local branding customised to each local track but maintain an overall policy and feel from an IGB corporate perspective.  That is driven forward using traditional marketing methodologies and new digital infrastructures.  We are pushing this through Facebook and other social media and encouraging the younger generation to attend at tracks and share their experiences with others.<\/p><p> This work is based on significant research and market analysis such that we now have our customer attendance segmented and we are very clear about the different types of customer, whether the general owner-trainer attending or the corporate leisure patron or the benefit attendees.  We have very clear analysis and market segmentation and we are tracking each and every one of those on a stadium-by-stadium basis such that we can gear and focus how much new marketing we should use through digital infrastructures and the level of traditional marketing and radio campaigns.  There is a very informed picture behind that.  Taking all of those factors and the different market segments into account our intention is in the coming year to grow the various customer segments by between 1% and 6%.<\/p><p> That marketing strategy and drive to new attendance is also driven by proposals to target new levels of ownership.  The current breeder scheme that lapsed with the reduction and reversal of the 2012 increase in prize money unfortunately did not give us the anticipated bounce in owners and breeders.  I want to expand the base of owners and see how we might bring in new owners and bring syndicates and syndication back into the industry.  It has often been said that the greyhound is the poor man&rsquo;s racehorse but it still costs a lot of money, relatively speaking.  There is a huge time commitment in the ongoing care, training and maintenance of a greyhound.  I want to consider how to grow ownership.  To do that in a way that is practical, pragmatic and focused and will deliver results we will have to sit down with the various stakeholders in the industry and come up with the best solution to growing ownership.  Already there have been several suggestions, some of them poles apart, on where it would be best to focus our money.  It is a matter of bringing all the ideas together and pushing that forward. <\/p><p> To grow attendance we are considering how we make our sales.  There has been talk of getting staff at track level to go out and push sales.  They are masters of many things.  We are examining how we can better support them and how we can more intelligently and strategically use our track staff resources.  We have always had a sales unit in Thurles for taking external bookings.  We have done limited pro-active work on outbound sales.  A core initiative will be to have an outbound sales team that will be centrally based but will support all managers.  That work has started.  There is a pilot under way and it is beginning to yield results.<\/p><p> Many speakers have mentioned that costs have escalated over recent years but there has in fact been considerable cost reduction and cost cutting throughout the organisation.  Our marketing and advertising expenditure has suffered and been significantly reduced.  On closer examination of the marketing budget it is evident that a disproportionate amount of money is being spent to convert the converted, so to speak, going directly to the greyhound industry.  This will be an unpopular decision but I see us diverting more funds to general marketing as opposed to industry-related marketing such that we can target those not coming into the industry.  That gives a flavour of some of the high level measures we are taking to grow attendance at all tracks.<\/p><p> Senator Landy mentioned the continuing difficulties with artificial insemination, AI.  That has been a significant issue and has been a priority for me and my colleague, Hilary Forde.  Proposals have been submitted to, and approved by, the board which I believe will shortly be approved by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  These will clarify the position for the future and give us the time to conduct a genetic study of the aging of straws and its long-term impact on a greyhound.<\/p> <p>That has been dealt with. <\/p><p> The Senator also asked for the membership of the control committee.  I cannot answer him on that as I do not have the membership to hand, but I will be glad to provide it subsequently in writing.  The control committee is independent.  If they are answerable, they are answerable to the appeals committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014102100009#J00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Larkin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413900900,"counter":45,"content":"<p>What is that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014102100011#L00200","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413900900,"counter":46,"content":"<p>There is a control committee and then there is an appeals committee envisaged under the legislation.

In fact, it was the first issue I took down.  The cut in prize money was looked at in terms of the ongoing sustainability and viability of the industry.  It was also looked at in terms of the dog pools we have now as opposed to what we had in 2012, as well as the opportunities for owners and trainers now as opposed to the situation in 2012 in terms of winning prizes.  In addition, it was looked at against the cold reality of our current finances.  While it was regrettable, it was very necessary.  It is a saving that will generate &euro;750,000 for us in a year.  It is a priority for us to restore it.  Against that, however, we have to be realistic - it can only be restored when the IGB is performing at a level whereby we can meet our other liabilities and commitments.<\/p><p>  Deputy Deering raised the matter of media rights and whether or not we are behind the scenes.  I would say that we are not behind the scenes.  I am glad to say that media rights will be an issue for the IGB.  We are currently at advanced stages of negotiations with a number of different onward providers in terms of selling on the IGB product.  That product has been split into a number of different models, such that we maximise the value and content from our bread and butter products.  Once we progress, part of the process will be the conclusion of media rights.  We have already spoken to some of the private tracks about media rights.<\/p><p>  Models are in place with our colleagues in HRI that clearly show a good example of what needs to be done.  There is no point in reinventing the wheel because we are similar industries.  There is a lot to be taken and learned from that.  The media rights issue is very much on or agenda and one that is being progressed.  I already mentioned what we are doing about breeding and ownership, and how we will deal with that.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also raised the question of the pension deficit and how we are about to address that.  We have submitted proposals to the Department giving a range of options as to how we might best address the pension issue.  It is clearly a priority issue for us given the fact that it directly impacts on so many existing staff, as well as staff that are no longer with us.  Those proposals are being considered by the Department.  The additional allocation of funding that we got in budget 2015 will also be a significant contributor for the IGB in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014102100011#L02400","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1413900900,"counter":68,"content":"<p>On that point, does Ms Larkin intend to use the extra funding in this budget to offset some of the deficit in the pension fund?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014102100011#L02500","speaker":"968"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413900900,"counter":69,"content":"<p>As regards how we use the additional funding, we will be guided by the direction in Indecon.  Indecon identified the pension deficit.  Equally, it would have identified the debt liabilities we have.  Apart from those two core issues, the extra money will also be used to re-engage and reignite various maintenance programmes around the tracks.  Up to now, the board has had to reduce expenditure so there is a heavy maintenance schedule to be undertaken.  Within that, I would also like to see money going back to owners and welfare, which are core issues.  The challenge for the IGB will be how to maximise that additional funding so that we can benefit as many different calls on the funding as possible and ultimately grow the industry as well.<\/p><p>  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill queried how long the properties have been on the market.  The Limerick properties have been on the market for some time.  The Cork property has yet to go on the market and will be subject to planning, as is the case with Harold's Cross.<\/p> <p>The Deputy also raised a number of questions about stanozolol and other anabolic steroids.  The IGB sends a control sample of tests to the UK.  That is all that is required for our accreditation.  The IGB laboratory is accredited AA.  It is accredited to both the Irish National Accreditation Board and the United Kingdom Accreditation Service, so we meet the laboratory standards of both.  That being the case, the Deputy asked what happens if a positive is found.  If a positive is found, the procedure up to now has been a hearing involving the owner, the control steward at the track and a representative from the IGB, following which the matter is referred to the control committee.  In recent times, a review of the time taken to conduct the middle piece of that work, the hearing with the control steward, identified that it was causing a considerable delay.  That stage is being removed so that cases will go before the control committee much faster.<\/p><p> The Deputy also asked if it was possible to publish positive results.  Heretofore, we have not done this, because the results have been associated with the determination of the case.  We are putting new protocols in place for this piece of work so that it will be very clear what we are going to do if we publish results.  It will also involve removing the dog and the existence of a particular prohibited substance from the subsequent deliberation.  There is a need for very clear rules to be implemented before we start on that process, so that everybody is quite clear about it.  However, that work is under way with my colleague and we are determined that it will be put in place.  In the interim, I would like us to be in a position to publish more statistics so that people have more of an idea what we are about and more confidence in us, so that one can see when cases go to a control committee how long they are at that control committee and so on.<\/p><p> The Deputy also queried the threshold for stanozolol and whether that has been varied or increased by the control committee and-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014102100011#L02600","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Larkin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413901500,"counter":71,"content":"<p>The thresholds are not set by a control committee; they would be set by a laboratory.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014102100012#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Hilary Forde"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413901500,"counter":72,"content":"<p>What I was about to say was that those thresholds have not been varied.<\/p><p>  There was also a question about whether the board has plans to sell stadiums other than Harold's Cross.  The tenet of the document that we will have put before the committee is not so much outright sale at this point.  We are committed to supporting all of our own stadiums and all the private stadiums.  At the same time, we cannot continue indefinitely, as has been echoed many times here today, to support tracks that are not viable and that are not delivering value for money with taxpayers' money.  We have constructed a set of metrics, both financial and non-financial.  We will assess each and every track based on those metrics and look at what the various tracks are delivering back to the IGB and, in broader terms, to the industry and the taxpayer.  In the short three months I have been here, much of the feedback I have been getting is that staff on the ground are not committed to developing the industry.  This gives everybody - the staff on the ground, the local owners and trainers - a role in ensuring the viability of a track is maintained.  We will be measuring the financial performance and, entirely apart from attendance, that measurement will also consider the level of sponsorship we can get in and what level of community involvement is attached to each track in terms of benefit nights.  Deputy Butler mentioned the benefit nights in Mullingar and there is great work done around the country in benefit nights, with huge amounts of money raised, I am glad to say.  On the other hand, the difficulty is that many benefit nights are going back to the same pot of people looking for support.  For us the challenge is to ensure, with the local communities as much as anything else, that we can identify different segments and different charities that will benefit on an ongoing basis from interaction with us.  It is a very crowded space, no more than any other aspect of our business, in that we face challenges from all sorts of new and emerging charity fund-raisers - Strictly Come Dancing, virtual horse-racing, and many more.  It is a matter of making sure that we are out there and focused.<\/p><p>  It is crucial that we benefit from local owners in terms of growing benefit nights.  Equally, the dog pool in an area associated with a track is crucially important in deciding what we do with it.  We will look at all these metrics.  We look also at the state of repair of a track and the level of capital investment that has occurred already.  Some tracks have yet to be developed, and it would be wrong to put them all on the same level in terms of evaluation.  These are the ways in which we will be assessing tracks, because ultimately we must ensure that the money we are spending is benefiting the industry in the best possible way and that we are giving money where it is delivering the most and giving the best return to the taxpayer.<\/p><p>  Deputy Butler asked about the arrangements put in place with the bank.

While that committee is independent, it did accede to increased fines.  We have already had a number of cases in respect of which such fines have been applied.

The 2009 results, which were published in 2010, show a total liability - between bank borrowings and the pension liability - of &euro;16.8 million.  The 2013 results show a total liability of &euro;29 million.  Bank borrowings increased from &euro;13 million to &euro;22 million in the period from 2009 to 2013.  The real deterioration with regard to bank borrowings would have occurred in 2010 but the results for that year would not have been published until 2011.  The people who would have been aware of this would have been those in government in the period from 2011 up to now.  There has been a major problem in the past four years.   Unlike Deputy Butler, I take a completely non-partisan view of this issue.  When the Deputy becomes a Minister he will discover that one only gets the information when one gets it.  In other words, Ministers only become aware of serious problems when they are presented with the accounts.<\/p><p>  I take this opportunity to commend the current Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on what he did in the context of commissioning the report from Indecon.  I am big enough to acknowledge it when a Government does take action.  The report is timely, particularly in light of the great concern within the industry.  I am not in the business of playing political games with this matter.  I do not care who appointed whom or to what board.  It does not make any difference to me.  However, I am obliged to state that there has been a major failure in this instance and the Indecon report highlights that fact.  The board does not have day-to-day responsibility but it does have overall responsibility.  Financial losses are one thing but such losses allied to a total loss of faith in the integrity of the industry is something else entirely.  The Indecon report clearly indicates that there is no faith in the integrity of the industry and highlights the fact that this has had a huge effect.  Other industries which faced even bigger challenges since the downturn have not experienced the same level of difficulty as Bord na gCon.<\/p><p>  The committee must take a serious view in respect of this matter and it is to be hoped that the Minister will do so too.  Ultimately, the broom must be wielded and we must start again.  The industry must regain its integrity and it must not only be completely cleaned up but this must also be seen to happen.  From everything I have heard - which, unfortunately, has been confirmed in the report - the industry lacks credibility.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill put it very well when referring to what our British counterparts are saying about dogs coming from Ireland.<\/p><p>  Like Deputy Martin Ferris, I wish only the best for the greyhound industry.  I am aware of the importance of the Sportsground in Galway, not only as a venue for greyhound racing but also for rugby.  I am not particularly into rugby but I am of the view that all sports and recreational activities should be encouraged.  I am delighted that we have a good venue for rugby in the west, which was not the case previously.  The concept of co-location is very welcome and I am sure it adds significantly to the viability of the greyhound track in Galway.  However, a major problem continues to exist.  I welcome the appointment of the new chief executive and the overhaul of the organisation.  That said, the board remains very small - at six plus one members - and two of those involved on it have been there since before Ms Larking was appointed.  It it time the Minister acted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014102100013#N01100","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1413902100,"counter":86,"content":"<p>Ms Larkin referred to the fact that the industry has sometimes been a lightning rod for controversy and for disagreement among stakeholders.

Repairing that breakdown must be the overlying objective if we are to bring confidence back to the sector.  The question, of course, is how one goes about doing it.  The Indecon report highlights many shortcomings that must be addressed one by one, including issues of financial oversight, day-to-day management and projection planning.  The most recent strategic plan objectives for year one fall far short of what is in the IGB's own plan.  That is an issue we have not touched on today and is, perhaps, a matter for another day.<\/p><p>  I wish to make clear that I have absolutely no vested interest in this sector.  We have a very fine, privately owned greyhound stadium in County Donegal which I understand is in difficulty and could potentially be put on the market.  Apart from once attending a greyhound stadium on a social occasion, I would not know one end of a greyhound from the other.  So far as I can see, however, the underlying issue is a lack of confidence in the sector itself.  I will draw a parallel with cycling, which may or may not be a fair thing to do.  Everybody knows about Lance Armstrong and the impact on that sport of the revelations about him.  The elephant in the room in cycling has been the drugs scandal.  Looking at it from the outside, without any vested interest whatsoever, it seems to me there also is an elephant in the room when it comes to greyhound racing.  It is something that is affecting the confidence of the sector and the buy-in in terms of getting new breeders and syndicates on board.  Why would anybody want to get involved in greyhound racing if there is a suspicion - even if it is nothing more than a suspicion - of generic and wide-scale doping in the industry, in a context where we do not have the testing mechanisms in place to determine whether or not the winner of last year's derby or this year's derby was legitimate?<\/p><p>  Reference was made to control samples being sent to Britain.  I understand from the Indecon report that 7, 307 tests were conducted in 2013, but I am not sure how many of those were sent to Britain.  Was the Indecon consultant fully briefed by the IGB in regard to the type of water-based testing that is done here and the availability of oil-based testing in the UK?  That is not referred to in the report, which is either a shortcoming on Indecon's part or a shortcoming on the part of the IGB in terms of its responsibility to inform the consultant about the different types of testing.  I recognise that the laboratories will calibrate the type of testing and follow industry best practice.  The Australian model is being used here, as I understand it.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge, too, that the control committee is entirely legislatively independent of the IGB.  However, the Indecon report indicated that the IGB itself questioned the control committee's findings and rubbished samples that were taken on certain occasions.  That raises questions, as Deputy Ferris noted.  I am not sure who sits on the control committee.  Are its members entirely independent or do they have any vested interests in the sector?  In my view, any member of a control committee should have no such interests and, in this particular case, no link to any animal or trainer.  I presume that is the case - if not, it is something that must be rectified urgently.  Certainly, it would be alarming if any control committee - for one reason or another, and the reasons are outlined in the Indecon report - should rubbish samples that tested positive.<\/p><p>  The drug-testing issue is one that needs to be challenged head on.  I am not sure what the plan is in this regard and I have not heard a great deal today in terms of any absolute plan.  There was no indication, for example, that the board intends to follow the UK drug-testing mechanism or how it will deal with and challenge the lack of confidence across the water in Irish greyhound racing.  Perhaps that is a conversation for another day when the new chief executive officer has had more time to reflect and plan.  It is something that must be challenged in a forthright way.  I urge the IGB, both board and staff, to reach out and listen to stakeholders, breeders, trainers and all involved in the industry.  Without those people, who very often are giving of their time on a voluntary basis, we will not have an industry in five or ten years time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014102100014#O00100","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1413902700,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Meaney wish to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014102100014#O00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413902700,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Thank you, Chairman.

That only reflects the interest held by the wider public, which we all endeavour to represent.  It is because it is such a traditional activity in many parts of the country that there is such genuine concern.  Many phrases such as \"reputation\", \"confidence\" and \"finance\" come up time and again.  In order to restore the financial position of the industry confidence and reputation have to be restored.  <\/p><p>  There are 27 recommendations.  The Indecon report has been very valuable.  I presume the response from the greyhound board is on the website at this stage and is publically available.  While all of that has happened, the elephant in the room has been reputation.  The issue may not have become apparent were it not for the crash in the economy.  Somebody on an expedition to a mountain who is hit by an avalanche might say there were weaknesses in the rules which allowed them to go there, but the main focus has to be on getting out alive.  The same applies to Bord na gCon.  It is a matter of the industry surviving.  Confidence and reputation need to be rebuilt.  <\/p><p>  The Indecon report recommends, among other things, legislation.  I remind everybody that section C of the heads of the Bill to be approved by Government is the greyhound industry (amendment) Bill to amend and extend the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 and the Greyhound Industry (Amendment) Act 1993 and related matters.  It is expected to be published in 2015.  Today we finalised agreement on a report on a pre-legislative scrutiny exercise we did on the general scheme of a Horse Racing Ireland (Amendment) Bill.  Integrity is an issue which has featured prominently.  Integrity and finance have been interlinked and have probably been the two key matters of greatest concern.  I anticipate that the Bill be go through the same process of pre-legislative scrutiny, at which stage we will have the Government and legislative response to the Indecon report and will know about the ongoing efforts made by the board and executive.<\/p><p>  Ms Larkin is a brave woman.  The Indecon report was published three months ago, and she started her job three months ago.  I hope she went in with her eyes wide open.  I wish everyone well.  The industry needs all stakeholders to feel they are a part of the solution to restore the status the industry, sport and recreation once had.  We took a decision to bring the Bord na gCon executive and board members before the committee to discuss the Indecon report before we held further hearings.  I anticipate we will agree the process at our meeting.  We have not finished and will send a response to the Minister before the publication of the draft Bill on the greyhound industry.  <\/p><p>  I thank members and the representatives from the greyhound board for their engagement.

While Mr. O'Reilly and I are representatives of the copiers and suppliers group, we believe the points we will be making apply generally to small businesses across the country which supply various types of equipment.  The issues arising are not limited to the processes and procedures in which we participate.  We represent a group of businesses based all around the country, including in Dundalk, Galway, Leitrim, Kilkenny, Tipperary, Cork and Dublin.  The group formed in 2012 in response to the actions of the National Procurement Service, which we believed would have a severe impact on the people we employ, our own futures and the very survival of the businesses in which we are involved.  As we felt we had to react to the position in which we found ourselves, we created the group and worked on the issue from there.<\/p><p>  The Office of Government Procurement defines an SME as a company with 250 or fewer employees and a turnover of not more than &euro;50 million.  It is our sincerely held belief that this definition is not appropriate in an Irish context.  The Central Statistics Office defines micro-companies as employing up to ten staff, small companies as employing between ten and 49 staff and medium companies as employing between 50 and 250 staff.  Based on that definition, SMEs employ nearly seven out of every ten people who participate in the Irish workforce.  A total of 90.8% of SMEs are micro-companies, employing 27% of the workforce.  A further 7% of SMEs are small businesses, employing 22% of the workforce.  Thus, 49% of the total workforce in this State are employed in companies with fewer than 15 employees.  A total of 1.3% of SMEs are in the final segment of companies with 50 to 250 employees, which, as I noted earlier, I do not regard as appropriate or relevant to the definition of an SME.  Companies in this category none the less employ a significant proportion of the workforce, at 19%.<\/p><p>  We want to know why micro and small SMEs are being excluded from tendering for public procurement contracts, even at a local level.  I will use Mr. O'Reilly as an example in Cork to explain what this means in practice.  Even though he has serviced the needs of a small national school for 20 years while providing a level of service and good value to his client over the period, because of the actions of the Office of Government Procurement he will be excluded from even offering a proposal.  It is not a question of being unable to compete; he is not allowed to compete.  We argue that this is due to a slavish adherence to the concept of aggregation and centralisation.  Aggregation is to do with how the Office of Government Procurement has taken responsibility for the requirements of the State, as it sees them, in specific sectors.  This does not affect copiers exclusively because, as I noted earlier, it also has an impact on other businesses.<\/p> <p>I have seen RFTs that relate to janitorial services, ICT consumables, paper and stationery, motor vehicles, etc., and the same rules apply.  By aggregating the needs of the State, it artificially inflates the requirements of smaller individual organisations that might well be subject to this tendering process.  A tender would be placed on the European e-tenders website and as a result of inflating the size of various contracts, a series of pre-qualification criteria would be applied.  In effect, 97.8% of all businesses in the State are excluded from even responding to a request for tenders in the first place.  If one is going to aggregate all of the State's requirements, one should centralise the procurement processes in order that all of the purchasing will be by a specific source, but that is not the case.  Do one or the other, but one cannot have one's cake and eat it.<\/p><p> In its new persona of being SME-friendly which involved a series of statements and circulars issued earlier this year the Office of Government Procurement has maintained that small businesses should create consortia.  At a previous meeting of the committee, attended by me and Mr. David O'Reilly, we were clearly advised by a representative of the Competition Authority that for us to sit in the room and discuss the equipment we supplied in terms of price or location would not only be a breach of common law but also a breach of criminal law.  Therefore, we would be colluding on price, which is called creating a cartel.  At that very meeting we also asked both the representative of the Competition Authority and a representative of the Office of Government Procurement to define how we could legally create a consortium that would enable us to respond to tenders, but we did not receive a reply.  In our belief, there is no such thing.  As we understand it, there is a precedent in respect of companies that have been brought to court.  They ran the risk of incurring heavy fines and terms of imprisonment; therefore, it is not something we are taking lightly.<\/p><p> I have one more point that links with the next slide, of which the Office of Government Procurement is totally aware.  If one reads any request for tenders that it issues, it may make reference to consortia.  Ultimately, however, what has to be clearly identified in a request for tenders is a main contractor and subcontractors.  My next slide refers to the potential impact this has on my business and similar businesses that have to act in that way.  The point I am clearly making is that acting as a subcontractor to a main contractor does not constitute acting as an equal partner in a consortium.  In fact, it is quite the opposite.  As a subcontractor, my turnover would be decimated or reduced significantly.  The main contractor would have to employ front-office staff to receive calls and need to employ back-office staff to fill orders.  In addition, they would need to have collection staff to obtain money, bill for and take care of everything.  I would simply take instructions from the main contractor to undertake specific jobs for which I would be paid a set fee.<\/p><p> The upshot of taking the main contractor-subcontractor route being put forward is that it would be called a consortium, which clearly it is not.  The main contractor, that typically would be outside the State, would have to increase in size and employ my staff to meet the demands of the tenders secured.  As a direct response, the size of the subcontractor would have to contract, dropping jobs to reduce the number of employees.  Turnover would also be significantly reduced and, in turn, profits would be reduced.<\/p><p> At a previous meeting of the committee, a representative of the Competition Authority was clearly asked what a SME could do to survive in this environment.  His comment was: \"You have got to consolidate.\"  When I asked him what he meant by this, he said: \"You have got to merge with the people you deal with.  You have got to create a brand new organisation that has no links to previous ones.\"<\/p> <p>In his view an acquired merge or to acquire a third party was the only way we could legally advance the process outside of the main contractor-subcontractor route that I have just identified that we found so inappropriate.  <\/p><p> Our group has incurred legal fees of &euro;206,000 to date in undertaking a judicial review of the actions of the Office of Government Procurement.  We are small businesses.  We did not undertake that process lightly.  We want to clearly flag it was an act of last resort.  We had no choice given the processes and procedures we saw in front of us, other than trying to protect ourselves in that manner.  I am not going to comment on the individual vagaries of the case but simply refer to it.  That is what we have had to spend to date.   I can only imagine what the State had to spend in the process and yet from our simple perception, small businesses are basically being ignored as part of this overall process.<\/p><p> What do small businesses need?  We are a copiers suppliers group but could just as easily be a group of stationers, janitors or supplies companies, ICT consumer supplies, paper suppliers, all of which have been impacted by various requests for tenders that have been issued by the State in the past.  What we need is a level playing field.  All we want is an opportunity to quote for local business.<\/p><p> Mr. David O'Reilly would like the opportunity to retain the business he has which he has nurtured and looked after for the previous 20 years to gain additional business with the local companies and schools or State offices in his area.  I simply ask that we be given an opportunity to tender.  By all means, the State should do whatever it can to ensure it secures best value; that includes benchmarking price.  At the end of the day small businesses have to compete.  We compete with the larger businesses on a daily basis and we do that by offering value, price and quality of service so it is not as if the two processes can be mutually exclusive.  Our clear requirement is for a level playing field, removal of artificial pre-qualification criteria, an opportunity to tender for local contracts and an inclusive approach.  I wish to state clearly that we support the Office of Government Procurement in its attempts to secure best possible value for the State but that cannot be at the expense of closures of hundreds of small businesses, which is what we firmly believe is at stake, and the subsequent loss of thousands of jobs.  That is before one considers any potential loss of further revenue to the State in respect of main contractors being outside the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014102100005#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413895800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. John O'Brien and invite Mr. Michael O'Brien to make his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014102100007#N00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413895800,"counter":124,"content":"<p>My presentation will be a little more political.  The O'Brien Press was founded 40 years ago.  We are the biggest independent publisher, but that does not mean we are big; we are quite small.  We have 700 titles in print, we employ 20 people and we create quite a lot of spin-off jobs among writers, artists, designers, editors, distributors and booksellers.  I am also the vice president of Publishing Ireland, which is our publishing organisation.<\/p><p>  I will preface what I have to say by noting that the current Government had a terrible job to do after the country was totally ruined by the previous Administration.  A lot of very difficult decisions had to be made, and some of the things it did were admirable.  One thing that came out of the Government's policy is the main thing they keep talking about, which is creating more jobs - jobs, jobs, jobs.  It is in that context I make my presentation.  The big disaster with regard to the proposal for a national library consortium for tendering is that the Government has now created a scheme to destroy jobs.  This was never contemplated and it is very shameful.  It sounds like a good idea - a national procurement policy for the whole State - but in fact, it was not thought out.  I even began to wonder where the idea came from.  Was it a secret deal with the troika?  Where did the idea come from, an idea that runs counter to the Government policy of creating jobs?<\/p> <p>Here are the negatives.  First, it completely undermines local democracy.  Where are the county councils, which are elected to look after their areas?  County librarians did not ask for this and, having spoken to some of them, I know they were not properly consulted.  The approach being taken is destroying local community bookshops, which are important to communities both culturally and economically.  One example is Hanna's, a fifth generation bookshop in my area.  The scheme has damaged book publishers such as The O'Brien Press, but it will also damage the writers, artists, distributors and printers downstream.  That is the chain effect of this type of action.<\/p><p> The system has been designed perfectly for two very large British conglomerates, Bertram Books and Gardners, which are library suppliers.

Before the British adopted a national procurement policy similar to that which has been proposed here, there were 652 local library suppliers in the United Kingdom.  Now there are two; I inadvertently mentioned their names.  As friend of mine said, first we were colonised by the English, then we were colonised by Rome, then we were colonised by the banks and now we are slaves to a non-existent European Union policy.  The reason say we are slaves to a non-existent European policy is this.  I had the good fortune to meet the Minister of State, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, when he was Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and both he and the President were in London.  We had a little meeting and I explained this issue in some detail.  The first thing he said was that it must be the result of European Union policy.  This is a default position.  I told him he was completely wrong.  In fact, the policy in most European Union member states is exactly the opposite of what is being proposed here.  When it comes to national procurement in the European Union, outsourcing to other countries is a small proportion of the overall total.  For example, the outsourcing of services from Germany to Sweden, amounts to 2% of public procurement.  In Ireland, however, the figure is 28%.  That is a massive drain on the economy, amounting to billions of euro.  The Government's policy is shooting own goals, and it must stop now.<br\/>Elsewhere in Europe, books fall under cultural policy.  A former Minister for Culture and Communications in France described culture in the following terms: <blockquote>Culture is a formidable factor of growth, generating direct economic benefits that are infinitely superior to any investment mobilised.  Culture must be viewed as an important tool for economic development.  Culture is also a powerful factor in economic success.<\/blockquote>In Ireland we do not look at culture in that way at all.  We look at it as something for which we give very small handouts.  We do not appreciate what we have.  Almost all of the 27 EU member states have an integrated cultural policy.  For example, many have fixed prices for books, by law, and local library procurement, sometimes within cities.  This means, for example, that in a city the size of Cork local procurement to the library would be from a supplier based in the city.  Elsewhere in Europe, books, tourism, information technology, arts, libraries, theatre, film and music are all stitched into one integrated cultural policy, creating millions of jobs and generating millions of euro for the economy.  We must learn from other countries.  The first Minister for culture in Europe was appointed in the 1880s in France, a country that is light years ahead of Ireland.  The French know how to do it.  We must abandon the brutal American and British race-to-the-bottom, winner-takes-all economic policies that we are mirroring.  Other countries in Europe play smart and are highly effective in protecting their economies.<br\/>We must make culture an economic force.  The annual budget of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is less than one day's expenditure in the Department of Education and Skills and is probably equivalent to about one hour's expenditure in the Department of Health.  The Arts Council should receive an annual budget of &euro;100 million, because the amount of spin-off jobs created would be way out of proportion to this.  In other words, we would get more jobs for our money.  Culture Ireland, which receives a budget of &euro;3 million, should be given a budget of &euro;20 million.<\/p> <p>Another thing that really affects me as a publisher, because I publish writers, is the Government's decision to name two warships after James Joyce and Samuel Beckett.  These are people who were drummed out of this country and could not live here.  Lots of writers' works were banned.  The hypocrisy of that compared to cultural policy is just mind-blowing.  We should scrap the national procurement policy for libraries before it scraps us.<\/p><p> I feel a sense of shame for my country.  I am a patriot, but I really do feel a sense of shame.  Where are the strategic long-term policies from any Government, including this Government?  We help generate wealth, and politicians spend it.  It is important to remember that.  There are very few businesspeople in the D&aacute;il or the Seanad.  Senator Feargal Quinn is an outstanding example, but they are a small minority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014102100008#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413896400,"counter":129,"content":"<p>Can I remind Mr. O'Brien that we are here to discuss access to public procurement contracts for small suppliers and that we should remain within that remit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014102100009#P00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413896400,"counter":130,"content":"<p>As we celebrate the 100th anniversary of 1916, I would not like to think that the proposed procurement policy will be implemented.

I am from Alan Hanna&rsquo;s bookshop in Rathmines and my children are the fourth generation of a long-established bookselling family in Dublin.  In this time, we have provided many local jobs and contributed substantially to the local economy through wages, rates, taxes, etc.  I live in fear of this small business closing only on account of public procurement.  We have been library suppliers for nearly 40 years and under tender to Dublin city libraries since 2000.<\/p><p>  In 2012, all the Dublin local authorities - D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal, Dublin City and South Dublin - put the library book supply out to tender.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council awarded &euro;595,000 of the total &euro;800,000 to a British company.  In effect, this exported at least six jobs as the Booksellers Association of Great Britain and Ireland reckons &euro;100,000 in book spend is equal to 1.5 jobs.  Greene&rsquo;s bookshop closed on account of this procurement tender going to Britain, with the loss of six jobs.  The Collins bookshop in Cork also closed completely with four jobs lost.  I lost 1.5 jobs.  The girl who remains in my shop lives in south County Dublin and gets &euro;100 a week in subsidised wages.  If I had got a bit of that contract, she would be working a five-day week.  Where is the saving to the Government?  When I speak to politicians about this, they tell me it is not their place and I need to write to the Office of Public Procurement.  When I do, it informs me it is all down to EU legislation, which it is not.  The EU legislation on procurement states cultural and social policies may be taken into account when dealing with contracts.<\/p><p>  Dublin City Council recently tendered its library contract.  I have been supplying Irish-published books to Dublin City Council since I was a teenager.  I lost the contract, however.  No one has the experience I have in this area.  One might think the library sends us an order and we send out a box of books.  This is not how it happens.  I source the books by trawling newspapers, periodicals, television and the Internet for small publications from the poet who walks in from the street to every other publisher.  This tender had 65% for marks on price alone with only 35% on service.  Service is a significant job in supplying books.  We source the books and then the library makes a choice from the list we compile.<\/p> <p>They do not make the choice of books and order them; we do.  We cover the books with laminate and security-tag, stamp and label them as part of the service provided.  Next year I will lose at least one further job and nobody cares.  I have a girl who has been working with me for 35 years.  What do I say to her - that the Government does not care?  We could take the Scottish route, where they take into account local people.  The Scottish Act provides that an authority has a duty to act with a view to securing improvements for the economic, social and environmental wellbeing of the authority's area.  We could adopt the French approach whereby they purchase their books within a 30 km radius.  Why do we have to go to a national consortium when it knocks every one of us out of the supply chain?  I am passionate about this issue as I am going to lose this business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014102100009#P00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Fallon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413896700,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Let me cite in part a memo which was recently created and ratified by the committee of the Booksellers Association of the United Kingdom and Ireland and submitted to the UK Government's review:<blockquote><br \/>[T]here needs to be genuine competitive tendering and the avoidance of monopolies.  We therefore do not support a single central buying authority acting on behalf of all libraries.  A range of options and alternative sources of supply should be available to local authorities in order to create healthy competition for the contracts to supply.<\/blockquote>This will include the creation and maintenance of jobs on a local basis throughout.<br\/>Our industry is built on knowledge.  Like libraries, most bookshops are curators of our culture and locality.  I trade in Portlaoise, in the Chairman's constituency, and we produce local books which would not be produced by large companies such as O'Brien Press.  They are very important.  It is also very important to have a stage from which to present them to local communities.  Bookshops are as important in their local communities as libraries.  We work hand in hand with librarians to ensure the community has access to this material and are creating jobs all of the time.<br\/>I am astounded that our colleagues in the copier and print supply sector had to spend &euro;206,000 to prove that Irish jobs were important and should be maintained.  It is an insult to the citizens of the State that we must take this legal route.  It is very hurtful.  We must bear in mind that in the tendering process I, as a company director, have an obligation to trade responsibly, not recklessly.  If we go to the bottom dollar to win these contracts, it will make our trading capability unsustainable.  Local authorities depend on businesses such as mine to fund them.  We could be cutting off our noses to spite our faces.

There is no such thing as an ombudsman or an appeals process.  If one finds something wrong in the way the tender is set out, that is simply the way it is.  We had no other option.  If one looks at the food industry, there is no Irish food supplier supplying the Defence Forces, the HSE or the Irish Prison Service.  They are all supplied from outside the State.  In the Chair's constituency the cash and carry in Tullamore which was 150 years old had to close as it could not tender for any business and 30 jobs were lost.<\/p> <p>We looked at all these things and said we could not let this happen to our business.  That is why we took this very expensive route.  We did not want to do that.  We brought up the matter of the way with which VAT is dealt with the Office of Government Procurement.  The officials there said it is none of their concern. <br\/>People do not understand that a lot of the VAT is being returned to Her Majesty's exchequer because under the VAT rules, if the turnover is less than &euro;41,000 per annum, the VAT must be returned to the jurisdiction in which the invoice was raised.  They may make a 10% saving on purchasing that item from a UK supplier or somewhere else, but there is a 23% loss to the State as well as the jobs that are lost.  The pork products in our hospitals come from Spain.  Our pig farmers are on their knees and we are buying from Spain.  It makes absolutely no sense.  <br\/>They are aggregating contracts together and the OGP is saying it is helping SMEs by breaking the contracts into lots.  I will give a classic example of how a lot would be broken up.  A stationery supplier supplies stationery, toners and inks and copier paper.  The OGP decided to break this into three separate lots: paper for the entire country; toners and ink for the entire country; and stationery items for the whole country.  One of its stated aims was to reduce the administrative burden on the State, but the burden has been tripled.  Instead of having one supplier there are now three.  As they are for the entire State, each of these lots is now so big that they all breach the &euro;125,000 limit.  This pushes them into the <i>Official Journal of the European Union<\/i>, meaning that tendering must also be open to companies outside the State.  <br\/>The people who are purchasing this stuff are not working from one common budget.  Cork County Council still purchases out of its budget, as does Laois, but they are aggregated together as if they were one.  That is how they are claiming to break it into lots in order for the SMEs to compete.  It is untrue.  It is just pacifying us; a way that they can come in here in a minute and say them have broken it into lots.  The way they do this is ridiculous.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014102100010#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dave O'Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413897000,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I wanted to move to questions and answers but Mr. Bannigan is signalling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014102100011#R00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413897000,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Very quickly, there is a disconnect between procurement and the results of procurement.

Over the same ten-year period, although I cannot make an absolute connect between these, issues from libraries in the UK decreased by 75%.<\/p><p>  Libraries in the UK are in crisis and are closing.  The Irish libraries are vibrant.  Their issues are increasing year by year.  They are getting great service from local suppliers.  I am a full-time library supplier and I employ people just to do library supply.  The libraries, by definition, are services, delivering a service to the community.  Just to purchase books on price alone - and we have tenders here where the criteria demanded 100% on price with nothing for service - is anathema to libraries.  We have seen what happened in the UK, we know what is going to happen here.  We are all going to go out of business and eventually libraries will go out of business too, if we follow the UK course.  We are too small a country, our companies are too small and it is perverse to bring in a Government policy that discriminates against local suppliers.

I was self-employed before I became a Deputy, so I know the experience of self-employment.  Tomorrow's dinner is based on the fact that one actually earns a living today.  It is a hand-to-mouth experience, in general.  I find it really frustrating that the Government has imposed laws which are effectively anti-business and anti-jobs.  There is a spend of approximately &euro;9 billion on goods and services, 22% of which is roughly &euro;2 billion.  That is a massive potential stimulus to the economy and, according to the figures supplied by Ms Fallon, it would be equivalent to about 20,000 jobs.  Given that 40,000 jobs have been added since the Government came into power, 20,000 jobs is a big number.  I met the Minister in early 2012 and made the point to him that economic benefit must be found within procurement, but that economic benefit also meant that people did not lose their jobs and that companies were not pushed out of business so that taxes would not be paid, and so on.  The cheapest contract is, therefore, not necessarily the most economically advantageous to the State.  The response to that was a shrug.<\/p><p>  The issue can be resolved.  In the North we had a Minister for Regional Development, Conor Murphy, who was involved in the breaking up of contracts.  In other words, large road contracts could be broken up into small parcels and accessed by smaller businesses without changing the cost-benefit ratio for the State.  There are a number of other issues within the contracting mechanism here.  If we push for the lowest cost, it often means that some contractors actually buy tenders.  They then squeeze out a subcontractor down the line to cancel out any financial disadvantage for them in the contract itself.  We see that right across the construction industry.<\/p><p>  I have also seen cases in which, after the IDA has given funds to FDI firms to come to this State, these firms have oriented their business to the domestic market on tenders and then outpriced local businesses and pushed people out of jobs.  That happened to a company in Meath.  Sometimes, if one quantifies the experience of an industry, it is easier to communicate that message both to the general public and to the Government.

I appreciate the sincerity and the concern that they have expressed.  A number of groups have contacted me, particularly art suppliers about schools.  I represent Galway West so I do not think I was contacted regarding the particular concerns expressed.  That is not to say that the speakers were not engaged with other people regarding them.  I raised an issue with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, in the D&aacute;il last June.  The question related to the setting up of the office of public procurement and the measures taken to maximise the participation in the procurement process of small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  There were a number of points raised by him and I ask the groups to comment on them.  The Minister spoke of circular 10 of 2014 launched in April setting out the new initiatives regarding procurement and the new guidelines aimed at reducing the burden of cost.  He said the new circular has been broadly welcomed by the industry representatives on the SME working group, which includes ISME, IBEC, the Small Firms Association, Chambers Ireland, and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation .<\/p><p>  When I questioned him regarding the savings and so forth, he stated that less than 5% of the overall public procurement spend is now won by foreign companies. In excess of 95% of public procurement in Ireland is won by Irish companies, 75% of which are SMEs.  That was the figure for 2013 up from 60% in 2012.  The Minister said that whatever we are doing, we are moving in the right direction.  That is at odds with what the groups are saying.  I appreciate they have real examples of real job losses and the effect on their industry.  Taking that as the overall scene and those figures -  presumably those are the actual figures; the Minister has put them on the record in the D&aacute;il - the Minister is saying the situation is good, we are moving in the right direction and that this is fine.  Could the groups comment on those figures?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014102100013#T00300","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413897900,"counter":155,"content":"<p>The figures that were given to the Deputy are at odds with the figures given to us in the High-Level Group on Business Regulation from the Office of Government Procurement.  It said that the figure was 15%.  However, it qualifies that by saying 15% was lost to the island of Ireland.  One of the members at the meeting went berserk.  He wondered when we annexed the North and asked what is the figure for the State.  The figure for the State was 27%.  The Office of Government Procurement is saying 27%.  The Minister is saying something different.  Somebody is wrong.  I do not know who is wrong.<\/p><p>  The next thing I wish to mention is the lovely circular, the replacement for circular 10 of 2010.  However, the Minister forgot to mention the publication of another circular, circular 16 of 2013.  This threatens public sector bodies, if they do not comply with its terms, with an audit from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  No public sector body wants to draw this down on itself;  it makes the decision that it is easier to go with it.  There are two circulars.  One saying all the right things, which the Minister can show to the Deputy.  One saying the opposite, which is applied to us.  We must have consistency.  If two circulars are going to be published, tell everyone about them.  People in public sector bodies are doing their jobs; they do not want to be drawing trouble down on top of themselves.  The most ironic thing about the whole situation is that when the Comptroller and Auditor General went to get a managed print service, a decision was taken not to use the framework produced by the Office of Government Procurement.  That speaks volumes.  The people who are policing it say it is bad.

Currently, there are machines in councils, on which there are four years left to run on leases, and another batch of machines have been purchased centrally and they are trying to negotiate their way out of the first set of leases.

In terms of the set of activities in place in it, it can contribute significantly more than just the tender; it is a wider process.  What we see in the public sector is a lack of the use of the full range of the procurement process.  In many cases of procurement in the public sector, engagement with suppliers through pre-market engagement or through ongoing contract evaluation does not take place.<\/p><p>  In the past three to four years the Irish public sector has formally moved to a more centralised approach for procurement, yet research throughout Europe and elsewhere has shown that centralised state procurement can lead to a stifling of innovation and a reduction of competition and certainly does not allow for local needs and the increased participation of SMEs.<\/p><p>  The general approach of Irish public procurement is to deal with the tactical issues of price and delivery and forgo the investment in strategic activities.  There is some evidence of a cross-over between the jobs strategy and public procurement, but in other areas we are not seeing as much of a cross-over on policy into public procurement as we should.<\/p><p>  In a recent review carried out for Enterprise Ireland I noted that there had been no follow up on policy implementation from 2009, where we had procurement of innovation.  No key performance indicators had been put in place once that policy had been brought forward and there had been no monitoring of the policy over a five year period.  Fve years later, we have no results of a positive or negative impact which we could measure coming from that policy being implemented.  That is consistent with the public procurement policy we see.<\/p><p>  In the programme for public sector reform, published in January 2014, there is less than one paragraph in four pages of text on public procurement that refers to SME participation.  In that paragraph it is stated the Office of Government Procurement will only address policy which, to date, seems to have been Circular 10\/14, with very little evidence that other policies will be addressed.  It looks like the Office of Government Procurement has succeeded in ticking the box for policy implementation on a procurement plan that runs for two years.<\/p><p>  The following are recommendations I have made to Enterprise Ireland and others over a number of years.<\/p> <p>All future policies aimed at suppliers should be mindful of the significant differences within the SME sector.  In a survey carried out by DCU over three years ago for the Office of Government Procurement and the national procurement service it emerged that 50% of companies competing for public sector contracts were micro enterprises.  However, they do not form part of any policy we have seen to date.  The State refers to small and medium-sized enterprises but not to micro enterprises in this regard.  These are enterprises with between one and nine employees.<\/p><p> Clear key performance indicators for SME participation should be set for all public procurers.  To date, no key performance indicators are used in any public sector body for the level of participation of SMEs or indicating what the level of participation of SMEs should be.  Even if they were put in place, there is no contract monitoring to ensure they would be met.<\/p><p> Clarity needs to be provided from a Government perspective on the intended outcome of a policy when a public procurement process is being put in place.  It is not always clear how public procurement supports policy objectives, in respect of which it should be upfront.<\/p><p> The Office of Government Procurement should set out clear rules and roles as to how collaborations might occur.  I understand some progress has been made in this area with the Competition Authority but question marks remain over how small companies can form consortia and bid.  Training on the issues such as consortium-building should also be provided.  Certainly, procurers should be required to set targets related to market intelligence and gathering data at the outset of each procurement depending the size of the market, the level of participation by micro-enterprises and what needs to be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014102100018#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Davis","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413900000,"counter":203,"content":"<p>We will move on to the presentation to be made by IBEC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014102100019#Z00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413900000,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the joint committee for the invitation.  I will offer a brief introduction and then ask my colleague, Mr. Aidan Sweeney, an IBEC specialist in this area, to talk members through some of the detailed content.  <\/p><p>  IBEC has 7,500 members in business throughout all sectors of the economy.  Within it there are 60 trade associations, many of which have a keen interest in the area of public procurement.  The issues relevant to small business and SMEs are addressed extensively throughout the IBEC network.  In particular, the Small Firms Association is part of the IBEC family.  Given our direct membership interests, there is considerable interest in procurement which represents a significant sector of the economy.<\/p><p>  Our priorities for public policy include supporting investment in the economy, of which public procurement is an important dimension.

I emphasise that what we are really talking about is small and micro enterprises, which is often confusing when we examine the procurement directives.  Their definition of an SME corresponds to a large company in an Irish context.  We need to be aware of this.<\/p><p>  I joined IBEC six and a half or seven years ago.  We have since seen a tremendous amount of change in the public procurement system in Ireland, not all of it positive.  The economic downturn has had an impact, especially on the capital expenditure side, and we have seen a rapid reduction in the number of projects undertaken.  This has had an impact on the marketplace, of which we also need to be conscious.<\/p> <p>There was an emphasis on unilateral cuts.  In February 2009, a circular implemented an 8% cut that particularly harmed small indigenous software companies.  There were unilateral cuts and procurement was seen as a soft target.  With the establishment of the national procurement service and now with the establishment of the Office of Government Procurement, we see greater centralisation and aggregation of contracts and the drive for efficiency through that.  This is supposedly moving from the battle over price, which is a major constraint barrier to SMEs bidding in, to value for money.  We would like to see many of the efficiencies on the administrative burden side rather than access for SMEs to win those contracts.  There is a major concern for SMEs in terms of the lack of a level playing field and the removal of local buying knowledge.  This applies to companies that already have public contracts and are concerned they will see the market and the contact point changing, and to companies looking to bid for the first time.  It is important that the Office of Government Procurement category councils under its jurisdiction and the sector leads across health, education, justice and defence establish more of an ongoing practical engagement with SMEs about what they will buy, who they will buy it from and the terms and conditions they seek.  There could be more dedicated meet the buyer events and we would like to see someone on the category councils responsible for the SME community within those areas.  Then, they can look at why SMEs that traditionally sold in are no longer able to win contracts and, if so, address the point.<\/p><p> We would like to see IBEC involved with the Office of Government Procurement through the SME procurement working group.  Circular 10\/14 was published earlier this year on improving SME access to public sector markets.  The key for us is to see it fully implemented across the public sector.  That is a start but there is much more we can do to improve the market through encouraging innovation and take-up from some of the newer companies, as well as looking at procurement as an export market.  References in Ireland are very important for such companies to secure international contracts through the public sector market, which is a regulated market and the rules apply across Europe.  In terms of using the administrative concerns, we would like to see greater use of e-procurement and technology to reduce costs, paperwork and constraints.  We would like to see the Government producing an e-procurement strategy.  The last such strategy was developed in 2001 and we would like to see one that goes beyond what is set out in the EU procurement directives in line with the national payments plan to allow full submissions and payment through the e-procurement process.<\/p><p> We would like to see an improvement in the standardised terms and conditions so that companies are familiar with the documentation, know how it is applied and know the criteria used.  We increasingly see evidence of different terms and conditions being sought where these may not be relevant to the conduct of the contract.  We would like to see more consistency about the indemnity liability provisions because they are a barrier.  Once companies see them, many will walk away from bidding.  Addressing such concerns will bring greater efficiency and this will benefit the taxpayers.  We would also like to see a provision dealing with the framework contracts, particularly in regard to the use of category councils.  We would like to see the comply or explain principle applied to the use of lots and how they are divided.  Someone should have to explain why the contract has not been divided into lots and consider it across regions rather than categories to bring in more localised SMEs into the process.<\/p> <p>That would bring more localised small and medium enterprises, SMEs, into the process also.<\/p><p> We would like buyers and the category councils to produce both annual and multi-annual procurement plans.  This would help to inform the market and SMEs in looking at what strategies they should use to position themselves in order to bid for contracts.  It would also help them to form consortia.  As Dr. Davis indicated, the publication of new guidelines by the Competition Authority that will help SMEs to form consortia will be key in this process, as will training.  We must ensure the development agencies will have adequate supports available to help SMEs, companies and client bases in seeking training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014102100019#Z00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Sweeney","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413900600,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for its invitation.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. Vincent Campbell, who is the policy director of the Office of Government Procurement.  The document circulated in advance of the meeting will give the committee an understanding of the fundamental changes taking place within public procurement.  I do not intend to go through it in detail as I have approximately five minutes in which to make my remarks.  Nevertheless, I will highlight some of the areas that may be of interest to the committee.<\/p><p>  It is important to note from the outset that the new structures for procurement are still at a very early stage.  As chief procurement officer, I welcome this debate and the advice and guidance committees such as this can provide as we start to make significant changes to how procurement is done in the State.<\/p><p>  The procurement reform programme is an element of the Government&rsquo;s overall reform programme and is tasked with delivering increased value for money, more accurate and timely data and an improvement in the capacity and capability of procurement across the public service.  The State spends significant amounts on goods and services, with an estimated spend in 2014 of &euro;8.5 billion, of which &euro;5.8 billion is addressable by procurement.  A new model for procurement was approved by the Government in September 2012, with common goods and services to be procured by a new central sourcing organisation, the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, with central sourcing organisations in the health, education, local government and defence sectors procuring sectoral-specific goods and services.<\/p><p>  In January 2013 I took up the position of the State&rsquo;s first chief procurement officer.  In consultation with key sectors, I developed a high level implementation plan for the new model and it was approved by the Government in April 2013.  In addition to its operational procurement role, the OGP also provides the national policy function, customer support services and systems for all sourcing organisations, including electronic tendering systems, business intelligence and electronic catalogues.  The new structural arrangements for the OGP and the sectoral sourcing organisations are going into place.  Staff are being recruited into the OGP from across the public service, thereby concentrating and leveraging the public sector&rsquo;s procurement expertise.  Similar processes are taking place in the local government, education and health sectors to create the centralised sourcing organisations in these sectors.  Transitional arrangements are being planned across sourcing organisations to realign responsibilities.  The main changes will happen late this year and in early 2015.<\/p><p>  The new model is underpinned by a common governance model that brings together the new sourcing organisations to co-operate and collaborate.  The arrangements include a procurement executive, a steering group to oversee the transition to the new model and an interim board, chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, to provide strategic advice for the OGP and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on procurement matters.  Accountability for sourcing rests with the sourcing organisation that undertakes the tendering.  The OGP does not have the resources or mandate to oversee or audit the actions of the other sourcing organisations.  The office relies on the governance arrangements in place for these public bodies, including the offices of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Local Government Audit Service, to provide such assurance.  Budget responsibility remains with the public service bodies.  The contractual elements put in place by the new sourcing organisation helps these bodies to remain compliant and deliver value for money.  Any saving from procurement remains with these bodies, enabling them to operate within their budgets, deal with increased demand or deliver new projects or services.<\/p><p>  In the policy area public procurement has strong rules and regulations determined by the EU treaty and directives, as well as by national laws.  The key principles enshrined in the treaty are openness, transparency, equitable treatment and non-discrimination.<\/p> <p>This means that tendering must be conducted in a way that provides equal treatment to bidders regardless of whether they are big or small, are based in Berlin or Bantry or are a new or well-established business. <br\/>The OGP is fully aware of the significant role that SMEs play in the Irish economy and is strongly committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged with public sector procurement and the opportunities presenting.  In that context, the OGP has established the high-level group on SME access in conjunction with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland.  The group is focused on monitoring the delivery of the procurement commitments under the Action Plan for Jobs and on developing further strategies to improve SME access to procurement.  In addition, the OGP policy director chairs the SME working group,  which brings together the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Enterprise Ireland, the Competition Authority and InterTradeIreland with industry representative bodies including IBEC, the Small Firms Association, CIF, Chambers Ireland and ISME.  <br\/>On 17 April 2014, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform issued new guidance to public procurers regarding SME access in the form of circular 10\/14.  The guidance sets out that procurers should conduct market analysis in order to ensure they understand the markets they are addressing.  This analysis will advise their strategies and actions to ensure they maintain competition in the market.  <br\/>The guidance also encourages procurers to break larger tenders into &quot;lots&quot;, which can enable smaller businesses to compete for tenders.  It reduces the recommended thresholds for turnover to two-times contract value and sets out pragmatic insurance requirements.  It also recommends that tenders are evaluated using the most economically advantageous tender, MEAT, methodology,  which balances quality with price.  The circular encourages consortia to come together and bid collaboratively.  Finally, the circular requires procurers to electronically publish tenders for spends in excess of &euro;25,000 on the national electronic tendering platform - <i>e-tenders<\/i>- and to record the outcome of the tender.  <br\/>The OGP is leading on procurement policy development in a number of other relevant areas including the social clauses project group, the transposition process for the three new procurement directives and a number of developments relating to construction procurement policy, including the review of the public works contracts.<br\/>The OGP supports the work of Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland in building awareness of public procurement and delivering training for small suppliers in bidding for public contracts.  In particular, the OGP supports the &quot;Meet the Buyer&quot; events, which help suppliers meet public sector buyers to better understand how public procurement works and the relevance of their goods or services to the public service.  InterTradeIreland data shows that attendees submit more tenders afterwards.  The events this year are being held in Belfast tomorrow on 22 October and in Citywest on 12 November.  I strongly encourage any members who are available to come along to the events and see the engagement with the SME community.  <br\/>This year, the OGP has attended a number of business events such as Taking Care of Business and the National Ploughing Championships.  At these events, the OGP focused on helping businesses understand how easy it is to register on the national tendering platform - <i>e-tenders<\/i>- and to receive alerts regarding business opportunities.  The OGP also supports the State-subsidised Go 2 Tender programme for small businesses run by InterTradeIreland and a new programme on consortia building.  The Competition Authority is currently developing guidance material for SMEs who are considering establishing consortia to bid for State contracts.  <br\/>A wide range of data continues to be quoted regarding procurement spend.  I would like to advise the committee on what the OGP is doing in respect of bringing about better data on procurement.  Thousands of State bodies are spending money, the larger of which have IT systems for processing spend and the smaller of which are probably using spreadsheets or even paper to record spend information.  The State had no mechanism in the past for collecting data on the amount of moneys spent across the public service on goods and services.  It has not been possible to determine in detail how much was spent, with whom, on what and at what price.  <br\/>In autumn 2013, the OGP initiated a project to begin collecting the spend information of the larger sectors, which account for over 80% of the State's spend on goods and services.  To date, the OGP has collected approximately 53% of the State's spend in one database.  <\/p> <p>The project is moving onto a second phase, which will include central government.  For the first time, this will allow the OGP in the coming months to publish far more accurate estimates of spend.<\/p><p> In summary, good public procurement is key to delivering sustainable value for money.  The new centralised structures for procurement are at an early stage but offer a significant opportunity to deliver value for money, consistent implementation of policy, reduced risk for the State, and improved data provision.<\/p><p> A key policy focus is to sustain competition in markets and work with other State bodies to fully support and encourage smaller businesses in competing for Government business.  The information I have provided demonstrates that the OGP has been proactively working with all stakeholders in identifying issues of concern for SMEs and effectively dealing with those issues to the betterment of the procurement landscape in Ireland.  These reforms are fundamental in their nature and will take time to implement and bed in.  As chief procurement officer, I am clear that we must listen to, and be open to, our stakeholders in industry in delivering for the Government a complex and challenging agenda.  I look forward to the questions and comments of the committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014102100021#BB00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413901200,"counter":211,"content":"<p>One of the items of information that has struck me is that the Government has not yet fully collected information on State spending.  For any enterprise looking in, to imagine that we have not been collecting this information to date is quite shocking.  One cannot manage if one cannot measure.  From working with small businesses, it is clear the procurement system in this country is a disaster from the perspective of small businesses.  I am glad to see moves are afoot to change that.  One of the great debates in this committee is how much money leaks from the State in State procurement.  If we have roughly &euro;8.5 billion, we have heard estimates of 28%, 27% and 20%.  Some people save 15% on an island basis, others say 5%.  It is a key piece of information because it determines policy by the State.<\/p><p>  Can we have an example of the average size of tenders over the past three years?  This will show us the trend.  There is an argument over the bundling and unbundling of tenders to make them accessible to small businesses.  My understanding where there is a debate about Bantry versus Berlin, we tend more towards the Berlin side more than other countries tend towards external businesses.  That is not a good thing.  We must fulfil our responsibilities within the law but we must also promote Irish businesses.  The issue of consortia is a difficult issue for small businesses.  We heard presentations that indicated no clear line of development with regards to consortia and their ability to access larger contracts.  Many felt they would be criminally liable if they entered the space where they could be identified as a cartel.  That line was not clear.<\/p><p>  We also heard that prequalification criteria were often set before the size of the contract was identified.  Contracts that were supposed to be &euro;100 million had prequalification set and the initial tender went out for &euro;16 million, with inflated prequalification criteria.  In my work, I came across cases of contractors who bought tenders due to the cost issue.  They pitch for a tender below the cost of reasonable delivery and then squeeze either subcontractors or workers along the supply chain.  We see that workers at the Kishoge site are on strike because they receive a wage less than &euro;5 an hour.  The issue of economic costs has been identified as part of the new policy change.  Will the economic costs include taxes forgone by the State due to the closure of business or people being made unemployed?<\/p> <p>That will also include welfare costs due to the jobs lost to the State.

The Deputy asked about data and data availability.  As a State we are well behind other jurisdictions, which have typically been working for eight to ten years collecting data, so we are trying to catch up in the process of capturing data and being in a position to answer to the Oireachtas and, from a procurement perspective, to the public as to how the money in the State is spent.  That leads to the Deputy's question about how much money is spent outside the State.  This relates to my earlier comment about the number of systems we have.  There are thousands of public sector bodies that spend money on behalf of the State and, traditionally, we have not had a system in place to gather that information.  We now have that system in place and we have been focusing on getting the larger public sector bodies to provide us with data.  The good news is we are starting to get that data and it is providing the granularity and visibility required to determine where taxpayers' money is spent.  As we get to the later part of the year, it is our intention to publish information from that database so we can be open and transparent about where the public has its money spent.<\/p><p>  On the 28% rate mentioned, we can have multiple answers depending on which data set is considered, and that is not acceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014102100024#EE00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1413901500,"counter":214,"content":"<p>It would have to be the most complete data set.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014102100024#EE00300","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413901500,"counter":215,"content":"<p>The last set of data we provided publicly related to 2011 data.  It is important to understand the context of that data in that the Government advertises its opportunities on the e-tenders website.  Where the opportunity breaches certain thresholds, the spend also must be advertised on the EU journal.  For example, in the works context the figure is a little over &euro;5 million, with goods and services by Departments it is &euro;134,000, for other public bodies the figure is &euro;270,000 and with utilities it is &euro;400,000.  Once these thresholds are exceeded, there is a requirement on public sector bodies to publish not only locally but also in the EU.  The data is gathered with respect to the outcome of those processes.  Typically, it takes some time to gather the data because some of the contracts may be large, the opportunities may be significant and the processes could take quite some time to work through.  That is why we may hear of data that seems to be years old.  Sometimes the processes take some time.<\/p><p>  With regard to the 2011 data, for the spend in excess of the threshold, &euro;240 million of procurement was awarded to businesses not within the State.

The Deputy asked about consortia building.  We want to make sure that, in conjunction with the Competition Authority, we get good clear guidance out into the marketplace for consortia.  It is not unsolvable.  We visited the Welsh procurement authority recently.  It has published guidance relating to joint bidding guides.  That is only a front page of a much larger document.  These are mechanisms for bodies to keep themselves safe.  That is the core issue reflected by the Deputy around bodies being able to work together and keep themselves safe with regard to competition law.  We are working with the Competition Authority to make sure that guidance gets issued as soon as possible and to enable consortia to work together.  InterTradeIreland offers training to bodies who want to come together and form consortia.<\/p><p>  I will try and move on.  We issued new guidance in April 2014, in particular guidance in respect of pre-qualification criteria.  <\/p> <p>Over the last couple of years we received a great deal of feedback that some of the pre-qualification thresholds were far too high.  Having examined some of the examples, we believe that the thresholds in some cases have been set too high, so the guidance has been reduced to two times the turnover of the proposed contract.  That is in the guidance that was issued.  It also accelerates one of the measures under the new procurement directives.  It brings the guidance down from three times to two times the turnover requirement.<\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned Kishoge Community College.  I can give him some further detail on that matter.  It is important to draw attention to the fact that the public procurement process for works provides a number of protections for the State and the labour force in the delivery of projects within the existing structure.  Obviously, from a policy perspective the Government wishes to ensure that these projects are delivered with a high degree of cost certainty, on time and with value for money.  Delays and issues on sites do not help anybody in that context.  The public works contracts already require that main contractors and any sub-contractors providing services adhere to labour law, and provide for penalties from a contractual perspective, including withholding payments and contract termination in the case of infringement.  The tools are in place.<\/p><p> There are three layers of protection in the process.  The first one is at tender stage.  The bidders must sign a declaration that they have fulfilled their obligations with regard to payment of social welfare contributions and taxation.  At the award stage the contractor must submit a valid tax clearance certificate as a precondition.  In particular, at implementation stage the obligations under the contract come into force.  There are a number of these.  I will not list them all but contractors and sub-contractors are required to adhere to all legal obligations.  They extend to matters such as health and safety and labour law.  Contractors must submit ongoing certification under clause 5.3 of the contract to make sure that they are paid.  As each payment application is made, they must certify that they are complying in full with the requirements under the contract, and that includes the requirements for sub-contractors.  The contractors must maintain records and time sheets of all those employed in the works.  The State has the right to audit payments that are made.  It has the right to withhold if certification is not provided and deduct if certification is proven to be incorrect, and the State has the right to terminate the contract or agreement where the contractor fails to remedy the situation.<\/p><p> It is important to note that public bodies rarely have the resources for the level of audit necessary to conduct some of these actions and in some cases they do not have the powers that are required to police what are quite complex and difficult areas.  Therefore, it is important that they report any submissions to the appropriate statutory bodies, which have the necessary powers and expertise, and particularly the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, with regard to disputed matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014102100025#FF00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413902100,"counter":227,"content":"<p>To make a brief point-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014102100026#GG00200","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1413902100,"counter":228,"content":"<p>There are two other Deputies who wish to put many questions.

I wish to put a number of questions to Dr. Davis.  Reference was made to the Scottish model, the Welsh model, etc.  In the studies it compiled, did IBEC compare Ireland with its EU partners in terms of establishing what is the best procurement model?  Is there a need to establish a separate working group - similar to that which obtains in respect of SMEs under the guidelines set down in the context of Circular 10\/14 - to deal with microbusinesses?  What figure does IBEC use in the context of identifying what constitutes an SME?  IBEC is represented on the SME working group.  Has it made suggestions to the Department with regard to the establishment of a similar group to deal with microbusinesses?  Dr. Davis stated that Circular 10\/14 has not been fully implemented but other speakers indicated that it has been totally ignored.  Will Dr. Davis comment on that fact?<br\/>I recall the old saying about lies, damned lies and statistics and Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n referred to the number of Irish companies that are winning procurement contracts here.  As stated earlier, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, stated last June that in excess of 95% of public procurement contracts in Ireland are won by Irish companies.  This tallies with the 5% figure to which Mr. Quinn referred earlier.  The Minister indicated to me in a reply to a parliamentary question that:<blockquote>Less than 5% of the overall public procurement spend is now won by foreign companies.  In excess of 95% of public procurement in Ireland is won by Irish companies, 75% of which are SMEs.  That was the figure for last year, up from 60% in 2012.<\/blockquote>Does the Office of Government Procurement stand over those figures, particularly as they have been disputed?  Perhaps this relates to the methodology used to assess said figures.  The Minister also indicated that the European procurement contracts market is worth approximately &euro;2.4 trillion.  How have the changes which have been introduced benefited Irish companies?  Was the aim of the amalgamations, mergers, etc. to try to secure some of those European contracts?  Is there any evidence that moves in this regard are working or is this something to which we aspire?<br\/>It has been stated that while the State might save 5% or 6% on a particular tender, jobs are actually being lost.  Obviously, this means that people end up out of work because, in some instances, businesses are forced to close.  This leads to a loss of tax revenues - including that relating to VAT - for the State and rates revenues for local authorities.  Is there any methodology which can be used to take those issues into account in the context of the tendering process?  Will Mr. Quinn indicate whether Circular 10\/14 is being implemented or is it, as has been suggested, being completely ignored?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014102100027#HH00200","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413902400,"counter":236,"content":"<p>As part of a recent review I carried out for Enterprise Ireland, I examined the models in Ireland, Wales, Scotland, England and Northern Ireland.  One model - the local multiplier methodology - provides answers in terms of a number of the questions the Deputy posed.  The local multiplier methodology looks at developing local economic benefits, so it is used as a measure in the context of awarding contracts.  In other words, one examines the local economic benefits for investment by public authorities.  It can, therefore, be built in as part of the most economically advantageous tender, MEAT, criterion.  That takes into account how organisations re-spend their money back into local economies.  The UK's Centre for Local Economic Strategies has discovered that small firms will re-spend 49p in every &pound;1 they receive back into local economies, whereas large firms only re-spend 31p.  There are models in action at this point and these are being adopted and rolled out across the UK.  The attitude relating to them is \"There is a better way of doing this\" and \"If we look at small companies, then we can actually place an economic value on what will be the spend locally\".<\/p> <p> On the question of a separate working group for micro-enterprises, it is worth revisiting the first question on the figures and statistics that are available.  For the last three years, we have been working with the National Procurement Service and the Office of Government Procurement on a survey through e-tenders aimed at collecting information on how the market is made up and what are the reactions of buyers.  Between 2011 and 2014, an average of 50% to 51% of companies bidding for tenders were micro-enterprises employing between one and nine people.  Current policies are addressed at small to medium sized enterprises which employ between ten and 250 staff.  As to whether we have policies that represent 50% of the bidding companies, it certainly should be considered.  In terms of why and where they are competing, 30% of companies bid for local business within 120 km of their home bases.  Only 20% of all businesses which replied to e-tenders sought business outside the Irish economy.  When we hear policies stating that we are using public procurement to drive exports, we should bear in mind that only 20% of the companies competing for public procurement business are interested in exports.  The other 80% are interested in competing nationally.  When we develop centralised national policies, we run the risk of alienating those small businesses and not having them participate.  We should be considering them as part of our policy and a more proactive approach should be taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014102100027#HH00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Davis","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413902700,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I will start with the question on micro-enterprises.  Rightly or wrongly, we have bundled all of our conversations regarding SMEs to include micro-enterprises.  We have never specifically excluded them in any way.  We believe the policies that have been set are inclusive of micro-enterprises because we know they do a huge amount of business in the Irish economy, particularly where larger contracts are broken down into sub-contracts.<\/p><p>  In regard to the figures of 95% and 75% cited by Deputy Kyne, we stand over these figures because we provided them to the Minister.  They are our best estimate at this moment in time of the composition of expenditure in the Irish economy.  They are, however, based on our estimates and our samples.  As I noted earlier, we will have substantially more detailed and accurate information towards the end of this year, which we will be able to provide to the Oireachtas, to stakeholders and to the public.  I am comfortable that the numbers are of the correct order of magnitude.  I do not think we will see a swing of 25% in any of the numbers.  I spent the last 20 months examining in detail how the public service spends money.  When one investigates what we buy and where we buy it, one realises that a huge proportion can only be bought locally.  For example, nobody will come from Berlin to clean a Garda station in Bantry.  Similarly, the energy that is used to light or heat that Garda station can only come from local sources.  A significant amount of the money we spend can only stay within the economy.  Goods can flow across seas in certain areas, such as the high technology and medical space.<\/p> <p>In the case of defence and vehicles, we do not produce any vehicles and we do not, by and large, produce armaments in this country.  There are some things which, by their nature, must come across but having examined and analysed what information we have over the last number of years, I am still very confident of those numbers.  I look forward to the day when I can return to the committee and be able to give solid numbers to the best of our ability based on actual spend.<\/p><p> There were also questions about exports.  We continue to work with Enterprise Ireland, and it is involved in most of our working groups, to help businesses get the process of public procurement right.  The analogy I generally use is that it is a little like answering an examination question.  Once one figures out how to approach and answer the examination question, one will get it right most of the time.  Public procurement, because it involves largely the same processes across all of the states in the EU, follows a quite prescriptive mechanism in how it operates.  We have worked with suppliers who have been successful not only in winning business in Ireland but also in figuring out that they can win business outside their natural geographic catchment and outside the State as well.  I will not mention the names of those businesses.<\/p><p> The final question was about the holistic impact of public procurement.  Public processes are very legally bound in what can and cannot be considered within the context of the directives and legislation in place.  Every time we run a procurement there is one winner and usually several losers, who are disappointed that they have lost business.  Some of them are incumbent businesses and might be losing business they have held for some time.  However, that is what is required of us from a legislative perspective.  The law requires us to offer the opportunities to the market in an open, fair and transparent way.  That is a legal obligation and it is the way we satisfy the taxpayer that we are spending money wisely when it is offered to the marketplace.<\/p><p> Job losses is a very difficult topic and it is very emotional for most organisations, which is understandable.  However, a reduction in labour that serves Government clients is not always a bad thing, particularly if it is enabled by new technology, innovative processes or simply more productive models in delivering for the State.  Procurement can capture those improvements and in doing that can deliver value to the State, reduce costs and deliver better services.  Should we not reward good suppliers who are innovative and find new and better ways to do things with Government contracts?  It will build innovative businesses, a stronger economy and ultimately will help those businesses grow outside the State.<\/p><p> Yes, there are downsides to running procurement, but there are upsides as well.  It is also important to bear in mind that, by and large, the Government is spending roughly equivalent amounts of money in the economy every year.  That supports a certain number of jobs.  We generally do not see large scale reductions in jobs that serve the Government.  Instead we see displacement, when jobs move from some suppliers to other suppliers.  That should be taken into account as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014102100028#JJ00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413903000,"counter":240,"content":"<p>Regarding IBEC's approach to the size of companies and SMEs, we typically adopt the approach that an SME is one that has approximately 50 employees or fewer.  That is for our thinking on strategy, although we are conscious of the 250 employees and below and the &euro;40 million turnover according to the European criteria.  With regard to micro businesses and to pick up a point raised earlier, there is a lack of statistical analysis.<\/p> <p>We will be pushing in the Action Plan for Jobs next year for a detailed economic assessment of the public sector market in Ireland, taking into account all the different actors, the dynamics of micro enterprises versus SMEs versus multinationals but also supply-based businesses and those that may be manufacturing.  There is an urgent need to get that analysis out there to determine the policies that need to be addressed.<\/p><p> In regard to Circular 10\/14 being largely ignored, it was published in April this year.  Based on the experience of circular 10\/10, from our anecdotal evidence, many of the clauses ignored are not applied in a consistent manner.  From our involvement with Circular 10\/14 this time we have not seen any data on its performance and we would call for the OGP to monitor its implementation across all public sector bodies.  It is a start.  An issue to which I wish to draw attention because of the reference we made to the use of prequalification criteria, is a clause on the use of open tendering below threshold, below &euro;134,000.  One of the areas where it is necessary to get more SMEs involved and flexible in the approach and would reduce the cost of bidding would be to encourage the use of open tendering above threshold.  Ireland, the UK and Denmark are, by and large, the largest users of the restricted procurement approach.  That is one of four broad approaches we conduct.  I would like to see more use of open tendering.  <\/p><p> As Circular 10\/14 is a guidance to all public sector bodies we would like to see the Office of Government Procurement and Government publish an SME procurement statement aimed at companies about what they can expect when bidding.  This could be followed up.  For instance, it is adopted in places across the US and other public sector bodies where there is a visible section on the websites of public bodies on how to do business with us, who would be purchasing, how one could approach it and what criteria one could expect.  This could be a way of getting more visibility and communication out there on it.  The major issue with Circular 10\/14 is communication, getting out there and monitoring it.  It is clear that the use of standardised terms and conditions in the document produced for general goods and services in 2011 have been applied on a consistent basis and have been applied for contracts but the contracts themselves were never so designed.  We see them increasingly in the IT space.  They were for general goods and services and not for anything more specific. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014102100029#KK00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Sweeney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413903300,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I thank the delegation for appearing before the committee.  My first question is to Dr. Davis.  With regard to our nearest neighbours, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, how do the policies there relate to our policies?  Does he see differences and how does he see us going in the future in terms of community benefits?  My next question is for Mr. Quinn.  In Circular 10\/14, that reminds me of the Battle of Clontarf when we kicked out someone to get in something else - he mentioned a geographic basis.  Perhaps he can provide more details on it?  How does he expect it to work and what percentage of the contracts will be based on a geographical basis?  He mentioned Scotland as having 20% under a collaborative centralised model.

In Circular 10\/14 we have given guidance to public procurers that they need to perform a market analysis.  Market analysis is critically important in that markets are structured differently depending on what the goods and services are.  For example, the market for desktop software is an international market dominated by two or three suppliers.  There is no desktop software supplier who is big in Kerry, for example, it is Microsoft and that is the answer.  Something like cleaning services, however, would be very much locally delivered.  There would need to be a strategy that reflects local delivery in the context of cleaning services because that is what matters.  A supplier of cleaning services would not come from Donegal to Dingle to clean the local Garda station; it would not happen in that way.  The lotting strategy would be determined as the market is analysed for each individual good or service.  If I am buying software I might lot it in a fundamentally different way from locally delivered goods or services.  If I need my PC fixed and I am sitting in Dingle, there is no point in ringing somebody in Dublin to come all the way down in a vehicle.  I could have a strategy to deliver that locally.  That is the geographic basis that the Deputy asked about.<\/p><p>  The second question concerned Wales.  They are centralising approximately 20% of their spend in their new national procurement services.  We are going to go beyond that to 50% in our model.  When we have looked at our goods and services and how they are split out, we have a higher percentage.  The UK model is fundamentally different from the Irish model in that local government in the UK does a huge amount of delivery of goods and services across the island, for example many health and education services.  That is not the case in Ireland so our model is a little bit different.  <\/p><p>  We have held meet-the-buyer events outside of Dublin.  We had one in Kilkenny previously and we also put our wellies on at the ploughing championships recently.<\/p> <p>I have spoken at quite a number of events outside Dublin, including one held by the Cork Chamber of Commerce.  We have somebody attending an event in the west in November.  If there is a sense that the approach is Dublin-centric, that is not the case.  <\/p><p> The meet-the-buyer events at a national level are organised by InterTradeIreland, which is jointly funded North and South.  It is a cross-Border body and we hold public procurement events North and South.  People from here travel to Belfast - some are in their cars on the way to the event that is being held tomorrow - and buyers from the North come to Dublin for events.  I have good anecdotal information that the committee will be glad to hear.  When I visited other jurisdictions, including the north of Wales and Scotland, I found that everybody complains about people coming across borders to deliver goods and services.  The complaint is not unique to Ireland.  There is a very strong perception that services are being provided by other jurisdictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014102100031#MM00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413903900,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Does the Northern Ireland procurement office hold meet-the-buyer events here?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014102100032#NN00200","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413903900,"counter":247,"content":"<p>It attends the meet-the-buyer event in Dublin.

There are two public procurement regulations in the UK which are applicable in Wales and Northern Ireland.  Scotland is seen as a separate entity.  A key item of interest within that is the Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012, which introduced a statutory requirement for public bodies to have regard to economic, social and environmental well-being in connection with public service contracts.  It legislated for a particular social clause.  We can have a debate as to whether that is good or bad, but it is a particular approach that we have not taken.  It may be an issue for us.<\/p><p>  Value Wales has developed a community benefits measurement tool.  A report stated that this sophisticated approach is seen as a leader within the UK in assessing outcomes and has been used to track six projects.  It showed that these contracts, valued at &pound;146 million, resulted in &pound;56 million in salaries for Welsh citizens and &pound;68 million spent with Wales-based suppliers.  In addition, the six projects created 44 apprenticeships and supported work for 140 disadvantaged people, as well as creating or protecting 2,200 jobs.  John McClelland, who has carried out reviews in Scotland and Wales, commented in 2012 in the review of public procurement in Wales that over the past two years the community benefits approach had been applied to contracts worth a total of &pound;3.4 billion.<\/p> <p>There are a further 50 projects in the pipeline and it is estimated that these will deliver benefits similar to those associated with the first six.  In terms of scope, what he meant was the creation and protection of an additional 16,000 jobs in Wales.  There are approaches which are being directly targeted in other jurisdictions in the context of job creation.  The &euro;6 billion spent in Ireland could be the equivalent of 24,000 jobs, approximately one quarter of the number identified in An Action Plan for Jobs.  It can, therefore, have a specific impact if targeted in a specific fashion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014102100032#NN00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Davis","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413904200,"counter":255,"content":"<p>Will Dr. Davis provide the title of the document to which he is referring?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014102100033#OO00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413904200,"counter":256,"content":"<p>The review to which I refer is Maximising the Impact of Welsh Procurement Policy by Mr. John McClelland and it is available on the Welsh Government's website.

Wales is divided on a north-south basis and the authorities there are very clear that there is an imbalance.  As a result, they have taken a very proactive approach to managing regionalisation.  Where they wish to have SMEs in the north participate, they will proactively try bias to do this as a disadvantaged area.  Again, lessons in that regard can be learned here.<\/p><p>  Scotland sets particular targets.  For example, local authorities will set targets of a 75% participation rate within a local region and these targets are then measured against whether contracts been awarded to companies within the region.  Again, we have not put targets in place and there has been a debate on whether we are already achieving them.  If one does not set a target, one does not know whether one is achieving what one wants to achieve.  Part of the issue here is that we wait for the statistics to emerge before we establish targets, rather than setting targets and then trying to find the statistics to prove that we are achieving them.  That might be a better way to proceed.<\/p><p>  On regionalisation, it was mentioned that we were breaking into lots.  Throughout the European Union organisations have been proactively encouraged to break into lots.  The example given here related to cleaning and it was stated this service could only be delivered locally.  That is a great idea, unless it is a national contract, in which case one buys through a facilities management company nationally.  That company will then outsource or subcontract the work through a local operator.  At what point does the procurement process take responsibility for delivery locally as opposed to just taking responsibility for a contract at national level?  The debate in this regard is interesting.  In the past three to four years Ministers have stated we are actually contributing to local economies by awarding national contracts because we ensure the work is subcontracted throughout to local operators or suppliers.  There is absolutely no onus on a commercial entity to subcontract, unless we legislate for it, in which case we are interfering in the competitive marketplace.  If we award a national contract whereby cleaning services could be delivered to all schools nationally through one or two facilities management companies, why are they obliged to use local suppliers?  In commercial terms, they are not so obliged.  This is something that is missing and it is a clear difference between Ireland and its close neighbours in that matters are being more proactively managed at local level than is the case here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014102100033#OO00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Davis"},{"type":"speech","time":1413904200,"counter":259,"content":"<p>Is Deputy Anthony Lawlor satisfied with the answers so far?

The health innovation hub established under An Action Plan for Jobs for this year has enabled them to adopt a more pragmatic approach to rolling out innovative solutions developed here.

I recall speaking a couple of years ago to someone involved in IT in the Department of Finance about a two-company operation which had a central government contract.

We have put forward to the Minister our economic regulatory framework and he has accepted it.  It is based on the retail prices index minus X, RPI-X, model, a typical model used for the regulation of utilities throughout the world and one that represents good international practice.  We find ourselves in a situation similar to that in 2000, when we assumed responsibility for the regulation of the electricity industry.  At that stage there had been decades of under-investment, as well as a high cost base and quality and security issues associated with the electricity industry.  Added to this scenario in respect of water and wastewater services in Ireland we have the establishment of a new utility.  Our starting point is that Irish Water, wastewater services and the system are not fit for purpose.<\/p><p>  We have three core areas on which we focus as an economic regulator.  First, we aim to drive efficiencies in Irish Water and its cost base to ensure value is delivered to all those who receive water and wastewater services.  Second, we aim to allow an economic regulatory framework to be in placd to ensure Irish Water has access to capital markets and borrowing in order that it can carry out the vital and necessary investment in water and wastewater services.  Third, we aim to ensure the appropriate customer services standards for those who are receiving water and wastewater services from Irish Water.<\/p><p>  In July we consulted on a proposed water charges plan which covered a range of matters.  I do not intend to go into all of them, but suffice it to say it covered domestic charges and the interim revenue review, that is, the amount of money we were willing to allow Irish Water to earn through charges and other means.  In response to this consultation we received 345 comments, all of which we reviewed and assessed as part of our decision-making process.  They covered a range of issues, including impaired water services such as boiled water notices, the size of allowances and discounts.  Having considered all of the comments made, we issued a direction to Irish Water on 17 September on its final water charges plan.  This was informed by the policy direction from the Minister, our review of Irish Water's costs and the review of all the responses to the domestic tariff and non-domestic tariff proposals.  It also took on board the Government's decision on 6 May on water charges.<\/p><p>  I will not go through in detail the slides on the Minister's policy direction because we have spoken about it before to the committee, but I will be happy to take questions.  The policy direction covered the stipulation that there be no standing charges for primary households, that provision be made for customers with medical conditions, that there be a free household allowance and that effectively there be free usage for children.  Furthermore, we had to make provision for circumstances where water services were impaired, allow for rebates in the event that a customer's bill was lower once he or she moved to a metered charge and for assessed charges to be a proxy for metered charges insofar as it was possible to do so.<\/p><p>  The next slide summarises the decision on Irish Water's overall revenue.  The bottom line is probably of most significance.  Effectively, Irish Water asked us for &euro;2.26 billion in revenue for the period 1 October 2014 to end December 2016.  As part of our analysis, we decided to allow the company &euro;2.08 billion, a reduction of 8%.<\/p> <p>We made this reduction in the interests of consumers.  We set what we considered to be challenging but realistic targets for Irish Water in terms of the amount of operational expenditure it would incur during the period.<\/p><p> We also reduced the level of capital expenditure in terms of customer charges.  This was to recognise, first, that we expected Irish Water to deliver efficiencies in its capital programme and also that it had put forward a very large capital programme.  We were concerned about the volume of work it had identified and its ability to have the work done in the two and a quarter year period.  We made it very clear to it that if it could deliver a larger capital programme and do so efficiently, it could proceed to do so and that we would take these costs into account in the next price control stage.  <\/p><p> The next slide sets out the charges we included in our decision on the water charges plan.  Effectively, the charge, after any free allowance is used up by a household, is &euro;4.88 per 1,000 litres in water and wastewater services.  If somebody avails of only one service, he or she will only pay 50% of the charge - &euro;2.44 per 1,000 litres.<\/p><p> There is no standing charge for a primary residence.  For most people, the first bill they will receive will be based on an assessed charge.  The next table shows the assessed charges which are based on estimated consumption in different sized households and take on board the numbers of adults and children living in them.  For example, where the number of adult occupants is two and they receive water and wastewater services, the assessed charge is &euro;278 for a full year.  Where the number of adult occupants is only one and he or she receives water and wastewater services, the charge is &euro;176.  It is worth pointing out that if there were three children in either household, the assessed charge would remain at &euro;176 or &euro;278, respectively, because water used by children is free.<\/p><p> In the assessed charge it is assumed that a one person household consumes 66,000 litres of water per annum and that for every additional adult in the household the additional consumption is 21,000 litres.  The estimate is based on data from Irish Water based on information from metres installed in households; it is, therefore, based on the most up-to-date data available in Ireland.  It means that for every additional adult in a household the rise in the assessed charge is approximately &euro;102, which is reflected in the table.<\/p><p> The key changes in our decision are as follows.  Instead of a 50% discount where water is not fit for human consumption, there will be a 100% discount.  The change made demonstrates that we took on board the comments received during the consultation process.  In addition, there will be a cap on bills once people have a water meter installed.  The original proposal was that a bill would not rise above the assessed charge and that the cap would apply for six months.  We have increased the period to nine months.  <\/p><p> The original minimum charge for non-primary or vacant homes was &euro;180, but we have now reduced that figure to &euro;125 or &euro;62.50 per service.  We have also improved the rebate system for customers.  We have included a 60-day look-back rule in respect of the default charge or non-validation.  That means that if somebody does not validate or register with Irish Water before the end of November, he or she will not lose out on free water allowances if he or she does so by the end of November.<\/p><p> We have confirmed that the cap on a bill will remain in place if there is a leak which qualifies under the first fix procedure.<\/p> <p>We also confirmed that a bill cap will be put in place for customers with medical conditions that necessitate high water usage, and this is a self-declaration system.  Finally, we confirmed that there will be quarterly billing and a range of flexible payment options for people making payments to Irish Water.<\/p><p> On the non-domestic tariff, we decided to retain the existing charging scheme used by local authorities up to 31 December 2013 and we confirmed that group water schemes would be treated as non-domestic customers for the interim control period.  We established that the domestic tariff and allowances would apply to mixed-use customers from 1 October, bringing such customers in line with every domestic premises in the country and ensuring equitable treatment for all.  Still on the non-domestic sector, we introduced a drinking water discount of up to 40% in the event of a boil-water notice or a drinking water restriction notice being in place.  We will retain current local authority arrangements for connection charges until we have decided an enduring arrangement.<\/p><p> Uisce &Eacute;ireann's customer handbook sets out minimum customer service standards that must be applied, and we approved it on 1 October 2014.  It includes a &euro;10 charter payment that Uisce &Eacute;ireann must pay to customers when it fails to meet standards specified in the handbook.  We have since reviewed and approved Uisce &Eacute;ireann's code of practice, customer charter and terms and conditions for supply of water and waste water services.  We have also reviewed and approved the code of practice for business customers, which covers areas such as the handling of complaints, metering, billing, customer communications and network operations.<\/p><p> I will now set out the next steps that we will take in terms of work we will undertake in the near future and next year, though the list is not exhaustive.  Before the end of 2014 we will have consulted on a first-fix policy with a view to its kicking off in January 2015.  We will consult this year on additional service charges that Uisce &Eacute;ireann may apply to customers and will put in place a partial overall performance assessment, OPA - that is, a set of metrics and key performance indicators to monitor whether Uisce &Eacute;ireann meets satisfactory performance levels.  We will publish the timeline for putting in place enduring non-domestic charges and we intend to establish a large water users' group in recognition of the significant impact this customer group has on the overall system.  In 2015 we will examine the enduring connection charging policy for all customers.  A big focus will be placed on data reporting and monitoring in the next two years and the purpose of this is to help us do our job of holding Irish Water to account.  In 2015 we will also kick off the first full price control, which will apply from 2017 onwards - it takes around a year and a half to carry out such work on a price control that will last six years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014102100004#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul McGowan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413898200,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending today.

I find it unbelievable that the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, has not yet ascertained what the first-fix policy is, although charging has been ongoing since October.  Was it always the CER's brief, as directed by Government, not to have that in place prior to the commencement of charging?  Is that as a result of what has come out in recent days about the excessive costs of repairs, with call-out charges of &euro;188 during office hours, &euro;282 outside office hours and &euro;141 per hour thereafter, as well as &euro;220 for a pressure test?<\/p><p> Mr. McGowan also mentioned that the CER's brief allows it to assess and make recommendations in relation to charges Irish Water may impose on its consumers and other means of income.  Is this another means of income?  Is this only now coming to light against a background in which the CER has not yet clarified the first-fix policy?<\/p><p> To go back to the start, Mr. McGowan said the cost base was excessive to the tune of 8%.  Which costs exactly does the CER find excessive?  Does it find the start-up costs excessive?  Does it find the ongoing operations costs excessive?  Did it factor into its analysis the payment system that exists for staff?  Does that fall within its remit or is it something outside its control?  In relation to the economic framework and the assessment of its viability in the future and its ability to raise and access funds in capital markets, last week's budget saw a further &euro;65 million in Government subvention through the benefits package, the fuel allowance and tax credits.<\/p><p> We are led to believe that up to one million people have not yet returned their packs.  Based on an 80% compliance rate, the total revenue from domestic users might be in the region of &euro;160 million.  Has the CER factored a compliance rate into its assessment of Irish Water's income?  If so, what was it?  Was it 80%, 100% or 50%, which it might be when the dust settles?  Has the CER had an opportunity to assess the impact of the increased subvention just mentioned, which has come since the charges were set in motion?<\/p><p> Free allowances were significantly reduced on 1 October compared to when the CER circulated its draft document.  The allowance has gone from 38,000 litres for children to 21,000 litres.  From where did the relevant data come?  What scientific evidence was available to back up that decision?  Will the CER publicise where that information emanated from?  Was any consideration given to whether people aged 18 and older who are attending college, for example, should be assessed based on an adult charge?  A commitment was given to review the charges on an ongoing basis.  It sounds to me as though the CER was not sure of the data available to make the assertion in the first place.<\/p><p> I welcome the CER's move to give an immediate refund from day 2 where a boil-water notice has been issued.  What I fail to understand and what I am greatly disappointed with is that the CER saw fit to give a discount of only 40% to non-domestic users.  What does that say to the commercial sector, to the tourism sector, to the licensed trade, and to restaurant proprietors in Roscommon and other places where a boil-water notice might exist?  How are they expected to carry on regardless? How are their businesses expected to succeed when they are being hit with such charges?  The costs are greatly excessive, given how they supply water to their customers.<\/p> <p> On the first-fix and call-out costs, what data has the CER assessed to allow Irish Water to arrive at the prices mentioned?  What analysis has it carried out of similar situations in other areas where water charges are part of the income for those providing it?  If those questions are answered they might lead to others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014102100006#K00200","speaker":"1101","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413898800,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I will try to answer the questions in order.  Under the first-fix policy Irish Water may spend &euro;51 million.  If it spends that amount of money it is important that it is accounted for properly.  It has always been our intention to analyse the first-fix policy and submit it for consultation in order to ensure that it delivers value for money for all consumers.  A pilot study is currently being carried out by Irish Water on first fixes, comprising 100 first fixes.  The results of that, along with its proposal on what the first-fix policy will mean, will be available to us for public consultation in the first week of November, and our intention is that the first phase of the first fix will begin in January 2015, based on what we call a partial approval.  We will grant it an approval on certain terms and conditions for a certain amount of money from January 2015.  We will follow that with a full and final decision on the first-fix policy.  We did not come to a decision in the last day or two; we have known for some time that the first-fix policy would need to be the subject of consultation to ensure that value for money is achieved.<br\/>Irish Water submitted proposals to us in its water charges plan concerning call-out charges.  We expressed concern about the level of those charges.  We said that we have not approved them and we will consult on what they should be.  We stated quite clearly that if anybody incurred those charges he or she would receive a rebate of any charges paid over and above what we would eventually approve.  We have not signed off on any call-out charges.  <br\/><font color=\"#0000FF\">.<\/font><br\/><b>Ms Cathy Mannion:<\/b>I will add something to that.  There is no link between the first-fix policy and the call-out charges, although when I first read about them in the press they seemed to go hand-in-hand.  The first-fix policy is all about how Irish Water fixes a leak at no cost to the consumer.  It is very different from call-out fees, which might apply when someone wants his or her pressure tested, a meter moved or something else.  As Mr. McGowan said, there will be separate consultation on that, because we were concerned about the level of those costs.<br\/>We were asked whether we had benchmarked costs from elsewhere.  We have done so for gas and electricity for ESB and Bord G&aacute;is Networks.  We will do the same for Irish Water.  We will ask it for a lot of detail on the wage rates of the people doing the work and the number of hours required for each piece of work.  It will be quite a detailed consultation.  At the end of all that, we will develop a fixed rate plus a fixed number of hours as a standard charge, which will bring clarity to the situation.  The costs may be more for some people than for others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014102100008#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul McGowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1413898800,"counter":278,"content":"<p>Does the delegation think too much is expected of it?

When I mentioned other means of income, I was merely referring to the subvention from the Government; I was not referring to anything else.<\/p><p>  In terms of costs and the 8% reduction we applied, the Deputy asked us about three specific areas.  Irish Water put forward an application for a figure of &euro;181 million in start-up costs.  We analysed its figures in detail and the Deputy may recall that we also carried out a previous analysis at a much higher level at the request of the Minister.  This time we carried out a more detailed analysis and found that the majority of the &euro;181 million in costs had been efficiently procured in line with proper procurement processes and that the costs had been efficiently incurred, with the exception of a sum of &euro;9.1 million which we did not deem to have been efficiently incurred.  As a result, we disallowed &euro;9.1 million of the expenditure.  These costs were primarily in the area of project management but there was an element of labour costs.<\/p><p>  In regard to operational expenditure, we all accept that Irish Water's cost base is too high.  The challenge for us is to put in place a regulatory framework that will bring pressure to bear on its cost base in order that it will be seen to decrease over time.  For the initial two year interim revenue control period, we have attached a reduction of 7% per annum in its operating expenditure.  In the first full price control process we will expect to be imposing even greater targets on Irish Water in terms of the reductions it will need to make to its cost base in order that the charges to customers will be brought down to as low a level as is reasonably possible.  This is not something that can be done overnight; it is a programme.  As has been seen across Europe when it comes to utility regulation, these efficiencies are achieved over time.  The targets we have set for Irish Water for the interim revenue control period are challenging, but they are also realistic, that is, they are achievable for Irish Water.  We will be considering more stringent operational expenditure targets in the future.  We do not get into or offer opinions on payment systems for staff.  <\/p><p>  I ask Ms Mannion to address the question of how we factored in the compliance rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014102100009#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul McGowan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413899100,"counter":281,"content":"<p>There are two aspects to the compliance rate.

In addition, as Irish Water did not have a perfect database of who everybody was and where everybody lived, we had to make allowances for names not being on the database or people having moved elsewhere.  We examined a number of figures and, from memory - I will revert to the committee if I am incorrect - we used a figure of 80% in the model.  That does not mean that we expect 20% not to pay, rather it was intended to cover the other two assumptions I mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014102100009#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Cathy Mannion"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413899100,"counter":282,"content":"<p>In regard to the free allowances, the Deputy is correct.  The original direction from the Minister mentioned 38,000 litres, or such other number based on available data.  I think we have published the analysis carried out in deriving the 21,000 litre free allowance for children.  We will continue to monitor this area and publish the results of our monitoring.  There is no issue in that regard.  The 21,000 litre figure is based on an analysis of 3,000 households in a period running from November 2013 to August 2014.  We are confident that the figure is based on the best available data.  We did not have that confidence in regard to the 38,000 litre figure which was based on a decade-old report based on UK consumption levels and not necessarily based on average consumption rather than the highest level of consumption for children.  The 21,000 litre allowance is based on the most accurate figures available to us in terms of average consumption by children.<\/p> <p>It is very important that we use the best available data because the policy is clear that the water used by children is free.  If we had stuck with the 38,000 litres or another number, we would effectively have been imposing a cross-subsidy from adults to children or <i>vice versa<\/i>; in that situation we would not have been complying with our duty.<br\/>With regard to charging for adult students, the position is clear that the entitlement to the free allowance is based on the PPS number and the payment of child benefit.  It is only those in receipt of child benefit who can claim a child allowance.  That is legal position, which is reflected in the charging.<br\/>The final question was related to the 40% discount for the non-domestic sector.  It is important to point out that from the start we made it clear we were addressing domestic charges first.  We have a huge body of work to undertake to ascertain the situation regarding charging in the non-domestic sector.  However, in the meantime we recognised that there could be a possible inequity if water was subject to a notice declaring it unfit for human consumption; therefore, we made an exception in the case of the non-domestic sector and introduced the 40% discount.  If we had stuck with our original position, we would not have made any change in the case of the non-domestic sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014102100009#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul McGowan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413899400,"counter":284,"content":"<p>When publishing the document, will the CER compare and contrast its analysis with the one that was in place, albeit from the United Kingdom and ten years old?

It is regrettable that we were not able to have this conversation before the CER issued the price of water.  Nonetheless, considering the storm of concern among the public about water provision, charging for it, fairness, affordability and so forth, it is important that the representatives are present at this meeting.  The main concern is affordability, fairness and customer protection, which Mr. McGowan mentioned, and that water customers will be looked after correctly and will not have inappropriate charges levied on them.<\/p><p>  What is the real cost of producing water and treating wastewater, taking infrastructure into account?  Mr. McGowan said the system in place was not fit for purpose, when one considered leaks, boil water notices, the lack of sewage treatment works and the array of problems in that regard.  What is the cost of producing water?  On the last occasion the representatives appeared before the committee I raised a concern which had been raised previously in the media that the estimated cost of the additional local authority workers - an estimated 2,000 people were moving from the local authorities to Irish Water - would be &euro;2 billion up to 2023.  Is this cost one of the factors the CER must consider and is it factored into the price it has devised?  Is it being passed on in the charges arrived at by the CER?<\/p><p>  On the cost of producing and treating water, it appears to be very neat that the cost of producing water if a person is only receiving a water supply service, as opposed to having wastewater going into the public mains, is simply half the price.  It does not sound very scientific.<\/p> <p>I would like to know the basis for the figure of &euro;244 for receiving the water and double that amount for having it treated out.  Some people are only using one of those services and I ask whether some of the cost of treating wastewater is being imposed on people who are already paying for water.  In rural areas where people are already paying for water, the rate per cubic litre is less than what Irish Water is proposing to charge and the allowances are higher.  In my own county the allowance is approximately 50,000 gallons, or approximately 200,000 l, for a domestic dwelling compared to the proposed 30,000 l.  This is a significant figure when the cost is being passed onto people if it also includes the treatment of sewage.<\/p><p> I ask for clarification on the cost of and timeframe for metering.  In regard to the call-out charge, surely an individual who calls out Irish Water to deal with a problem in a property is also entitled to hire a private plumber instead.  I ask the witnesses to confirm that.  If I report a leak in the public road to Irish Water, I presume I will not be charged for a call out.  Perhaps that, too, can be clarified.<\/p><p> I am mindful that the Chairman has directed us to discuss water tariffs but the regulator gave us an assurance at our last meeting that only the real costs associated with the production of water would be passed on to the water consumer or customer.  The regulator indicated that it would act as watchdog to ensure we get fair prices.  This is aside from the debate about whether we should pay for water.  The eye of the current storm is the issue of bonuses.  The most ridiculous thing I have heard is that somebody who is not working well can get a bonus of up to 9% to encourage him or her to work well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014102100010#O00400","speaker":"1070","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413899700,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to keep to the tariffs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014102100011#P00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1413899700,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I was reassured by the regulator at our last meeting that there would be fairness but people do not see this as fair.

There is a range of such companies - how do they compare?<\/p><p> On the issue of protecting customers, last night a householder informed me that his phone calls to Irish Water over the past eight days had gone unanswered.  In general he uses the phone every day, but his calls to the Irish Water call centre have neither been answered nor returned.<\/p><p> On customer costs, over 40% of all treated water is lost through leakage from the mains system.  One can keep mopping the floor but it is not a productive way to spend time if one does not fix the leak.  The overall cost of providing water is &euro;1.2 billion, but 40% of this leaks into the ground.  Have the witnesses discussed with Irish Water a programme to improve this?  Allowance has been made for substantial capital works.  The document provided by the witnesses says there will be &euro;750 million worth of capital works for 2014 - this figure rises to &euro;864 million for 2015 and &euro;894 million for 2016.  Over the past ten years, between &euro;300 million and &euro;400 million was spent per year on mains rehabilitation capital works.  Substantial work was done on installing high-quality mains infrastructure in some counties, including new boreholes and so on.  How much mains rehabilitation has been carried out in 2014?  I cannot get an answer on this from Uisce &Eacute;ireann because it sidesteps the question.  Have the witnesses discussed this huge cost base issue with Irish Water?  Efforts will be made to force people to pay for water that is leaking into the ground, and this concerns me greatly.<\/p><p> What is the plan for dwellings that cannot be metered?  Many dwellings are part of a group supply scheme and some old houses have backyard supplies.  This issue affects apartment complexes too, some of which house single people on low incomes.  How will costs be determined in these cases?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014102100012#Q01500","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413900600,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I will answer some questions and then hand over to Ms Mannion.

At the moment, 400,000 meters have been installed, and installation is proceeding at a rate of 33,000 per month.  This is phase one of the metering programme, and the next phase will address apartments and places where a single supply pipe feeds a string of houses.<\/p> <p>We need to see whether arrangements can be made for metering and what those arrangements might be.

He was told it would not do the fix for him so he decided to intervene himself and he dug up his path and installed a new water pipe.

However, this is the only utility in which one could potentially pay for something that one does not consume, because of the leakage issues.  I accept that the first-fix policy is not the issue; it is what happens subsequent to that, when one has full liability.  Somebody mentioned the customer side of the meter.  Most meters are situated in the middle of the public footpaths in housing estates.  I am not worried about the first leak but the second.  If the leak is between the meter and the curtilage of one's site, a permit is required to open the footpath.  In Kildare such a permit costs &euro;120, along with a charge of &euro;50 for repairs to the footpath.  A &euro;500 refundable bond is also required to ensure it is done, and there is also public liability.  That is the position around the country; it may vary slightly, but there is a policy in each local authority.  That could potentially be over and above the cost of repair if a person has a liability for that part of the footpath and if the leak happens to be there.  Has the delegation discussed this issue with Irish Water?<\/p><p>  A leak is more likely to occur outside a house when there are severe weather events, and the location of the meter then becomes an issue.  Is it the case in other countries that the liability is on the outside?  If one has a problem with a gas or electricity appliance one will get it repaired; the same happens if the loo or the bath is leaking.  The area between the meter and the house is where there will be the greatest difficulty, with the necessity of digging up paths and so on.  What is the position in other countries in respect of such issues?  The location of the meters appears to be an extreme liability that will cause major problems.  Who decided on the location?<\/p><p>  In regard to commercial charges, if the shop is downstairs and the living quarters are upstairs, the charge is &euro;250 as opposed to &euro;488, as it is just the one charge.  Is it intended to charge fully, or will there be two tariffs, a domestic tariff and a commercial tariff, which would obviously involve a substantial increase on the commercial side?  The existing commercial free allowance for the house is 200,000 litres, as opposed to 30,000 litres.<\/p> <p>That becomes an issue.  They are potential significant new charges.  The delegation might give us their thoughts on them.<\/p><p> It said it benchmarked against other countries, but I cannot but note that we have the most expensive electricity in Europe.  We have a dispersed population pattern, but we also have a dispersed pattern of water mains.  I am concerned that we are being asked to compare Ireland to other countries.  A comparison between Ireland and other countries in regard to electricity does not produce an average cost for Ireland.  Our charges are excessive.  <\/p><p> The other issue is estates that have not been taken in charge.  I presume once they are occupied there would be an obligation to sign a form in order to receive a free allowance.  The developer retains control of an estate until it is taken in charge.  What is the first fix policy in regard to such situations?  I know of situations where shortcuts were taken underground and cheap fittings were used.  Irish Water will find serious problems and shortcomings with some systems for which individuals may have to pay.  The issue is not just the location of pipes, but also the quality of some of what was laid.  I will revert to the delegation if I have any supplementary questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014102100016#U00600","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413901800,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I will pass the question on electricity prices to Mr. Blaney.

For a long time I have felt that the establishment of Irish Water was tantamount to handing over an asset belonging to the people to a private entity, and there is no doubt that it was handed over in a very haphazard way.  What was not taken into account was the huge number of people who set up group water schemes back in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.  At that time, people paid to get a scheme up and running, which cost, in poor times, anything from &euro;200 up to &euro;800.<\/p><p>  The information given to the public was very unplanned.  I know people who contacted Irish Water but were told to contact their local authority to deal with a leak.  People do not know exactly where they stand in this regard.  We need greater clarity on the matter.  The system of communications with the general public is totally ineffective.  The matter needs to be addressed quickly, because people are angry, and rightly so.  All we have heard about since the establishment of Irish Water is the astoundingly large amount - &euro;180 million - invested in Irish Water, what consultants got, what bonuses have been paid, etc., which has annoyed people.  That is the reason there will be great difficultly in getting people to sign up to Irish Water.  On my way here today I heard that fewer than 500,000 people had returned their forms, which means that 1.5 million forms are outstanding at this juncture.<\/p> <p>It is only right that we fully scrutinise the amounts spent on Irish Water, both internally and externally.  We need greater clarity because people are not receiving the information they deserve, which is why they are so angry.  I would appreciate it if the CER looked at that issue and took it on board as quickly as possible.  People want to know exactly what is going on, but they do not seem to be getting answers.  This annoys both rural and urban dwellers.  <\/p><p> Another issue which is causing annoyance is the installation of water meters in areas where water is undrinkable.  Does the CER believe this is right?  It is a very bad policy to install meters in such places because the people living there are already angry about the poor quality of their water supply.  Boil notices are in operation and a company then comes along to install water meters.  This issue must be addressed as soon as possible.  Clear information on fixing leaks in the system must also be provided.  People want to know when major investment in water and sewerage schemes will take place.  It appears that nothing will happen in this regard in the foreseeable future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014102100018#W01100","speaker":"1062","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413902700,"counter":348,"content":"<p>There were two direct questions which Mr. McGowan might like to address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014102100019#X00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413902700,"counter":349,"content":"<p>Our role is to ensure we do everything transparently and publish as much data and information as we can for public consumption.

A comprehensive study of water usage was commissioned by Dublin City Council and carried out by Veolia Water UK and RPS in 2008 - I assume the CER accepts that the source for the study is reliable.  The study found that average usage in 2007 for an individual was 148 litres per day.  I will pass this information to committee members because they also need to explain why they are accepting the usage figures from Irish Water.  The typical household usage figure the CER has accepted is way below the one in the Dublin City Council study, which means that when the meters start to tick, people will receive much higher bills than the CER has indicated, once the nine month cap has beem lifted.<\/p><p>  Let us take as an example a two adult household.  Irish Water calculates average usage of 66,000 litres for the first adult in the household and 21,000 for the second.<\/p> <p>For a two-adult household, Irish Water calculates an average usage of 66,000 litres for the first adult in a household and 21,000 for the next.  Are they sharing the bath or what?  Where is the evidence that a second adult uses a third of the water used by a first adult?  I would love to hear a little bit more on that.  We must be going back to the days when we were all thrown into the bath on a Saturday night.  This would give 87,000 litres per year for a two-person household, or 119 litres per person per day, which is way less than the 148 litres that seems to be the average usage that was accepted in the greater Dublin area.  Why is the Commission for Energy Regulation accepting those figures?  For a typical household, as broken down by the commission itself, it would be much higher.<\/p><p> For a three-adult household, Irish Water calculations give 108,000 litres per year equating to 98 litres per day, so that is even lower than the other ones.  A four-adult household is 129,000 litres per year equating to 88 litres per day.  The more people in a family, the less water each individual will have to consume according to this.  Those figures are based on the most recent studies.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014102100019#X00600","speaker":"1195","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413903000,"counter":354,"content":"<p>The Deputy has two minutes remaining.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014102100020#Y00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1413903000,"counter":355,"content":"<p>The commission accepts the notion that a teenager uses way less water than an adult, when anyone knows that a teenager uses more water than most adults, and it has accepted the definition of a child.  This makes it clear there is no free water or free allowance and the commission is perpetuating that myth that is out there.<\/p><p>  My second question concerns the price rate that has been given.  The commission has accepted &euro;4.88 as the price.  I have figures from five different local authorities, and the business price of water at the moment in Limerick City and Limerick County is &euro;2.70.  In Fingal it is &euro;1.95, under South Dublin County Council it is &euro;1.93 and in Dublin City it is &euro;1.78.  In all these areas, householders are paying more than businesses pay.  Can the witnesses explain why they gave that price for water?  <\/p><p>  It has become clear to the 100,000 people who were on the streets and to everybody else that people fundamentally reject the bonus culture etc.  We do pay for water; we always have done.  The witnesses actually accept that in one part of their document.  Why did they not seek that real conservation measures would be undertaken?  In Britain, where there is metering, domestic water usage is 141 litres per person per day.  This is not much different from Ireland.  Yet since 1996 water losses in the Dublin region have been brought down from 42.5% to 28% through investment and through an actual programme where leaks were detected by teams.  That would save much more money, as would dual-flush toilets, water harvesting and all of those things.  No effort is being made to bring those in.  In Denmark through dual-flush toilets and other educational measures they achieved a figure of 30 litres per day for sewage, whereas in Britain it is 51 litres.  Huge amounts could have been saved on that.  The only conclusion we can come to is that this is an austerity tax pure and simple with lots of window dressing to make it look fair.  The fact that a very sick or infirm person gets no waiver or discount puts it all in perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014102100020#Y00300","speaker":"1195"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413903000,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I would like to address the issue of consumption levels first of all.  The analysis indicates that a one-person household consumes 66,000 litres every year.  The 21,000 represents the marginal consumption that occurs when additional people are in the house.  The very fact that a household exists means that there is a level of water consumption associated with that and that is the 66,000.  The additional 21,000 recognises that it is marginal consumption associated with an additional adult or child.  The analysis indicates that in fact the level of consumption by an adult or a child is broadly similar.  That is why we have used 21,000 as the children's allowance and also as the level for each additional adult within a household.  That data is based on Irish data gathered from Irish Water meters in the last 12 to 16 months.<\/p> <p>It is the most up-to-date data available to us.  As we said, we will keep this under review and require quarterly monitoring of it by Irish Water but we believe it is the best available data on water usage in Ireland.<\/p><p> The price of &euro;4.88 was set based on our analysis of the cost to Irish Water of delivering water and waste water services to the domestic customer sector.  We have done no analysis of the cost of providing the same services to the business sector and, thus, can offer no opinion on whether the different charges applied in different counties are correct.

However, it does set the level of costs, and salary plays a part in that.  How can the CER, in the public interest, ensure that the utility is paying the appropriate levels of remuneration and getting value for money for the salaries it pays?  It seems to me that the CER is looking at it on a macro level.  The at-risk salary model is being used at Bord G&aacute;is.  Does the commission look at the salaries there with regard to getting value for money?  That is important, because it is certainly an issue of public interest and concern at the moment.<\/p><p>  In relation to the call-out charges of &euro;188 for the first hour, &euro;282 for out-of-hours call-outs, &euro;142 for any additional hours and &euro;220 to test water pressure, the CER has stated - and I would like to hear it confirmed - that it has not approved those figures.  Could the witnesses give a timescale for approval of the figures?  Those figures are excessive when we take into account that the weekly dole payment is &euro;188.  That is the cost of the first hour alone.<\/p><p>  The ESB is responsible for maintenance up to the electricity meter, which is on the side of the house.  In the case of Irish Water, the meters are often out on the road or a couple of yards from the house.  If the network fails, in this case the customer would be responsible for the network beyond his or her house.  If the customer was at fault or it was damage caused by the customer, in most cases a repair would be needed on the network.  Are there any plans to review this?  It differs from the situation with ESB or Eircom with regard to the network and the point at which the customer is liable.<\/p><p>  I agree that the CER should look at establishing a capped or assessed charge until all the meters are in place so that people have certainty about what they are paying.  This is a very important factor.  There is a lot of fear out there at the moment for customers, and that would provide clarity and allay a lot of the concerns that the public have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014102100023#BB01000","speaker":"1187"},{"type":"speech","time":1413903900,"counter":401,"content":"<p>Before Mr. McGowan answers, I might add that when people do not actually have a utility bill - they cannot sit down and read something - it is harder to visualise it.

It is up to the company to determine how it delivers those efficiencies, whether through its management of consumables, how it uses energy or how it utilises its labour.

We will look at setting more stringent OPEX reduction targets under the first full price control exercise, which will run from 2017.<\/p><p>  In terms of Irish Water's responsibility versus the customer's liability in the context of location of meters and so on, this is a matter of law and not something we would review.  The legal situation that prevails is that the customer is liable up to the mains which, in many cases, runs down the middle of the road.  Irish Water, in accordance with custom and practice, has taken responsibility for the water service pipe up to the boundary of the property.

That is a matter for Government and not something over which we have control.<\/p><p>  In terms of the cap and the assessed charges, we have recognised that people may  be in a situation where they are facing a meter charge and do not know what it will be.

It is not an area in which we have a legal remit.  We try to set water charges that represent the efficient level of costs.  In regard to the level of call-out charges specifically, we have not approved anything in that regard.

First, I want to focus on a comment Ms Mannion made earlier to the effect that people with higher levels of water usage can actually tick a box in respect of self-declaration.  It must be remembered that we are dealing here with those with disabilities or older people in general.  I completed a number of these forms on people's behalf.  I was obliged to read the form approximately ten times before I realised where to tick the box in respect of self-declaration.  The box appears beside question No. 16, which states \"If you would like to request registration forms and information for special and priority services, please tick the box\" and \"You can nominate a carer or another person to deal with your bill and your correspondence.\"  It is also stated that if a person ticks the box to indicate that he or she wants to avail of these services, Irish Water will send him or her an information booklet and registration form.  There is no mention of additional water usage in question No. 16, the box attaching to which is supposed to be the one people should tick if they have extra water demands.  Can any of our guests explain in plain English how this can be deciphered in such a way that it means that a person with higher water usage should tick the relevant box?  The latter is not what is stated in the double-Dutch question beside which people are supposed to place a tick if their water usage is higher than normal.  It is both wrong and misleading to state that people can make self-declarations.  What has happened here today is deceptive, particularly in the context of some of the most vulnerable water users in the country.<\/p><p>  In the context of the submission I made to the regulator in respect of boil water notices, our guests will be aware that I live in Roscommon and that I am an expert when it comes to such notices.  What is the justification for allowing for a 40% discount for commercial users in respect of boil water notices?  Let us consider the position of a restaurant, the owner of which will be obliged to foot the additional costs relating to supplying both bottled water and ice and to absorb the hit from a loss of business due to the fact that some customers will not frequent his or her premises if they are obliged to buy bottled water.  There is also the negative publicity attaching to the community or town in which that restaurant is located.  People will not even visit such a location in the first instance if there are boil water notices in place.  The regulator has stated that there will be a 40% reduction for commercial customers affected by boil water notices when the impact on their businesses - particularly those relating to restaurants - could be devastating.  Why is there are 100% discount for water in for domestic users who are affected by boil water notices and only a 40% discount for commercial users?<\/p><p>  In my submission, I made the point that there should be a 100% discount for both water in and water out.  As our guests are aware, Irish Water is of the view that if a boil water notice is going to last for 12 months or less, it will not put in place a temporary treatment facility.  In reality, this means that people are being stuck with boil water notices for 18 months.  Does the regulator not have a responsibility to ensure that such notices are lifted as soon as possible?  The best way to achieve the latter is to put in place financial disincentives for Irish Water and, in fact, to penalise it in respect of water in and water out.<\/p><p>  The third point I raised in my submission relates to the position with regard to other water quality issues.  There are many other instances in which water quality does not meet the EU standard relating to potable domestic drinking water.  No discount or recognition has been provided in the regulations or in the cost structure in respect of this matter.  If we are not penalising Irish Water by imposing charges, what incentive is there for the company to ensure that those water supplies which do not meet the EU standard are brought up to scratch?<\/p><p>  In the context of the cost structure, our guests made the point that Irish Water does not have an incentive-based efficiency target such as that which obtains in the UK and that, as a result, its cost base is higher.  If that is the case, why is it that the cost base relating to group water schemes in this country is 35% lower than that of local authorities?<\/p> <p>That is based on a study by Professor Nick Gray of Trinity College Dublin that was published in March of this year.  We are told that the full economic cost of water is &euro;594, which works out at &euro;6.82 per 1,000 litres of water.  Forty percent of that is leakage, so customers are paying &euro;2.73 per 1,000 litres for leaked water which will not actually come out through their taps.  What incentive is there for Irish Water to clean up its act in relation to the leakage?<\/p><p> The cost base that the regulator has set for the domestic water charges is 31%.  If that is based on an overall cost of &euro;594, then householders should be charged an average of &euro;184 per annum.  Instead of that, the average cost is &euro;225, which is 71% of the overall cost base.  Why has 71% of the overall cost base been used, rather than 31% as per the presentation given earlier?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014102100025#DD00500","speaker":"1177","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413905700,"counter":417,"content":"<p>Tuigim go bhfuil Gaeilge ag duine de na finn&eacute;ithe.

Some of us do not believe that Irish Water has got anything to do with water conservation at all and that it is just another money-grab that is going to cost people a fortune.  I would like to ask the witnesses what precisely they consider their role to be in the area of water conservation and how they are going to act to ensure that is actually of some priority to Irish Water.  Reports are circulating - I wonder if the witnesses have heard this - that the actually installation of meters is leading to more leakage.  In the aftermath of sticking in these meters, which frankly I think is an extraordinary waste of money because it does not conserve any water - it is 500 million euro that could have gone into conserving water - as if that irony is not great enough there are now considerable reports that the act of putting in the meter is leading to leakage and that people are reporting leaks afterwards.  It is not entirely clear to me looking at the terms and conditions for the customer - perhaps the witnesses could clarify this too - whether customers could actually end up paying the bill for leakages if they are on the wrong side of the boundary between Irish Water's responsibility to maintain the pipes and the customer's responsibility.  Is it possible that the customer will end up paying for the leaks caused by putting in the meters?<\/p><p>  Staying with the issue of conservation, the CER is setting a price of &euro;2.44 per 1,000 litres for single service, &euro;4.88 for double service.  At the same time, it is requiring Irish Water to generate a certain amount of revenue from billing customers, if I understand it correctly.  They have to meet a target for billing.  Does that not mean that if people reduce their water usage, but Irish Water is still required to meet certain targets in terms of revenue, inevitably as people conserve more water the price per litre has to increase?  It seems to me that that has to be the case if there is a set target for what Irish Water has to generate in terms of revenue.  I did not hear the answer earlier on the issue of full cost recovery and the need for Irish Water to move towards full cost recovery.  I would appreciate if the witness could repeat this.  The assessed charge is currently &euro;2.48 per household but what about the requirement to get to full cost recovery?  <\/p> <p>What about full cost recovery and the requirement to get to that?  Does this not inevitably mean that whatever the price is now - which is unaffordable for many people - it will rise and continue to move towards full cost recovery?<\/p><p> Can a person opt out of Irish Water and can people say \"No\", that they do not want its services?  Is it true that if people do that, they will be told they must pay a fee to opt out?  That is what I have been told by somebody who phoned Irish Water and said he wanted to opt out of the Irish Water service.  Incredibly, he was told he would have to pay a fee to opt out of the service.  I saw a fantastic placard at the weekend which stated: \"I will pay for water when God sends me a bill.\"  That would be my attitude also, but as I do not believe God exists, I will never get a bill I intend to pay for water. <\/p><p> If we must pay for \"water in\" and \"water out\", does this mean we will pay for the water from the sky?  This is what has happened in Bolivia and Detroit.  I am not talking about the water that comes in through the system, the treated water, but for the water that comes down from the sky.  Will we end up paying for that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014102100027#FF00300","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1413906300,"counter":422,"content":"<p>D&eacute;anfaidh m&eacute; mo dh&iacute;cheall freagra a thabhairt as Gaeilge.

Nevertheless, we recognised that a situation arose in respect of non-domestic customers.  The then position was that there were no discounts in respect of them.  We are not proposing to carry out the full review and determination of non-domestic costs until next year.  We will be publishing a timeframe in respect of that matter.  However, we recognised that there was a potential issue in the context of the discounts.  We applied a discount of 40% where none had existed before and when we had no plans to introduce any discount.  What we need to do is to carry out an analysis, because some of these non-domestic customers are extremely large and, with the exception of a small number, they do not use water for the purposes of food preparation.  Until we have carried out a full analysis in respect of the non-domestic sector, we will not be in a position to move beyond the 40% discount we have already identified.  As already stated, there previously had been no discount.<\/p><p>  Deputy Denis Naughten inquired why the discount is not being applied in respect of water in and water out.  The initial proposal was that there would be a 50% discount in respect of water in, and we have increased this to 100%.  At the same time, however, we recognise that Irish Water has a job to do and that it must be able to take in sufficient revenue in order that it might make the necessary capital investments to ensure that supplies of water in and treatment of water out both meet the requisite quality standards.  We have reached a position at which the water that comes into a premises will be free in circumstances in which a boil-water notice is in place.  However, we recognise that all water out from that premises will still need to be treated and that there are costs associated with this.  It is important that we get the balance right in terms of ensuring people are treated fairly with regard to the services they receive from Irish Water while also ensuring that the company has sufficient revenue to allow it to fix any problems that arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014102100030#JJ00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul McGowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1413907500,"counter":462,"content":"<p>So people must pay for bottled water coming in and then they must pay also for it to be treated after it leaves the premises.

I wish to make it clear that if water is deemed unfit for human consumption, the 100% discount will apply.  We are aware of other issues such as that relating to hard water.  The advice is that such water does not represent a health risk to people and, therefore, no discount will apply in respect of it.  The basic position is that if water is deemed and declared unfit for human consumption, then discounts will apply.<\/p><p>  The Deputy stated that group water schemes have lower cost bases.<\/p> <p>We do not regulate the group water schemes.  Our job is to ensure that the costs Irish Water incurs are as efficient as possible.  Our role is to drive those costs down.  We have imposed 7% per annum reductions on the company in the first cycle and in the second cycle we will be looking at imposing even more stringent cost reductions.<\/p><p> There was a question about the incentive to reduce leaks.  We have a function in respect of the conservation of water resources.  The greatest area of water conservation is reducing leaks.  This is why we will be examining Irish Water's investment priorities for capital maintenance and so forth, which includes leakages, but we will also examine other investment priorities.  For example, raw effluent is still being discharged in some locations throughout the country.  The incentive to bring about the reduction of leaks stems from the fact that if Irish Water reduces leaks, it will reduce costs, and if it reduces its costs, then it will be in a better position to meet its targets.  Under the regulatory model we have imposed, the company will be incentivised to reduce leaks.  We will be looking at further specific incentives relating to leakage rates once we have the associated data.  One of the things we need to do in the coming years is gather a vast amount of data that are simply not available at the moment.<\/p><p> There was a question on whether it follows that if there is reduced usage the price will go up.  That is not necessarily the case because many factors go into the determination of the price of water.  For example, if water usage goes down then certain operational expenditure efficiencies could be associated which, in turn, would lead to lower prices.

It does not necessarily follow directly that if people start to conserve water, their bills will suddenly go up.  There are many factors that feed into it.  A major determinant of future prices is the level of capital investment that must be carried out to make the overall water and wastewater system fit-for-purpose.
