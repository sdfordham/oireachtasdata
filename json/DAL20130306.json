This comment came from one of the country's leading trade unionists.  In addition, it is not justifiable that na banaltra&iacute; agus na garda&iacute; on the front line should be obliged to accept such savage cuts.  It has been proposed under this agreement that those earning between &euro;35,000 and &euro;40,000 per annum would be obliged to accept a cut of up to 8%.  This is not acceptable but it does not simply stop there.  Those who earn more than &euro;100,000 per annum only stand to lose 6%.

Why should they stand to lose more?  They have worked and strived so hard down all the years and did nothing wrong.  Is daoine an-mhaith ar fad iad.

In fact, what occurred was that public representatives were removed from the boards and a new administrative tier was placed above what was a dysfunctional health board system, which was really a product of the 19th century poor law system.  The top-down system remained in place but there was a need for the whole organisation to be reformed.  Despite good people working in it, the structure and culture ended up being a failure.  It is beyond question that there were abuses by public representatives on the boards.  While I do not stand over that, they did, however, perform an oversight role which was lost when they were removed and that has never been properly replaced.<\/p><p>The HSE, instead of simplifying things, introduced a new level of bureaucracy that has proven to be extremely difficult to interact with for the citizen, which feeds into clientelism.  An organisation cannot have a clientelist approach unless its systems of governance are inaccessible to the public, meaning that people have to go through a middle man or woman.  That is one of the dysfunctional things about Irish politics.  <\/p><p> A good citizen interface for any organisation is essential in any reform process and this must be underpinned by the services being available.   A website is now the shop window for any service and I challenge anyone to make sense of the HSE's website.  A website is a mirror image of the organisation it represents.  The processes, culture and services can all be seen and to me it looks like chaos.  It looks like an organisation that is inwardly focused and process driven.  It is a tall order to expect that the changes proposed in this legislation, namely to replace the board with a new directorate, can deliver the kind of change that is needed.  This was the approach that was taken with local government, where directors of service were introduced but it did not change the culture because what was underpinning it was not changed.  Much more substantial reform is required.  I accept that this might be done on an incremental basis but we need to see what is the overall blueprint.  The people who work within the system and the citizens have a right to expect that.<\/p><p> The HSE was also a very useful vehicle for Ministers in the past in terms of blaming the organisation rather than accepting responsibility for failings.  The HSE served as a kind of teflon for the Minister for Health.  Parliamentary questions often took a ridiculously long time to answer and there is still a difficulty with accountability.  Responses from the HSE take longer than other parliamentary replies.  Another difficulty is that several Deputies are often asking the same question of the HSE.  There is duplication by virtue of the fact that one has to look in another location to determine what questions have been asked previously by others.  There is room for efficiency in this area, in terms of improving accountability and taking a simpler approach to finding out what is happening.  <\/p><p> The provisions of this Bill are intended to change all that but it will require a change in both structure and the organisational culture to achieve this.  The existing accountability arrangements under the Health Act 2004 are retained and they relate to service plans and annual reports but in many cases these are deficient.  There is no point in having service plans if there are no services available and I wish to cite a number of examples in this regard.  People often criticise politicians for spending time in their constituencies once or twice a week and accuse us of fixing potholes.  I wish it was only potholes that we were attending to but the issues are much more complex.  Deputies can see the failures in the system.  I was approached by a family with a 12 year old child who was ready to begin secondary school.  She has been on the waiting list for a tonsillectomy for the last two and a half years.  She is missing school regularly and on antibiotics frequently, which is not the kind of case management one would want.  She is not well and is losing weight.  She has been waiting for an appointment in Tallaght hospital for over two years and her parents have no private health insurance.  They asked if she could be moved to the waiting list for another hospital because if she was on the list for the actual procedure, rather than for just an appointment, she might be able to get treatment under the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  This is the reply her parents received from Crumlin hospital: &quot;Thank you for your referral to the ENT department.  Currently the outpatient waiting time is two years for a routine ENT appointment&quot;. The hospital refused her referral.  We are busy talking about building a children's hospital, which is desperately needed, but while we are waiting for that, we are seeing the failures.  That child is being failed.  There is no point in having service plans unless there are services behind them.  We need real reform that will impact on people.  <\/p><p> Access to services can often depend on one's address, which is a lottery I frequently come across.  In many cases, this affects children who need essential services such as occupational therapy.  Again, I have one of many examples of this.  The HSE informed me that the paediatric occupational therapy service was developed in Kildare, west Wicklow in 2009.  It added that the resources have been depleted in recent years due to resignations and it has not been possible to replace the staff due to the moratorium on recruitment.  This is penny rich and pound foolish because, in many cases, children will miss out on the developmental opportunities provided by occupational therapy and we will pick up the tab later by way of disability payments and so forth.  This is stupid.  Service availability is very much dependent on where one is in the country and for children living in a different part of the country, this is not a problem.  I do not see how a new directorship will make a difference in this regard.  Will people be moved from Cork to Louth or from Galway to Kildare?  We need a whole-of-organisation approach to understand where people are, where the gaps are and how we can plug those gaps.  <\/p><p> I have another example of an eight year old who is falling through the cracks.  He struggles to dress himself, cannot hold a knife and fork and needs occupational therapy but he cannot even be put on the list.  He was diagnosed by the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, CAMHS, with Asperger's syndrome and Attention Deficit Disorder but his parents were told that he would not be seen because there was no list for him to be put on.  The CAMHS does not have an occupational therapist, even if he was to be referred back to it and community treatment is not an option any longer.  This may well be a local play-out of this problem but it is impacting negatively on the child.  A new directorship and service plans will not resolve this issue if the people are not in place and I cannot emphasise this strongly enough.  <\/p><p> I have another example of a child who has a specific learning and language difficulty.  Speech and language therapy will not be provided in the school in Tallaght that specialises in treating the small number of children who have this disorder.  He is emotionally impacted by this but is also impacted badly in terms of his educational prospects.  When the particular service is provided, a child is taken out and given intensive occupational therapy for two years and then returns to mainstream school.  The experience of children who have gone through that route is very good.  In my view not having those services in place is criminal.  I have come across several children who need behavioural therapies.  I have had parents tell me that their big fear is that if their children do not receive the necessary treatment, they will end up in prison.  They are displaying violent tendencies at primary school.  They clearly have some difficulties and need behavioural therapies to modify their behaviour.  Their parents have said to me, bluntly that their child will end up in prison.  We talk about the past, about failures and the kind of Ireland we used to live in but this is the Ireland of now.  These are people I am coming across regularly and I do not suppose that Kildare is different to other parts of the country.  It may well be that there is a more deficient service in my area by virtue of the fact that the population increased rapidly in a very short space of time and the services did not keep pace with that.  We are now struggling with that and people are being lost in the system.  <\/p><p> Another issue of major concern, which is not being provided for, is the fact that we have younger cohort of people working in our public services.  Older people have tended to be the ones who have opted out when retirement packages were put in place.  Approximately 50% of these younger people are women as more women need to work these days because of large mortgages and so forth but no cover is being given for maternity leave.<\/p><p>We cannot be serious about providing a service unless we cover something like maternity leave, as that is where gaps occur.  The coverage of maternity leave is essential.<\/p><p> A huge number of good people are employed in the HSE and most of the workers are not responsible for the structure of the organisation.  I am sure these people are frustrated by the service within which they work but any change must occur with their co-operation.  I am concerned about the top-down approach.  We are told new directors will have a critical role to play and I hope that ends up as the case.  It is not just a question of hiring good people to fill those directorates, and the process must be underpinned by values and objectives.<\/p><p> As an example, the robotic approach to the home help system in recent months flies in the face of the objective of trying to keep people living independently within their own homes for as long as possible.  It cannot purely be about financial outcomes and I am concerned about the market and management language being used.  People who use the health services are not customers but they are citizens who pay their taxes if they are lucky enough to be able to do so.  They have an entitlement to a service when it is required.  We should stop the management speak.  A 12-year-old waiting for an emergency medical procedure is not a customer but a citizen of the country who is entitled to be cared for.  Citizens must be put at the heart of redesigning the process, as the outcomes are for these people.<\/p><p> Nevertheless, it is essential that we get best value from the limited funds available and it is clear from the leaked reports in recent years that internal audits are extremely lax when it comes to oversight of spending by the HSE.  This is unacceptable and it must change because we cannot afford waste.  What is proposed is limited and there is a need to see the shape of the organisation that will run our health services.  This piecemeal approach is not convincing.<\/p><p> There was a very useful paper delivered some years ago at the MacGill summer school, with Mr. Eddie Molloy talking about Ireland's sixth crisis involving a severe implementation of deficit disorder.  For those of us who want to see significant or radical reform in many of our institutions, we can identify with the idea.  Mr. Molloy indicates that the main carriers of the disorder are organised groups with strong bargaining power.  He includes in this senior public servants, executives, medical consultants and board members who have reached the top of their respective organisations.  They are a good cultural fit for the board and unlikely to question the prevailing culture, amounting to a safe pair of hands, with a core value of loyalty to a group or circle, golden or otherwise.<\/p><p> Mr. Molloy argues that we need to strengthen the strategic centre and that we need to establish the discipline of real, edgy, transparent strategic management.  Public agencies publish strategic plans approximately every three years but the track record in implementation is poor; we know this because they are all on shelves.  Mr. Molloy argues that there is a belief that a job is done once a report is published and people can read it but there is no effective system of strategic review and transparent reporting.  He also seeks the formation of senior public servants, which means they should not merely be trained in administrative and sector-specific skills and there should be inculcation of a value system.  He identifies institutional culture as the root cause of failure and the biggest obstacle to reform, highlighting several concrete steps that can be taken, including boards and senior executive teams giving quality time on a regular basis to engaging with an organisation's values and culture.  A cultural audit must be an integral element of strategic planning, with a section of culture a requirement in all annual reports.<\/p><p> Culture can be very difficult to change in an organisation but if it is not on the agenda, there is no chance of changing it.  Mr. Molloy also speaks about initiating a major multi-year programme to reappropriate and breathe life into the foundational values of the public service.  We must be deliberate in the kind of change being sought.  These are elements in a longer paper that has a wider scope but it is nonetheless relevant to this proposal.<\/p><p> We have an old poor law model that we are trying to tweak, which is not good enough.  What is beneath the directorships requires radical reform.  The structure and culture of the executive are in need of reform, with a whole-of-organisation reform required.  The top-down model was an intended change in the HSE and we can see that it did not work.  I do not understand why it continues to be the favoured approach when a whole-of-organisation approach is required.  It does not matter how good this organisational vehicle becomes if we do not have people with the right skills in the right places to deliver services to the public.  It does not matter how good the management system is in that case and there are serious deficiencies that will cost both money and opportunities.  These must be addressed and to give the impression that this is a big reform, with addressing such issues, will be seen as a failure for people who present with the kind of examples I used.  I wish these were the only examples I could use but unfortunately every one of us has a group of people seeing deficiencies in service delivery.  I am able to put my hands on just a few in order to give an example.<\/p><p> I am not opposed to the Bill but it is very limited in what is being done.  We need to see urgently what will be the overall shape of the HSE in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600010#H01700","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362571200,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Bill.  This legislation provides for three elements, the first of which is the abolition of the board structure of the HSE and for a directorate to be the new governing body for the HSE in place of the board, headed by a director general.  The second element is further accountability arrangements for the HSE, with the third element being related matters, including a number of technical amendments to take account of the replacement of the board structure by the directorate structure.<\/p><p>  The HSE was established in 2005.  It is a large organisation providing a broad range of services which are essential to the individuals who are in receipt of them.  The programme for Government commits to the abolition of the HSE but the abolition, as the Minister said in his opening statement on Second Stage, will require careful planning, sequencing and complex further legislation.  This Bill is an important step on the road to replacing the HSE with a new health governance structure that places the patient at the centre.<\/p><p>  When the HSE was set-up by Fianna F&aacute;il it was believed that a centralised health service would perform much better than the previous health board structure.  The health boards were much criticised but gave public representatives a meaningful role in holding the health authorities to account.  We currently have health regional fora for elected members, which were effectively established as an afterthought.  In recent times, fora members have complained about ineffectiveness and the lack of accountability from the HSE.  One of the main areas of concern for the public is the amount of administrators within the HSE structure.<\/p><p>The HSE created these positions following the amalgamation of the health boards.  Effectively, an increasing number of management positions were created on the establishment of the HSE to the detriment of front-line staff, such as nurses and doctors, and ultimately to the detriment of patients.<\/p><p> The Government has a mandate to reform and reorganise our health services fundamentally in a way that places the patient at the centre.  This Bill is an important building block on the way to the introduction of a universal health insurance system where money follows the patient.<\/p><p> The creation of six national directorates is to be welcomed.  They will focus on the areas of hospital care, primary care, mental health, child and family care, social care and public health.  We need to bring services closer to people so that they can be treated in their own communities.  Day care services, for example, are an important component of our health system.  In my community, Clarecastle in County Clare, we have a thriving district day care service which serves a catchment area with a ten-mile radius.  Fifty people attend the centre daily and they are provided with a broad range of health services and social activities.  This community-led day care centre represents exceptional value for money and has dramatically improved the quality of life of those who attend and their families.  In a nutshell, the centre enables people to live in their community for longer and to live independently.<\/p><p> The recently published HSE mid-west area service plan for non-acute services, 2013, confirms further enhancements of services at Clarecastle and serves as recognition of the range of competencies, including that of dementia-specific care, with the creation of a new development fund to support these important activities.  This is most welcome news.  I wish the hard-working board, manager and staff of Clarecastle day care centre well as they further develop the services.  I also wish the board and management of the new Carrigoran day care centre in Newmarket-on-Fergus well as it launches its new service.  It is a most impressive building that will offer a three-day service to its clients.<\/p><p> I acknowledge the process of change in the mid-west regional hospital network with the creation of a single hospital system incorporating six hospital sites, namely Limerick regional hospital, Ennis General Hospital, Nenagh General Hospital, St. John's Hospital, Limerick, the Mid-Western Regional Maternity Hospital and Croom orthopaedic hospital.  The primary focus in 2012 was on strengthening governance in the hospital network.  This was achieved through the establishment of clinical directorates and a new model of corporate and clinical governance.  Key areas of patient safety concerns were focused on, in addition to achieving efficiency through the creation of a single hospital system in the mid-west region.  This approach breaks down traditional barriers and makes it possible to utilise the total capacity of the hospital network in the region, which is leading to progress in the delivery of targets for scheduled and unscheduled care.<\/p><p> I welcome the opening of the new 50-bed ward block at Ennis General Hospital, which is a huge shot in the arm of health service provision in County Clare and the mid-west.  In the coming weeks, a new site manager will be appointed at Ennis general hospital following the promotion of former manger Mr. Frank Keane to manager of the new maternity and child health directorate.  Ennis has been accredited as a colorectal screening site, and this service is due to commence in the not-too-distant future.<\/p><p> There is ongoing commissioning of the critical care block at Limerick regional hospital with the opening of a state-of-the-art cardiology section backed up with the appointment of five cardiologists.  I welcome the commencement of work on the new emergency department at Limerick regional hospital and look forward to its opening in the next 18 months.  The mid-west hospital group also received an increase in the funding allocation this year of 10%.  That is an increase from &euro;216 million to &euro;238 million.  There are still funding challenges but this is certainly a boost.<\/p><p> I welcome this legislation as it is an important step towards achieving the goal of a single-tier health system together with universal health insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600012#K00200","speaker":"975","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362571800,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I am sharing my time with Deputy Finian McGrath.<\/p><p><br \/>  As the Minister said when introducing the Bill, it is a building block.  It is a transitional Bill that is part of the Government's programme to reform the health service.  Apparently the intention is to give the Minister more control over the health services.  In the past year, we have seen what more control of the health services means in practice for the Minister.  We witnessed the debacle of the prioritisation of primary health care centres that led to the resignation of a Minister of State at the Department of Health.  New areas in the Minister's constituency were added at the last minute to the list without the knowledge of any of his Cabinet colleagues or, it seems, the HSE.<\/p><p><br \/>  Two hospitals building programmes were announced by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, before the HSE even knew they were being prioritised.  Is this the type of governance that the Minister is talking about?  I have no doubt that we will continue to see this type of action from the Minister.  If the examples I have given are not bad enough, it should be noted they are not what the Minister intends in this Bill.  The Bill will provide for the establishment of a new management structure in the health service, creating a tier of directorships that will operate alongside the existing HSE structure of national directorships while he prepares to abolish the HSE.  We are told this will be done without any extra cost to the Exchequer.  What will happen in the transitional period?  Will there be a freeze in the work of the health service as staff wait to see how the structural will emerge?  We saw this before when the HSE was established.  This led to years of inertia during which many workers and decision-makers at local level were unable to determine where decisions should be made or by whom.<\/p><p><br \/>  A change of the magnitude that the Minister is proposing needs to be managed, and an organisation such as the HSE should have a change management team in place.  This should cost money if it is done right.  How can an organisation of almost 100,000 people change fundamentally without incurring any cost?  The building block that this Bill is supposed to be a part of is a move to the universal health insurance model that the Government wants to introduce in the image of the Dutch model.  In this system, we are told money will follow the patient.  I remind the Minister of what his predecessor, Ms Mary Harney, said when introducing the Health Bill 2004:<blockquote>It is our generation&#8217;s chance to put patients first in the design of the management of health services.  It is our chance to put in place modern, effective management to make the best use of these tremendous resources we are applying to health and to get clear value and clear results for that money.  It is our chance to create a system where money can follow patients and where outcomes can be measured.<\/blockquote>Those words will sound very familiar on the Government side of the House.  They have been uttered by the current Minister, Deputy Reilly, on many occasions and have been the mantra of Fine Gael Members for years.  I, for one, hope the Minister's plans go the way of the previous Minister&#8217;s plans and that, in years to come, the health service will be reformed to move away from the universal health insurance model.<\/p><p><br \/>  Universal health insurance will not be part of a system that will enjoy the faith of the people and I will not support the Government's effort to introduce it.  Unfortunately, the Government is moving on the road to create the system, and this Bill is one part of that programme.  The rolling out of the hospital groups is also a step, with the English system of trust being established.  This will drive the move to privatising the health system and handing over control to private health insurance companies.  The programme for Government sets out that the hospital purchasing arm will merge with the National Treatment Purchase Fund to become a new purchaser of public patient care in the period of transition.  It seems the Department of Health will purchase hospital care for public patients from the hospital groups, and this will fit nicely into the model of the universal health insurance companies.<\/p><p><br \/>  For many reasons, the move to universal health insurance will mean health care will become more expensive and access will be restricted for citizens.  When universal health insurance was introduced in the Netherlands in 2006, there were 13 health insurance companies operating there.  Today, there are five.  This is in a country with a population of 18 million.  What do we expect to see in a country with 4.5 million people?  The State will provide limited care for people who cannot afford it, with perhaps two companies operating and profiteering to the detriment of those who have no choice but to purchase from them.<\/p><p>In 2006, in the Netherlands, the average health cover cost approximately &euro;1,000 per citizen.  Today, it costs over &euro;3,000 per citizen.  How does that equate to progress?  In the Netherlands universal health insurance buys a basic package of healthcare and it now has a system where citizens must buy top-ups to increase their cover.  We will see the same happening here, but probably more quickly.<\/p><p> In discussing this Bill in the House, many Fine Gael members have complained that we are spending over &euro;13 billion on the health services and that this cannot continue.  There is much talk from them about how the health services must spend the funding in better ways and must achieve more for less, but all they are doing is using these fancy phrases.  I have not heard any of them identify where is this waste and give concrete examples of where savings can be made.<\/p><p> By all accounts, there has been tension between the HSE and the Department of Health on where savings can be made.  The Department and politicians claim that there are billions of euro to be saved from the elusive &quot;efficiencies&quot;, and that other great mantra of &quot;getting rid of waste&quot;.  The HSE claims that it cannot do much more and maintain services without the Government tackling the matters over which the HSE has no control.  The response of the Minister has been to introduce the so-called graduate nursing scheme, and that will be rolled out to other health professionals, cutting the wages of front-line health workers in order to save peanuts.<\/p><p> If there is to be one good outcome from this Bill, it will be that the Department of Health would not be able to hide behind the HSE and accept that the Department is not funding the service adequate.  I believe the Minister should have more control over the health services and he should also be accountable for how the health services work.  So should healthcare providers.  The real problem with the HSE is that there is no accountability and there is a lack of clear information, and in a country of our size the type of treatment one can expect to receive depends on where one lives.  One need only look at the debacle over catchment areas in Dublin hospitals that I highlighted in this House last year.<\/p><p> The health services may have reached, or even gone beyond, the level of cuts that they can sustain, unless, of course, there is this considerable waste and inefficiencies, of which we hear mention but of which we never hear any detail.  In my county, for example, Letterkenny General Hospital is probably one of the most efficient hospitals in the country.  Over 90% of procedures in the hospital are non-elective, yet the hospital has started each of the previous two years with a budget millions of euro short of what it needed to maintain services.  This has been softened slightly this year with an increase in the budget allocation.  This year Letterkenny General Hospital will only start the year &euro;1 million short of what it needs to maintain the services.  The fact is if we want a health service that is up to the standard of the best in Europe, it must be paid for.  If the health service improves outcomes and becomes more efficient by treating more patients and ending waiting lists, then it will cost more, and there is no way of getting away from that.<\/p><p> The Government should be driving a debate about what type of health service we want and how much it would cost to provide it.  Do we want a health service that is driven by private health insurance providers charging thousands of euro per citizen and driving the levels of treatment available with the State picking up the cost for those who cannot afford the premium?  Or do we want a health service that is free at the point of contact where every citizen can access treatment as required in a system that is led by medical need where citizens can access it based on equality, not wealth?  The second option may cost more but I believe that the Irish people would be willing to pay for it if they believed that it would be implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600013#L00200","speaker":"1001","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362572400,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  Before I start, I offer my sympathy and condolences to the family of the great President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez of Venezuela who died yesterday evening, and also my support and solidarity to the people of Venezuela.  Hugo Ch&aacute;vez was a great man and a great president who looked after the poor in Latin America and in his own country, and his record in reducing poverty by 50% and his improved health services over the past ten years have shown that he was a magnificent leader.  I offer my deepest support and solidarity to his family and to all the people of Venezuela.  There are many Irish, both at home and abroad, who would agree with this position.  I express my condolences to the people.<\/p><p>  It is important that we welcome and look at the broader debate on this legislation, the Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill 2012.  This is an important debate on the way we run the health service.  This is also an important debate on reform and change in the health service.  Change and reform are what we all, not only the Government parties, promised at the last election, given what had happened to politics in Ireland in the previous five to six years.  Nobody denies that we need change, nobody denies that we need radical reform and nobody denies that we need a quality health service.  To do this, the Government needs to bring the citizens and the staff in the health service with it, otherwise it is doomed to failure.  Reform and change are part of the agenda and if people are not up for it, they should not be involved in politics.<\/p><p>  There are certain aspects of this legislation which are a step in the right direction.  I welcome strong aspects of the Bill.  It is important when one sees sensible proposals coming from the Government, even though I am an Opposition Deputy, to look at them and support them because we all want to improve the health services for citizens.  We all will be aware that we are spending &euro;13 billion on the health service.  We all want to achieve efficiencies, we all want quality staff and we all want to deliver an efficient service in a professional way.  There is no contradiction and no opposing view on that issue.  My personal broader view is that in the long term I would like to see a universal health service paid for out of taxation.  At present, we are looking at the idea of universal health insurance and I will speak about that as well because there are aspects in this legislation which will be positive.<\/p><p>  The Bill abolishes the current board structure governing the Health Service Executive, HSE, and replaces this with a directorate system, headed by a director general.  The Bill also provides for additional accountability arrangements in the HSE.  The directorate structure is intended to be an interim measure, pending the ultimate dissolution of the HSE, which will require further legislation.  This Bill does not change the legal status of the HSE under the Health Act 2004.  Basically, that is what the legislation is about.<\/p><p>  This is where I welcome it.  It replaces the board with a directorate system, headed by a director general.  I want to see directors leading change and bringing in the necessary radical reform.  There has been too much bureaucracy.  From past experience, when I was pushing the issue with the previous Government, I am aware that there were cock-ups and delays, for example, in the provision of the cystic fibrosis unit in St. Vincent's Hospital where there was a turf war between the HSE, the Department of Health and the Minister's office.  With everything like that going on, those who suffered in the end were the patients with cystic fibrosis.  Thankfully, that unit was eventually built.  I welcome the fact that was done but I remember dealing with those families every day and the trauma it caused.  We need decisive leadership and if there are good proposals in this legislation, I will support them.  I make no apologies for that.  We need to ensure that there are drivers for change within these structures and I see the role of the director general in that light.<\/p><p>  The one measure I very much welcome in the Bill is the additional accountability arrangements for the HSE.  That is something that we all support.  Whether it is a patient on a trolley or somebody with a disability, there must be accountability and there must be staff who take responsibility for the jobs.  In a previous job, I worked as a principal in a disadvantaged school in the north inner city.  I often laugh when I hear of the bankers and developers wasting money and speculating, and all  kinds of things going wrong.  I remember doing our books every June to have them ready for the cigire.  As the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, will be aware, the inspector would come in and if one was &euro;10 over budget, he would be down on one like a ton of bricks.  If I was &euro;40 over budget, I had to go to the parents' council and ask could I take &euro;40 from it to put into the school merely to ensure that books were in order.  I always remember the efficiency of the inspector.  I welcome accountability.  When I saw what some others did, for example, in the regulation of the bankers, it blew my mind away.<\/p><p>The poorest schools in Ireland and the DEIS schools now were more efficient in managing public money than a lot of people who squander it.  Public servants, whom I strongly support, have to deal with this issue of reform and take responsibility.  Those in the HSE need to take responsibility and that is why the additional accountability arrangements for the HSE in the Bill represent an important reform.  If people do not want to take responsibility or do not want to be accountable, they should forget the day job.  We need people in jobs where they love their jobs.  We also need to look at the idea of the good old-fashioned quality public servants such as teachers, garda&iacute;, nurses and postal service workers, who like to serve their community and know they are paid out of public money and thereby develop accountability.  Sadly over the past ten years that has not been in place in the HSE.  There are positive aspects in the HSE.  We have brilliant professional staff, but we also have major flaws and inefficiencies.  People should do their best at all times in this regard.  If 20 people are on trolleys in Beaumont Hospital tomorrow, I want the Minister to be accountable, but I also want the managers to be accountable and accountability should also come from the HSE.<\/p><p> In my speech I mentioned the late President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez, who spent much of his oil money on developing the health services and reducing poverty in Venezuela.  We also need to ensure the &euro;13 billion is spent in a sensible way.  On the broader reform of the health service, we need to stop people going to emergency departments as much as possible because we need to ensure there are efficiencies there.  Part of that policy must include dealing with the GP issue but also dealing with the medication issue.  I disagree with the Government on issues such as cutting the respite care grant for people with a disability by &euro;325.  I do not accept that cut was acceptable at a financial level or from a human rights level.  If we take money from people who are out in the community, at some stage they will end up involved professionally in the system and will cost more money.<\/p><p> Prevention is a very important part of any health strategy.  Let us make sure that somebody surviving with a disability, for example, with a few extra bob through a respite care grant or something similar, is looked after.  Many parents of children with disabilities regularly come to me and say that despite paying their taxes every week, when they go looking for a service they have to reduce service or take a hit.  That is not acceptable - people forget about that.  Some 13% of families are directly affected by a disability and I will be their voice in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  They are telling me they go to work every week - those who have jobs - and pay their taxes, and so are entitled to look for a service.  I do not believe it is acceptable.  A very disabled young man in my constituency was getting a service five days a week in the CRC in Clontarf, but he is now reduced to three days.  That is not acceptable in any society, regardless of what people say.  With a &euro;13 billion budget, I do not accept that some reasonable way cannot be found to fund that issue.<\/p><p> I support the reform proposals in the legislation.  I have a broader view of the health service - I would lean more towards the Cuban model - I know the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, will be interested in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600014#M00200","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362573000,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I have looked at it and it is not that good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600015#N00200","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1362573000,"counter":204,"content":"<p>A week in Cuba might do him good.

He is correct in saying our minds should be open to new ideas and things that work well in other countries.  We should consider models that work well elsewhere to see if they are applicable to Ireland.  The most dangerous threat to the concept of representative politics is the idea that all politicians are the same, that ideology and policy do not matter, and that regardless of whom we vote for we will get the same outcomes and the same policy.  That is something that is particularly relevant to Ireland at the moment as we struggle with terrible financial difficulty and look to exit a bailout programme later in the year.  I believe it is also a concern across Europe as people look at the relationship individual nation states have with the European Union and their interaction abroad that regardless of the government, the outcomes will be the same.<\/p><p>  In that spirit, I accept that the late President Ch&aacute;vez offered a different view of how his country could be run and the role government could play.  Even though I had concerns over some of the things he did and some of the directions he wanted to take, he clearly mattered deeply to the people of Venezuela and showed that politics could matter and make a difference.  Therefore, his demise should be recognised and sympathy should be extended.  Deputy Finian McGrath is correct in that regard.<\/p><p>  This debate is about the role of the HSE and its future.  The opening ceremony for the London Olympic Games was a fantastic ceremony orchestrated by one of Britain's leading film directors.  A striking point was the prominent role given to recognition of the NHS in that ceremony.  People were celebrating the role of the NHS and of nurses, doctors and the people who run it.  The vision of the people, such as Ernest Bevin, Clement Atlee and William Beveridge, who set up that organisation, regarding a welfare state and the difference it could make and the war on the four evils, as they described it, clearly resonates with the people of Britain to the degree that they wanted to celebrate it in the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games.  The acting director general of the HSE was asked if a similar ceremony was organised in Ireland for the opening of a sporting event like the Olympic Games whether the HSE would receive that kind of recognition and get that kind of celebration.  He was forced to reluctantly conclude that the answer to that question was that it would probably not, and I believe he is right.<\/p><p>  We need to ask why that is.  Is it because of the quality of our nurses and doctors?  Absolutely not.  I believe anybody who attends a GP or goes to a hospital or primary care centre comes away impressed by the quality of care and compassion they get from the people with whom they engage.  Is it because of the quality of the people who are leading our hospitals?  I have dealt with many of those people and I must conclude that the answer to that question is also &quot;No&quot;.  I have met the chief executive of the Mater hospital on a number of occasions and have met the people who run Temple Street Hospital and seen the work they do.  They are second to nobody in terms of the commitment they have to patient care and to doing all they can to ensure their hospitals offer the best possible environment for people who need care and want to recover.<\/p><p>At the opening of the new Phoenix Care Centre in Grangegorman, which I attended and the Minister may recall for another reason, the Minister spoke about heritage and the tradition of compassion and care in such facilities on the part of staff there in terms of caring in the best way possible, despite the limitations on them, for people who are vulnerable.  I also attended the Minister's opening of the new extension to the Mater hospital, which is an extraordinary new facility in the centre of the inner city.  On that occasion, I again heard staff speak of the type of care they want to give people in that new facility.<\/p><p> In seeking to reconcile the difference between the quality of staff within our health service, the &euro;13 billion being invested in it and the resonance, despite this, of the HSE with the people of Ireland, I am forced to conclude that there are difficulties in terms of the manner in which our health care services are designed and delivered and in the structure of the link between money invested in the health care system and the quality of care received by the patient.  That said, despite the difficulties we are experiencing, huge progress is being made.  There has been a reduction in the number of people on trolleys in our hospitals this year versus last year despite that, regrettably, less money is being allocated in this regard; the number of people awaiting operations for more than three months has also decreased and the number of children awaiting urgent medical attention, who should not have to wait for it, has also decreased, as has the number of adults on such waiting lists.  Despite our difficulties, progress is being made in many areas.<\/p><p> This Bill deals with the design of the Health Service Executive and how we can change it further to ensure we get more from the enormous compassion and financial resource that exists in our health care service.  I am certain that the direction in which this legislation proposes to move the HSE is the right one.  Does any Member of this House believe that if he or she had the privilege of doing the job of the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, taking account all of the challenges and opportunities to deliver, he or she would be better placed to do that job following publication of this legislation?  In my view, the answer to that question is, yes.  The reason he or she would be better placed to do the job following enactment of this legislation is because it seeks to ensure a more consistent and coherent decision-making process within the Department of Health and its impact on care on the ground.  It also seeks to strengthen accountability and the links of control around decisions made at policy level and how they are implemented.<\/p><p> I would like to focus on a number of additional areas I would like to see improved and believe will be improved in the coming years.  I make the following suggestions based on my interaction on a number of occasions as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts with the Secretary General of the Department of Health and acting director general of the Health Service Executive.  It strikes me that there are a number of areas worthy of further work and focus, the first of which is how we track and monitor through the systems in use within the Health Service Executive.  During a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts I asked Mr. O'Brien about the level of wages in the HSE, who is doing what, how allowances are allocated and efficiencies within the system.  He made the point that despite its best efforts the HSE still does not have a single system that is capable of tracking the allocation of moneys in the health care system.  In saying this, I am a aware that the caveat in this regard is that many of our hospitals are voluntary hospitals.  In other words, they are not directly run by the State and therefore extension of IT systems in it, as compared with their extension into hospitals run directly by the State, is difficult.  That being said, many of the pay-roll systems currently in operation have been in operation since the previous health board system.  This is despite the fact that the Health Service Executive has been in operation for many years.  As we grapple with the issues of consultant pay and implementation of the new Croke Park agreement, if supported by the unions, greater progress in the aforementioned areas is essential if this type of legislation is to make the difference needed.<\/p><p> Another issue of concern is the role of early intervention teams in dealing with many of the health and quality of life difficulties faced by citizens.  I am particularly aware - I am glad the Minister is in the House as I make the following point - of the role of early intervention teams in the area of speech and language therapy.  Many parents have raised with me the difficulties they are experiencing accessing the services needed for their children.  While their children are in primary schools and are in receipt of support from their teachers, they need further support in terms of diagnosis of their conditions and early intervention in terms of the provision of appropriate care.  The Minister, having been a general practitioner and having experience in this area, will know better than I that the earlier children receive care and support the better the outcome in terms of their quality of life and the opportunity to realise their full potential.  The State also benefits and not only because the children realise the potential their families and we want them to achieve but because this the right way to run our health system and schools.  I urge the Minister - I understand this will be difficult given all of the other issues he is currently managing - to ensure that as money becomes available - I am certain it will through the changes we are making - and our recovery accelerates everything possible is done to prioritise the care of these young children and their families.  I also deal with people on the other side of the coin, namely, the young men and women we have trained in the area of speech and language therapy and who have enormous expertise in terms of diagnosis of the conditions from which children suffer.  These people are currently unable to find employment in this country.<\/p><p> My final point relates to reform.  I agree with Deputy Finian McGrath that there is no politician who does not favour reform.  I have spoken on this issue many times in the past.  In my view, we must reach a point of no more change.  We need to put in a place a system and allow it to bed down and work.  As much as I believe reform is required and will be implemented by Government I believe also that an agenda of continual reform and upheaval for those working in our hospitals is not good.  Staff working in our hospitals, general practitioners, nurses and consultants are entitled to know, following reform, that they will be allowed to work for a reasonable period in that new environment and that further reform will not be sought until such time as there has been a review of how the new system works.<\/p><p>The Minister has worked as a doctor in various parts of the health service and I am certain he knows the value of this.  In the United Kingdom the reform agenda was championed in particular by people such as civil servant Anthony Barber, and Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron have also done work on this.  They always speak about reform and seek to introduce radical change.  When this change is introduced, and fundamental changes have been made with regard to money following the patient, governance and how we want to structure and merge the HSE and the Department of Health, we should let it be for a while to allow our energies and the attention of the Minister and the people working in our hospitals focus on how to make these processes work as opposed to continually looking at how the processes need to change radically.<\/p><p> In a discussion such as this it is vital to acknowledge the big progress made and the new facilities being opened.  A primary care centre will be opened in Grangegorman within a few years.  This is a gigantic change for the people I represent.  I am sure a primary care centre will open in Summerhill in the inner city on a piece of land the late Tony Gregory identified.  This is a colossal change and offers huge opportunities for the people we serve, in the same way the roll-out of the D-Doc service has provided a choice for people in where to go at weekends if they do not want to go to the Mater hospital accident and emergency department because, while their problem is serious, it is not serious enough for a hospital.  D-Doc has given them an option as to where to go and it has made a big difference.  Many of the waiting lists and the number of people on trolleys and awaiting particular operations are reducing due to intervention by the Minister and due to continued work by the people who really care, namely, staff, nurses and doctors.  I look forward to seeing the Bill continuing this work and clarifying the lines of accountability in our health care system to ensure we come up with a system which reflects the aspirations of the people working in it and meets the needs of the people we look to serve.  I am sure the Bill will represent progress on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600015#N01800","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362574200,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the presence of the Minister and I sincerely thank the Technical Group for allowing me time to speak on this important Bill.  Many years ago I started out as a young politician on the old Southern Health Board and I believed in the structures of the board at the time.  I learned many valuable lessons from other board members because, as the Minister remembers, at the time the structure of the board was very different from what exists at present, and consultants and national and local public representatives, who had a wealth of experience, attended the meetings.  I would be neglectful if I did not mention one great friend I had at the time and perhaps the Minister knew him also.  His son, Deputy Sean Sherlock, is a Minister of State.  Joe Sherlock was a man for whom I had tremendous respect and I am sorry he is gone to his eternal reward.  I know he is above in heaven looking down.  He brought passion to health board meetings and fought in a forceful way.  I remember him shaking and trembling when fighting for Mallow Hospital like it was yesterday.  He brought a real sincerity to meetings which I valued and appreciated.<\/p><p>  I had respect for the structures of the board at the time because we had an input into the budget which, as everybody knows, is very important because to influence change one must influence the budget.  I thought the old Southern Health Board was a good model.  Unfortunately, doctors differ and patients die.  The new HSE was brought into being and one of the first things it did in its infinite wisdom was to remove politicians.  I remember thinking at the time this was wrong because I believed politicians brought to meetings their own expertise and local knowledge from dealing with constituents.  They were able to raise important local, national and regional issues.  When we speak about the old health boards we are speaking about regions and we are not being parochial.  I immediately saw a very big problem with the set-up of the new HSE and I was proven right, because after a while it was decided to bring back the politicians.  I was one of these politicians and I immediately saw an awful change in how the structures worked.  We were virtually toothless . We attended meetings, but it was not the same and the new structure did not have the same effect or bite as the old Southern Health Board.  I know the Minister must move on and I appreciate there must be change.  Excellent speeches have been made today on the need for change.  I know in today's world the structure of the old Southern Health Board would not be fit for the practice, but change for the sake of it is not something I welcome.<\/p><p>  I must say something about accountability.  I remember when the Minister was an excellent Opposition spokesperson on health and he attacked and berated the then Minister at every opportunity, which was his right and his job.  He did it very effectively which in turn ensured he was the new Minister for Health.  I must be honest, and the Minister knows that for personal reasons I do not like being critical of him above anybody else on that side of the House-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600017#P00200","speaker":"1049"},{"type":"speech","time":1362574200,"counter":223,"content":"<p>The Deputy is waving the knife around for a long time before sticking it in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600017#P00300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1362574200,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I will be very kind to the Minister but at the same time I must make this point, and I know he cannot disagree with me for making it.  If a Deputy wants to tackle the Minister for Health on an issue by tabling a parliamentary question, he or she receives the response that the Minister has referred the matter to the HSE.  It is maddening and the Minister would agree if he were on this side of the House and wanted to engage with a Minister for Health who was looking at him as though he had four heads and telling him to go away and take up the matter with the HSE.  At the end of the day he is the Minister for Health.  The buck should stop with whoever is the Minister and the Minister knows I am not being personal.  I absolutely hate the idea of a Minister putting up the shutters of the HSE.  It is like a shield with the Minister stating: \"Please, go away, this is not my problem.  I am just the Minister for Health.  You must take your problem up with the HSE.\"  This is absolutely not good enough.  The Minister was very forceful when Mary Harney was the Minister.  I remember him berating her, telling her she was the Minister and that it was her responsibility and she should not hide behind anyone else.  What is he doing now that he is in the role himself?

I will save criticism also for past Ministers who were from parties other the Minster's one.<\/p><p>  It is nationally and internationally recognised that our community hospitals are not just essential, but also vital in delivering health care throughout the country.  The Minister is a lot older than I am, so he can remember when we had Government Ministers who thought it was a good idea to close down our community hospitals.  In the county that I represent, we once had a Minister who thought it was a great idea to close down the hospitals in Kenmare, Killarney, Caherciveen, Skibbereen, Millstreet and a couple of others, at one stroke of a pen.  That Minister thought this would be better for the delivery of health care.  If that had been allowed to happen it would have been one of the most disastrous political decisions ever made.  Thankfully, however, there was a very forceful chairman of the old Southern Health Board at the time.  His name happened to be Jackie Healy-Rae and he laid it on the line to the then Minister that those hospitals would only close over his dead body.  A determined argument was put up against their closure and consequently they were saved.<\/p><p>  The current Minister knows that every Deputy works on a daily basis with community hospitals in their areas.  They know how important they are.  They provide long-stay beds for people who are not fit to enter nursing homes because they need special medical care.  They also offer physiotherapy services and respite care.  In addition, patients in larger hospitals who are not fit to go home can be cared for in step-down facilities in community hospitals.<\/p><p>  I wish to pay a special tribute to the matrons and nurses in those community hospitals who do Trojan work.  I know the Minister would also wish to pay them tribute.  They really work above and beyond the call of duty.  We should realise what it means to be a nurse or other front-line health worker today.  Every day I am contacted by people working in the health service who highlight problems and inadequacies in their workplaces.  They are under great strain and genuine hardship in carrying out their daily work.  It is staggering.  We are dealing with an ageing population which brings added pressures to the system.  <\/p><p>  Younger nurses have their own troubles with high mortgages and husbands who may not be working as they did in the past.  Therefore, they are under strain at home and when they go to work they are under severe strain.  I am no different from other elected representatives who know people in such predicaments personally.  Such people are really feeling the strain, but they keep saying that there is no accountability at the top.  They say that everything is being thrown at them and it is up to them to deliver the service with very limited resources, so they are being put through the mill.  <\/p><p>  I would not be doing my job properly if I did not also highlight the issue of psychiatric services and how the HSE system works in that regard.  A change has been made recently with regard to assisted admissions.  In the past, they were done through the Kerry health services but they must now go through a company in Kildare.  The Minister should think about this matter.  Instead of doing an assisted admission within County Kerry, we are employing a company from Kildare to do the work.  I have nothing against Kildare, they are great people there, but why must we employ people in Kildare to work on assisted admissions in Kerry?  Perhaps the Minister can prove me wrong, but I estimate that it will cost five times as much to carry out an assisted admission through this company rather than doing it locally in Kerry.  The difference however - it is like a three-card trick - is that the cost will not be borne by the Kerry services.  It will be borne nationally by the HSE, so it will not as though the budget for admissions in Kerry is going through the roof, but the exact opposite.  The cost will go down because it is not being charged to Kerry but is being absorbed nationally by the HSE.  This is one of the many examples of changes that are being made but to no good purpose.  It does not make sense to me.  Can the Minister deal with this matter?  I tabled a parliamentary question about it, but I was certainly not happy with the reply I received.  It does not make financial sense and neither does it make for good work practices.<\/p><p>  In every constituency, health staff are being taken out of day centres to fill the required staff levels in hospitals.  This, in effect, is leaving day care centres short staffed.  By their very nature, such centres are assisting predominantly elderly people.  It is a vicious circle, however, because such people are being kept out of community hospitals.  We have always been told that it is better to take care of people's needs at home or as near to home as possible.  That is why our day care services are invaluable.  I work closely with many day care and health centres in County Kerry and I see at first hand the excellent service they provide.  Less than a few hundred metres from where I live there is an Alzheimer's unit which provides an invaluable service to the wider community in my region.  I can see the positive impact that unit has on elderly people in the early stages of Alzheimer's.  I compliment the management and staff who provide great care in all such centres around the country.  <\/p><p>  It is great that the Minister for Health is also a medical doctor because he can appreciate and understand that the patient must come first at all times.  We must recognise, however, that we cannot squeeze any more from health service staff.  One can only squeeze so much and no more.<\/p><p>  In recent months, certain situations have dogged the health system.  One only has to examine the Government's decision to centralise the processing of medical cards.  One may ask what that has to do with the delivery of health care locally, but it does have an effect.  People with medical problems that require treatment want to obtain a medical card, yet they are unable to do so because the connectivity that was there in the past in local regions has been centralised.<\/p><p>There was a brilliant system in place, in which the people who processed the cards were able to deal with community welfare officers and community welfare nurses and could get information about locals.  They were able to work together to ensure the speedy and timely delivery of a medical card.  If this did not happen and if a person could not afford to get his or her health care taken care of because of the delay arising from the Government's centralising of the processing of the cards, it meant the health of the person in question would deteriorate.  What might have been a problem that could have been dealt with in a community hospital would worsen suddenly and the person would be obliged to attend a regional hospital and take up an acute bed.  More than anyone else in this House, the Minister knows the cost of an acute bed in one of the main hospitals.  It costs enormous sums of money and as one wishes to avoid having people lying in trolleys, it again comes down to early intervention, while always remembering that the patients' concerns and health come first.  I acknowledge the Minister appreciates this point.<\/p><p> In the future, the great working relationship with the general practitioners must be continued as by using their common sense at all times, they do their best to get people the care they require while avoiding unnecessary admissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600018#Q00200","speaker":"1049","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362575400,"counter":228,"content":"<p>One minute remains to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600019#R00200","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1362575400,"counter":229,"content":"<p>In that case, I must speed up.  I have seen the health service from both sides because approximately 20 years ago, I was a long-term patient in hospitals and saw the great work that is done on a personal basis.  Until the day I die, I will never be able to say enough good things for the people who were with me at that time.  Accountability starts both at the bottom and the top and everyone must be accountable, including the Minister for Health.  Massive sums of money are being spent on health and if at all possible, to save on the budget, efforts should be made to treat people at home.  This is the reason I told the Taoiseach this morning of my horror that the grants available for disabled and elderly people in County Kerry have been slashed from &euro;3.6 million last year to &euro;1.4 million this year, which is a reduction of 50%.  This may well lead to people who could have stayed at home on foot of the installation of downstairs bedrooms and bathrooms ending up by taking up room in a community hospital.  Good oversight and good governance are important.  I also compliment the SouthDoc service on its excellent work in my region, as well as all the other networks that perform similar functions throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600019#R00300","speaker":"1049"},{"type":"speech","time":1362575400,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy, that is grand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600019#R00400","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1362575400,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I wish the Minister well and welcome the fact he will join me in opening a new hospital in Kenmare in the near future and next year, a new 40-bed unit for psychiatric services in Killarney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600019#R00500","speaker":"1049"},{"type":"speech","time":1362575400,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I understand Deputy Penrose is sharing time with Deputy Nolan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600019#R00600","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1362575400,"counter":233,"content":"<p>Yes, I am sharing my time with  Deputy Nolan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600019#R00700","speaker":"1063"},{"type":"speech","time":1362575400,"counter":234,"content":"<p>The Deputies will have ten minutes each.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600019#R00800","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1362575400,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute today to this important debate on the Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill 2012.  I am glad the Minister is present in the Chamber, as it shows the importance he attaches to trying to sort out this problem in a forward way.<\/p><p>  Were I sitting in the Minister's seat today and taking account of the Government's efforts to set out a clear vision for the future of the health services and the fundamental and extremely important objective of ensuring greater accountability by the HSE to the Minister directly as Minister for Health and to his successors, I straight away would abolish and dissolve not just the board of the HSE.  I would put in place a new streamlined governance structure, which basically would comprise directorates or heads, as the Minister has pointed out.  I would abolish them straight away and would not have any interim steps, as I have good reason to have no confidence  in the structure that has evolved and emerged since 2004, when the old health board structures were abolished.  Many Members expressed their fears of what might emerge when this out-of-control bureaucratic labyrinthine structure was set in place and it gives me no pleasure to state their worst fears have been and are being confirmed.  In effect, this was a pyramid of bureaucracy with well-paid managers put in place, all of whom were located well away from the local management sites in which they should have been placed, being based in Dublin, Naas or wherever.  However, this structure was built in a pyramidal fashion upon the old health board management structure and, worst of all, effectively removed all decision-making functions and abilities from the local managers and administrators who always were best placed with intimate and detailed knowledge and who held the most ability to make critical and ongoing decisions at the level of the coalface, that is, right at the counter, face-to-face with the user or the customer of the service.  Moreover, these decisions always were decisive and quick and notwithstanding the fact that one may not always have concurred with or liked all those decisions, nevertheless in general they were correct and one must acknowledge that.  I reiterate they were decisive and correct and dealt with the problem there and then.<\/p><p>  This clearly was the position during my almost 30 years of experience as a public representative when dealing with senior health board management officials in Longford, Mullingar or Tullamore.  One had people who were familiar with the problems, backgrounds and circumstances, be they financial or relating to the health of a person involved, as well as the nature or degree of the emergency at issue.  I pay tribute to these people, who epitomised everything one expects in public servants.  They provided a top-class, efficient and effective public service.  Moreover, it always was given with a smile, even if the decisions may well have been ones other than what the person who sought their help desired.  I refer to people like the late Tommy O'Hara, a superb administrator with the Midland Health Board based in Mullingar.  Similarly, Dorrie Mangan, Dick Stokes, Donie Murtagh, Derry O'Dwyer and Finbar Murphy - I could go on and on - all were extraordinary individuals who made thousands of decisions over the years in a highly efficient, productive, thoughtful and caring way, reflecting all that is good in respect of the ethos of public service and public servants.  Moreover, they were aided and abetted by great assistance from their staff from the clerical officers right up through the ranks.  However, I will cite an example of what the HSE then did in one area to which I also heard Deputy Healy Ray refer earlier, that is, the General Medical Services, GMS, and medical cards.  The HSE took the processing away from this efficient form of local administration and centralised it at a post office address in Finglas - clearly removed from the people they needed to serve - thereby showing a disdainful disregard and disrespect for the people affected.  This clearly was a retrograde step, which did not involve significant savings and which epitomised and encapsulates the reason the HSE has lost the confidence of the people and the broad mass of public representatives who come into contact with it.<\/p><p>  In another example, people come to Members' clinics with various health issues, such as the need for urgent operations, dental or orthodontic issues in respect of young children, outcrops and everything else, schoolchildren under 14 years of age with significant dental problems and a host of other personal issues.  If one raises such issues in the D&aacute;il via parliamentary question, the Minister will reply to the effect it is a matter for the parliamentary division of the HSE to deal with and the Minister will refer it on.  It is sent to the HSE, where it disappears into a black hole from which it may never emerge.  Even if it does, the people may have borrowed money from the credit union - if they can get it now, given the new restrictions on them and on other financial institutions - or wherever and have the procedure carried out or they may have died in the interim.  What kind of service is that?<\/p><p>  In the good old days of the health boards, for all of their reputed faults and I agree it was necessary to have them upgraded, refurbished and brought into the modern era, they nevertheless still were highly efficient.  One would have a reply within the week and could advise one's constituents accordingly.  I would abolish this monster today and revert back to a system with an upgraded or modernised health board structure, which at least would have a local input and which would listen.  What is wrong with politicians having an input, as well as various representatives of professional organisations and the staff?  This is the way it was and in effect, Members had a representative role.  People did not talk down to one, lecture one or make one feel like nobody.  Above all, they had respect for one as a public representative.  I have a sheaf of letters I could show the Minister that I sent to senior managers in the HSE, none of which were afforded the courtesy of a reply.  I believe the biggest issue they had was wondering how I had got such accurate information.<\/p><p>The Minister expects me on behalf of the constituents of Longford-Westmeath, whom I am proud to represent, to have any faith in this body.  I have none whatsoever when I am treated in such a disrespectful fashion.  I always personally reply to people who make the effort to contact me.  It is a fundamental precept of courtesy and respect even if I disagree fundamentally with them.<\/p><p> How could I have confidence in a structure that so blatantly colluded in depriving MRH Mullingar, one of the top three hospitals in the country for the past decade in efficiency, effectiveness, throughput, output and outcomes, of its rightful share of funding and which engaged in spirting it off to other hospitals.  The executive is implementing a policy that is contrary to what the Minister has advocated - I have heard him say so at Cabinet - which is that the money will follow the patient where there is a clear and demonstrable increase in activity, effectiveness, quality, treatment and outputs.  These parameters have all not only been achieved, but clearly exceeded in MRH Mullingar, which the Minister has acknowledged on radio and television, and that is why I have no belief in the HSE and I will continue to defy the Minister, no matter the intent of sections 5 and 6 and other amendments concerning the relationship between the HSE and the Minister and his successors.  I wish him well in his ambition and I acknowledge he has put a great deal of thought into this.  He will have my support to make HSE officials accountable, to make sure they reply to Members and to make sure the money follows the patients.  That is the Minister's concept and that is what officials should ensure but I can give him examples where they do not do this and they refuse to reply.  He will be aware of one or two examples.  I do not spare the rod but I believe in being truthful; they do not.  That is why I have no time for them.<\/p><p> The budget for MRH Mullingar was supposed to be &euro;58 million in 2012 and the administrators spent &euro;59 million.  The budget has been reduced by another 4.4%, which means the number of people looked after has been reduced by more than 50.  The hospital has lost 70 nurses with only 19 replaced, which means a net loss of 51.  We have done our job.  The accident and emergency department has experienced a 50% increase in clients, with people travelling from Roscommon, Leitrim and other areas.  The acuteness of patients' conditions is also higher.  Why did the HSE not give the hospital an additional allocation as it copes with a significant additional intake of such patients to ensure they are afforded the appropriate treatment they deserve?  If the executive gave the hospital the amount it deserves, if only to provide limited accommodation for patients from outside its catchment area, there would not have been an overrun of &euro;1 million in 2012.  The overrun was clearly related to looking after people from other areas.  It is clear from any objective analysis that the hospital was punished for being efficient whereas the opposite should have been the case.<\/p><p> This is why I look forward to the new hospital groups the Minister will announce shortly, which will see our excellent hospital grouped with the Mater hospital and St. Vincent's hospital in Dublin, two excellent hospitals.  This is a clear recognition that MRH Mullingar will be the top hospital in north Leinster.  If the Minister gives us a few additional resources, a major rehabilitation centre and approximately &euro;30 million, which is required for new theatres and to refurbish current theatres, the excellent staff from consultants, doctors, nurses, paramedics to attendants will not let him down.  They will deliver the next phase of the health reform programme he has planned in a positive and proactive way and we will play a constructive role in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600019#R00900","speaker":"1063","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362576000,"counter":237,"content":"<p>Previous contributions, including the passionate contribution from Deputy Penrose, highlight that HSE is a damaged brand lacking credibility in which people have little faith.  I do not say the organisation's staff are branded with that because anybody I talk to who has dealt with the health services speak highly of the staff they deal with.  However, the organisation's bureaucratic structure, the way people interact with it and the way it operates infuriates people and is causing severe problems and issues for people across the country.  That is why I welcome the Bill, which is a step in the right direction.<\/p><p>  The Bill intends to be a step on the way to the UHI model.  Of all the priorities in the programme for Government, our desire, intention and plan to introduce UHI and to finally take economics, ability to pay and personal circumstances out of access to health care is one of the reasons I support the Government so strongly.  Anybody, regardless of their background or circumstances, will never have to worry about money in their pocket when accessing health care.  If we achieve that during this term in government, we will have achieved something monumental.  It is one of the issues on which I am particularly proud to support the Government.<\/p><p>  There are a number of problems with the structure of the HSE, which were alluded to more eloquently by Deputy Penrose, but the accountability of expenditure is crucial.  Earlier, I had a discussion with an official in HSE west about allocations for disability services.  It is my understanding that a pot of money has been allocated for disability services nationally and the reduction of 1.2% in the allocation negotiated nationally is working its way down.  However, the budget, as it has been allocated, is being interpreted differently in various HSE regions so much so that I still do not have a figure for the cutback in HSE west and it may differ from the percentage negotiated nationally.  The concept of directorates, whereby the money will be disbursed to a single directorate and would mean, for example, the disability budget would go to the disability directorate, which would allocate and monitor the money to ensure value for money, is welcome.  The HSE was a fake corporate veil.  It was used to give the Minister the opportunity to say, &quot;That is not my problem.  That is for the HSE&quot;.  It created an artificial wall between those responsible for the health service, which are public representatives and the Government, and the corporate entity at whose door we could lay accountability.  That needs to change and this legislation is acknowledged by the Minister and his Department as a step along the way to the abolition of the HSE, which I welcome.<\/p><p>  I refer to a positive development in the health service, for which I would like to give the Minister credit because he gets many knocks.  He deserves credit for the way in which the health service in Galway has been transformed positively as part of the Galway and Roscommon hospital group. The new chief executive, Bill Maher, who came from St. Vincent's hospital, Dublin, and Tony Canavan, whom I know in Galway, are working hard to change the entire management concept of how the hospitals are run.  They have a network of four hospitals Galway University Hospital, GUH, including Merlin Park, Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe and Roscommon County Hospital and rather than saying every hospital has to provide every service, they have said GUH will be the acute centre, Merlin Park, the step down centre and the other two hospitals will be responsible for other functions.  They are using their resources cleverly and properly, which is something we have not experienced previously.  They are also introducing concepts, which anybody working in the private sector or cutting edge public service bodies knows should have been introduced a long time ago, such as key performance indicators, management plans, target and clinical director meetings where people administrating the service sit down with the staff and put plans together and follow through on them.<\/p><p>  The people who are most impressed and heartened by this are the staff because they have worked for so long in a leaderless environment.  To the shame of the previous Government, it was often said that GUH was the worst run hospital in the State but it is turning this perception around because it is putting in place a proper management plan and examining how it implements initiatives.  The Government is only two years old but some of the changes that have been introduced in a short period have meant that, despite a massive increase in accident and emergency department activity - GUH has the second busiest such department in the State - trolley waiting times have reduced significantly.

It goes without saying that no Minister would choose the appalling financial position in which I have had to operate.  In that context, the legacy the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government bequeathed to me was a series of expenditure ceilings for the justice sector which, if applied, would have resulted in devastating cuts in Garda services which I, as Minister, would not and could not stand over.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Fianna F&aacute;il national recovery plan of November 2010 was unacceptable and would certainly have put the Garda Commissioner in an impossible position.  Fortunately, I was able to secure additional funding over the three year period, from 2012 to 2014, to ensure the Garda Commissioner and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could continue to deliver an effective policing service.  Specifically, I secured &#8364;2.243 billion for the justice sector for 2012, which was &#8364;118 million more than had been allocated by Fianna F&aacute;il.  For 2013, I secured funding of &#8364;2.2 billion, which was &#8364;191 million more than the Fianna F&aacute;il allocation.  For 2014, I secured &#8364;2.065 billion, which was &#8364;105 million more than the original Fianna F&aacute;il allocation.  Overall, had I not obtained this additional finance, the Garda would have stood to lose an average of &#8364;90 million each year under the Fianna F&aacute;il plan for the years 2012 to 2014.<\/p><p><br \/>  In 2013, the Garda financial allocation, which in gross terms amounts to more than &#8364;1.4 billion, is a substantial amount.  I assure the Deputy and House that this allocation will be spent in the most effective way with the emphasis on the delivery of front-line services.  In that general context, a budget of &#8364;5 million has been made available in 2013 for the purchase of additional Garda vehicles.  The modernisation of the Garda fleet is a crucial part of supporting policing operations throughout the State.<\/p><p><b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b>Garda numbers have been reducing owing to the moratorium on recruitment introduced by the previous Government and the current strength is just under 13,400.

This was the opportunity for the associations to raise issues of concern and put their point of view on how best savings could be achieved in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I understand that anything that impacts on the pay and-or conditions of their members is a matter of grave concern for the GRA, AGSI and every member of the force, but that is the case for all unions and associations.  It would have been far better if both associations had stayed at the table, talked through these options and engaged in the process of negotiation.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is not the case, as has been suggested, that the associations were in some way excluded from real negotiations.  It is true they are not trade unions and are not, therefore, represented by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  While this means there must be parallel negotiations with the associations, it does not make, nor would it have made, such negotiations any less real, and they have not been any less real in the past.  Exactly the same position applied to the Defence Forces associations and they concluded a deal with their management counterparts which was facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission.  Parallel negotiations were also conducted with the Prison Officers Association, even though they are represented by congress, because of the unique issues which arise in the Prison Service.  No one is saying the prison officers were disadvantaged by such sectoral talks or that the Prison Officers Association was not serving the best interests of its members by remaining engaged in the talks.<\/p><p><br \/>  The GRA and AGSI chose to leave this process.

At an individual level, there have been pay reductions, and for the force in general there are constraints on its budget.  I fully understand how difficult this is at an individual and operational level and I earnestly wish things were different.  The Government's aim in engaging in the negotiations was to achieve the necessary &#8364;1 billion in savings in the public sector payroll, to try to protect the basic pay of public servants at the lower end of the scale and to ensure an equitable contribution from all.

The plan contained the Commissioner's proposals for the continued re-organisation and consolidation of the Garda station network.  It is, of course, a matter for the Commissioner to put the necessary policing measures in place to take account of the closure of Garda stations.<\/p><p><br \/>  In that context, the Garda authorities have indicated that, where stations have been closed in 2013, a comprehensive set of revised structures has been put in place.  In particular, the Garda authorities have emphasised that the force is continuing to support the relevant communities through the clustering of services at policing hubs.  This centralisation has facilitated the introduction of enhanced patrolling arrangements that, in turn, provide increased Garda visibility as well as maintaining existing links with communities, both rural and urban.  The objective is to ensure that the best possible policing service will be made available to our communities.  I should add that the closures yielded the freeing up of over 160 Garda members in 2012 for operational policing duties.  Moreover, the Garda authorities have indicated that the consolidation measures for 2013 will result in an extra 61,000 Garda patrol hours.  The overall result is that a very wide range of measures have been implemented to take account of the closure of stations and I am confident that, arising from the consolidation process which is taking place, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to provide a professional, efficient and effective service to communities throughout the country.<\/p><p><br \/>  With regard to the provision and deployment of Garda vehicles, the Deputy will appreciate that decisions in these areas are a matter for the Garda Commissioner in the context of his identified operational demands and in the light of available resources.  In that regard, the Deputy may be aware that currently the Garda authorities are rolling out a supply of 170 new vehicles, which have been procured by means of an additional allocation of &#8364;3 million that I made available in 2012.  These vehicles are being deployed on the basis of operational needs, including the revised policing arrangements for areas.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, I am advised by the Garda authorities that the financial provision of &#8364;5 million in the Garda budget for the purchase and fit-out of Garda transport in 2013 will enable the Garda to obtain a significant number of new vehicles.  Arrangements are being made to place the order for the new vehicles, which the Deputy can be assured will be deployed as effectively as possible in line with the Garda's operational requirements.<\/p><p><br \/>  This represents a considerable financial investment in Garda transport, particularly at a time when the level of funding available across the public sector is severely limited.

I have no hand, act or part in that determination and the Deputy is well aware of that.  I cannot comment on what it is reported some UN rapporteur has said, given the manner in which it is quoted by the Deputy.  However, in so far as anyone has reached a conclusion that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is not independent, he or she has clearly not read the legislation and does not know the manner in which the commission operates.  Clearly, it would be completely inappropriate if I, as Minister, was in a position to interfere in any investigation that it undertakes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600024#X00200","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1362578400,"counter":319,"content":"<p>The time has run out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600024#X00300","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1362578400,"counter":320,"content":"<p>If I may respond ---<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600024#X00400","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1362578400,"counter":321,"content":"<p>We are out of time.

The Act provides that an applicant for criminal legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his or her means are insufficient to enable him or her to pay for legal representation him or herself.  The Court must also be satisfied that by reason of the gravity of the charge or exceptional circumstances, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  The constitutional right to legal aid was established in 1976 in the Healy<i> v. <\/i>Donoghue case.  In addition, Article 6(3)(c) of the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend him or herself in person or through legal assistance of his or her own choosing or, if he or she has insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.<\/p><p><br \/>  A new criminal legal aid Bill is planned to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Consideration is being given to including in the Bill provisions to, <i>inter alia<\/i>, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, allow the board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute cases of abuse.  Provision to give power to the Legal Aid Board to recover the costs of criminal legal aid or to make application to a court to revoke a criminal legal aid certificate are also under consideration.  These provisions must have regard to a person's rights to the presumption of innocence, to a fair trial and to be given legal aid, where appropriate.  I hope it will be possible to publish the Bill during the course of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600024#X00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1362578400,"counter":326,"content":"<p>As we are no longer dealing with Priority Questions, I remind Deputies that there is a one minute limit in respect of supplementary questions and replies to same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600024#X00800","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1362578400,"counter":327,"content":"<p>We would all agree with what the Minister has just said in terms of people being entitled to the presumption of innocence and to a fair trial.  That is a cornerstone of our criminal justice system.  However, an issue which arises time and again and which grates with the public, as the Minister is well aware, is that of serial re-offenders who are availing of the free legal aid system.  The point is regularly made that these people make no contribution whatsoever.  Perhaps that is a failure of the means test within the system.  It has been pointed out by the public, quite rightly, that the local property tax can be collected directly by the Revenue Commissioners.  Revenue can access people's employers or their bank accounts to collect the property tax but, at the same time, the recovery of money for the subscription towards free legal aid does not seem to be possible.  This issue must be addressed because the wider public is hugely concerned about this.<\/p><p>  When does the Minister hope to introduce the proposed legislation?

This is based on the assumption that they each only received &euro;100,000 although I presume some would have received more than that sum.  In the context of the promised legislation, will the Minister look at the costs associated with the free legal aid scheme?

The effect of that was that considerable savings were made last year.  The outturn for 2012, which is to be finally confirmed, was that the cost of the legal aid scheme fell to &euro;50 million, representing a saving of some &euro;6 million over the preceding year.  I would stress that this is a tentative figure.  I will have the definitive figure very shortly and will forward it to the Deputy then.<\/p><p>  The reality is that under Irish Statute, our Constitution and the European Convention, people have a right to legal aid and a right to be represented in circumstances where they cannot afford to pay their own legal fees.

Its key task is to ensure the delivery of a well-co-ordinated whole-of-government response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence against women and men.  Cosc was established in June 2007 and was given a remit to address these forms of violence from a cross-Government perspective rather than from a purely criminal-justice perspective.<\/p><p><br \/>  Cosc carries out its co-ordination functions primarily within the framework of the first national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  The strategy was published in March 2010 and covers the period 2010 to 2014.  The strategy incorporates the specific tasks assigned to Cosc.<\/p><p><br \/>  The four high-level goals of the strategy are to promote a culture of prevention and recognition through increased understanding of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence; to deliver an effective and consistent service to those affected; to ensure greater effectiveness of policy and service planning; and to ensure efficient and effective implementation of the strategy.  The high-level goals cascade down into 59 detailed on-the-ground activities.  Progress indicators and structures for implementation are also set out in the strategy. <\/p><p><br \/>  Cosc consulted a broad range of stakeholders in the State and voluntary sectors to develop the strategy and is now driving its implementation.  Consultation continues to form a major element in implementation.  This is done through the medium of the national steering committee on violence against women and the national steering committee on violence against men.  The steering committees are made up of representatives of the principal non-governmental organisations which provide direct support services to those women and men affected by these forms of violence and the State organisations with responsibilities under the strategy, which provide front-line services to victims of such violence.  Bilateral meetings are also held with these organisations and with other regional groups.  Cosc maintains a website containing comprehensive information, including the composition of the committees.<\/p><p><br \/>  Monitoring of the implementation of the strategy is achieved through a high-level group of officials chaired by the Secretary General of my Department.  The group, known as the strategy oversight committee, is composed of senior officials from the Departments and national agencies with responsibilities for actions under the strategy.  At present, it includes representatives from the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Health Service Executive and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on floor of the House.<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  Cosc reports to the oversight committee twice per year.  The report is compiled by Cosc from updates on each action provided by the lead body with responsibility for the action.

Five reports have so far been published on the Cosc website for the period up to the end of June 2012.  A sixth report is being finalised for the period to the end of last year.  In addition, a mid-term review of the implementation of the strategy was completed in 2012 and published on the Cosc website following consideration by the national steering committees and the oversight committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600026#Z00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1362579600,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I, along with many Deputies, attended last year a very moving presentation from SAFE Ireland, the umbrella group for domestic violence centres and groups.

That model works and we should consider it for the Fermanagh-Cavan region or Tyrone-Derry-Donegal, where the community could be involved while being reassured at the same time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600027#AA00400","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speech","time":1362580200,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I support any co-operative structure that might provide added value and facilitate co-operation in policing matters between North and South.

Fixed charge notices are provided for under the Road Traffic Act 2002 and are an alternative to prosecution.  They give a motorist the opportunity to acknowledge the offence, pay the fixed charge and, where the offence is a penalty point offence, incur the appropriate penalty points.  While the issuing of a fixed charge notice does not constitute commencement of legal proceedings, it normally leads to a prosecution if the fixed charge is not paid.<\/p><p>  There can be circumstances, however, where the fixed charge notice may be cancelled, in accordance with Garda procedures drawn up in the light of legislative exemptions and prosecutorial guidelines.  Cancellation occurs where it is believed the evidence would not sustain a prosecution or a prosecution would not be appropriate, fair or proportionate.  The procedures provide authority to district officers, or inspectors acting as district officers, and an inspector in the fixed charge processing office to cancel fixed charge notices. <\/p><p>  Cancellation can occur in circumstances where, for example, exemptions apply for emergency vehicles or the wearing of seatbelts, or where there are evidential difficulties, such as where the registration number registered by a speed camera does not correspond to the vehicle in question, or where there are emergency medical circumstances such as, for example, a sick child being driven to hospital, an imminent birth, or a medical professional rushing to a sick or elderly patient.  Access to cancel a fixed charge notice through PULSE is restricted to users with the rank of inspector or higher.<\/p><p>  The examination directed by the Commissioner into the allegations concerning the cancellation of fixed charge notices is continuing and I expect a report on the findings shortly.  I have received an interim report from the Commissioner, but I will not be making any further comment on any of the allegations until the final report is available.  It would be premature and wrong to assume that all of these cancellations of fixed charge notices were inappropriate, or that money has been lost to the Exchequer as a consequence.  Equally, it is premature for calls to be made for a statutory inquiry into these matters.  Let us await the final report on this matter, which I understand from the Garda Commissioner is nearing completion and I expect to receive in two weeks time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600027#AA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1362580200,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for that reply.

Less than half an hour ago, Members from across the House, including Deputy Mac Lochlainn, criticised me, as they are entitled to do, as being in some way responsible for what is reported to be the low morale in the Garda force.  The Members who want to talk about low morale in the force on one issue are then persistently making allegations against members of the force, that they do not properly conduct themselves, they are basically a law unto themselves and they are making decisions that they should not be making.<\/p><p>  The penalty point issue is a case in point.

While the situation has somewhat eased in the past number of years, it is still unacceptable that so many are killed or injured on the roads every year.  There are many reasons for this and now is not the time to delve into that discussion.<\/p><p>  I bring the attention of the House to one aspect of road safety that simply must be further legislated for.  According to a recent report by the Transport Research Laboratory, there are concerns over the quality of windscreen replacements in this country.  In all the replacements that have taken place in the past year, 35% of them were found to have a safety or quality issue and 14% were found to have serious signs of safety issues.  While I do not want to over-dramatise the position here today, it is important.<\/p><p>  The windscreen of a car now accounts for up to 30% of its structural integrity and it prevents the roof from collapsing if the car rolls over.  Also, once the airbag has been activated, it relies on the support from the windscreen in order to make it work properly.  A windscreen that is fitted properly is, therefore, crucial to the overall safety of the occupants of the car and an incorrectly fitted one could significantly increase the potential for serious injury or worse in the event of an accident.<\/p><p>  In addition, windscreens are becoming increasingly complex as car manufacturers have over the years added electronics to their construction, as well as tinting and curving them more than ever before.  The industry is producing ever more complex windscreens and we must be able to trust the appropriate company to replace them properly.<\/p><p>  However, little or no regulation exists in this area, one which is crucial to road safety.  I might add that this is not peculiar to Ireland.  It also is the case in other countries.<\/p><p>  It has been highlight at the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, of which I am a member, that there is another worry associated with this industry, that is, the practice of steering.<\/p><p>Many insurance companies now offer policies that give free windscreen replacement to those who take out motor insurance with them.  As policyholders with certain insurance companies, we are steered towards a particular windscreen company for a replacement.  In order for a windscreen company to get that business, standards are often cut and shortcuts taken.  These insurance companies are trying to keep their costs down and so in order to get one of the lucrative contracts windscreen-replacement companies can be tempted to cut their costs by using inferior materials and shoddy work practices, leading in turn to a poor quality service.<\/p><p> Consumers are entitled to have any component replaced or repaired so that the vehicle is as good as it was before an accident.  This is not helped by the lack of proper regulation governing this industry.  Most people are unaware of the lack of standards in the industry, and may be driving a vehicle with a windscreen that is defective and may render the airbag useless.<\/p><p> I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.  I do not wish to overdramatise the situation but it is important.  I had my windscreen replaced approximately four weeks ago and I was completely unaware that one should go to a reputable company.  I did not realise the windscreen was so important to the overall safety of the car.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600028#BB02000","speaker":"964","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362581400,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Ann Phelan for raising this important issue.  I know it is of concern to her as she has spoken to me about it privately.<\/p><p>  The poor fitting of replacement vehicle windscreens is currently a consumer affairs matter relating to the delivery of a service, for which the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has no functional responsibility.  However, if there are apparent flaws in the manner in which replacement windscreens are fitted, I believe the issue would best be addressed by agreement among all interested parties to improved training standards for windscreen replacement and by adopting an industry-wide operational code of practice, which I believe the Deputy would welcome.  Such agreement would necessitate a combined collaborative approach between the windscreen-replacement industry, vehicle manufactures and insurers within the Irish market in coming together to agree standards and the sanctioning of the installation of replacement vehicle windscreens by reputable well-trained windscreen replacement technicians only.<\/p><p>  With regard to legislative provisions relating to the service and-or repair of a vehicle, I am advised that at present there is no specific legislation governing windscreen repair and fitting companies, individuals or indeed the standard of workmanship for fitting or repair of windscreens.  However, there are regulations regarding the quality and fitness for purpose of a vehicle and of a vehicle component, and the standard of a service provided or performed in respect of a vehicle or of a vehicle component.  For example, the Sale of Goods Act 1893, as amended, provides that a good, which would include a windscreen, sold in the course of business must be of merchantable quality and must be reasonably fit for the purpose for which it was intended and that a service, including a service or the repair of a vehicle, is subject to four requirements.  These include that the supplier has the necessary skill to render the service; the person supplying the service will do so with due skill, care and diligence; where materials are used, they will be sound and reasonably fit for the purpose for which they are required; and where goods are supplied under the contract, they will be of merchantable quality.<\/p><p>  The Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963, SI 190 of 1963, as amended, requires windscreens to be made from a suitable material that is clear, stable and will not splinter if fractured and that is either safety or laminated glass.  Additionally, the European Communities (Road Vehicles: Entry into Service) Regulations 2009 require replacement windscreens for European approved vehicles to be of the same standard and specification as the original windscreen fitted when the vehicle was manufactured.  Compliance with this legislation is checked at the vehicle's periodic roadworthiness test when the windscreen is inspected to ensure that it is labelled with specific safety and approval markings.  The windscreen is also visually checked to ensure that it is not damaged and is secure.<\/p><p>  Poor quality fitting of replacement windscreens, as highlighted by the Transport Research Laboratory's report, which had been commissioned by Autoglass, was brought to the attention of the RSA which has responsibility for vehicle standards policy.  After reviewing the report the RSA agreed that a correctly bonded windscreen plays an important role in the strength of a car in the event of a collision.  Correctly fitted and bonded windscreens may also play a role in the correct deployment of passenger side airbags.<\/p><p>  I understand that after reviewing the report the RSA engaged with the Garda national traffic bureau which advised it was not aware of any instances of ill-fitting windscreens being responsible for fatal or serious injury caused to any person in any collision.  The RSA also engaged with the Irish Insurance Federation which forwarded the report to motor damage claims specialists in a number of its member companies for comment.  The IIF indicated that should Autoglass conduct further research disclosing safety and standards issues, it would be happy to work through the IIF and others to address them.<\/p><p>  The RSA concluded from the information contained in the TRL report that it appears that not all windscreen replacers are following the correct procedures and workmanship when fitting windscreens resulting in possible safety implications and value-for-money considerations for vehicle owners.  RSA engineers reviewed the fitting process of a replacement windscreen and agree that in order to ensure a good bond is achieved between the windscreen and the vehicle a prescribed series of steps must be followed utilising manufacturers recommended adhesives and curing times.  As with many other vehicle repairs, a certain level of training, competence and quality assurance is required to ensure that individuals carrying out such work do it correctly to an appropriate standard and to manufacturers' specifications.<\/p><p>  In order to improve the standard of workmanship in the windscreen replacement industry it is suggested that the industry engages with insurance companies, the Society of the Irish Motor Industry and vehicle manufacturers to agree on standards, training, quality control and codes of practice that should be used when repairing or replacing windscreens.  This approach of upskilling and training of windscreen fitters, combined with agreement from the insurance companies that only suitably trained individuals can carry out work on their behalf, will drive improvements in the standard of workmanship in this important area of vehicle safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600029#CC00200","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1362581400,"counter":407,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600029#CC00300","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1362581400,"counter":408,"content":"<p>Both the Department and the RSA would welcome such developments and in general support any efforts that will improve the standard of the national fleet including upskilling and training of those involved in the maintenance and repair of vehicles in the national fleet.

We know the plan for community-oriented multidisciplinary mental-health teams that will allow people to access treatment without hospitalisation, but it is not moving as efficiently as it should.  Apart from the human advantages, there are also significant economic advantages.  The money for mental health services has not always gone into mental health services, where we know it is needed.<\/p><p>There is a need for a system that would track the activities of community-based mental health services and funding.  I draw the attention of the House to the report, published on 1 February, of the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Mr. Juan Mendez, which looks at abuses in health care settings that may cross the threshold of mistreatment and be a form of torture or cruel and degrading treatment.  In looking at mental health legislation within the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Mr. Mendez established that community living with support is no longer a favourable policy development but an internationally recognised right.  <\/p><p> Community mental health services are not an established right in Ireland.  While this was first proposed in 1984 and again in A Vision for Change in 2006, we are still awaiting the move from residential and institutional care to community care.  While the policy in this regard has been in place for more than 30 years, it has not been the practice.  I support the call by Amnesty International for legislation in this area to provide that health authorities are duty-bound to account for and ultimately deliver community mental health services.  Mr. Mendez also calls in his report for legal provisions to be revised, which provisions currently permit detention on mental health grounds in mental health facilities and allow coercive interventions and treatments in mental health settings, without the free and informed consent of the person concerned.  The report also calls for a ban on forced and non-consensual medical interventions for persons with disabilities, be that psycho-surgery, electric shock treatment, mind altering drugs, restraint or solitary confinement.  I would like to know where we stand on these matters.<\/p><p> Another issue of concern is the status of the appointment of the director for mental health services and whether that person will have budgetary control and an implementation plan for delivery of A Vision for Change.  I have previously tabled parliamentary questions to the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, on staffing issues.  Between March 2009 and December 2012, there was a 12.1% decrease in staff numbers in mental health services.  We do not want a recurrence in 2013 of the delays which occurred in 2012.  There must be visible accounting in terms of what is happening in terms of funding and staffing for mental health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600029#CC00900","speaker":"1005","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362582000,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I apologise on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, for their not being in the House to respond to this important issue raised by Deputy O'Sullivan.<\/p><p>  In line with the agreed programme for Government, the Government has prioritised the reform of our mental health services and is committed in particular to the delivery of more and better quality care in the community, as envisaged in A Vision for Change.  Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the 1984 document, which I recall because I was a student at that time and did a special report on it.  That report focused on the move to a community model.  I recall distinctly well the context of the report at that stage.  Implementation of the recommendations of the report has been slower than originally expected owing to a number of factors, including the changed economic context, constraints on public expenditure and the moratorium on recruitment.  However, with regard to residential services, a great deal of progress has been made with the accelerated closure of old psychiatric hospitals and their replacement with bespoke new facilities such as the Phoenix Care Centre which was recently opened in St. Brendan's, Grangegorman.  Beyond new capital developments, progress also encompasses shorter episodes of inpatient care and involvement of users in all relevant aspects of mental health policy and services.  One of the most fundamental changes in recent years, as the Deputy will be aware, has been that people within the mental health service now have advocates who argue for their requirements, in terms of services, locally.  This is happening across mental health service provision in this country and has given an additional voice to people who need help.<\/p><p>  A Vision for Change recommended that a modern mental health service is best delivered in the community.  The Deputy will be aware that a special allocation of &euro;35 million was provided in 2012 for mental health services to strengthen community mental health teams in adult and children's mental health services; provide an additional 414 full-time posts to enhance suicide prevention measures; initiate psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems; and advance relocation of mental health service users from institutional care to independent living arrangements.  Full utilisation of the 2012 funding, together with a further &euro;35 million for the new service put in place for 2013, represents an extra &euro;70 million, with more than 800 associated mental health posts to improve and reform services.  Recruitment of 307 of the additional 410 posts approved in 2012 has been completed.  The HSE aims to fill the remaining posts by end March 2013.  I hope to be able to report progress in this regard over the next few weeks.  <\/p><p>  Under the national implementation framework for the National Housing Strategy 2011-2016 for people with a disability and mental health issues, initial funding of &euro;1 million has been made available by the Department to support the commencement in 2013 of the transitioning of people from existing settings to independent mainstream options.  The renewed investment in mental health also facilitates the full implementation of the clinical programmes in this area and will drive service delivery and consistency, with a major emphasis on early intervention and improved collaborations within the primary care system to ensure the provision of a 21st century mental health service in Ireland.  Ireland has a strong human rights record.  The protection of such rights is central to our domestic and foreign policies.  The practical fulfilment of this objective is of paramount importance, including proper reflection in evolving policies and settings across a wide range of our health and personal social services.  <\/p><p>  Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the most recent report of the Special Rapporteur, Mr. Mendez.  There are significant findings in that report in terms of the setting that is now chosen for the majority of people in this country with mental health issues.  I understand that the Department is studying the report in detail and will issue its considered view on it in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600030#DD00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1362582000,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I take heart from the fact that the Department is studying Mr. Mendez's report and will issue its findings on it.  It is, however, difficult to accept much of what the Minister of State had to say about budget cuts and the moratorium on recruitment given the issue of mental health has not suddenly appeared on our agenda.  This issue has not been a priority for any of the parties, including Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party, in Government since 1984, although it has become a priority in recent times.<\/p><p>  What was promised in 2012 did not materialise.  The fear in the mental health setting is that the same will happen in 2013.  The point that must be made is that political will alone has not worked when it comes to the provision of mental health services.  A different approach is now needed, which could be provided by way of enactment of legislation to provide that the HSE is obliged to account for progress in this area and for the production of regular transparent reports in this regard, including to this House.  It is important also there is development of mental health services for people with an intellectual disability.  I ask that these proposals be taken on board.  As they are included in the report, I presume the HSE will respond to them.<\/p><p>  Spending on community mental health has been static at 27%.  Spending on residential care has been consistently 58%.  I acknowledge the opening of the Phoenix Care Centre, which I attended.  I was disturbed by the attention of the media on that occasion to the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, being stuck in a lift rather than on that amazing facility.  The opening of that facility presented an opportunity to look at the whole area of mental health in a much more progressive manner rather than on the mishap in the lift.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600030#DD00300","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1362582600,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I do not disagree at all with what the Deputy said and there is much common sense in it because we should focus on the merits of the issue rather than frivolities or otherwise of people getting stuck in lifts.  There is a message in this for the media and those who pander to them with simplistic commentary rather than detailed policy work.  The Deputy is right to say that even with the cutbacks there has been a renewed commitment on funding on the part of the Government, and the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, in particular has taken a huge interest in this area.  Fair is fair and in circumstances where cuts have occurred a special allocation of an additional &euro;35 million was made last year.  Our commitment was to have an additional 414 places.  As of now, 307 of these are in place and a commitment has been given that the great majority of the remaining number will be in place in a matter of weeks.  I understand the 2013 budget also contains a commitment that an additional &euro;35 million would be put in place to allow these additional posts to be filled.<\/p><p>  Even in very difficult times when budgets are being cut this is an area where budgets are expanding because we recognise there has been a real deficit in the number of trained personnel working in the area.  I expect, because of the notes I have in front of me, these people will be in place by March this year.  This will represent an increase of &euro;70 million over the past two years and an additional 800 posts over a longer period of time.  Slowly but surely we are beginning to recognise the need for proper mental health services, as the Deputy has rightly said.  Even in difficult times we can still do this.  I am sure the Deputy and others will encourage the Minister to get even bigger budgets and have a larger number of supporting personnel.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, there is an issue with regard to how developments in this area will have a practical impact throughout the HSE service and this is something of which we need to be very mindful.  We should not have doctrinaire ideological views on something if evidence shows a better system, or at least a more flexible system, needs to be put in place.  We need to be mindful of this and change policy accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600031#EE00100","speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","time":1362582600,"counter":419,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600031#EE00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1362582600,"counter":420,"content":"<p>The parents of children with special needs in County Wicklow need and want to hear from the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills about the future plans for St. Catherine's Association and all of the services it provides to children in the county.

I understand a meeting will take place on Monday with the board of directors for all parents whose children use the services of St. Catherine's Association and this is a very important process.

Clearly there are very serious issues and the new board of directors of St. Catherine's Association very much acknowledge this and have been working hard over the past month to attempt to rectify it.  These issues must be addressed.  From our perspective, we need the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills to work together and meet the new board of directors and put in place a structure to ensure the health, education and residential services can be retained.

In recent years, much concern has been expressed by disadvantaged groups who feel they are taking a disproportionate cut in the services provided to them.  I am confident this will not be the case in this situation.  St. Catherine's Association was established several decades ago as a voluntary organisation to provide services for those with intellectual disabilities.  On a voluntary basis many people campaigned, fund-raised and worked for many hours to establish a service when the State provided very little, if anything, in the area.  It has developed and grown and provides an excellent service to many families along the east coast of Wicklow.  It is going through change at present but it is very important.  I am aware the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, has had dealings with the HSE in this area in recent months and it is important that she gets out the message that the service provided will not suffer and that in whatever manner it is revamped the facilities and services of St. Catherine's Association will remain available to the residents and families.  It is important to acknowledge the excellent work done by the many volunteers throughout the years and I hope once we go through this process that people will be reassured.  I welcome the decision of the board of directors to meet the families in the coming days to reassure them that services will stay in place.

St. Catherine's Association was established at a time when families or those with an interest in special needs had to push harder than they do today for anything they got.  They got money and established a service at a time when there was no such thing as service level agreements or corporate governance.  The service was born in this era, and it is the property of not only the families but also the community which feels it established it.  This weekend the local Lions Club will run a fund-raiser for St. Catherine's Association.  It will run vintage car runs and make other efforts to raise money to enhance the services provided by State funding through the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p>  It is regrettable that it has come to this.  There are issues which have needed to be addressed for some time and it behoves everybody involved to get proactively engaged in resolving the issues.  It is very important at this stage that the families, parents and children who are service users are reassured about the quality and type of service that will remain once the process has been completed.  This is the most important thing and I urge the senior management of St. Catherine's Association, with or without the HSE, to meet the parents and give them this reassurance and explain to them exactly what has gone on.

I understand people's concern and the necessity to use the Chamber for a very clear statement on the part of the Minister for Health and the Minister of State at the Department and the Minister for Education and Skills.  I know St. Catherine's Association as when I was education spokesperson on the other side of the House I worked with it on a number of issues with regard to special educational needs support.  I take the point made by Deputy Doyle that this is not just a local concern.  It is more important than this because St. Catherine's Association is a fundamental part of the national infrastructure for educational support of children with special needs.<\/p><p>  I understand all Deputies in the Wicklow constituency are concerned about the future of the services of St. Catherine's Association in the context of difficulties which have emerged with regard to financial and governance issues, and in particular the fact that St. Catherine's Association has decided that a number of current employees will not have their contracts renewed.  It is important to reassure the Deputies and the wider community that the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills are working closely with the service to ensure it will be sustainable for the future.<\/p><p> St. Catherine's Association delivers services to children with intellectual disability and is a valued service provider to people in the area.  Services currently provided include multidisciplinary support services to approximately 250 children in St. Catherine's special school and early services including preschool to a number of children on the autistic spectrum.  It also provides residential places for 11 children and two adults, and respite services for approximately 75 children.<\/p><p> The HSE provides funding to St. Catherine's Association - which, in 2012, amounted to in the region of &euro;9 million - under a grant as provided for by section 39 of the Health Act 2004.  The Department of Education and Skills funds the educational elements of the service separately.  In that context, I am assured by the Department of Education and Skills that St. Catherine's Special Needs School remains open to its pupils.  The difficulties currently being experienced do not concern the education provided to the pupils.  Department of Education and Skills officials have arranged to meet with the school tomorrow morning to discuss the current difficulties and to assist the school.<\/p><p> St. Catherine's has grown significantly over a short timeframe in an unsustainable way.  The HSE recognises the value of this service and is anxious to help the organisation to return to sustainability as soon as possible.  A financial and governance review is being finalised by the HSE at present and the aim of the close engagement by the HSE is to ensure that this valuable service can continue on a sustainable footing.  As part of the resolution of the matter, I understand that St. Catherine's has decided in recent days that it will not be renewing the contracts of a number of staff attached to the educational part of the service.  While I understand this may be of concern to parents of children who attend St. Catherine's, it is important to note that it is in everyone's interest that the service be run in a financially sustainable way.<\/p><p> I understand that the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, recently met with all the Deputies for County Wicklow.  She emphasised that every effort is being made to assist this organisation and, in particular, the children and parents who rely on its services.

There has been some tangling of wires in that area because what was part of a &euro;9 million budget for care may have become part of an education stream of funding also.  This is the nub of the problem with regard to governance.  In anyone's language, &euro;9 million is a substantial amount of money for a service.

They simply cannot go around the place without informing elected representatives, who understandably will take on board queries and concerns from constituents.  I hope the HSE will learn lessons from this affair because that information was not provided, albeit through no fault of the Minister.  On the contrary, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, met all the Deputies concerned last week.

The fear is that the sector is in jeopardy and it is believed that the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has not adjusted the REFIT scheme to allow the entire crop to be sold to the Edenderry power station in the coming weeks.  The biggest difficulty is that approximately 300 farmers have invested a significant amount of money in the sector in recent years to develop the industry and grow almost 6,000 acres of miscanthus.<\/p><p>Rightly or wrongly, there was a belief that the farmers concerned would have an outlet for this crop when it was ready to be harvested.

At present, to meet its current energy demands, Ireland is importing approximately 90% of its fuel requirements at a cost of approximately &euro;6 billion per annum.  Developing robust indigenous renewable sources of energy will help Ireland to meet its 2020 targets and to reduce its dependence on such fossil fuel imports.<\/p><p>  In February 2012, I opened a REFIT scheme for biomass technologies to promote the use of renewable energy from biomass.  REFIT 3, which is the scheme to which Deputy Moynihan is referring, was designed to incentivise the addition of 310 MW of renewable electricity capacity to the Irish electricity grid.  The technologies being supported include anaerobic digestion and combined heat and power, which also will contribute to Ireland's renewable heat targets.  It also contains incentives for co-firing of biomass, including energy crops such as miscanthus and willow in existing peat-powered generation plants and the use of biomass for generation of electricity only.  The scheme operates by guaranteeing a minimum price for renewable electricity generated and sent to the grid over a 15-year period and the cost of REFIT is borne by electricity consumers through the public service obligation, PSO, levy.  REFIT payments are made only to electricity suppliers for the renewable electricity exported to the grid.  It was never intended to set out a tariff price for biomass itself and prices paid to suppliers of biomass are a private contractual matter between the supplier and the electricity generator.  The REFIT schemes are funded, which is paid for by all electricity consumers.<\/p><p>  REFIT 3 was designed, in part, to build on the bioenergy scheme operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which provides establishment grants to farmers to grow energy crops such as miscanthus and willow for use in renewable energy production.  It is, however, important to note that the bioenergy scheme was opened in 2007, long before a REFIT scheme for biomass was mooted.  Equally, REFIT 3 does not preclude the use of miscanthus by electricity generators other than those co-firing with peat.  Miscanthus and other energy crops can be used as a fuel in both the heating and electricity sectors.  While miscanthus has certain advantages over other energy crops in respect of returns, I understand it is not suitable for all applications and its high chlorine content can cause corrosion in some boilers.  It also is bulky and expensive to transport and therefore, the economics work better when the plantations are close to where it is required.  As a result, the markets for miscanthus is limited at present.  I understand that most of the miscanthus is used for co-firing with peat at one of the power plants in the midlands.  I also understand that a small proportion is processed into heat logs and used in the heat sector.  However, I believe that as new biomass plants supported by REFIT 3 come online, this will create further demand for energy from biomass and miscanthus may have a role to play in contributing to meeting Ireland's renewable energy targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600033#GG00200","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1362583800,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the reply.

I had not been informed that the Minister had met the company concerned.  I really seek to ascertain what can be done to assist these people and to ensure there is some outlet for them in the future.  In the last line of his reply, the Minister noted that as REFIT 3 comes online, it would create further demand for energy from biomass and miscanthus.  When is this likely to happen and what is the likelihood of it coming on-stream in the short term?

Bord na M&oacute;na insists this is not the way it happened and since I came into the Chamber, I have received a communication from JHM Crops Limited, to the effect that contact is ongoing right up to today between the company and my office about what, if anything, I can do to pull it out of the fire, no pun intended.  The difficulty is that it is a private contract between the growers and JHM Crops Limited, the company acting as middleman which organises the farmers and transports the miscanthus to the plant in the midlands.  The difficulty is that at present, that contract is not rewarding the company for the costs of the enterprise involved.  Even were Bord na M&oacute;na to enter REFIT 3 in six months' time, the difference would not be adequate to maintain any kind of viable margin for JHM Crops Limited.  I also have spoken to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine about this issue because, as Deputy Moynihan has noted, 300 farmers have been given an expectation, which is a serious matter, apart entirely from the company that acts as the go-between being at risk.  Consequently, I am discussing this matter with my colleague, the aforementioned Minister.  It is a very difficult issue when it comes down to a private commercial contract entered into between two parties and the role of the State in this is minimal, if it exists at all.  On the point Deputy Moynihan raises, the problem is that even were Bord na M&oacute;na to enter REFIT 3 as soon as may be, the difference would be very small.

The administration of health services has been a source of irritation to many of us over a long number of years.  I am of the vintage who experienced the termination of the county health system and the beginning of the health board system, which was interesting.  The late Erskine Childers is reputed to have said, \"How can you unscramble an egg?\" when asked whether he could go back to the original system.  I am afraid the egg has been scrambled a few times since and the question of how the health services should be run has come into focus on numerous occasions in the past number of years.  I served on the health board system and there was accountability, responsibility and action in response to the problems raised by elected public representatives regarding services.  The major players, including GPs, nursing professions, psychiatric services, consultants and the chemists, were on board in the old health boards because it was felt necessary at the time in 1970 to ensure the major contributors would be in the same building at the same time with the same responsibility, answering the same questions, accountable to the same people and committed to the same vision.  That was the case but, unfortunately, as time passed, it became awkward to administrate and questions were raised.<\/p><p>  The leader of the Opposition was Minister when it was decided to abolish the health boards and to introduce a new system.  I strongly opposed that at the time both within my party and anywhere else anybody would listen me.  I am sure not many people wanted to listen to me still but I remained opposed to it for a good reason.  One of the propositions advanced at the time as to why we should have a different system was a comparison made with the greater Manchester area, which has a similar population to this country.  Management experts around this country and several from outside the country made contributions in which they opined that it should be possible to have a similar administrative structure to that which prevailed in Manchester.  They were wrong because it was chalk and cheese as two entirely different geographical areas were involved.  In one scenario, there was a compact urbanised population, which was easy to administer and in which it was possible to walk from one end of the area to the other in a few hours whereas in Ireland, if somebody attempted to walk from the south end of Kerry to the north end of Donegal in a few hours, he would find out after a short while that there is a difference and if he wanted to walk from there across to Carlingford, he would find another difference.  If he then walked back down to Wexford and Waterford and around to Kerry again, he would find out there was a major difference.<\/p><p>  My view at the time was the equation was wrong, the structures were not analogous and attempting to superimpose a similar structure in this jurisdiction would not work.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Wall, and I have discussed this many times in the past.  I do not claim to the be only one right about this because many others had the same view.  However, I was right and it did not work.  I recall asking the first chief executive officer of the HSE whether he felt a single executive with the appropriate authority could administer the health service and he said, &quot;I don't know&quot;.  He knows now, as does everybody else.  I emphasise we attempted to impose a structure that was seen to be in management circles as the ideal response to a situation but it was not because they did not know what was the situation.<\/p><p>  Then Members experienced an issue which we anticipated on the Opposition benches where when we tabled questions to the Minister for Health and Children, we were told the Minister had no responsibility to the House.  I recall refusal after refusal from the Ceann Comhairle's office.  This was no reflection on the Ceann Comhairle because the prevailing advice at the time was that the Minister had no responsibility and eventually the Ceann Comhairle inquired as to whether any Minister had any responsibility.  Earlier, Opposition Members complained about a lack of accountability and responsibility but I know all about that because I was here at the time, as was the Acting Chairman, and we learned a harsh lesson during that period.<\/p><p>  I pay tribute to the Minister who knows me well enough to know that I do not pay tribute too readily.  However, there has been a dramatic difference in the way questions to his Department are responded to as compared to the previous Administration.  That is no reflection on the previous Administration because its members admitted they admitted they did know not know much of what was happening.  I would like to acknowledge the major improvement in the ways questions are answered.  However, it is not ideal nor will it ever be.  Somebody can ask who do I think I am and what do I think should be done.  I acknowledge I am not always right but, in this instance, it is beyond any shadow of doubt that those who held the same view as me all along were right but we did not wait until now to find out.<\/p><p>  The second issue I would like to deal with is accountability and the composite bodies in the health boards at the time.  Consultants, nurses, GPs, chemists and administrators, including three or four programme managers, were accountable to the entire board area.  The Eastern Health Board was the largest in the State and it was possible to gain access at the highest level instantly.  Those who opposed this concept said it was all wrong and it was too politician-oriented.  What they meant was there was too much accountability and it was alleged that nothing could be done because politicians would not allow it.  There are ways and means of dealing with that.  I believe in responsible public representation as well as everybody else and it is important that when people are in opposition or government, they act responsibly.  We learned during that period to try to act responsibly and that meant that the health board spent what it had and nothing more and stayed within budget.  However, the budget was beginning to creep up and get out of hand.  The same experience is repeated in the House every day.  Opposition Members promote excessive expenditure we know the country cannot afford on a daily basis.  This money would have to borrowed at high interest rates.  We have to beg for this money on a regular basis from our colleagues in Europe yet Opposition Members want to spend it lavishly at every hand's turn and pretend to the people that it is possible to take actions that are impossible.<\/p><p>  I also learned during that period about the need to respond to patients' requirements.<\/p><p>It is all very well to state we will provide a certain quality and level of service, including an after hours service.  I compliment the outstanding cohort of people who provided these services over the years, including consultants, general practitioners, chemists and nurses, as well as many others in the health service structure.  Many of them gave above and beyond what was required of them as they contributed to the sum total of the response of the health service at the time.  They did very well and stand unheralded, unsung and largely unrecognised to this day.<\/p><p> General practitioners, who were represented on the health boards, worked extremely long hours providing clinics in the morning, afternoon and evening for six or seven days per week as they sought to respond to need.  They showed the vocational calling that is found in education, politics, the health service and across the public service.  Unfortunately, this calling is disappearing at an alarming rate.  I hope it will be rediscovered in the not too distant future because it is essential and central to the delivery of health services.  I acknowledge the quality and commitment of the general practitioners and consultants who worked in the period following the 1970 Act.  They did very well in providing what was needed in response to the needs of people.<\/p><p> Time moves on, however, and we must proceed to a different scene.  The entire Health Service Executive structure must be abolished and the Minister for Health held directly responsible to the House for the functioning of the health service.  The Minister of the day should answer questions in the House, as the current Minister does to a large extent, although many questions are referred to the HSE for direct reply for understandable reasons.  For many years, while the Acting Chairman, Deputy Jack Wall, sat alongside me and many others on the Opposition benches, we had to put up with appalling nonsense in this regard.  To discover now that the current system has its critics on the Opposition benches is equally alarming. <\/p><p> In any event, the system should be transformed and the old health board structure reconstituted, albeit with fewer health boards.  Given the different requirements and demands in urban areas, such as the greater Dublin area, and large rural areas, it is not sufficient to concentrate services in more densely populated areas.  Every citizen is entitled to a fair degree of service under the Constitution and to provide for anything else would be wrong.  The current HSE structure should be abolished and replaced with a new structure.  The new system should be centralised with a budget that is determined on the basis of submissions received from the various constituent health boards.  These boards should be given responsibility for running the health services in their respective areas.  The public and private sectors must not trip over each other and become involved in turf wars or financial wars.  They should focus solely on delivering services to members of the public.<\/p><p> Public representation should be part and parcel of the new system.  Local authority members should be represented on the new boards, as should Deputies and Senators for as long as the Seanad remains in place, which is a matter for the people to decide.  General practitioners, consultants and the nursing and pharmacy professions should also be represented.  All the professions involved in the delivery of health services should have a role in the health boards, which should be charged with the responsibility of delivering services.  The boards must be accountable and do their business in a responsible manner.  This would present a serious challenge for politics, citizens and our European partners.  Those of us who examine what is taking place in other EU member states will note a tendency to resile from reality and pretend that things will go away if one ignores them.  Nothing goes away, which means we must accept responsibility, even if it means telling citizens that we do not have enough funds to do the job they expect of us or that we must do the job in a way they do not expect. <\/p><p> Major economies can be secured in the health services, especially in the area of procurement.  During my time as a member of a health board, we did an exercise on generic prescribing which resulted in substantial savings.  Some of the opponents of moves towards generic prescribing were Members of this House, with certain Deputies voicing in a highly loquacious manner their opposition to the proposal.  While they must have had reason to be so impressed with the argument for continuing to use branded products, the basis for their position was not made clear.  We proved our point and our solution was workable. <\/p><p> We also set about determining in which European countries prescriptions were most economical.  We decided to use Spain as a template for achieving the best solution available to us for Irish citizens and it proved highly effective.  Subsequently, a certain Minister, whom I will not name in the House, decided that the health services were costing too much, were too democratic and were subject to too much intervention from the various constituent bodies.  As a result, it was decided to abolish the health boards and establish the Health Service Executive.  What a disaster.  Not alone did this decision not save money, as originally intended, and not alone was the Secretary General of the Department moved sideways during the machinations that took place at the time, but the cost of the health service subsequently increased to an unprecedented extent.  I will hold the view that abolishing the health boards and replacing them with the HSE structure was an appalling disaster until the day I die.  In doing so I do not mean any disrespect to those who were given responsibility for the HSE structure and the many thousands of health professionals who were condemned to work within it.  It is, however, a serious condemnation of those who determined that the HSE structure was an appropriate way to run the health service. <\/p><p> Having exchanged views with me on the matter many times, the Acting Chairman will be aware of my strong views on the health service.  The Minister is aware that some Deputies have serious concerns about the governance of the health service.  I hope the current proposal will be reviewed and revised and a structure will be established similar to that which I have suggested.  While I do not claim to be the only authority in this business, I spent 20 years on a health board for my sins - I must have been very sinful - during which time I learned a great deal and met many of the great people who forged the structures for the delivery of health services.  They were trailblazers in medicine who did a tremendous job in addressing people's concerns.<\/p><p> The health board structure may have required some refinement but it was an excellent structure.  The Government of the day, in an extraordinary intervention, decided to increase the number of health boards to eight and, subsequently, to 11.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600034#HH00300","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362585600,"counter":440,"content":"<p>The Deputy has one minute remaining.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600036#KK00100","speaker":"950"},{"type":"speech","time":1362585600,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I wish I had more, but I will conclude.

It has no credibility in the eyes of the wider public or the health service's users.  However, it is important to qualify this statement.  There is an almost universal phenomenon in which everyone who engages with the health service believes its nurses, doctors and other front-line staff are wonderful, yet the way in which the system is organised is a nightmare.  As I am sure other Deputies have pointed out, anything I say is not a criticism of the heroic front-line staff in the health service, be they ambulance drivers, nurses, medical practitioners or so on.

However, the rhetoric was also good when the HSE was being established in 2004.  The digest supplies a telling quote from the then Minister for Health and Children, Ms Mary Harney.  Her rhetoric was electrifying.  One would really have believed we were on the brink of a wonderful revolution in the way health services were being delivered.  She stated, &quot;This is an historic piece of legislation.&quot;  How often have we heard that?  She continued:<blockquote>It provides for the most comprehensive reorganisation of our health services since 1970 which is long overdue and vital. It is a once-in-a-generation event.  It is our generation&#8217;s chance to put patients first in the design of the management of health services.  It is our chance to put in place modern, effective management to make the best use of these tremendous resources we are applying to health and to get clear value and clear results for that money.<\/blockquote>To be honest, there is not much difference between the 2004 rhetoric and the rhetoric now.  The main question is whether the new re-organisation of the dysfunctional health service into what it needs to be - modern, efficient and a provider of the services that people desperately need - will transpire in reality.  I am sure Ms Harney sounded convincing when she made that speech, but the reality did not match.<\/p><p><br \/>  I will put my cards on the table.  The Minister is trying to square a circle that cannot be squared.  It comes down to resources.  I am not claiming there are not structural issues of management, mismanagement and organisation, elements on which the Government places much emphasis.  Historically, Fine Gael has put a great deal of emphasis on them.  The Government's main assertion is that we need better management, but this argument does not stack up for me.  I am not saying we do not need better management, but focusing on it is to gloss over the fundamental problem, that being, from where does bureaucracy come.  Does it just arise because we do not devise the right structures?<\/p><p><br \/>  I am sure the HSE's current structures probably sounded reasonably convincing following the rhetoric of Ms Harney's speech.  I am sure there were many arguments about how health boards were not terribly functional, were somewhat corrupted by political influence and cronyism, etc.  Directorates based on particular areas of service provision or care also sound like a good idea.  However, is this element the problem?  I do not know whether the word &quot;Directorates&quot; is a reference to the French revolution and Robespierre, but it sounds good and revolutionary.  I put it to the Minister that the HSE's structure is not the main problem, although it may be a problem and probably could be redesigned.<\/p><p><br \/>  Someone whose name one probably cannot mention in polite company without being laughed at by certain sides of this House, but who I will simply call a revolutionary from the turn of the century, explained that bureaucracy and corruption developed because of shortages.  He used the example of a bread shop.  If the shop is packed with enough bread for everyone who enters the shop, there will be no queue and people can get the bread as they need it.  However, if there is a shortage, a queue forms and people start jostling with one another over who will be at the front.  Once a queue develops, it becomes necessary to have someone to keep it in order.  That person often seems to use an arbitrary and coercive power to keep in line the people who are queuing for bread that they desperately need.  As the person whose job it is to order the queue has power over people's access to scarce resources, he or she is vulnerable to corruption even if he or she does not start as a corrupt person.  This allegory of how bureaucracy and corruption develop is at the heart of the problems with the health service.<\/p><p>I do not know how one can resolve the problem of great layers of bureaucracy that are dysfunctional and where there is mismanagement of the health service when the problem is that we do not have the resources.  We are cutting the elements in the health service that work.  We are cutting the number of nurses.  Everyone says the nurses are wonderful.  The front-line staff are wonderful but what have we done to the number of front-line staff but slashed them.  We are cutting the one part of the system that works, and we are demoralising such staff with pay cuts.  Even if they were wonderful up until now they certainly do not feel wonderful anymore.  One wonders how long their goodwill can last under the hammer of the cuts.  Front-line staff are the one part of the health service that work.  Ambulance drivers and others are withdrawing their goodwill for the same reasons.  They say they are working their backs off trying to provide the service and everybody acknowledges that they do it well but what do they get for it?  They have their wages cut.  They get attacked and are asked to work longer and harder for less.  One could ask how that can work.  I put it to the Minister that it cannot.<\/p><p> Perhaps the lack of detail on the directorates and what will follow what the Minister describes as the transition provided for in the legislation tells its own story in that regard.  It may be a dawning awareness of that fact.  As I understand it, it is Government policy that we are in transition towards a model of universal health insurance.  We need to know what the model will look like.  I am not sure whether the Dutch model, about which the Minister initially spoke a lot, is still the model we are following.  The evidence is piling up in the Netherlands that what the Dutch model produces is ever-higher health insurance costs.  More and more of the resources that go into the health service there are being taken up with the bureaucracy of the private health insurance system.  The most dramatic and developed example of such a system is the United States, which is the ultimate example of where universal health insurance as delivered by private health insurance companies is the main model, in contrast to, for example, the national health service model in Britain that was set up at the end of the Second World War where everyone gets free health care and it is paid for out of general taxation.  What is happening in this country seems to be a transition towards that failed model in the United States and the failing model, in so far as it has been developed, in the Netherlands where the public are becoming increasingly angered and outraged over the increased costs.<\/p><p> The facts about the American model are shocking.  They spend more on health than any other country but 40% of it is wasted on administration.  The reason that is the case is to do with money, because companies are billing people.  There is a massive administration for billing people.  That is what it is about.  The money is not going into the front-line services.  That is not its primary purpose.  It exits to make money so one has a huge bureaucracy whose job it is to capture the money instead of financing health care through revenue and a system of taxation that already exists and which is progressive and can capture the funding necessary for public services without creating a new privatised bureaucracy whose main job is to make money and who will push up insurance premiums as it needs.  I ask the question in that context because there is so little detail in the Bill.  Is the main concrete proposal in the Bill the separation of service provision from procurement?  Is that what is going on, that the Bill is setting up the system for the move towards privatisation where services will be purchased by the private health insurance companies and provision will come from the public system?  I suspect that is the case.  I urge the Minister not to go in that direction because it is a failed model.  The alternative is more in the direction of the British health service model.<\/p><p> I see it as a positive step that the Minister is seeking to take more personal responsibility for what goes on in the health service, but there is a need for checks and balances at local level.  I agree with Deputy Penrose&rsquo;s point about the former health boards.  It was a localised form of governance of health services.  It would be necessary to reform them.  The boards should not be as they were, made up of cronies but of patient representatives, health professional and other stakeholders such as representatives of the workforce and perhaps elected representatives to represent the wider public to see how policy translates at the other end.  My concern is that we are preparing for the outsourcing of much of the health service to private insurance companies and the directorates, which will possibly compete for resources among themselves, will still represent a top-down structure.<\/p><p> I stress the importance of localised oversight and management of health services.  I wish to bring to the Minister&rsquo;s attention what on the face of it the evidence suggests is an absolutely shocking example of the mismanagement of HSE funds in the home help sector.  I am reluctant to go into too much detail because the charges that are made are serious against home help companies in the Fingal and Wicklow areas.  There is substantial evidence, and allegations have been put forward by employees in both areas, of rampant misappropriation of HSE funds.  Significant amounts of funding were invested by the HSE in home help services in Wicklow and Fingal.  The allegations suggest the misappropriation of hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of euro in funding.  One company was getting &euro;250,000 a month from the HSE.  Allegations have been made of company credit cards being used to finance holidays and to buy cars.  There was no oversight of the expenditure of funds.  No regard was taken of proper regulation and how the service was being run although it was dealing with vulnerable people.  Rules were flouted and people who blew the whistle were sacked, among other actions.  I will not go into much more detail in that regard.  Snippets of information appeared in the newspapers before Christmas but some of the people directly involved have told me they met a brick wall in trying to get proper investigations into these matters which they describe as rampant corruption and misappropriation of scarce resources supposed to be directed towards a vulnerable sector of society from the public purse via the HSE but where the HSE did not provide proper oversight in the matter.<\/p><p>It is not clear to me at all, from what the Minister is proposing in this Bill and from the lack of detail about where this is going, that the new structures will deal with this problem.  We need a level of local oversight to determine what is happening with moneys that are being allocated centrally.  What is being done with the funds?  Are the local units delivering health services to vulnerable citizens being managed properly?  Are the resources actually going to patients, staff and so on?  That is a role that any reformed health board system operating at a local level and made up of stakeholders would be far better at performing.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600036#KK00500","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362586800,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill.  I am not surprised that this has been introduced because when I was involved in the debate about setting up the HSE, I expressed my extreme concern about the development of such a monolithic organisation.  I appreciate that the objective was to ensure co-ordination between the old health boards and consistency in terms of service delivery.  However, this could have been achieved while maintaining and reforming the local health boards themselves.<\/p><p>  Admittedly, there were some difficulties with the old health board system but I believe we threw the baby out with the bath water at that time.  We now have a situation where there is very little input from service users, interested parties, public representatives and professionals.  I was a member of the Mid-Western Health Board for seven years and was also involved in the Association of Health Boards in Ireland and a lot of good work was done by individual boards and by that association.  Issues were brought to the attention of Ministers and the Houses of the Oireachtas, in terms of difficulties experienced by people.  Such issues were also brought to the attention, at a local level, to the managers of the health boards.  Monthly meetings were held, which were attended by public representatives, consultants, dentists, nurses and so on, who would raise, in public and in the presence of the media, their concerns regarding the delivery of health services.  The health boards were made aware of the concerns and needs that existed as well as the changes in the requirements of the general public with regard to the delivery of the health services.  Furthermore, the Minister was responsible for what was happening in the delivery of health services throughout the country.   <\/p><p>  The setting up of the HSE changed all of that.  The potential for external input all but disappeared and the opportunities for those at the coalface to have an input into the delivery of services were lost.  Also, the removal of the responsibility for the delivery of the health services from the Minister created a situation whereby there was a complete lack of accountability to these Houses in terms of service delivery.  Others have raised the issue of replies to parliamentary questions about the delivery of health services and the fact that, in certain circumstances, the HSE is quite tardy in issuing responses.  It can be extremely frustrating for those of us who want to respond to the concerns of our constituents.  In that context, I welcome the fact that the Bill will abolish the structure of the HSE and provide for a directorate to be the governing body of the executive, in place of the board, which will be headed by a director general.  The Bill also provides for accountability arrangements for the HSE, which is very important.  <\/p><p>  I wish to draw attention to the important decision which has been made to appoint a director of mental health services and that the recruitment process is under way.  I welcome the fact that the director will have full control of the delivery of mental health services.  I also welcome the appointment of Mr. Gerry Raleigh as director of the National Office for Suicide Prevention, which has had a lot of difficulties in the last 12 months, not least the fact that moneys allocated by the Minister to the work of suicide prevention, suicide postvention and research were not spent last year.  It is important that the &euro;35 million allocated in the budget for the delivery of mental health services is spent in the most appropriate way to deliver A Vision for Change.  There has been much debate about the non-spending of some of the resources last year.  However, I understand the complications that arose because of the delay in the formulation of the service plan and the recruitment of the 411 consultants and professional staff for community-based mental health services.  I ask the Minister in his response to inform us of the plan for the delivery and improvement of the services, based on this year's allocation of &euro;35 million.  We need to know what will happen with that money this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600038#MM00200","speaker":"1056"},{"type":"speech","time":1362586800,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The Government is committed to the eventual dissolution of the HSE.  However, this is a complex process which will take time and this Bill is a transitional measure along that path.  The Bill is all about accountability and its aim is to make the HSE more directly accountable to the Minister for Health.  The provisions of this Bill will see the abolition of the board structure of the HSE and a directorate created as a new governing body, headed by a director general.  The directorate does not have a fixed number of members - the Bill provides for a maximum of seven and a minimum of three.  This should allow flexibility for the directorate to deal with circumstances as they arise.  It is important to stress here that the HSE will continue to have operational responsibility for running the health service.  The director general will account, on behalf of the directorate, to the Minister.  As with any large corporate structure, one needs to have good governance practices and structures in place in order to implement the changes that are necessary.<\/p><p>  This Bill will aim to make sure that Government policies and objectives relating to the HSE functions are implemented and this is no mean task.  The Minister will specify his priorities for the HSE and the HSE must have regard for these in preparing its service plans.  Like any good plans, they must have performance targets and metrics for measuring performance.  The HSE must pay particular regard to these targets as they are set out for it.  These operational changes will ensure that the HSE, which is a very large organisation, will have greater flexibility and will be able to react more quickly, as change is required.<\/p><p>  I wish to stress that while this Bill is about making sure the HSE reacts faster and in the direction that the Minister wants, my experience of the HSE in the south has been very positive.  Everybody likes to criticise the HSE but it certainly has a lot of good points.  It would be wrong of anyone to suggest that all areas of the HSE are not performing.  Only last week, the reconfiguration plan involving Cork University Hospital and Mallow General Hospital reached the point of implementation.  The HSE and its staff played a pivotal role in this, liaising with all of the consultants and everyone else involved, in drawing up a very detailed strategy and everybody is on board, I am glad to say.  I am delighted to say that this will probably form the template for how small hospitals work in the future and will allow for a future for them.<\/p><p>Until now we have been worrying about the future of all our small hospitals.  Most importantly, this will see better service delivery to the patient, with shorter waiting times and the freeing of emergency surgery wards for emergencies requiring specialist care.  I particularly thank the regional director of operations in HSE south for his tireless work in ensuring that the Minister's aims are being delivered on the ground.<\/p><p> We must move forward toward greater accountability and transparency in health care delivery.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, has succeeded in reducing waiting times and time spent on trolleys, with individual performances across the HSE to be monitored and accessible for all.  If three surgeons can perform the same procedure, the waiting times for each surgeon should be available online so a patient can decide which surgeon to go to.  With prescription drugs, there should be a list of those who give prescriptions, particularly general practitioners, taking into account those who prescribe cost-effective generic medicine in preference to high-cost brands.  That would generate best value for the patient.  We must also move to a system where prices of drugs can be published online so that patients who pay for drugs with minimum subvention can have access to the information that will allow best value for money.<\/p><p> I congratulate the Minister on the establishment of the medicines management programme, which is concerned with the spend on medicines.  The Minister is tackling the issue with the programme, which will evaluate medicines under the headings of safety, efficacy, access, and savings for the State and patient.  It is an holistic process as part of a broader remit, with co-ordination between the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics and the National Medicines Information Centre, coming together with collaboration of the HSE under the primary care reimbursement services.<\/p><p> In private business, getting policies delivered is important; it is done quite quickly in small business but doing it in a large organisation is very difficult.  Delivering such change can take time.  I congratulate the Minister on the establishment of the national early warning score.  All these initiatives may sound like they are more jargon but they are well thought through and will deliver for the patient and, in time, bring cost savings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600038#MM00300","speaker":"980","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362587400,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I am delighted to welcome the Bill to the House.  In doing so, there is a statement of an ongoing need for reform, reorganisation and refinement of services for the patient, although this in no way reflects on the professionalism, commitment and wonderful work done by individual HSE employees at all levels in recent years.  There is no implicit criticism of their professionalism in the legislation or its objectives, which is concerned with structure, future direction and ambition to deliver a single-tier health services.<\/p><p>  Today marks the Government's second anniversary in office.  In that context I salute and compliment the achievements of the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and his Department in those two years which have led to the Department being overhauled.  Since 2011, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and his Department have cut the cost of medicine by &euro;400 million, which is a very significant achievement.  They have allocated a further &euro;35 million to mental health services and filled 246 new mental health posts, which is another great achievement.  They have also established a special delivery unit to work with hospitals to reduce the number of patients on trolleys and waiting times.  In 2012, the number of people waiting on trolleys decreased by 23.6% and although this is not where we wish to be, it is a true reflection of the work done and tangible evidence that we are going in the right direction.  It means much to those who are affected and it is a great achievement in the context of very stringent economic times.  The Minister has achieved much with significant budgetary constraints.<\/p><p>  There has been a 98% decrease in the number of adults who must wait more than nine months for inpatient and day surgery, with a 95% decrease for children.  I am pleased to report that in Cavan General Hospital, the number of patients waiting on procedures has fallen by 48%, which is a very significant development.  A new 34-bed cystic fibrosis unit was opened in St. Vincent's hospital and we have established a site for the new children's hospital.  The Bill is being brought forward against that backdrop of real reform and achievement, with tangible differences for people.  The ambition of the Bill is to continue the reform and build on it.<\/p><p>  There are two essential objectives of the Bill.  The first is to make the HSE more accountable to the Minister for Health and the second is to restructure the HSE in line with the programme for Government commitments, specifically the move towards universal health insurance.  The Bill is a transitional measure with the intent to implement the proposals as set out in the programme for Government.  It aims to ensure there is more accountability between the Department and the HSE and, more importantly, it will ensure that there is greater accountability and involvement by the Department of Health and the Minister, who is answerable to the electorate.  It is an important component of the legislation.<\/p><p>  The Minister has already started a process of change in this way.  In 2011, he made changes to the composition of the HSE board, ensuring greater co-ordination and a higher level of dialogue between senior officials in the Department and the HSE.  The fundamental flaw of the HSE as introduced in 2004 and 2005 was that a structure was imposed on an existing health board process, meaning there was not a sufficient link to the greater resource that is the Department of Health.  It is a fundamental difficulty that became more of an issue in a number of ways over the years.<\/p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, has referred to this as a unity of purpose, with the changes made guaranteeing a higher level of integration between the Department and the HSE.  The Bill will seek to eventually dissolve the current board structure and establish a new arrangement of governance.  The HSE will have operational responsibility in the interim but accountability will be strengthened.<\/p><p>  The second objective is to begin dissolving the HSE board and move towards universal health insurance.  The new HSE structure will have directorates and a director general, with a flexibility about the number of directors in that the minimum will be three and the maximum will be seven.  That will allow adaptability and a response to certain circumstances.  The directorate will be fully accountable to the Minister, which is important.  The Minister may issue directions to the HSE and the directors regarding the implementation of Government policies relating to specific priority areas, which is important.<\/p><p>  Section 10 refers to levelling the balance of power between the Minister's Government policy and the HSE's operational responsibility.  The Minister has indicated that the HSE has a responsibility under the Health Act 2004 for the provision of health and personal social services.  However, the HSE also has a statutory obligation to have regard to ministerial and Government policies and objectives when performing functions.  The new structures are intended to strengthen that process inherently.  The Bill is only an element in a reform process that is moving toward a single-tier health system in which access to and quality of health care will be available to everyone, irrespective of means.  That should be the objective.<\/p><p>  I will refer to one or two specific areas within health policies as we are given such scope on Second Stage of a Bill.<\/p><p>I am delighted with the developments in primary care.   My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who will be speaking later, and I are aware of recent openings of new health care centres in our area, namely, in Bailieborough, Cootehill and Cavan town.  Another, in Kingscourt, is already functioning but the opening is pending.  It is entering the full development stage.  The primary health care centres have enormous potential to allow for the effective treatment of people in the home, which is where they want to be.  They allow people to remain in their community and have treatment brought to them.<\/p><p> The home help service is a great resource with enormous potential to augment the primary care service and keep people in their own homes.  Dovetailed with this is the carer's allowance, which I know is the direct responsibility of the Minister for Social Protection.  The allowance has great potential to facilitate people being looked after at home.  It should be made more attractive and easier to access, and it should be advertised and recommended more.  This could make it very attractive for people in lower-paid occupations who have sick relatives to become full-time carers.  It has inherent advantages already but could be improved further.  The Department of Health and the Department of Social Protection should consider the carer's allowance as a vehicle to achieve more with a view to keeping people at home, reducing institutional care and, ultimately, reducing costs.  It will allow for people to be cared for at home, which is where they prefer to be.<\/p><p> We should be very careful not to reduce home help hours where possible.  It is reasonable to redistribute them and examine their allocation.  It is reasonable to ensure they are targeted according to need but it is not a good proposition to reduce the number of home help hours in absolute terms.  We should be increasing the number.  It is through the provision of home help, the use of the carer and home care packages that we will reduce institutional costs, make patients happier and allow patients to remain in their own homes.  This is why I salute this measure.<\/p><p> The &euro;35 million extra for mental health services represents wonderful news.  I ask the Minister to elaborate on the plans to spend this immediately to implement the recommendations of A Vision for Change and to have community services developed.  That is very important.  I look forward to the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600039#NN00200","speaker":"971","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362588000,"counter":452,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na Teachta&iacute; as ucht a gcuid rann&iacute;oca&iacute;ochta&iacute; sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo.  I thank the Deputies for their contributions to the debate.  Mar is eol do Theachta&iacute;, t&aacute; an Bille mar chuid de chomhth&eacute;acs n&iacute;os leithne.  T&aacute; an Rialtas ag tabhairt faoi chl&aacute;r athch&oacute;irithe m&oacute;r ar an gc&oacute;ras sl&aacute;inte, agus &eacute; mar aidhm aige c&oacute;ras sl&aacute;inte sraith amh&aacute;in a chur ar f&aacute;il le taca&iacute;ocht &oacute;n &aacute;rachas sl&aacute;inte uil&iacute;och, &aacute;it a bhfuil rochtain bunaithe ar riachtanas seachas ioncam.  Creidim go bhfuil an Bille seo ina ch&eacute;im ar an mb&oacute;thar athch&oacute;irithe sin.  T&aacute; dh&aacute; chusp&oacute;ir aige.  As Deputies are aware, this Bill is part of a wider context.  The Government is embarking on a major reform programme for the health service, the aim of which is to deliver a single-tier health system supported by universal health insurance in respect of which access is based on need, not income.<\/p><p>  The Bill is a step on the health reform road and its purpose is twofold.  Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, for&aacute;lann s&eacute; do dheireadh strucht&uacute;r bhoird an HSE agus le haghaidh stiurth&oacute;ireacht a bheith ar an gcomhlacht nua rialaithe don HSE in ionad ag an mbord, faoi cheannas ard-stiurth&oacute;ir.  Ar an dara dul s&iacute;os, for&aacute;lann s&eacute; do socruithe freagrachta breise don HSE.  Baineann siad seo le athch&oacute;iriu a dh&eacute;anamh chun deireadh a chur leis an gc&oacute;ras dh&aacute; shraith, chun &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh othar-I&aacute;rnach.  Beidh mar thoradh ar seo n&aacute; coinn&iacute;ollacha d'othair a bheith mar thosa&iacute;ocht i ngach a dh&eacute;anfaimid.  First, it provides for the abolition of the board structure of the HSE and for a directorate to be the new governing body for the HSE in place of the board, headed by a director general.  Second, it provides for further accountability arrangements for the HSE.  It is about reform to end the two-tier system to make it patient centred, and it will keep outcomes for patients as its priority in all it does.<\/p><p>  T&aacute; dul chun cinn suntasach feicthe againn cheana f&eacute;in.  Buna&iacute;odh an t-aonad seachadadh speisialta i m&iacute; l&uacute;il 2011.  Ag an am sin, bh&iacute; 2,732 othar ag fanacht n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; bliain agus 6,277 othar ag fanacht n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; naoi mh&iacute; ar ch&oacute;ire&aacute;il c&oacute;naitheach n&oacute; ar ch&oacute;ire&aacute;il lae.  We have already seen significant progress.  The special delivery unit was formed in July 2011.  At that time, 2,732 patients were waiting more than a year and 6,277 patients were waiting more than nine months for inpatient or day case treatment.  Faoi Nollaig 2011, bh&iacute; titim tagtha ar l&iacute;on na ndaoine f&aacute;sta ag fanacht n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; naoi mh&iacute; le haghaidh c&oacute;ire&aacute;il c&oacute;naitheach n&oacute; c&oacute;ire&aacute;il lae go dt&iacute; 3,706.  Faoi dheireadh m&iacute; na Nollag 2012, bh&iacute; an l&iacute;on sin tite go dt&iacute; 86.  L&eacute;ir&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin laghd&uacute; de 98%.  By December 2011, the number of adults waiting more than nine months for inpatient or day case treatment had fallen to 3,706, and by the end of December 2012 the number was just 86.  This represents a decrease of 98%.<\/p><p>  I gc&aacute;s p&aacute;ist&iacute;, is &eacute; an sprioc gur c&oacute;ir nach mbeadh aon ph&aacute;iste ag fanacht n&iacute;os m&oacute; na 20 seachtain mar othar c&oacute;naitheach n&oacute; ar obr&aacute;id m&aacute;inliachta mar othar lae.  Faoi mh&iacute; na Nollag 2012, bh&iacute; an l&iacute;on ag fanacht nios faide n&aacute; 20 seachtain s&iacute;os go dti 89, le titim de 95% ar an 1,759 p&aacute;iste a bh&iacute; ag feitheamh n&iacute;os faide n&aacute; an sprioc i m&iacute; na Nollag 2011.  For children, the target is that no child should be waiting for more than 20 weeks for inpatient or day case surgery.  By December 2012, the number waiting longer than 20 weeks was down to 89, representing a decrease of 95% on the 1,759 children waiting longer than the target in December 2011.<\/p><p>  In the area of emergency departments, despite the winter pressures, including increases in the incidence of influenza and respiratory illnesses, the year-on-year improvements continue nationally.  The number recorded on trolleys at the end of 2012 showed a marked improvement, namely, 23.6% fewer than in 2011, which equates to 20,342 fewer people lying on trolleys.  Progress continues to be maintained in 2013.  On Friday, 1 March 2013, the number on trolleys for the year to that date totalled 12,283, representing a reduction of 2,116 patients, or 14.7%, on the improvements already made in 2012.  We have much more to do and we will continue to make progress.<\/p><p>  Let me turn again to the Bill.  The Bill is about a new governance structure for the HSE and increasing the HSE's accountability to the Minister for Health and, ultimately, the Oireachtas and the people.  Contrary to what has been suggested during the debate on the Bill, it is not about the Minister for Health taking over the HSE's functions, nor does it give sweeping powers to the Minister.  The HSE has responsibility for managing and delivering health services, and that does not change under this Bill.  The Government has responsibility for policy.  Any State agency must have regard to the policies and objectives of the Government to the extent that those policies and objectives may affect or relate to its functions.  A State agency must be accountable to the Minister concerned and, therefore, must explain its actions and decisions.<\/p><p>The Health Act 2004 and this Bill provide for this accountability.<\/p><p> The board of the HSE is the current governing body for the HSE.  The abolition of the board structure and the increased accountability measures are intended to help prepare the service delivery and funding systems for the next phase of the reform programme.  As the HSE board structure is to be abolished, it is necessary to replace the board with an alternative governing entity.  The proposal in the Bill is to have a directorate as the governing body, comprising the director general and senior employees.  The directorate will have collective responsibility as the governing authority for the HSE.<\/p><p> Issues were raised in the debate about the detailed governance mechanisms and inter\u00adrelationships for the directorate members under the Bill.  In practice, the directorate model will involve a combination of a senior management team working together on major corporate issues but with the usual operational line of reporting for the specific service functions.<\/p><p> Deputies asked why members of the directorate must be appointed from HSE employees.  The establishment of the directorate is about more direct accountability, whereby the governing body of the HSE is drawn from people in senior positions within the organisation itself.  I should clarify that this means that appointed directors are not limited to current employees but may be drawn from HSE employees irrespective of when the employee was appointed.<\/p><p> There will be new administrative structures in the HSE which, while in support of the Bill, are separate from it.  The HSE has begun the process of putting in place the new administrative management team.  The recruitment process for five new national directors has now commenced through a competitive process to be run by the Public Appointments Service.  One of the new posts is director of mental health.   Deputies asked if there could be specific reference in the Bill to a director of mental health with specific functions.   While I am very glad to say that the director of mental heath post is one of the posts included in the competitive recruitment process I mentioned, I do not believe that the legislation should specify the functions of particular grades within the HSE.<\/p><p> The appointment provision for the first director general was raised.  There are legislative precedents providing that the first person appointed to a new office be appointed as envisaged under the Bill, and this is the most practical way to advance the new governance arrangements.<\/p><p> The Bill is a transitional measure and is part of a much larger plan.  I said at the beginning that the Government is committed to fundamental reform of the health care system with the objective of delivering a single-tier health system, supported by universal health insurance, where access is based on need, not income.<\/p><p> Deputies have asked me to state clearly my plans for the changes that are coming for the health system.  In November 2012, I and the Ministers of State, Deputies Kathleen Lynch and Alex White, published Future Health: A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012-2015.  This document sets out the major health care reforms that will be introduced in the coming years as key building blocks towards the introduction of universal health insurance, UHI.   I intend that further detailed actions will be built on the foundations of the document as the reform process proceeds.<\/p><p> I have identified an overall governance structure for the programme of reform.  The new structure includes a strong programme management office in the Department of Health to drive and oversee implementation of the health service reform programme in line with the public service agenda, and a systems reform unit in the HSE.  The Government recognises that effective consultation and collaboration with stakeholders will be crucial for the successful implementation of the reform programme.  In the two weeks following the launch of the framework, I met some 1,500 local clinical and administrative staff and management, as well as regional health forums at 14 different events across the four HSE regions.  Consultation will continue throughout the reform process.  The progress to date underlines this Government's commitment to health service reform and the implementation of universal health insurance.  We are confident that with the involvement and support of all the main stakeholders in the health system, we can deliver on our objectives in the best interest of patients.<\/p><p> Deputies asked about universal health insurance.  Preparation is key to UHI and the new governance arrangements for the HSE under the Bill are intended to play a part in preparing the system.  Under UHI, every individual will have equal access to a standard package of primary and acute hospital services, including acute mental health services.  A new insurance fund will subsidise or pay insurance premiums for those who qualify for a subsidy.<\/p><p> There are a number of important stepping stones that are necessary to pave the way for the introduction of UHI.  Work is under way to advance these initiatives which will bring benefits and drive efficiencies in advance of implementing universal health insurance.  They include the strengthening of primary care services to deliver universal primary care with the removal of cost as a barrier to access for patients, the work of the special delivery unit in tackling waiting times and establishing hospital groups, and the introduction of a more transparent and efficient money-follows-the-patient funding mechanism for hospitals.<\/p><p> In February 2012, I established an implementation group on universal health insurance to assist in developing detailed and costed implementation proposals for universal health insurance and in driving the implementation of various elements of the reform programme.  We must learn from other countries and build on best international experience.  This is reflected in the membership of the UHI implementation group.  The UHI implementation group comprises a mix of those with executive responsibilities within our health services and external expertise, including international experts working with the World Health Organization and the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies.<\/p><p> In addition, my officials have been examining the experience of health reforms in a range of countries, including the Netherlands and Germany.  This analysis is vital to enhancing our knowledge and informing policy.  A prerequisite for designing the UHI model for Ireland, however, is that it meets the needs of individuals in Ireland and that it achieves the best outcomes for patients.  This requires that we have regard to our starting point, that we carefully plan and sequence the reform programme and that we give detailed consideration to the most appropriate structures for delivery of different services.  Ultimately, the Government is committed to introducing an Irish model of universal health insurance that best fits the Irish system.<\/p><p> The Department is advancing work on drafting the White Paper on universal health insurance which will outline details of the UHI model in addition to the estimated costs and financing mechanisms associated with the introduction of universal health insurance.  Preparation of the White Paper is a complex and technical process requiring significant research and financial modelling to support analysis and costing of different design options.  My Department is engaged in a process to ensure availability of the necessary expertise to support work on preparing the White Paper in 2013.<\/p><p> In the meantime and in advance of the White Paper, my Department published a preliminary paper on UHI.  That paper provides a succinct update on work on universal health insurance as well as providing further details on the path ahead.  The reform programme is a major undertaking that requires careful planning and sequencing over a number of years.  The implementation group will assist, advise on and oversee different elements of the reforms as they are being put in place.  It is also my intention to consult widely as part of the reform implementation process.<\/p><p> Several Deputies referred to medical cards and, in particular, individuals with very serious health conditions.  More than 1.8 million medical cards have been issued to individuals, the highest percentage of the population covered in the history of the State.  Medical cards are provided to persons who, under the provisions of the Health Act 1970 are, in the opinion of the HSE, unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants.  Under the legislation, determination of eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  The assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants.<\/p><p> Under the legislation, there is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with a specific illness such as cancer.  There is, however, a provision for discretion by the HSE to grant a card in cases of undue hardship where the income guidelines are exceeded.  The HSE set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards where there are difficult personal circumstances.<\/p><p> Most importantly, the HSE has an effective system in place in relation to the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally ill, or who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford.  Emergency medical cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant.  This can be initiated through the local health office by the office manager who has access to a dedicated fax and e-mail contact within the primary care reimbursement service.<\/p><p>While it can take a day to produce the plastic card physically and a further day to allow for its arrival in the post, the medical card number can be provided to the local office or social worker within 24 hours, if requested.  Once approved, any primary care contractor can validate the entitlement of a client through the online system.<\/p><p> With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card.  As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months.<\/p><p> The arrangement is slightly different for persons with a terminal illness.  No means test applies to an application by a terminally ill patient.  Once the terminal illness is verified, the patient is given an emergency medical card for six months.  Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible.<\/p><p> Some Members mentioned the backlog of medical card applications.  The major backlog of last year has been cleared.  Furthermore, in the case of discretionary medical cards, there was the backlog towards the end of last year and that has been reduced, from 3,500 to only nine cases today.  Contrary to some of the contributions and common belief, the centralisation of medical cards has resulted in an &euro;8 million saving to date.  The PCRS can be commended on the work it has done to address the issue of backlogs and in bringing in a more efficient system.<\/p><p> The issue of free GP care was also raised.  The Bill to allow for the extension of free GP care to persons with prescribed illnesses will be published in the next couple of weeks.  Progress also continues to be made in building primary care capacity and in chronic disease management, particularly for the management of diabetes which will commence in the coming months.<\/p><p> Some Members asked what I was doing to address the costs of health insurance.  I can assure the House that the Government is committed to keeping down the cost of health insurance so that it is affordable for as many people as possible.  We remain committed to protecting community rating, whereby everyone pays the same price for the same health insurance product, irrespective of age or health status.<\/p><p> The programme for Government contains a commitment to put a permanent scheme of risk equalisation in place, which is a key requirement for the existing private health insurance market and is designed to keep health insurance affordable for older persons and to maintain the stability of the market.  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012 gave effect to a new risk equalisation scheme with effect from 1 January 2013.  This will contribute to the protection of affordability for those who need it most.  It is important to note that the measures contained in the new risk equalisation scheme are designed to result in no overall increase of premiums paid in the market.  Rather it is intended to spread the risk more evenly between the healthy and the less healthy, as well as the old and the young.<\/p><p> I have repeatedly raised the issue of costs with health insurers as a whole and I am determined to address costs in the sector in the interests of consumers.  Last year, I established the health insurance consultative forum which comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority and the Department of Health.  The forum was established to generate ideas which would help address health insurance costs, while always respecting the requirements of competition law.  Given the VHI's significant share of overall costs in the market at 80%, I will continue to focus strongly on the need for the VHI to address its costs and to address aggressively the base cost of procedures, including professional fees.  I will also continue to focus on the need for more robust auditing and the need for clinical auditing to be introduced, which would be for the first time.  In other words, the treatments that some clinicians are delivering would be challenged as to their necessity.<\/p><p> The issue of delays in replies to parliamentary questions was commented on by many Members and I am happy to provide some detailed information.  My Department received over 7,500 parliamentary questions in 2012.  Some 4,045 of these concerned operational issues and were referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Members.  In its service plan, the executive has a commitment to answer within 15 working days 75% of parliamentary questions referred to it.  Of the 4,045 referred to it for direct reply, 74% were answered within 15 working days and 83% within 20 working days.  This represented a significant improvement on 2011 when the percentage answered within 15 days was 56%.  Of the total amount of parliamentary questions referred to it in 2012, only 64 remained open at the year end.  We want to improve further on this by examining IT solutions that would help Deputies and Senators to track the progress of parliamentary questions.<\/p><p> Procurement issues were also raised in the debate.  The HSE is fully committed to the Government's procurement objectives and initiatives and will continue to support the Government programme to reform public sector procurement.  Adherence to the Government's public service reform objectives regarding the use of shared services will be a requirement for the newly created structures, in procurement and other matters.  The director general designate of the HSE has acknowledged that the new governance and management arrangements for the future health service will require us to change radically the way we approach the provision of shared or common services to meet the needs of all parts of the health system.  In addition, the financial challenges we face mean we must take advantage of any opportunity for increased value in the way we provide such services.<\/p><p> As this day marks two years in Government, I have mentioned some of the progress that has been made but I might just mention some other areas.  On outpatients, there are clear and comprehensive data now being reported for the first time which will allow the special delivery unity and the National Treatment Purchase Fund to target resources at the longest waiting lists.  There are new cystic fibrosis services in the Nutley wing of St Vincent's Hospital which opened in the summer of 2012 at a cost of almost &euro;30 million.  There is the decision to co-locate the new national children's hospital at St James's, made in November 2012.  Thirty-five locations for primary care centres have been identified, of which 20 will be commissioned subject to the agreement between the local GPs and the HSE on active local GP involvement and subject to site suitability and availability.<\/p><p> In October 2012, a new drug pricing agreement was reached with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, which will deliver savings in excess of &euro;400 million over a three year period.  Approximately half its value - &euro;210 million - will be used to cover the cost of new drugs from 2013 to 2015.  The balance will go towards reducing expenditure on drugs supplied through the General Medical Services scheme and community drugs schemes.  The Department and the HSE have also reached an agreement with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland, APMI, which will deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs.  Total gross savings, between the IPHA and APMI agreements, for 2013 will be in the region of &euro;120 million.  There is also a drug reference pricing Bill, which is going to committee this week or early next week, that will allow us, after consultation, to set the price for generic drugs.  We have a new medicine management initiative, as outlined by Deputy Barry.<\/p><p> The HSE's health care capital allocation for the period 2012 to 2016 is &euro;1.87 billion, of which &euro;1.67 billion is allocated for construction of health care facilities and the remaining &euro;200 million is allocated to ICT infrastructure.  In addition, the Government announced in November 2011, that up to &euro;200 million from the proceeds of the sale of the national lottery would be allocated for the construction of the new national children's hospital.  We have also appointed the chair to the new national children's hospital group.<\/p><p> We will be opening new facilities.  There will be a new wing at Ennis hospital.  The new emergency department at Letterkenny is finished and will be opened officially later this year.  The outpatient and emergency department at the Mater hospital are completed and we are making progress with the new central mental hospital.<\/p><p> Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services in Ireland was published on 20 July 2012, the National Housing Strategy for People with Disability 2011-2016 was approved by Government in October 2011, and the implementation framework was jointly published with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Affairs in July 2012.<\/p><p> The children, adolescents and young people with complex disabilities unit, led by a principal officer, has been established in the Department of Health.  On 1 January of this year a permanent scheme of risk equalisation put in place in the private health insurance market.<\/p><p>In December the Government approved the implementation of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland case by way of legislation with regulations, within the parameters of Article 43.3.3&deg; of the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the X case and progress has been made towards producing the heads of a Bill.<\/p><p><br \/> There many other areas relating to older people, health and well-being, and health protection.  Deputies asked about the &#8364;35 million earmarked for mental health and the increase in the number of beds for child and adolescent psychiatry.  There were also issues around the drugs task forces, HR and health reform as I have outlined.  So there has been considerable improvement.<\/p><p><br \/> I also wish to mention the long-running problem with Tallaght Hospital board has been resolved.  Hospital groups have been set up in Galway and Limerick, with a phenomenal effect in Galway in particular.  Clinical programmes are moving ahead - we have developed them in emergency medicine, acute medicine, fragile older patients, stroke care and heart failure.  For the first time anywhere in the world that we are aware of, we have introduced a new early-warning scorecard so that doctors and nurses in Tralee will react in the same way as they would in Letterkenny, the Mater Hospital or St. James's Hospital in the face of a patient who may be deteriorating.  The screening for bowel cancer has commenced.<\/p><p><br \/> The reforms will continue unabated.  I will not be deflected from the course we have set.  I remain determined, as does the Government, to see this through.  I am as committed to it as ever.  I am more certain and convinced than ever that we will succeed because of the new leadership emerging in the HSE, the Department of Health and indeed the VHI, but most importantly among the clinicians, medical nursing and allied professionals - the men and women on the front line who have already delivered so much for us in terms of the improvements I set out earlier.<\/p><p><br \/> Molaim an Bille don Teach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600040#OO00200","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1362589800,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 89; N\u00edl, 43.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Paul Kehoe and Emmet Stagg; N\u00edl, Deputies Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Feargha\u00edl and Jonathan O'Brien.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600043#RR00200","aye":["1062","980","974","946","1079","989","1029","1030","1042","975","1092","988","1031","972","1041","1087","1099","991","986","1091","968","1075","1107","1011","1103","957","1078","1014","1085","1009","1068","1055","1019","1076","995","1106","958","1089","949","967","1097","973","1033","1012","1098","1088","1072","1021","1110","990","1023","996","1000","1017","997","1082","1038","1027","1026","1004","1070","985","1034","1067","1177","1056","1045","1018","1060","1058","1069","1073","971","1005","1063","964","966","947","952","1074","1013","979","1048","961","1104","1010","950","1109","1024"],"nay":["1066","1003","1020","1096","1071","1032","1057","1083","1101","1037","1015","959","1022","1047","1084","1050","960","1049","954","983","1040","998","999","1008","1090","993","965","981","987","1052","1175","969","1044","1054","1028","984","1059","1001","953","1178","970","1102","956"]},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill 2012 [Seanad]: Referral to Select Committee","time":1362590400,"counter":457,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600044#SS00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1362590400,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Sub-Committee on Health pursuant to Standing Orders 82A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and (6)(<i>a<\/i>) and 126(1) of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600044#SS00200","speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1362590400,"counter":459,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Seanad","time":1362590400,"counter":460,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600044#SS00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1362590400,"counter":461,"content":"<p>Seanad &Eacute;ireann has passed the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013, without amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600044#SS00500","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Defence Forces (Second World War Amnesty and Immunity) Bill 2012 [Seanad]: Second Stage","time":1362590400,"counter":462,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600044#SS00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1362590400,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p><p>  I am pleased to present the Defence Forces (Second World War Amnesty and Immunity) Bill 2012 to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  When the Bill was published last December, the Minister, Deputy Shatter, said that he hoped that the actions proposed in the Bill would help put to rest the concerns of those individuals still alive who fought for freedom and against tyranny with the Allied Forces during the Second World War.  He also expressed the view that the Bill might lift a veil for the families of those who have already died.  Having had the honour of taking the Committee and Report Stages of the Bill in the Seanad last month, and having heard the very positive contributions from all sides of that House, I believe that the optimism expressed by the Minister will be the case.<\/p><p>At its peak during the Second World War, the Irish Defence Forces had approximately 42,000 serving personnel.  Over the course of the war, it is estimated that more than 7,000 members of the Defence Forces deserted, many to join the Allied Forces.  Of these, approximately 2,500 personnel returned to their units or were apprehended and tried by military tribunal.  The remaining personnel, numbering approximately 5,000, were the subject of dismissal under the Emergency Powers (No. 362) Order 1945 and the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act 1946.<\/p><p> The emergency powers order, which was signed by the then Taoiseach on 8 August 1945, provided for automatic dismissal from the Defence Forces of certain deserters and absentees without leave.  The order also provided for surrender of pay and allowances and a condition that every person to whom the order applied should be disqualified for seven years from holding any office or employment remunerated from the Central Fund.  This was subsequently enacted by the Oireachtas in the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act 1946.<\/p><p> The effect of the order was to impose significant hardship on many individuals and families and remove from them the right to be tried for the offences of which they stood accused and to provide a defence against the alleged crime.  Many of the individuals were shunned in their communities and many never returned to Ireland.  It is understood that some of those who were the subject of the order had actually died in combat.  The majority of the individuals impacted by the order have now passed on, while those still alive are in their twilight years.<\/p><p> It was against this backdrop that in June 2012, following detailed consideration of the issue, the Government concluded that the sacrifice and contribution of those who deserted from the Defence Forces to fight on the Allied side in the Second World War should be recognised, while not undermining the requirements of military discipline or in any way condoning their desertion in a time of national emergency.  In this context the Government committed to issuing an apology for the manner in which those members of the Defence Forces who left to join the Allied side during the period from 1939 to 1945 were treated after the war by the State and to seek to provide a legal mechanism for an amnesty to those who absented themselves from our Defence Forces for this reason.  It is these individuals whom the Defence Forces (Second World War Amnesty and Immunity) Bill 2012 seeks to address.<\/p><p> The ability of the Defence Forces to maintain the high standards demanded of them requires complete clarity with regard to the exercise of command authority whether at home or abroad.  To maintain standards and rise to the challenges of a military environment and all of the associated tasks, it is important to uphold a chain of command that is clear and unambiguous at all times.  This is critical to the maintenance of unit cohesion and operational effectiveness.  In this regard, it goes without saying that the Defence Forces must retain the power to enforce discipline through its own unique code of discipline within the military justice system.  This disciplinary code must be efficient and effective, and above all else it must be fair to the individual.<\/p><p> In common with armies throughout the world, desertion from the Irish Defence Forces is regarded as a very serious offence.  It is at the heart of the system of military discipline that when an individual takes the solemn oath at the commencement of his or her career, he or she cannot decide to just up and leave or fail to be available to perform duties.  While this is very much the case today, it would especially have been the case at a time when the world was at war and our troops were on standby to defend our country from invasion.<\/p><p> Before elaborating on the Bill, it is important to put on the record of the House the fact that the Government recognises the value and importance to the State of the essential service given by all those who served in the Defence Forces throughout the period of the Second World War.  They performed a crucial duty for the State at a time of national emergency and enormous difficulty.  The loyalty of the Defence Forces to the State is indispensable.  It is essential to the national interest that members of the Defence Forces do not abandon their duties at any time, especially at a time of crisis, and no responsible Government could ever depart from this principle.  It is important we acknowledge that throughout the Second World War, the vast majority of men chose to stay in the Defence Forces and serve their own country.  These members were engaged in important service for their country and it is crucial that nothing we do now in any way diminishes or undervalues their loyalty and the service given by them to the State.<\/p><p> Having said this, it is accepted by most people today that the majority of those who deserted the Defence Forces during the Second World War and who went on to fight against fascism did so out of a sense of idealism and with a commitment to protect democracies from tyranny and totalitarianism.  Had there been a different outcome to the Second World War there is no reason to believe this State would have been immune to invasion.<\/p><p> In seeking to address the question of desertion during the Second World War, the Government has already acknowledged that the war gave rise to grave and exceptional circumstances.  Members of the Defence Forces left their posts at that time to join the Allied side in the fight against tyranny, and together with many thousands of other Irish men and women, these individuals played an important role in defending freedom and democracy.  Those who fought on the Allied side also contributed to protecting the State's sovereignty and independence and our democratic values.<\/p><p> It will be accepted by all in this House that in the almost 74 years since the outbreak of the Second World War, our understanding of history has matured.  History teaches us lessons which can sometimes only be learned with the benefit of hindsight.  The actions of those taken long ago, for whatever reasons, are not beyond re-evaluation.  These actions can now be considered free from the constraints that bound those directly involved at the time and without questioning or revisiting their motivation.  As the Minister, Deputy Shatter, has stated, the exploits of the men who left the Defence Forces to join the Allies have been politically airbrushed out of our contemporary history, but at this time of greater insight and understanding of the shared history and experiences of Ireland and Britain, the time is right for the role played by these brave volunteer Irish veterans to be recognised and the rejection they experienced understood.<\/p><p> From the remove of 2013, it is very hard to imagine the difficult decisions people made when they consciously decided to leave Ireland to join the Allied Forces during the course of the Second World War.  During that period Ireland decided to remain neutral, but it is safe to say that at the time anti-British feeling was still running very high.  Despite this, over the period of the Second World War an estimated 60,000 individually motivated citizens from the Twenty-six Counties left these shores to serve as volunteers in the British armed forces.  While at the end of the war many of those who chose to fight with the Allies stayed on and sought to build lives for themselves, many more returned to Ireland.<\/p><p> There is no doubt that many veterans returning to Ireland at the end of the Second World War were met with grudging acceptance, but it is also clear that others faced hostility.  This would be particularly true when the individual was known to have deserted the Defence Forces.  For all of them, the honour and celebration which they may have experienced at the end of the war in England contrasted sharply with the changed circumstances of their return.  There was no flag waving or cheering masses to greet them here.  Instead they were faced with difficulties in seeking either work or social assistance, and many of their countrymen and women remained suspicious towards these individuals long after their return.<\/p><p> Before moving on to detail the specific provisions of the Bill, it is important that - just as the Minister, Deputy Shatter, did on Second Stage in the Seanad - I should re-emphasise that the Government does not condone desertion.  The Government fully recognises, values and respects the contribution of all those who stood by their posts with the Defence Forces and pledged their lives to defend this State's integrity and sovereignty against any and all aggressors.  In any consideration of the matter, we must also bear in mind the principle that such decisions cannot be left to the discretion of individual soldiers on active service.  All soldiers must accept that there are consequences for desertion.<\/p><p> I now move on to the specific provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 outlines the definitions for the purposes of the Bill.  Section 2 provides for an amnesty for members of the Defence Forces who deserted or were absent without leave during the course of the Second World War and who subsequently served with forces fighting on the Allied side in that war and who were dismissed from the Defence Forces by the Emergency Powers Order 1945, were convicted of desertion or being absent without leave, or were or are liable to be prosecuted for desertion or being absent without leave.<\/p><p> Deputies will have noticed the Bill provides for an amnesty for those convicted of desertion or being absent without leave, rather than a pardon as was originally envisaged by Government.  This change has been made for technical reasons and is in line with legal advice provided to me during the drafting process by the Attorney General to the effect that a pardon would require that each case be individually processed, a situation that would clearly not be possible in practical terms.<\/p><p> Section 3 provides an immunity from prosecution for members of the Defence Forces who deserted or were absent without leave during the course of the Second World War and who subsequently served with forces fighting on the Allied side in that war.  Section 4 provides that no right, liability or any cause of action shall arise resulting from the enactment.  Section 4 also provides that the amnesty being provided in section 2 will not have the effect of a pardon under Article 13.6 of the Constitution.  Section 5 provides for the Short Title of the Bill.<\/p><p> I am satisfied that the Bill as drafted fully meets the Government's commitment to deal in a positive way with the issue of those who deserted our Defence Forces to join with the Allied Forces during the course of the Second World War, and that it does so in a way that does not expose the State to any liability in respect of those individuals.<\/p><p> I also believe that if this Bill is enacted it will send an important message to those people surviving, and the relatives of those that have since passed on.  That message is that they can be proud of their contribution, or their relatives' contribution, in the fight for freedom.  Indeed, it is more than that.  As we look to the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the commencement of the Great War, the 75th anniversary of the start of the Second World War in 2014 and the remembrance of all those who served and died in those conflicts, the survivors and the relatives of those who have since passed on can proudly commemorate the sacrifices they made during a very difficult time, not only in Irish history but in the history of Europe and the wider world.<\/p><p> I am pleased to submit this legislation for the consideration of the House.  I look forward with anticipation to hearing the views and contributions of Deputies in their deliberations and reflections on the Bill.<\/p><p> I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600044#SS00800","speaker":"1098","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362591300,"counter":466,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dh&eacute;anamh leis an Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Kehoe, agus leis an Aire Cosanta, an Teachta Shatter, as ucht na hoibre at&aacute; d&eacute;anta acu ar an mBille t&aacute;bhachtach seo.

In discussing the soldiers who deserted to support the Allied war effort, we should not lose sight of all the other Irishmen and women who left these shores at that time.  It is estimated that approximately 60,000 did so from the Twenty-six Counties and upwards of another 60,000 from the Six Counties.  They participated in the effort against what was a fundamentally evil regime.  We all accept that those who participated in the battle against Hitler's monstrous regime were fighting in the interests of humanity.<\/p><p><br \/>  As we meet to debate these matters, we remember in particular those who lost their lives.  Like Deputy Clare Daly, I come from County Kildare and we have a particularly strong tradition of support and respect for the Defence Forces.  It goes back beyond the foundation of the State because within our county many members of the British armed forces were based for many years.  Therefore, our tradition and respect in Kildare is strong.<\/p><p><br \/>  In examining this matter, I was interested in the writings of one of our well respected solicitors and historians in Kildare, Mr. Frank Taffe.  He has researched the number of Kildare people whose family members who took part in the Second World War or who fought in it themselves.  I will read into the record of the House an extract from one of Mr. Taffe's writings entitled &quot;Eye on the Past&quot;.  He is writing here about reading a book on the personnel who had deserted and who participated in the war effort.  He states:<blockquote>I went through the book at the time and extracted the names of 19 Athy men from the town and surrounding countryside who were included in what was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Irish list of shame&quot;.  For my part, I never regarded the book in that light and especially so after I had the privilege of interviewing one of the men who was so listed.  His story was a simple one.  Without work and with no prospect of getting work, he enlisted in the Irish Army only to find conditions and food so bad as to be intolerable.  He, in company with so many of his army colleagues, travelled by train to Belfast to enlist in the British armed forces.  His was not an ordinary act of desertion, rather a simple man's response to what he felt was an uncaring Irish Army regime which treated its recruits with callous disregard for their well-being.  He fought alongside Irishmen, Englishmen, Scotsmen and Welshmen throughout the Second World War and never once did anyone question his right to do so.<\/blockquote>  In examining some of the statistics concerning this particular issue, I was also struck by the fact that the first RAF bomber pilot to be shot down and killed in 1939 was Willie Murphy from Cork.  His navigator, Larry Slattery from Thurles, became the longest serving prisoner of war.<\/p><p>Moreover, the co-pilot of the last RAF bomber to be shot down over Germany and killed in May 1945, as the horror came to an end, was an Irish man named Pilot Officer William Mackay.  In common with many Irish families, I have my own experience, which is that my only aunt and godmother went to London in the early 1940s and met a young man who had grown up and been educated in Dublin.  He had left the country for economic reasons and then joined the Irish Guards, as many Irish people subsequently did.  He went on to be shot down over Tunisia and is buried, together with many others Irish comrades, in Tunis.  This topic resonates with people up and down the country and all of them, including those who were directly connected to those who simply volunteered and those who are connected with those people who deserted for whatever reason, are welcoming of the fact that the Government and Members are debating this issue today in a positive and, hopefully, a constructive way.<\/p><p><br \/> When one considers those statistics of between 6,000 and 7,000 people who left the Defence Forces, it is interesting that at time, they were at the incredible strength of 42,000 men.  If I have read the records correctly, between 1939 and 1945 the strength of the Defence Forces ranged between 40,000 and 60,000 at any given time.  Professor Michael Kennedy of the Royal Irish Academy raises the point that while we know that perhaps 5,000 of these deserters went on to join the British armed forces, we do not know precisely what became of the rest of them and whether they became involved in the war effort in Britain.  The Minister has highlighted the impact of the procedures that were in place at the time and he spoke of how those who were dismissed were disqualified for seven years from any public or Civil Service employment, including employment with local authorities or positions on any board or office of semi-State companies.  Moreover, such individuals would have no pension entitlements from the day on which they absconded and no entitlement to receive unemployment assistance.<\/p><p><br \/> If one looks back at the period, there were pretty genuine reasons for the harsh nature of the imposition of such penalties.  The Government of the day decided to punish desertion in this way rather than in the traditional military fashion with courts martial because of the scale of the desertion.  It would have been impossible logistically to court martial 5,000 deserters and certainly it was not practical.  At the time, according to the then Minister for Defence, Oscar Traynor in 1946:<blockquote>It was not deemed feasible to hold courts martial on the large number, even if they could be apprehended.  A question would arise as to whether they could be apprehended, or be apprehended for a long period of years.<\/blockquote>The Minister at the time also held that courts martial would have resulted in more serious punishments for deserters.  He stated &quot;if these men had been tried by court martial and dealt with through the medium of courts martial many of them would have received very severe sentences&quot;.  As for the exclusion from State employment, the Minister in 1946 gave preference to those who had not deserted and stated &quot;whatever number of vacancies exist will be held for the men who served this nation loyally&quot;.  The decision was criticised strongly by the Opposition parties, who thought this desertion should have been dealt with in the traditional manner.  The Opposition parties on this occasion certainly are a hell of a lot more mild-mannered in their approach.<\/p><p><br \/> It is important to refer to the context of this issue, which often is viewed with the benefit of hindsight in the context of Irish neutrality and British-Irish relations.  It is not viewed sufficiently often in the context of the human relations that existed between citizens in this State and those in Britain, that is, Scotland, England and Wales.  Members are discussing a situation in which initiatives were taken by a fledgling State which was extremely anxious to demonstrate to its neighbours and to the world that it was an independent State which was proud of that sovereignty it recently had won and was determined to protect.  It also was a policy which had widespread public support in this country.  One should remember this was not the only country that did not rush to the war effort.  The American Government, despite pleas for its support and participation, only became involved after the attack on Pearl Harbor.  This context for what happened is extremely important and one should not lose sight of it.  The Emergency years in Ireland were extremely difficult years for the public at large.  Sustaining the Defence Forces to be able to respond to any eventuality by keeping it at a strength of between 40,000 and 60,000 people was a real challenge for the Government of the day and constituted a cost on the taxpayer of the time.  While the State obviously did not suffer the horrors of war, it still was a time of crisis, rationing and privation for many citizens, and allowing desertion to go unpunished simply was not an option for the Government in 1945.  Moreover, while one brutal war may have ended, who was to say that another would not have broken out?  The Cold War was about to start and in the circumstances, no government could do anything other than to impose the most stringent penalties on deserters.<\/p><p><br \/> However, in the more enlightened and peaceful period we now are privileged to enjoy, one can look back with greater compassion and greater understanding.  One can empathise with those people who, for whatever reason, felt the need to leave the Irish Defence Forces.  Some of them, I am sure, were motivated by the highest ideals while others perhaps were not but saw an opportunity to get out of a country that was under extreme economic pressure at the time, as also is the case today.  However, it is appropriate that the Bill the Minister of State has introduced will receive the support of all parties in this House and that Members will enact it as soon as possible.  It is appropriate to tell those very few survivors of that turbulent period that the Houses of the Oireachtas respect the contribution they made to the Allied cause and to the war against a brutal and monstrous regime and that Members, albeit belatedly, thank them and congratulate them on what they did and that where their emotions were right, Members are happy and content as a Parliament to extend an amnesty to them.  I am unsure of what practical benefit this will be to any of those remaining people affected but at least, like the Taoiseach's apology some weeks ago to the Magdalen laundry women, it has an important symbolic effect on all those involved.  Consequently, with those few thoughts, I also commend the legislation to the House and thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600046#UU00200","speaker":"1054","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362591900,"counter":468,"content":"<p>Measaim go bhfuil s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach labhairt ar an mBille seo.

A great number of Irish men died in Second World War battles and their sacrifice is, rightly, the subject of a regularised annual commemoration in the State.  Regrettably, some died on the Axis side and their memory is in many ways besmirched by the fact that they fought on that side.<\/p><p> However, we are addressing the issues surrounding those who deserted the State's Defence Forces 60 years ago to join another army to fight Nazism and Hitler's army in Europe.  Given the lapse of time, it is impractical to revisit the individual circumstances surrounding each case and many of those who survived the war are deceased.  The amnesty provided in the legislation has been deemed the most appropriate means to acknowledge that these men deserted to do a greater good and their insubordination and perceived treasonous act in fighting an evil threatening the very fabric of democracy, society and the world was not wrong.  It is felt that an amnesty will bring the matter to a close.<\/p><p> The amnesty is a redress measure.  I remind the Minister of State of the Government's responsibility to apologise, for instance, to the survivors of symphysiotomy or to the survivors of the Bethany Homes who were left out of any attempt to make amends when the State dealt with the Magdalen laundries women only last week.  The children of those who deserted were promptly taken by the &quot;cruelty men&quot; and put into forced labour in industrial schools and laundries for their so-called crimes of their fathers.  Hopefully, we will revisit this.  It is not the issue today but it needs to be taken on board.  Thankfully, the State has, in recent years, accepted its responsibility to apologise for past mistakes and wrongs.  Our society is big enough and strong enough to admit that there were failings in the State and all of us have failings in our lives.  That is a sign of a mature society and, hopefully, the wrongs I have mentioned will be addressed.<\/p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in approves of this Bill as a recognition of the response to the actions of deserters at the time.  They were faced with the Emergency Powers (No. 362) Order 1940 and summary dismissal and they were punitively prevented from gaining employment from the State having been dishonourably discharged after absconding.  Bizarrely, while they were barred from State employment on returning, the State made administrative provision in order that they could receive pension entitlements from the British authorities.  On the one hand, they received their British entitlement for their service during the war but the State would not give them recognition in any shape or form.<\/p><p> I also understand the concerns of the current and formers members of the Defence Forces regarding the Bill when they face the level of cutbacks currently under way and the continued downsizing and downgrading because it must feel like a kick in the teeth to them for an amnesty to be granted to those who upped sticks and left at a time of the State's greatest need.  Ireland, despite being neutral, also faced the threat of invasion not only by the Nazis but by the British who had drawn up a plan to invade and reconquer the island at the time.  That must not be forgotten because two foreign armies were stationed on Irish soil.  The British and US armies were based for the duration of the war in the Six Counties in large numbers in preparation for D-Day and its aftermath.<\/p><p> It is in that context that it is important to recognise those who remained in Ireland and served the Defence Forces throughout the Second World War and acknowledge the fact that they did not abandon their duties, although, as an Irish republican, I wish some of them had because many of those imprisoned by the State might not have served time in the internment camp in the Curragh and some of those executed by the State might have been freed to live a longer life.  Perhaps the State will revisit this issue as well.<\/p><p> The fundamental point of this Bill is to say that at the time it was not feasible for the Government to have gone through the normal channels of military justice which would have entailed the rounding up, court-martialing and imprisonment of almost 5,000 men.  That is what is said but it should be recalled that most of those who deserted left the country quickly and were members of various armies, including the British, US and Canadian before they were even missed.  It would have been impractical for the Army to consider rounding them up.  I am not aware of any Defence Forces deserter who ended up fighting in the Axis armies but others of many hues, some of whom represented the State, besmirched their reputation and Ireland's reputation by aligning themselves with Hitler's grand plans and, in some cases, collaborating with his genocidal policies.<\/p><p> On the question of courts martial, the Fianna F&aacute;il Administration at the time was easily able to summons courts martial when it suited, especially to intern and convict, including execution, republicans during the Emergency.  The State was so distracted rounding up republicans that it could not have rounded up all the deserters if they had remained in the country and the Curragh was over capacity, as internees were imprisoned for years on end.  It could not or would not pursue deserters because its main target was republicans.  During this period, there was a nod and wink support of the Allied forces by the state, with captured British airmen, etc., always finding their way north, even though they had been captured, and information gleaned by G2 and the Garda special branch was exchanged and passed to civil servants, which then mysteriously found its way into British hands.<\/p><p> Just as I commend those who went and fought to prevent the spread of fascism, especially those who joined armies other than the British army, which was an occupying force in Ireland, I commend those who left Ireland and fought against fascism in the Spanish Civil War.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600047#VV00200","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362592500,"counter":470,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600048#WW00200","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1362592500,"counter":471,"content":"<p>It should not be forgotten this was at a time Nazi Germany was supplying General Franco of Spain with the hardware to bomb towns and cities such as Guernica and to gun down many brave Spanish and international comrades at battlefronts across the Spanish state.  I wonder when the State or the church will apologise to the volunteers and their families who had to sneak out of the country to fight the evils of fascism which they understood three years before the outbreak of the Second World War.  They understood the dangers of Franco's dictatorship and the ideals he, Hitler and others in Europe shared at this stage.  Those volunteers were excommunicated, ostracised and discriminated against by the church and elements in the State because they had the gall and bravery to stand up for the greater good of society and against the evils of fascism, whether it was in Ireland or in Europe.  They suffered the same retribution Irish republicans and their families suffered during the foundation of the State, the Civil War and for a number of years afterwards in Ireland through torture, imprisonment and execution, ostracisation, exile, discrimination, being pilloried and censure.<\/p><p>  It is interesting that a Fine Gael Minister in introducing the Bill acknowledged that the State wronged those who were fighting fascism, given their Blueshirt history.  His party is a merger of the Blueshirts, the Army Comrades Association, National Guard, Cumann na nGaedhael, the National Centre Party and some southern Unionists.  It is not that they gave a good account of themselves fighting fascism in Spain because they spent most of their time cowering in the trenches or, when ordered from the front by Franco, cowering in the wine bars before being sent home in disgrace.  There have been no apologies from Fine Gael for the wrongs done to them and their families.<\/p><p>Where is the amnesty or pardon for the members of the Defence Forces who joined the Free State forces in the mistaken belief they would stand by the Republic but then left, having seen sense, to join the IRA during the civil war?  No such apology has been given and the individuals in question have not been recognised.

While debate on this issue is for forums other than this Chamber, in academia and elsewhere, I do not believe the Minister is correct.  It was not the Holocaust that motivated the Allied powers to come together; they were motivated by a wish to defeat the Axis powers.  The USSR and United States both remained neutral until they were attacked and did not join the war as a result of the Holocaust.  Regardless of one's views on the rights or wrongs of their positions, these are the facts. <\/p><p> Among the 5,000 deserters - the figure is in dispute and may have been higher or substantially lower than this - many may have been ideologically motivated to leave the Defence Forces and defect to fight the Nazis.  Ideologically motivated or not, we should not misread the motivation of the Allied side in the early years of the war.  To do so is not to deny in any way the right and need to commemorate the memories of those who fought and what they fought against in the full context of the war.<\/p><p> Those who returned from the war were effectively blacklisted from employment, which consigned many of them poverty.  This discrimination was wrong and the State should have redressed it and the consequential poverty the individuals in question and their families had to endure years ago.  It is good, therefore, that this is being done today.  The emergency powers order denied these individuals the opportunity to defend themselves and their actions.  Given the time that has elapsed, it is impractical to visit each and every case of desertion and, therefore, it is much more appropriate to proceed with the Bill. <\/p><p> We should not be surprised by the manner in which the de Valera Government responded at the time given.  It also interned more than 2,000 republicans in the Curragh during the period it referred to as the Emergency.  Moreover, it showed scant regard for the rights of those who were held in the Curragh and it was brutal in its use of special powers.  It broke the men, many of whom were so distressed by the inhumane conditions in which they were forced to live that they simply could not function in normal society once they were released.  This is a legacy with which society must also live. <\/p><p> Three prisoners died on hunger strike against their imprisonment and the conditions in which they were held.  Jack McNeela, Tony D'Arcy and Sean McCaughey died protesting the conditions in the Curragh prison camps.  During Sean McCaughey's inquest, it was made known that he had not been outside in the fresh air or sunlight for four and a half years and had been kept for months on end in solitary confinement.  Se&aacute;n McBride, acting as counsel for the next-of-kin at the inquest, asked the prison doctor if he would keep a dog in such conditions, to which the doctor replied he would not.  The treatment of republican prisoners was in stark contrast to how certain other categories of prisoners were treated in the Curragh.  Soldiers from the Allied and Axis powers found themselves in Ireland during the Second World War and were held, following capture, as prisoners of war in the Curragh prison camp.  In contrast with republican prisoners, they were wined and dined, as it were, and in some cases British soldiers were allowed to attend social functions outside the camp.  Some of them even had their own bicycles and were allowed to travel to Dublin for events under supervision.  The position was bizarre, especially as others who had not been convicted and were not combatants in the war were not afforded similar rights.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600048#WW00300","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362593100,"counter":473,"content":"<p>They were not considered a threat to the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600049#XX00200","speaker":"1054"},{"type":"speech","time":1362593100,"counter":474,"content":"<p>They were a threat to the State because they were British soldiers in uniform when they landed here.

The Government even went as far as banning any mention of his killing by the State on radio and in newspapers to prevent any groundswell of public support.  George Plant, who had been an IRA volunteer since the 1920s, was a Protestant from the Minister of State's part of the country.  Plant was dubiously tried and sentenced to death for the capture and interrogation of an informer, an IRA chief-of-staff named Sean Hayes.  The State also executed, within weeks of arrest, volunteers Patrick McGrath and Tommy Harte, who were also refused the right of appeal, and volunteers Maurice O'Neill and Richard Goss.  Bernard Casey was shot dead in captivity in the Curragh.<\/p><p>  The Minister may argue that this is not the day for discussing these particular aspects of the State's wrongdoing.  However, if we are to embark on a journey of healing wounds inflicted by the State in the past, these matters must be addressed.  The State might not have such a schizophrenic approach to Irish reunification and its history and outworkings if it had faced up to its past and had a truth and reconciliation process at any stage since the 1920s.  We are suggesting such a process for the period since the late 1960s but the State, even at this late stage, could establish a truth and reconciliation process for past events.  It could even result in another merger, similar to that which took place when the Blueshirts, Cumann na nGaedhael and so forth came together, albeit this time between Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and maybe even Sinn F&eacute;in, given that we all came from the same party before going are separate ways. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600049#XX01000","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1362593100,"counter":482,"content":"<p>The potential is unlimited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600049#XX01100","speaker":"1054"},{"type":"speech","time":1362593100,"counter":483,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in, that is the alternative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600049#XX01200","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"speech","time":1362593100,"counter":484,"content":"<p>It may be appropriate to face into the centenary commemorations around the revolutionary period from 1916 to 1921 and the subsequent counter\u00adrevolutionary period.  Many long conversations need to be held about the actions of past governments and elements of the architecture of the State.  These include a discussion of what took place in Ireland during the Second World War.<\/p><p>  In all of this we need to heed rather than repeat the lessons of history.  We must be mindful and vigilant, especially in this era of recession, of those who resort to racism and anti-Semitism.  There are some in political life in Europe and beyond who hold similar views to those which led to the slaughter of the Holocaust and the Second World War.  We must not be complacent when it comes to the prospect of fascism.  While Greece does not have a history of fascism, Greek fascists did not fall from the sky.  The violently aggressive programme of impoverishing a nation at the behest of the troika, the victimisation of Greek people and the pitting of citizens against one another is fertile ground for fascism.  Members of the Golden Dawn party, which gained 7% in recent elections, openly give Nazi salutes and advocate fascist ideology.  The party scapegoats immigrants and, in one case, threatened to remove immigrant patients from Greek hospitals which were running low on medicines.  Golden Dawn appeared in Greece because racist ideas were allowed to fester in the public mind in combination with social dislocation and economic devastation.<\/p><p>We need to be mindful of this situation, not only in Ireland, but throughout Europe.<\/p><p> Thankfully, it appears the far right in this State is confined to the rooms of lonely men who lurk on far right Internet message boards posting racist messages or to the sad cases who believe that they can impress people by spray painting racist graffiti.  However, Governments inadvertently fuel extremist right-wing ideologies through certain actions.  I would urge caution, particularly given that, as we saw on television last night, elected councillors have freely called for apartheid for Travellers.  Even a former justice Minister was alleged to have made racist comments during the citizenship referendum.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, and some judges have strayed close to making racist comments about Travellers.  We must be mindful of our language.  Otherwise, we will fuel an element that once gave rise to fascism.  I am not making an allegation against any Deputy.  Rather, I am urging caution.  Some people feed on the type of language that we have heard in recent times, particularly as regards Travellers.<\/p><p> It does not take much for fascist or racist groups to gain a foothold when people are neglected and left weary from economic destruction and significant levels of unemployment.  Even Mr. Nick Griffin in Britain managed to get himself elected to the European Parliament.  These are dangerous ideologies and Greece will not be the last European country to witness a rise of a degree of fascism unless we address it early, something that Europe did not succeed in doing in the 1930s when the dangers were clear to everyone who was willing to listen and when the rest of Europe did not support those who stood by the republic in Spain in 1936 and beforehand.<\/p><p> While we are examining issues of the past and making right the wrongs, it is essential that we not impact on the future of the Republic while we are still attempting to create it.  This Bill is an important part of that vital debate.  It is believed that as many as 5,000 men deserted the Irish Defence Forces, 100 of whom are still alive.  I hope this Bill and its amnesty as regards their actions will give them some solace.  They are also owed the right to live out their days in a country that does not have the conditions necessary to feed into and breed fascism.  They should never need to see the forces that they fought against during the Second World War return to the fore.<\/p><p> My party and I will support the Bill in the D&aacute;il as we did in the Seanad.  This welcome legislation will address the issue in question.  Hopefully, it is a signal that many other wrongs will be addressed and that the issues I have raised will be discussed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600049#XX01300","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362593700,"counter":486,"content":"<p>Deputies Clare Daly and Finian McGrath are next and will share a speaking slot.

I am speaking as someone whose family's involvement dates back to the foundation of the Irish Army.  I am also an internationalist and a socialist.  In this context, I clearly understand that it is always ordinary people and soldiers who pay the price in war.  The Second World War was no different.  We all know the stories of the promises of freedom, &quot;homes fit for heroes&quot; and heroes who only returned fit for homes with all of the scars that accompany war.<\/p><p><br \/>  This is not just a question of how these men were treated at the time, but also of the long delay in the State's recognition of the situation as one that needed to be addressed.  That delay indicates a lack of political back bone.  The issue is also linked to our relationship with Britain.  Seven years after the end of the Second World War, the British Government announced an amnesty for 10,000 of its military's members who had deserted.  That army was actively involved in combat, yet here we are more than 60 years later still deliberating on what to do.<\/p><p><br \/>  We must approach the issue with a sense of history, perspective and humanity.  It was not just a matter of punishment.  The only reason for the delay and for the imposition of such punitive measures on Army deserters was that they deserted to the British army.  The issue has been surrounded by a certain amount of Anglophobia that has existed since the foundation of the State.  It is a legacy of the weak Irish State's hypocritical attitude in its dealings with Britain.  The battle was fought for independence against Britain.  However, as James Connolly warned at the time:<blockquote>If you remove the English army to-morrow and hoist the green flag over Dublin Castle, unless you set about the organisation of the Socialist Republic your efforts would be in vain.<br \/><br \/>England would still rule you.  She would rule you through her capitalists, through her landlords, through her financiers, through the whole array of commercial and individualist institutions she has planted in this country...  Nationalism without Socialism &#8211; without a reorganisation of society on the basis of a broader and more developed form of that common property...is only national recreancy.<\/blockquote>Since the State's foundation, we have continued to treat our citizens poorly and have not granted them their economic independence.  For this reason, many of the issues in question arise.  We are quite happy to export to Britain the nurses that we train in our hospitals.  We are quite happy to export Irish women and to agree that they have the legal right to travel to look after their health and to go to Britain for abortions, but a woman cannot have an abortion within her own country.<\/p><p><br \/>  Having examined the history books, the key reason that many people deserted the Army in desperation and went to Britain was not ideological, but owed to the State's failure to deal with the issue of economic independence.  A soldier was expected to raise his family on 14 shillings during the war.  It was not enough.  We must ask ourselves whether poverty is treason.  For many of those involved, it was not an easy decision.  They knew they would be vilified, but they clearly believed that, if they wanted to look after their families, they had no choice.  They were treated shabbily and unacceptably.  I am glad the issue is being tidied up now.<\/p><p><br \/>  I noted the Minister of State's points.  It was almost suggested by some Deputies that the lack of access to military courts did the people in question a favour and that emergency powers were used to help them.  I do not buy that argument.  Those powers were always wrong.  It was a starvation order.  It denied these men entitlements and gratuities, barred them from working in public jobs for seven years, disqualified them from receiving unemployment benefits etc.  One reason for military tribunals not being utilised was the fact that the issue would have attracted media attention.  Let us remember that de Valera had already embarrassed the country in international eyes by officially commiserating with the German Government on the death of Hitler.  Clearly, there was another motive for not dealing with deserters.<\/p><p><br \/>  I have little time remaining.  Emigration to Britain is continuing.  We are exporting people because this country is failing to provide them with a decent standard of living.  Irish firemen in New York and Irish nurses in England have been forced out of this country.  Army barracks are closing and allowances are being taken from soldiers.<\/p><p>The very circumstances which forced previous generations of Irish men in desperation to go and join the British army are alive and well now under the policies of austerity which are driving many people out of this country today.  We must be wary of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600050#YY00300","speaker":"1015","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1362594300,"counter":489,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Health Insurance: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]","time":1362594300,"counter":490,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600051#ZZ00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1362594300,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I apologise as I was delayed.  I compliment and thank the proposers of the motion, which is worthy.  We must examine the issue.  The population is ageing and, by extension, will become sicker.  We discussed the costs of various issues, including generic drugs, in the term of the previous Government.  I am a victim of the system myself.  I was rushed to a private hospital in the city last Tuesday.  I am paying private health cover for the past 20 years.  Thankfully, I came out the other side but I had a nice little bill of &euro;395.  My insurance did not cover the visit.  I was told that I had to go back for a scan which will cost &euro;700, which again is not covered even though I am paying health insurance for 20 years.  Health insurance is becoming more expensive and less cover is provided.  It is time for someone to stop the racket, the abuse and the extortionate charges of a range of people, including consultants, to the health care companies.<\/p><p>  I do not know how many increases we have had in the past two years.  No doubt the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesman and others have outlined the details.  We must grasp the nettle and deal with the issue because private health care charges are exorbitant.  We were promised changes in governance and a difference by the Government before the election.  We were promised a new era of transparency and openness.  However, we have a Minister who is compromised because he is involved in private health care.  He is involved in a private nursing home in my county.  I said it previously.  I thought the Taoiseach would have moved the Minister.  He is someone who should understand the brief as he is eminently qualified.  I do not challenge his bona fides in that regard.  However, he has a vested interest.  The Minister previously acted on behalf of his colleagues to strike a lucrative deal with the Government for a group of people within his own profession.<\/p><p>  Now the Minister is involved in property speculation.  He is in charge of the HSE which employs HIQA.  The latter closed down a nursing home in my county.  It literally terrorised and persecuted the nursing home.  When I inquired I discovered that HIQA had made only one fleeting visit to a nursing home in which the Minister has a stake.  How about that for transparency and openness?  Is it a case of jobs for the boys or we do what we like, not as we say?  It is not fair.  What is going on in health insurance is just a racket.  It is disgraceful.  It is going on in other areas of insurance also but it will not change until someone shouts &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;.  People cannot afford to pay premiums.  They are walking away in their droves from paying health insurance as they cannot afford it and the people who are paying are not covered when they require treatment.  The genie is out of the bottle.  Someone had better try to examine the situation and deal with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600051#ZZ00400","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1362594300,"counter":492,"content":"<p>The current statistic indicates that more than 200 people per day are abandoning their health insurance policies.  It is a frightening scenario when thousands of people with private health insurance are experiencing dramatic increases in 2013 with further increases of anything between 20% and 40% envisaged.  More than 300,000 health insurance customers on the cheapest plans are to lose full cover for procedures in private hospitals from April onwards.  In order to comply with the terms of the Government&rsquo;s new risk equalisation scheme, the cheaper plans will no longer be able to offer cover of more than 60% of the cost of day care procedures in a private hospital.<\/p><p>  The Minister&rsquo;s target is to raise an extra &euro;60 million this year by charging all private patients in public hospitals based on a charge of &euro;1,000 a night for a private bed compared to a cost of &euro;75 for a public bed.  To put it mildly, that is puzzling.  It is hard to fathom the vast difference in pricing.  Alarming figures are being bandied about regarding costs for some procedures being carried out through insurance cover.  Some operations require just an overnight stay in a private hospital and costs of between &euro;1,000 and &euro;3,000 have been mentioned.  Blatant overcharging is pushing up premiums.  That is a significant factor in the spiralling cost of premiums.<\/p><p>  In 2011, the VHI revealed that more than 30 hospital consultants received more than &euro;500,000 each from it.  One consultant on the VHI earning list for his private practice, who was also on the list of a number of other health insurance companies, earned more than &euro;1 million.  A lot of question marks hang over the VHI.  In 2005, it had 1.7 million customers.  Now it is down to 1.2 million, yet its number of employees has increased in a steady manner since 2005.  The VHI cost base is mainly due to abnormally high remuneration and increment rate.  That seems to be the root cause of its insolvency.  At this stage the taxpayer might be burdened by the European Court of Justice ruling that this country is in breach of its EU obligations by the exemption of the VHI from regulation by the Central Bank.  The VHI has been allowed to mismanage its affairs.  It has been propped up.  The Minister will have to urgently intervene and call a halt to the anomaly where competitors are subsidising the company for far too long.  If it is left unchecked it is heading for an increasingly expensive health insurance premium and it will accelerate rapidly the thousands opting out who are further pressurised with stretched household budgets to keep up with rising costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600051#ZZ00500","speaker":"1050"},{"type":"speech","time":1362594300,"counter":493,"content":"<p>The current system of health care in this country is similar to the system in operation in Legoland and Disneyland to decide who gets to use it next.

It was difficult to get in but once one got in, it was quite good.  From the perspective that one can use the system without paying for health insurance on the basis that one has paid for it through one&rsquo;s taxes begs the question of whether that part of the system needs to change much.  I agree in principle with the notion of universal health care.  It makes sense.  One of the issues that must be tackled if one wants it to work out well, because otherwise it will cost too much, is that one must get rid of the waste and overspending.  The cost of drugs is the obvious case that comes to mind in the context of overspending.  Another such cost is the cost of consultants.

Tonight in this debate we are dealing with the cracks and the immediate cost issue but this is not the solution if we really want a fair, efficient and high-quality health service.  My own clear position is that we need a proper universal health service, with those in most need always getting priority.  There should be universal health insurance across the board, paid by us all as part of our general taxation.  That is my clear political and philosophical position and I believe there is support in this House for it.  That is why I supported the Government's Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill earlier today.<\/p><p> There has been too much messing around and too much in-fighting between the HSE, the Department of Health and politicians for many years.  I know it is not trendy or politically correct to say this but the Minister and his senior officials should visit Cuba and look at that country's health service and how well it works, despite being hammered by a US blockade.  The Cuban people put equity, equality and justice at the top of their health philosophy and ensure quality service delivery to all Cubans, particularly the poor.  I met a medical student in a bar in Havana who, as part of his training, was going out to live in villages and mountains, helping and caring for people, for his summer holidays.  He told me that it was his patriotic duty to work and serve in his country's health service and that he would defend it to the end.  That is the kind of spirit we need in our health service and the kind of spirit that we need to reform it.  <\/p><p> I know there are some plans to reform our health services but hammering our nurses, doctors and those in the 24-7 Alliance is not the way forward.  It is a crime and a disgrace to penalise those on the frontline because of the recklessness of senior bankers in the past.  This needs to be said in the debate tonight because it is linked to the cost issue and the high price of health insurance.  Approximately 6,000 people are leaving the health insurance market every month, many of whom are young people.  This will threaten the sustainability of the entire insurance market.  Health sector inflation is now out of control and many people are now downgrading their cover.  I call on the Minister to speedily reduce the cost of the delivery of both public and private health care, as promised in the programme for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600051#ZZ00900","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362594900,"counter":498,"content":"<p>Up until a few short years ago, throwing money at the health care system was viewed as the solution to its challenges and ills.  We now know that this approach did not have the desired effect and in reality, ignored the root causes of problems in our health care system.  If there is anything at all positive about financial constraints it is that they force a new approach and a re-evaluation and examination of not just what we spend, but how we spend it.  The Minister for Health, officials in his Department, nurses, doctors and staff of the HSE have all been working to bring reform to our health service within the budget necessitated by the State's current financial situation.<\/p><p>  Despite the detractors, doubters and cynics, we are seeing results.  In my constituency, the new Galway Roscommon hospital group is proof of the benefits which the new group hospital structure can bring.  In 2012 the group successfully treated more patients, faster and more efficiently, despite a reduced budget.  The group successfully tackled the significant problems in the accident and emergency department and exceeded the targets set by the Department of Health's new special delivery unit.  In 2012 it effectively halved the numbers waiting for accident and emergency care and achieved a reduction of over 36% in the number of patients on trolleys awaiting treatment.  The Galway Roscommon hospital group clearly demonstrates that strategic and targeted use of public money always delivers better outcomes than the old practice of simply throwing money at a broken system.  Fixing and reforming the system is what we must do, while simultaneously ensuring that people can continue to access high-quality health care.<\/p><p>  Last month the Department of Health published what I believe to be one of the most significant documents it has published in many years.  Unfortunately, it received very little attention in many political and media circles, who instead prefer to focus on negative stories rather than progress or plans for reform.  Entitled The Path to Universal Healthcare, the document examines the current health care system, with a focus on health insurance and sets out a vision for how we will achieve a single-tier health service supported by universal health insurance, which provides equal access based on need and not on ability to pay.  The overall goal is to develop a new health-insurance-supported health care system, guided by health promotion, equal access, patient safety, outcome-based rewards, as well as efficiency and effectiveness.  <\/p><p>  Specifically with regard to the health insurance market, the focus of Government will be on ensuring a fair and robust community-rated market.  The concept of community rating is central to a properly functioning health care system.  The health insurance market is one of the clearest examples of where government involvement and, indeed, interference with the commercial market is both fundamental and welcome.  It is, put simply, positive discrimination which ensures that our citizens can access affordable health insurance, regardless of age, gender or health.  Many people will be aware of community rating through the Supreme Court ruling of January 2009 which declared that the then Government's risk equalisation was based on an incorrect interpretation of the law and had to be set aside.  This led to an unsatisfactory interim measure to plug the gap which the Supreme Court had found.  This Government committed to finding a workable and effective solution that would be rooted in fairness among the health insurance companies and, most importantly, for citizens.  We achieved that commitment with the passing of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act last year.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and his officials have ensured that fairness remains at the heart of the health insurance market.  The new permanent scheme of risk equalisation protects the community rating system and ensures inter-generational solidarity in the provision of health insurance.  <\/p><p>  Reforms are continuing apace, radically improving our health system so that it prioritises patient safety, is patient centred and delivers the best health outcomes for citizens.  It will take time but I am confident that we are beginning to see the results.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600052#AAA00200","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1362594900,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this motion.  For the past two years, this Government has consistently striven to ensure that the cost of private health insurance for ordinary families in Ireland is kept down and our efforts in this regard will have to continue for the months and years ahead.  It is a complex issue involving competition in the market place, the base cost of procedures and the pay of the professionals involved.  Undoubtedly, there have been significant price rises in recent years and this, coupled with declining household incomes in many cases, has seen many families forced to opt out of private health insurance, placing an even greater burden on the public system.  However, over 45% of the population is currently covered by private health insurance, greatly alleviating the burden on the public health system.<\/p><p>  In terms of the drive to reduce costs, there have been some notable successes.  The VHI, for example, has achieved cost savings of over &euro;300 million by reducing consultants' fees and payments for procedures such as inserting stents and MRI scans.  This cost-saving drive has also resulted in a large increase in the number of day-case procedures and the average length of stay in hospital has also been decreasing.  <\/p><p>  Competition is a key factor in today's private health insurance market and while there are four main players in the market, GloHealth only has 1% of the market, Aviva, 16.9% and Laya Healthcare, 21.5%, meaning that the market is dominated by the VHI, with over 56% market share.  There are pitfalls to having such a large segment of the market as many older people have never switched providers and thus, while VHI has 56% of the customers, it has 67% of the claims.  By offering inducements to adults with small children, companies are targeting young professionals in their 30s and 40s, ensuring their products are most attractive to people whose needs are least in terms of health procedures.  <\/p><p>  One aspect of the payment structure which has received much focus is community rating but this inter-generational solidarity is necessary is to prevent our health service, both public and private, from crumbling.  There is little incentive to pay a large health insurance premium during the years that one is least likely to have to avail of it, only to be pushed out by the private system as one ages.  Without community rating, very few older people would be able to avail of private health insurance and the huge pressure on orthopaedic and neurology departments, for example, all across the country would soar.  The Health Insurance Authority has, in recent years, been highlighting the ease with which people can switch providers and has matched its ambitions with actions in terms of a very user-friendly plan-comparison tool allowing individuals and families to assess which plans best suit their needs and what savings can be made.  That tool is something which I would encourage everyone to use before renewing their health insurance.<\/p><p>  I believe the risk equalisation measure currently in place in Ireland has forced private health insurers to seek greater efficiencies rather than cherry-picking the best and healthiest customers, creating the leanest regime possible in terms of administration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600052#AAA00300","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speech","time":1362594900,"counter":500,"content":"<p>In these recessionary times it is true that people of all demographics are opting to leave their current private health plan or not sign up to one at all.  The private health insurance market peaked in 2008, along with many other things in this society, when approximately 2.3 million people signed up to private plans.  That number has declined ever since and at the moment there are 2.1 million people with private health insurance, which is approximately 45.8% of the population.  These numbers are indicative of the tough times we are in but I would also venture to say that everything peaked in 2008 and what goes up must come down, unfortunately and we will seek to have a rebalancing of this in time.<\/p><p>  The media has a large part to play in terms of the apocalyptic headlines gracing the newspapers on a weekly basis on this issue.  I would argue that the media has a large part to play on many issues but that is for another day.<\/p><p>By all accounts, private health insurers are attempting to keep costs down as it would do them no service to raise costs and lose customers.  That would be the easiest avenue to bankruptcy.  Rising costs can largely be attributed to what hospitals and consultants are demanding from private insurers.  I propose that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, should commission a small team of health insurance experts to conduct an investigation - lasting six month or so - into the rising health costs in Ireland.  It should be at minimum expense to the Exchequer and for the betterment of the industry as a whole.  There is more to this issue that must be examined more thoroughly.<\/p><p> The Opposition has raised some points about which most of us in the House can agree.  I wholeheartedly agree that the best and most equitable health care should be provided for every individual in the State.  The Labour Party advocated a Nordic model of health care prior to the 2011 election and there is commonality with the coalition partners, who have agreed to this approach and decided to pursue this aspiration, which unfortunately can only be achieved in more prosperous times.  We are trying to set the bedrock in place to achieve this aspiration.  Many of us social democrats have examined the Scandinavian model and seen it as something to which we aspire.  It can be achieved but the Government must be serious about it and give a long-term commitment.  With the current Government and those who have seen the light in the party that was part of the previous Government, we will get there in the end.<\/p><p> I have spoken in the House many times in the past two years about hardships, such as mortgage distress and unemployment, which affect the nation.  Families across Ireland must cope with many tough decisions and cutbacks, including cuts to private health insurance.  There is an old saying that health is wealth and health care is a crucial pillar in the country's architecture.  Grouping private health insurance with a better service in the public system is a main priority for the Government.<\/p><p> I will continue to work as a backbencher to ensure that the best service can be provided and afforded by people.  Health is wealth but the costs are a key component.  It has been indicated that some people have received over &euro;500,000 and &euro;1 million in payments from private health insurance.  A public bed can cost &euro;75 per night but a private bed can cost up to &euro;1,000 per night.  Some 56% of the market is held by VHI but 80% of costs go to the company because the majority of older and sicker customers use it.  There must be some kind of equalisation.  The path to a universal health care system must be pursued on an equitable basis over a number of years for the betterment of all society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600052#AAA00400","speaker":"1048","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362595500,"counter":502,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I will deal with the specific issue of the use of private health insurance by those who are hospitalised because of psychiatric ill health.  There are a few issues of great concern and public patients often have a greater opportunity to recover in the long term when compared with those who enter private institutions, although all the facilities do very good work.  Of great concern is the process of follow-up after discharge from a private hospital.  There is no connectivity with the HSE, and the community-based after-care system with HSE involvement can be patchy in following up psychiatric patients discharged from private institutions.  There should be some follow-up by the health insurance companies in that regard.<\/p><p>  There are two main private psychiatric hospitals in the country.  Many people who use those facilities would have insurance but may not have much other money.  They would have to travel to and from Dublin and pay for a consultation with a psychiatrist and treatment.  The expense can be quite significant for people who access health care in psychiatric hospitals.  An initiative should be taken to bring the three groups - private hospitals, private insurers and the HSE - together to examine follow-up after discharge from private hospitals.  There is a difficulty.<\/p><p>  Private insurance lasts for six months in a private hospital and if people cannot pay privately after that time, people need to be transferred to the HSE hospitals or to their communities.  Treatment often lasts longer than six months.  Some years ago I mentioned an experience when somebody was discharged from St. Patrick's Hospital one evening in a highly suicidal state.  Her mother took this 21 year old student back to Limerick on the train and she was taken into hospital late at night.  There was not much investigation of her condition and a student nurse was assigned to care for her the next morning while the patient was still in a suicidal state.  The nurse left at 1 p.m. and there was not enough cover, so the patient took her life at 1.30 p.m. in the hospital.  There is a difficulty around discharge and after-care when patients have been cared for in private psychiatric hospitals.  The follow-up for public patients is far superior to that seen by private patients.

At a time when the Government is driving efficiencies across the health sector, it is important for insurance companies to step up to the mark, especially with regard to sharing resources.  We can see what is happening on a cross-Border basis in Altnagelvin in Derry, where there will be a &euro;19 million investment by the Government for a shared double linear accelerator radiotherapy centre for the people in the north west.  The Government is working on a shared basis and trying to drive down its cost so there must be some sort of replication in the insurance sector.<\/p><p>  How does private health insurance cover work when we will work on a shared basis between North and South?  There will be a similar process in paediatric care, where the Minister is working closely with Mr. Edwin Poots, MLA, his counterpart in Belfast, with respect to shared paediatric services.  Crumlin is a possible location to treat children with special difficulties.  We must have a conversation on how health insurance companies will work on a cross-Border basis.<\/p><p>  Tied to this is the issue of the patient mobility directive, which will be transposed into law in October this year.  It is almost like a liberalisation of health services throughout the European Union, with patients in this State having the possibility of utilising services in other states or jurisdictions.<\/p><p>We need to have a conversation on how that will work and the nature of the involvement of the health insurance companies with regard to private patients.  Will it just be for the public system?<\/p><p> The next issue I wish to raise is close to the heart of the Acting Chairman, Deputy Charlie McConalogue.  I refer to regional status for Letterkenny General Hospital, which is bringing an increasing number of people through its door.  The hospital is carrying out many more procedures than it used to and the workload of consultants in the hospital is increasing by the month.  More patients from outside County Donegal are attending and the hospital is becoming quite a success story.  At present, the extra footfall is not being rewarded although this is the aspiration of the Minister, which I acknowledge.  A hospital such as that in Letterkenny should not be discriminated against because it does not have regional status.<\/p><p> There is an excellent MRI scanning system in Letterkenny General Hospital.  The VHI, however, does not have a reimbursement scheme in place for it.  It does have a scheme for Sligo hospital, which has similar services.  There are excellent facilities in both hospitals but the VHI does not have a reimbursement scheme with the one in Letterkenny.  Will the Minister ask the VHI why no such scheme is in place?  Can one be put in place?  If so, let us do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600053#BBB00500","speaker":"997","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362596100,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I agree with universal health care.  How did we get to this position whereby the cost of insurance is increasing?  The cost has increased because nobody took on the vested interests, including the consultants.  I have paid for health insurance, as has my mother and other members of my family.  We have done so because we could and saw it as a civic duty.  At many times, we did not receive care better than we would have received in the public system.<\/p><p>  There is another form of insurance, however.  At many times, consultants would say that because one had voluntary health insurance, one could be kept in hospital for a few days.  This meant more money for the consultants.  The insurance companies did not take on the professionals and this increased the cost of health insurance.<\/p><p>  Another form of insurance was used in public hospitals.  I believe in public hospitals.  I was in Roscommon hospital a week ago for a hip X-ray.  The service I received there is not inferior to the service I would hope to receive in Blackrock Clinic or Galway Clinic, to which I have never been.  I believe in public hospitals.  In the public hospitals, there was a form of insurance whereby consultants could be paid &euro;500 or &euro;1,000 if one wanted one's mother, father, brother or sister to stay an extra week.  This practice was ongoing over the past 30 or 40 years.  It was the way business was done in this country and it was wrong.  This is why our health insurance system is at a low point.  So much cash was going through the system.  Anybody who enters my office tells me that this practice occurred.  It occurred all over the country.  There were patients with voluntary health insurance in respect of whom the consultants were able to charge the VHI.  Nobody questioned this.  In the public health system, there was another form of insurance, that is, nod-and-wink insurance whereby one paid the consultant or doctor &euro;300 or &euro;400 to keep one's mother or father in hospital.  Everybody in the system knew this practice was occurring but nobody was prepared to tackle it.  The Minister is now going to make the system open and transparent and, most important, he will ensure that the nod-and-wink insurance system cannot continue.<\/p><p>  Risk equalisation in the VHI is very good.  It can be blunt but the VHI is charged with catering for a much more elderly cohort than other companies.  I pay voluntary health insurance but do not expect to receive treatment any better than that which I would receive in a public hospital.  Perhaps that is just my opinion but I believe most people are beginning to examine their health insurance.  People are asking how they can get the best cover for the money they pay.  As with utility bills, such as those for oil, electricity and telephony, people are examining health insurance bills all the time.  I urge people to shop around.<\/p><p>  I examine the cost of my insurance.  I have an elderly mother of 85 and I pay her insurance.  While we have always had private health insurance, perhaps we would be better off using the public system, thereby saving a lot of money.  If many hundreds of thousands of people stopped paying for private health insurance, however, the public health system would not be able to cope.<\/p><p>  The Minister must take on the vested interests, who have not been taken on for the past 15 to 30 years, or even since the foundation of the State.  We had an Irish solution to an Irish problem, thus putting us in our current position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600054#CCC00200","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speech","time":1362596100,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important motion.  It is extraordinary that in two years Fianna F&aacute;il is returning to form.  It has abdicated its responsibility and forgotten it was in Government.  It never took the Department of Health and Children as it left it to Ms Mary Harney.  It did not have the courage to take it.<\/p><p>  Let me cast the minds of the Members opposite back to 2008.  Some &euro;700 was the price of a premium.  Under the Fianna F&aacute;il regime, the costs spiralled.  Since 2008, more than 200,000 people have left the health insurance market.  It is worth noting that at the peak, 50.9% of the population had health insurance.  Unfortunately, this figure has reduced to 45.8%.<\/p><p>  Significantly, despite all the pandering and posturing by previous Administrations, we now have a Minister who has set about creating a universal single-tier health service.  The best that the Members opposite can say is that this is not happening fast enough.  They ask whether there are clear pathways.  They should examine the recently published document The Path to Universal Healthcare, on which we should have a debate.  For once, we are in circumstances in which we will have people gaining access to medical care not on the basis of what they can pay, who they are or where they come from, but on the basis of their needs and how they can be treated and cared for properly, promptly and decently.  The model of health care that the Government and I espouse is based on this philosophy.  Anybody who promulgates a different version is talking out of both sides of his mouth.<\/p><p>  It is about time that we got real in this country regarding health care.  For far too long, we have let the vested interests dominate, take over and dictate what happens.  For once, we have a Minister who is prepared to drive reform and implement change.  While this may take time and while we may need to go to Legoland and back, I hope that on the way to Legoland we can build the blocks on a sustainable foundation that will not collapse like the Miche&aacute;l Martin-Mary Harney model that has left us where we are today.<\/p><p>  The priority is to examine what the health insurers are doing because they all have a responsibility.  Members have focused on the VHI in this debate as it is the dominant market player.  It must lead the drive to reduce costs.  Our main question, to which Deputy Kelleher referred last night, concerns increasing costs.  The Deputy is correct that they are increasing but the current Minister is the one who has said consistently to the insurers that they must keep their costs down.<\/p><p>  It is tough for Deputy Dooley being in opposition.  When his party was on this side of the House for 14 years, he was like a little mouse.  He did not budge or open his mouth.<\/p><p>I ask him not to open it now.  If I was him, I would be embarrassed given Fianna F&aacute;il's record in government.  I would not say too much about it.

Reform in rostering and changes to work practices have allowed for greater numbers to be seen and fewer people on trolleys.  These are some of the many positive signs that the Deputies opposite do not want to hear because they just want the bad news.  That is fair enough, it is their prerogative, but let us look at what we are doing in the health system, driving reform and putting the patient at the centre of the system.<\/p><p>  It is not good enough for the Health Insurance Authority to tell people to shop around.  There are more than 200 differently priced plans in the market.  Let us make it simpler and more streamlined for those who want to keep their private health insurance.  We face many challenges in the health insurance market and consumers are making difficult choices.  As prices have increased, many have relinquished their policies, but insurers have an obligation to stop the spiral of price increases and to work with hospitals and others involved to reduce costs because they have a social objective, to make it attractive for people to keep their health insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600055#DDD00700","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1362596700,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Kelleher for putting down this motion.  Every Member of this House is concerned at the increasing costs involved in health care, particularly with health insurance companies increasing their premiums.  There is a real concern that 200 people per day are giving up their health insurance.  That demonstrates the crisis of affordability for individuals and families.  The health insurance companies are increasing their rates and blaming inflation but in fact these premiums are ahead of inflation generally and ahead of health sector inflation.<\/p><p><br \/>  Like the Minister, I am concerned that 6,000 consumers are leaving the private health insurance market every month.  There is little incentive for younger people to take out health insurance.  This threatens the sustainability of private health insurance for those who remain within the system.  Many people have downgraded their cover and there is concern 300,000 holders of lower level plans will face a substantial rise in the health levy.  It is unfair that someone paying &#8364;500 for a lower level plan will pay the same levy as someone who can pay &#8364;4,000 for a higher level of cover.  There is no level playing field and that is a matter of concern surrounding the introduction of this levy.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Minister should consider removing the levy from children.  Families have enough problems with school fees and paying for college education.  These health premiums will be an extra cost.  The percentage of the population with inpatient health insurance stands at 45.8% according to the CSO population figures for April 2012, a fall from the peak in 2008 of 50.9%.  That is a matter of concern.  Among the under 50s, there was a fall of 122,000.  We must be concerned about that and consider ways to encourage younger customers into the health insurance market instead of putting obstacles in their way.  Last year, the Irish League of Credit Unions found nearly one in ten adults with health insurance would abandon the policy because they could no longer afford it, with 31% claiming they would do that if prices increased again.  An article by Charlie Weston in the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>in December outlined increases of almost 50% under a scheme the Minister is devising.  If these health insurance experts say the Minister's plans will lead to a higher premium payment for families, we should take note of that and deal with the increases in premiums.<\/p><p><br \/>  Public hospitals are charging about &#8364;1,000 per night instead of &#8364;75 for these beds.  The impact will be significant and we should ask why there is never a breakdown of that &#8364;1,000 figure.  These changes will have an impact because health insurers are not allowed to negotiate prices charged by public hospitals, in contrast to private hospitals, where the insurers can demand terms.  There is a reluctance on the part of the health insurance companies to get involved in cover for the newer private hospitals.<\/p><p><br \/>  I hope the reports of health insurance companies charging punitive fees for people who want to cancel a policy will be dealt with.  One family I know was quoted a cancellation fee of &#8364;700.  It is difficult to shop around in that situation.  The CEO of VHI said people could choose wisely and save money if they shop around but it is not that simple when such punitive charges are in place.<\/p><p><br \/>  The cost of health insurance has doubled in four years at a time when general inflation was low.  Last year the inflation in health insurance was ten times the inflation rate in the health sector generally.  I call on the Minister to act speedily to reduce the costs in the delivery of both public and private health care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600055#DDD00800","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1362596700,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on this important motion put down by our party spokesman last night.  It deals directly with the widespread concerns of many families throughout the country who are struggling to maintain their private health insurance.  The dramatic reduction in the number of people paying this insurance must be a cause of serious concern in overall health provision and the additional funding pressures that will ensue for the health sector in general.  The drop of 64,000 policy holders in the last year demonstrates a dramatic loss of revenue and, according to the Health Insurance Authority, the people leaving the market are younger and healthier and those with young families.  A few years ago, younger people taking out policies were growing that insurance market, a welcome development.  By definition, those younger people joining the market were of significant value to community rating, which is of critical importance for an ageing population.  Community rating must be protected.<\/p><p>  Now we have a market in decline, losing people who should be the lifeblood to ensure sustainability for community rating.  The younger policy holders, who are healthier by definition, are a critical ingredient in ensuring we have a sustainable community rated market.<\/p><p>As a society, we need to provide protection for older persons and those in ill or failing health.  We must have that critical cohort of younger policy holders to ensure that necessary protection and we will not have those younger policy holders unless that age group finds health insurance attractive in its benefits and, most important, affordable.  A continuing decline in younger policy holders would be detrimental to the health insurance sector.<\/p><p> The increase in private health insurance premia is well ahead, not only of inflation generally but of health sector inflation as well.  I referred earlier to the large numbers leaving the insurance market.  Allied to lower numbers is the fact that large numbers have downgraded their level of cover.  All these factors contribute in a negative and, unfortunately, significant way to the further upward pressure on premia for those remaining as policy holders.<\/p><p> My party's spokesman, in his motion and his contribution last night, put forward a number of proposals that need urgent consideration and, I would suggest, implementation by the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, and his colleagues in the Department.  The Minister, through VHI, must achieve a reduction in consultant fees.  That is one of the issues that has always been with us and that the public constantly raises with us.  It is understandable that this issue is still one that needs further resolution.<\/p><p> A 70% increase in two years for some VHI policies is putting a terrible burden on many households already under pressure.  I understand that those policies hit with such a large increase are typically those held by older persons.  The latest 6% increase in VHI premia is the fifth in over two years, and this has to be tackled before policies become totally unaffordable, except for the very well off.  This trend of increasing cost is causing many individuals and families to question how long more they can afford to remain in the insurance market.  Of course, the same concerns exist for the policy holders of the other three private insurers as well.  Subscribers giving up or downgrading their policies continue to put further pressure at an accelerated rate on those remaining in the market.  Young families are under constant pressure to meet household commitments and there is a strong case to remove the &euro;95 per annum levy from children.  Such a move would help to make insurance that bit more affordable for so many families.<\/p><p> The Minister, Deputy Reilly, in a newspaper interview in January, spoke of his concerns about VHI's cost base but less than two weeks later VHI announced a further 6% premium rise, the fifth increase in two years - a point that Deputy Buttimer might note.<\/p><p> Particular attention must be paid to VHI as it is the only beneficiary of a very substantial levy.  That is understandable because it has the vast majority of older policy holders.<\/p><p> The Minister gave a clear commitment to protect 330,000 health insurance customers with lower levels of cover from a further increase in the Government's health insurance levy this month.  Now that is not being implemented.  This is another broken promise, one that was only made a few weeks ago during the course of the enactment of legislation here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600055#DDD00900","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362597300,"counter":519,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis mo chomhleacha&iacute;, an Teachta Kelleher, as ucht an seans an fadhb d&aacute;irire at&aacute; againn le &aacute;rachas sl&aacute;inte a phl&eacute;.<\/p><p><br \/>  We all accept it is a serious problem when 140,000 subscribers have left the private insurance market in two years.  These 140,000 will now depend on the public hospital system to look after them.<\/p><p><br \/>  In January 2011, Deputy Reilly, speaking about increased health insurance premia, stated it is the last straw for many and that many who have been holding on have given up their insurance as a result of these proposed increases, the consequences of which will be more pressure on our public hospital system.  No doubt this has been the effect.  In his tenure as Minister for Health, there have been 140,000 additions as a consequence of such increases.  In March 2012, the Minister defends that by stating that is the way it goes, even through he has a chance, as Minister, to influence it through legislation.  When he introduced legislation, it achieved the opposite of what he intended.  It has added to the cost base and to the cost of premiums of many of the companies.  In fact, it has also resulted in a reduction in the benefits of many of the packages.  That is the Minister's track record after two years.  In fairness, the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, is only in the Department a few months and I am happy to give him much more time to try to achieve something on it.<\/p><p><br \/>  There is a serious problem in the market.  Initially, we were told that competition would be the answer to the problem and the introduction of new market entrants would sort VHI out.  In 2011, VHI's market share was still 57%.  In four years, it has only fallen from 66% to 57%.  It is still the dominant player in the market.  It is still the player that is being subsidised by the private players in terms of many of its plans and we must look at its <i>modus operandi<\/i>.<\/p><p><br \/>  When one compares the cost model of VHI, in terms of its running costs as opposed to the profile of its customer, against those other competitors it is completely out of sinc.  Its running costs are considerable higher than those of its competitors and those running costs are passed on in the premia increases to those of us who are VHI customers.  VHI is using its loyalty within the Irish market to pay off those cost increases and therefore is putting pressure on the private operators in order to do that.<\/p><p><br \/>  Many Members referred to the flight from the insurance market of younger subscribers, in particular, young families, and specific attention needs to be paid to that.  Why is it that those with no children are less likely to use the system and are not even considering taking out insurance?  God forbid if they need the system, they will have to depend on an overstretched public system.  It is because there are few incentives for them.  The Government, through the legislation passed before Christmas, through extra levies, is adding to the cost for children.  It has a chance of doing something on this, by stating to families that in one area the Government can control - the cost of health insurance through levies - it will reduce the levy on children or get rid of it altogether when it comes up for payment in a few weeks time as a signal of the Government's interest in their position as families in terms of the running of their households and as a statement that the Government wants people to try to have health insurance.  Instead, the advice coming from the Government benches is to shop around.  Like Marie Antoinette, those who sit on the benches opposite suggest those who shop around will find it.<\/p><p><br \/>  As, in fairness, Deputy Buttimer stated, it is difficult to shop around when there are tens of plans available.  It is utterly confusing and nobody seems in a position to explain to the consumer what is in certain plans and not in others.  Instead of telling consumers to shop around, let us work with the market and tell insurers to simplify their offer, take away all the frills and elements that confuse the marketing of the offer, and give consumers direct information.  They should do consumers that favour alone.  That is something that has not properly happened.  There is still this mirage of plans with which consumers are utterly confused.  Unfortunately, in many cases it is only when subscribers go to use their plan that they realise its deficiencies.  That also needs to be addressed.<\/p><p><br \/>  An issue that applies with all of the companies is the delay in paying hospitals for services that have been provided.  At every HSE quarter meeting, it is pointed out that there is money outstanding from various insurance companies to hospitals and the HSE generally for services that were provided, and it tends to be a substantial sum.  In HSE west, at one stage the sum was in the teens in terms of millions of euro, much of which dated back a long time.  That was due to disputes over the filling of forms because consultants would not fill out forms properly, and that is not right.  It means that hospital beds had to be closed and services had to be withdrawn from companies which have the money and will not pay it.  That is an issue these companies need to address as a matter of urgency.  The Department needs to flex its muscle in this regard and not have a situation, as is the case every year, that when we come into August and September cuts must be made to the health budget.<\/p><p>Some of those cuts happen because some of these large companies that have the money will not pay the HSE or pay the various hospitals on time.  It is March and we can stop that from happening now.  That is one easy way to resolve the challenges in the health budget and there are not too many other ways.<\/p><p> The tenor of debate from the Government side has been phenomenal.  There is an unbelievable loyalty in Fine Gael to the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  One will not see that in the O2 tonight with all those screaming fans of One Direction.  For Fine Gael backbenchers he is like the Niall Horan of Fine Gael.  They speak of all the reform he has introduced in the past two years.  I remember being here in 2008 when the then Minister for Health and Children, Ms Harney, introduced the reforms that have revolutionised cancer treatment and revolutionised the outcomes for those who are unfortunately suffering from cancer.  I remember the Minister, Deputy Reilly, leading the charge against those reforms because it suited him and it suited Fine Gael in Sligo, Mayo, Galway, Cavan and Monaghan to lead the charge against those reforms - reforms which he has now championed.  We now have to listen particularly to the Fine Gael Deputies praising him for that - the Labour Deputies are slightly more circumspect of the Minister, Deputy Reilly, which, given their experience with him, is to be understood.<\/p><p> These are reforms he bitterly opposed and from the back of every truck during 2011 he told every community he would deliver and subsequently he has gone away.  I will not take a lecture on the lack of reform during our time in government from Deputies so devoted to a Minister who opposed every one of those reforms and got votes on the back of opposing those reforms.  Now we are all supposed to bow down and face towards north County Dublin - or is it Tipperary, I get confused - and pray towards him and give thanks to God for this maestro who is Minister for Health.  The 140,000 people who have given up on the Minister's health insurance policies do not even begin to add up to the number of people who have given up in other areas of health.  Nobody should expect us to accept him as a champion of reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600056#EEE00200","speaker":"1071","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362597900,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the motion ably proposed last night by Deputy Kelleher.

As Deputy Kelleher has said, I am sure he will stand up to the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and plough his own furrow in the Department.<\/p><p>  We have a serious problem with the health insurance industry where the ever-increasing cost means 200 people every day are giving up on their health insurance.  The programme for Government committed to acting speedily to reduce costs in the delivery of public and private health care, but obviously that has not happened.  The Government is now beginning its third year in office and nothing substantial has happened in this area.  On Monday the Oireachtas Members from Wexford were briefed by senior representatives of the HSE south.  One of the points made to us was that the number of people giving up private health insurance was having a serious effect on people attending hospitals in the south east, resulting in a large increases in the operations and people attending such hospitals.  They made the point that we will have ever-increasing problems in dealing with the numbers of people leaving the VHI and the other private health insurers.<\/p><p>  There is an ongoing and persistent increase in the cost of private health insurance with a crisis developing in affordability for individuals and families.  The increase in private health insurance premiums is significantly higher than not only inflation generally but even health-sector inflation.  An average of 6,000 consumers leave the private health insurance market every month.  Obviously that is a major problem in the public health area.  What plans do the VHI and other private health insurers have to deal with this?  Obviously a company in the commercial sector losing that number of customers would be trying to deal with it effectively.  Clearly the VHI's running costs are far too high.  Even though it has lost a significant number of members, it still has the same number of staff.  Surely this is not acceptable.  The company should take a serious look at how it is operating and the high costs of its operations, and make changes.<\/p><p>  As other Deputies have said when the Minister, Deputy Reilly, was on this side of the House he had all the solutions to the problems of the private health sector.  He castigated the then Minister for Health and Children, Ms Harney, and the then Government for not dealing with the issue.  However, now he just shrugs his shoulders, saying this is the way it is and this is the way it will continue.  However, it cannot just continue because if huge numbers continue to leave the private health sector we will have serious problems in the public sector.  This is an issue in which the Minister of State should involve himself directly because obviously the Minister, Deputy Reilly, has no interest in dealing with it.<\/p><p>  I thank Deputy Kelleher for tabling the motion.  He has outlined some of the solutions that can be implemented to bring about a reduction in costs and allow people to remain in the sector.  We cannot afford for them to be leaving it thereby putting pressure on other areas of the health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600057#FFF00200","speaker":"1096"},{"type":"speech","time":1362597900,"counter":522,"content":"<p>Few things strike more fear in the heart of a family than the fear of illness and concerns over the inability to pay for the care of a family member.

That fear is real to the family and out of that concern people have participated fully.  While that fear still exists, approximately 200 people are dropping out of private health insurance on a daily basis.  That is a staggering number.

That will allow that fear to be a daily fear - not just the fear of illness, but the fear of being unable to pay if a family member falls ill.  It is not good enough for Deputy Buttimer or any other Member to come in here and give us a history lesson as they regularly do.  That is fine when we are having general banter and just tossing political jibes across the House.  However, tonight is about addressing a crisis in the private health insurance sector.  It is not just a crisis in the health insurance sector, it is a crisis among so many families across the State and is being exacerbated every day.  It ill behoves any of us to start throwing politics around the House.<\/p><p>  We have an opportunity to resolve it.  Unless we can come up with a solution that can stop this vicious circle of people being unable to pay, thereby falling out of the system, putting a greater burden on those in the system and increasing the charges for those fortunate enough to be able to scrape together the money to participate.  Next month as the charges increase more people will find themselves outside the net and unable to pay.  That is an ever-decreasing circle that will lead to a major problem.  The problem exists already but the increase in charges will make it worse and we have to tackle it.  The Government will need to propose incentives and solutions to help the people who want to pay - and paid when they could - but are no longer in a position to do so.<\/p><p>We know the pressures they are under.  I do not propose to engage in the usual commentary about other taxes.  I accept that the tax base needs to broaden.  Private health insurance, which is a fundamental component of the livelihoods of many people, is being tossed aside.  I am disappointed at the approach the Minister is taking given he came to office with so many promises of resolving the perceived inability to control spending in the health area.  We heard much about money following the patient.  What happened to that proposal?  What has happened to the proposed universal health insurance system under which the State would pick up the tab for those who could not afford to pay and those who could pay would pay an affordable rate?  It appears to have gone out the window.<\/p><p> Deputy Buttimer stated that the delivery of the entire health system has changed in the past two years and that we now have some of the most advanced technologies and facilities.  It is as if all of this mushroomed in the past two years.  What Deputy Buttimer and others on the Government side - I do not include the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, who has always been balanced in terms of his commentary - have failed to recognise is that many of these advances were made under former Minister for Health, Mary Harney, whose only fault was the manner in which she communicated them.  I believe she would admit that herself.<\/p><p> In my view, the advances in reconfiguration of the delivery of health services has led to a much better service delivery, which Deputy Buttimer and his colleagues refused to accept and worked against on a daily basis.  They frightened the people of this country, telling them they would die if the reconfiguration of services went ahead, which was outrageous.  Thankfully, Members on this side of the House are not engaging in that type of banter tonight but are instead putting forward solutions that are acceptable, meaningful and have the capacity to assist the Minister in the discharge of his duties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600057#FFF00500","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362598500,"counter":526,"content":"<p>I do not propose to continue the battles of the past in the House tonight.  I am not interested in doing so.  While many Members say in their contributions that they want only to speak about the future and that Members on the opposite side want only to speak about the past, one finds that five minutes into their speeches they are speaking about the past, which is ludicrous.  We cannot make any progress if that continues.  However, I can banter another day about that.  This is far too important an issue to do so now.<\/p><p>  I thank Deputy Kelleher and his colleagues for raising this important matter and giving the Government the opportunity to restate its commitment - which has not been abandoned, far from it - to the introduction of a system of universal health insurance which will bring an end to the current two-tier health system which for so many years, it cannot be denied, has discriminated against patients on the grounds of income.<\/p><p>  As stated last night by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, this Government is the first in the history of the State committed to developing a universal single tier health service which guarantees access to medical care based on need and not income.  We will leave the failed policies of the past behind and introduce UHI with equal access to care for all.  This has been a useful debate.  I welcome some of the contributions made on all sides of the House.  I do not underestimate the size of the task ahead.  I have previously made clear that it would take two terms in government to achieve our aims in relation to the introduction of universal health insurance.  Much has been achieved already.  It is only fair that Deputies opposite would acknowledge this.  For example, through the efforts of the Special Delivery Unit, SDU in my Department, working with hospitals and clinicians, we are successfully tackling problems associated with delays in accessing care.  These are real achievements and substantial improvements that should be acknowledged.<\/p><p>  As Minister of State with responsibility for primary care, I want to see progress continue to be made in building capacity in primary care and in chronic disease management, particularly for the management of diabetes.  Only today the Health Service Executive announced the appointment of 17 clinical nurse specialists who, as part of their role, will support health care professionals providing care for diabetes patients in primary and secondary care settings.  Currently 1.8 million individuals in the State hold medical cards, the highest number in our history.  The Bill to allow for the extension of free GP care to persons with prescribed illness will be published this year.  It is not unreasonable for Deputy Kelleher to raise the issue of the pace of change.  We all want to see change happen quickly.  I have been Minister of State for almost six months now.  I too am often frustrated at how long it takes for particular changes to imbed in the system.  However, change is occurring.  As acknowledged last night by Deputy McConalogue change takes time, particularly change in the health services.<\/p><p>  I would like to address the issue of risk equalisation, which is the meat of this debate.  As Deputies will be aware the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012 has provided for the introduction, for the first time in this country, of a permanent risk equalisation scheme, RES, with effect from 1 January 2013.  I recall that legislation was strongly supported on all sides of this House, although some Members opposite appear now to be criticising it.  The new scheme will play an essential role in maintaining stability in the private health insurance market.  As outlined last night by the Minister, with effect from end March 2013, support levels under risk equalisation will increase substantially over 2012 levels for higher risk groups, particularly men aged 70 and above.  This will further reduce the incentives which insurers have to select younger and healthier customers at the expense of older and less healthy customers.  It will help to ensure to a significant extent that private health insurance remains affordable for older and less healthy people.  I regard risk equalisation as an indispensable element of the necessary reforms of our system.<\/p><p>  Deputy Kelleher raised the issue of the pace of change.  The recurring theme of the speeches made by Members opposite has been the number of young policy holders leaving the system.  I acknowledge this is a problem.  I do not seek to suggest that is not an issue.  Members opposite have described the problem.  The challenge is to come up with solutions.  Seeking to undermine the risk equalisation scheme will not form part of any realistic solution.  For example, a deferral, as advocated for in the Fianna F&aacute;il motion, of the increase in the health levy, which is scheduled for end March 2013, would manifestly undermine the risk equalisation scheme and would take from it.  It would add to the problems rather than reduce them.  It may be attractive on the face of it to suggest children should be removed from liability to the levy.  Three to five of the proposals in Fianna F&aacute;il's motion would, I respectively suggest, rather than help the situation undermine the risk equalisation scheme and levy system crucial to it.  I can do just as well as Deputy Kelleher in describing the problem.  There can be no doubt in anybody's mind - Deputy Dooley will have to acknowledge this - that the reduction in the number of people who hold or have reduced their insurance cover is manifestly linked to the reduction in people's living standards owing to the economic and financial collapse here and the increase in the number of people unemployed and the affect this has had on families.  In terms of everybody being honest with each other, it appears strange to me that the Opposition would not acknowledge this is a factor.<\/p><p>  Deputies opposite say we need a solution and to look to the future and address this issue in the long term.  I agree with them.  I call on everybody in this House, particularly those who have taken an interest in this issue, to contribute to the debate on what universal health insurance should look like.  I do not regard as a settled issue precisely how it will manifest itself or be implemented.  I ask Members opposite to contribute to the debate on the way forward.  Wisdom does not reside on one particular side of the House or with Government alone.  I would welcome a good, strong and healthy debate on these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030600058#GGG00200","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1362598500,"counter":527,"content":"<p>I thank all Members who contributed to the debate and for their viewpoints on this issue.

We can argue about the current state of the economy and how we got there but health insurance inflation is not the direct result of the difficulties in our economy.

Let us park the argument about the shortage of money, the inability of the Minister for Health to balance last year's books and his having to obtain a loan from the health insurance companies to tide him over and sort out overdrafts for hospitals.<\/p><p>The real reason the Government is proposing to charge full cost for private patients in public beds is nothing more or less than a finance raising mechanism.  This is not about taking away subsidies from health insurance companies; it is about charging customers of health insurance companies.  Their universal entitlement to be treated in a hospital is something which those on the other side of the House espouse.  Under the Government's proposal one will be treated in a hospital, but if one stays in a public bed one will be charged the full cost.  The Minister pretends the insurance companies will pay for it but this is not correct.  The premium holders will do so because the insurance companies will be obligated to pass it back to them because they cannot run deficits.  They are obligated to keep a reserve and legislation is in place to ensure this is the case.  Yes they will make profits, but this is not about removing a subsidy; it is about double taxation and attacking a fundamental right to free health care at the point of need in a public hospital.  That is what this is about.<\/p><p> If some consultants are sending people through the system and charging them even though they are being treated in a public bed the Government should deal with this and there are other ways to do so.  This blanket decision to penalise on the double for going to a public hospital every person who has worked hard, paid their taxes and decided to take out private health insurance to protect them and provide for their health care is unacceptable in my view and should be unacceptable in the view of the Minister of State.  If he espouses universal health insurance, this attempt the Government is making at the start of the process suggests it will be very unfair for much of middle Ireland who pay their taxes and try to provide for themselves and their families.  At one fell swoop the Government is telling them they must pay twice to be treated.  Being asked to do this is the most mean-spirited attack I have seen in recent years on people who make an effort and work hard to provide for themselves.<\/p><p> We supported the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act.  We were proponents of risk equalisation and we saw the necessity for it.  We were led to believe there would be two types of plans, non-advanced and advanced.  During the discussions in the Chamber we were led to believe the Health Insurance Authority would deem 47 plans as non-advanced and they would avoid the higher levy.  The legislation has been passed and now it transpires there are no non-advanced plans and all of the health insurers will now have to design them.  The important point to be made is with regard to people who are already under huge financial pressure in trying to retain health insurance, who have been reducing their cover and barely hanging on.  This will force health insurance companies to drop benefits and certain cover for the lower plans to ensure they are non-advanced.  The same people who will have to avail of these non-advanced plans will then have to pay for some of the services that will be provided if they go into a private hospital.  With another fell swoop the Government is asking people who can barely afford health insurance to subsidise those who can afford higher premiums and higher insurance cover, or the Rolls-Royce five-star private health insurance.  It is a direct transfer of wealth from the poorest in terms of private health insurance to those who can afford it most.  The Minister of State knows this is completely wrong.  He knows it is unfair and anathema to everything for which most people in the Chamber stand.  I suggest it is something with which the Minister of State certainly does not agree.<\/p><p> In fairness to the Minister for Health, he is often wrong but never doubts himself.  How could he have come in here on Second Stage and stated there would be 47 non-advanced plans which would avoid the high levy because he was so concerned about those on the lower reaches of private health insurance who were barely hanging on to it?  The legislation has been passed and what do we get?  There are no non-advanced plans.  This must be revisited because what will happen is that MRI scans and many other benefits which were in the lower plans will now be removed to qualify for the lower levy, which will mean those who can barely afford it will have to pay more out of their pockets for treatments in private hospitals.<\/p><p> There is a view that those with private health insurance are queue jumpers who buy themselves a place ahead of those in the public hospital system.  The vast majority of elective surgeries are carried out in private hospitals.  If one has private health cover one is not taking a bed from somebody in a public hospital because most elective surgery is done in private hospitals which have no contact with the Exchequer or public patients.  If people really wanted to support and help the public hospital system because of the difficulties in which it finds itself, as many people as possible should be encouraged to take out private health insurance so they would lighten the burden on the public hospital system.  This is what the Minister for Health proposes in his universal health insurance policy.  I have stated before, and will do so again, that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and his party sat in opposition for 14 years and came up with grand plans and great schemes.  I would have assumed that on taking office, although his party did so with wild outlandish promises as did the Labour Party, he would have had some blueprint in his mind for universal health insurance based on a particular model.
