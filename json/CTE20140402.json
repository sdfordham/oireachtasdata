It is Ireland's truly international centre of higher education in medicine and health sciences.  It is an international organisation.  Our campus in Dublin has over 3,800 students and 1,000 full-time members of staff, mainly graduates.  In collaboration with Irish Aid, we are the largest international surgical trainer in sub-Saharan countries.  In addition, we run training programmes throughout the Middle East, with a training campus in Dubai and a university in Bahrain.  We also run undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in the Far East, mainly in Malaysia.  While the RCSI has traditionally been acknowledged as the lead higher education institution in attracting international third level students to Ireland and bringing Irish education to international settings, this is now an important aspect of the work of many higher education institutions and a key part of Ireland&rsquo;s development as a knowledge economy.<\/p><p>  The RCSI has worked closely with Enterprise Ireland and we are proud that many of our graduates have played a key role in opening doors for Irish business in the Middle East and worldwide.  It has had a relationship with Bahrain for over 30 years.  The college established the Medical University of Bahrain in 2003 and the students who attend RCSI Bahrain are now drawn from more than 30 countries across the globe, including the United States, Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.  There are 1,240 students enrolled in medicine, nursing and masters programmes.  There are over 130 academic and administrative staff drawn from across the globe at  RSCI Bahrain.  In addition, there are over 200 associated clinical faculty staff who support the training of our students in the hospital environment.<\/p><p>  The RCSI delivers the same curriculum across three campuses in Dublin, Bahrain and Perdana.  When it comes to examinations and despite significant logistical challenges and differences in time zones, a medical student in Dublin will turn over his or her examination paper at 8 a.m. local time and his or her counterparts in Bahrain or Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, will turn over the same paper at 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. local time, respectively.<\/p> <p>Papers are jointly set, centrally reviewed and moderated, and external examiners are appointed by the National University of Ireland and the RCSI and shared across the campuses.  Examination boards are held jointly using video conference facilities.  Graduates from the School of Medicine of RCSI-Bahrain are conferred with the degrees of MB, BCh, BAO from the National University of Ireland, NUI, and in addition they will receive licentiates of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. <br \/>The RCSI (Charters Amendment) Act, 2003, included a provision that allowed the Minister of Education and Skills to commence RCSI independent degree-awarding powers.  Since 2010, as directed by the Minister, the RCSI is both an independent degree awarding body and a recognised college of the NUI.<b><\/b>As a designated awarding body under the terms of the 2012 Act, the RCSI deals directly with Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, and other State agencies.  The RCSI and the NUI operationalise the provisions of the 2012 Act through the RCSI-NUI working group executive, established in 2013.  A key point here is that the academic qualifications awarded to RCSI-Bahrain graduates are identical to those awarded to all RCSI graduates, including those in Dublin.  These are subject to both internal and external oversight which I will now describe in some detail.  The RCSI medicine and health sciences board is responsible for oversight of the degree-awarding activities of the college.  The RCSI awards and qualifications committee has the authority and operational responsibility to evaluate and consider programmes which fall under the National Framework of Qualifications, NFQ, for approval, accreditation and periodic review.    <br \/>At the RCSI we believe that providing an accessible, high-quality education and experience for all our students will ultimately translate to better health outcomes for patients.  The RCSI has invested heavily in a quality agenda both in Ireland and overseas.  In recent years we have come through many quality assessments, including the rigorous assessment mentioned earlier in regard to independent degree awarding status in 2010.  All RCSI activities, nationally and internationally<b>, <\/b>are subject to oversight by QQI, the statutory body which was established by the Oireachtas in 2012.<b><\/b><br \/>We have just recently come through an institution-wide review by a six-member international review panel, commissioned by QQI.  This review encompassed our RCSI-Bahrain campus and included a review of our undergraduate, postgraduate and research activities.  The report is expected shortly, but the chairman, Professor Simon van Heyningen, honorary fellow and emeritus professor at the University of Edinburgh, commented at an exit meeting that it was a privilege to conduct the review in such an impressive institution with a pervasive culture of quality. <br \/>As our awards are professional in nature, they are subject to what I describe as a triple-lock approach to quality.  First, they are subject to our own internal quality assurance and enhancement procedures; second, they are subject to external oversight in Ireland by the NUI and QQI, and in Bahrain by the Higher Education Commission and the national authority; and, third, because they are professional in nature, they are subject to professional accreditation by the relevant authorities such as the Irish Medical Council and, in Malaysia, the Malaysian Medical Council. <br \/>The Irish Medical Council&rsquo;s accreditation mechanism is highly valued by all of the Irish medical schools with international activities.  The RCSI believes that the Irish Medical Council review helps to support the ambition and strategy of the Department of Education and Skills to internationalise Irish higher education.  Importantly, it helps to protect and further enhance the overall reputation of Irish higher education institutions in the competitive international market where evidence of the quality of transnational activity is essential.  The primary purpose of accreditation by the Irish Medical Council is to provide additional external assurance in relation to the quality of the qualification.  Accreditation of RCSI-Bahrain by the Irish Medical Council will be based on the World Federation of Medical Education Standards.  RCSI-Bahrain has completed a self-assessment report and we are confident that it meets these standards and that the resources available to staff and students meet the requirements specified.  The RCSI-Bahrain campus is a state-of-the-art medical campus, completed in October 2008 with a built-up area of more than 15,750 m<sup>2<\/sup>.<br \/>It is important to note that the accreditation of RCSI-Bahrain by the Irish Medical Council gives no legal advantage to graduates of RCSI-Bahrain, nor does it improve access to employment opportunities, but we believe that accreditation by the Irish Medical Council would be a further demonstration of our commitment to quality. <b><\/b>In addition to seeking accreditation by the Irish Medical Council, RCSI-Bahrain has previously been accredited by the Gulf Co-operation Council, GCC, committee of medical school deans; it is included in the World Health Organization directory of medical schools, the International Medical Education Directory of the Foundation for the Advancement of International Medical Education and Research, FAIMER, and the health profession education directory of the World Health Organization; and is recognised by the Medical Board of California and the UNESCO-run International Association of Universities.<b><\/b>The National Health Regulatory Authority, NHRA, is the licensing authority for medical graduates undertaking internships in Bahrain.  As a testament to the educational standards in RCSI-Bahrain, I am pleased to advise the committee that the pass rate in the last licensed exam for RCSI-Bahrain was 100%, compared to a national pass rate of 40%.<br \/>Our RCSI-Bahrain graduates have been accepted into postgraduate training posts in the GCC countries, the United States, Canada and several European countries, including the United Kingdom.  Earlier this year, the Canadian federal authorities designated RCSI-Bahrain as an eligible institution for student financial assistance purposes in the different provinces.<b><\/b><br \/>Since 2010, in conjunction with the NUI, we have graduated four cohorts, a total of 611 graduates, in the different programmes offered by the university.  As in Dublin, each RCSI-Bahrain graduate proudly stands at the graduation ceremony and recites the Declaration of Geneva.  I will not read this in its entirety, but it contains the following points: <blockquote>I will not permit considerations of age, disease or disability, creed, ethnic origin, gender, nationality, political affiliation, race, sexual orientation, social standing or any other factor to intervene between my duty and my patient; <br \/>I will maintain the utmost respect for human life;<br \/>I will not use my knowledge to violate human rights and civil liberties, even under threat.<i><\/i><\/blockquote>As Irish companies and universities increase their activities abroad, as we all must do, we will find ourselves working in countries with very different political systems and cultures from our own.  To work in these countries, we must find a way to be true to ourselves and our core mission while being respectful to the cultural, judicial and political norms of the countries in which we work.  We at the RCSI are proud of our staff and students in Bahrain, where we provide a high-quality medical and nursing education in a non-sectarian environment.  It is our intention to continue to contribute to the future of Bahrain through the provision of high-quality education in the health sciences.  With respect, I would say to the committee that the proposed Irish Medical Council visit is a mark of quality for our students.  It confers no legal advantages.  If it does not go ahead, the only people punished will be our students.  While all of us in this room may have different views, I hope we are united in wanting the best outcome for these students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040200003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Cathal Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396440600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Medical Council I welcome the opportunity to address the committee on this important topic.  I am joined by the vice president of the Medical Council, Dr. Audrey Dillon.<\/p><p>  The role of the Medical Council is to protect the public by promoting and better ensuring high standards of professional conduct, professional education, training and competence among doctors.  The Medical Council is responsible, under Part 10 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, for setting and monitoring standards in undergraduate, intern and postgraduate education and training in Ireland.  We also ensure that doctors engage in lifelong learning and skills development activities by monitoring the ongoing maintenance of doctors' professional competence.  We accredit the bodies that deliver medical education and training and professional competence schemes against robust and validated international standards; and we ensure through a monitoring process that accredited bodies maintain and improve their standards.  Where education, training and professional competence standards are not met, the Medical Council can take action in the public interest by applying conditions or refusing to approve relevant bodies and programmes.  External accreditation ensures education and training is delivered to defined high quality standards, while also fostering institutional improvement and promoting a high-quality experience.  It encourages organisations to think about, respond to, and deal with the strengths and weaknesses of their programmes.<\/p><p>  In line with the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and Medical Council rules, globally recognised standards are used in accreditation.  We use the World Federation for Medical Education Global Standards for Quality Improvement in Medical Education: European Specifications 2007.<\/p> <p>A standard procedure is used by the Medical Council in the application of these standards to its consideration of any programme of basic medical education.  That procedure, and the approach of the Medical Council, has been externally reviewed and benchmarked by the US Department of Education&rsquo;s National Committee on Foreign Medical Education, which provides assurance that a proper approach is taken by the Medical Council.  The principles underpinning these accreditations ensure that they are based on a sound legal footing; are independent from the medical schools, the medical profession and government; are trustworthy and recognised by all; are fair; possess a high degree of transparency; and involve assessors who are respected in the field, and are recognised as such internationally.<br \/>The council&rsquo;s accreditation teams normally comprise a combination of lay and medically qualified members of the Medical Council and external independent assessors.  The external assessors have expertise in medical education or quality assurance, or represent the public interest.  They are drawn both from within Ireland and from other jurisdictions.  Dialogue with students is an important part of accreditation visits.  We aim to meet students in every year of the programme.  One of the key elements of the dialogue is that it is confidential.  That is emphasised to students at the start of every session.  Professionalism and ethical issues always feature in the discussions, particularly with students at the later stages of their training, who for that reason are experiencing real life on the ward or in a general or community-practice setting.  The types of scenario they met in a more theoretical way earlier in the course are teased out in a more practical sense at a later point in the course.<br \/>Many medical schools in Ireland, approved by the Medical Council for the purposes of the delivery of programmes of basic medical education, have expanded operations to deliver medical education globally.  The Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection will be aware of increasing delivery by Irish universities of third and fourth level education around the world and of the support of the Department of Education and Skills for such overseas activity.  As the responsible body for approving programmes of medical education and training, and the bodies that deliver those in Ireland, the Medical Council has been invited to consider the same bodies' delivery of medical education internationally for the purposes of quality assurance.  In the case of some programmes, these are co-delivered in Ireland and in another country; some are delivered in totality outside the State.  The Medical Council has considered how it should approach such requests.  In the context of increasingly globalised medical education and training, the Medical Council takes the view that, in safeguarding the reputation of Irish bodies&rsquo; role in medical education and training, it does consider requests to review programmes delivered by Irish bodies outside the State.  We understand from the bodies that make this request that the quality assurance role of the Medical Council is highly valued.  Indeed, the Department of Health has expressed to the council its view that programmes delivered under the auspices of an accredited Irish education body should be of equivalent standard and quality to a programme delivered within the State.<br \/>Medical education and training is increasingly globalised.  Medical schools in Ireland welcome students from around the world, who enrich medical education in the State.  Their study at Irish medical schools also makes an important contribution to the funding base for medical education in Ireland.  The Medical Council has received and is processing a request to review the programme of basic medical education delivered by RCSI-Bahrain.  The WHO standards and procedures will be used by the Medical Council to review the programme of basic medical education at RCSI-Bahrain and to inform a decision by the Medical Council in respect of that programme under section 88(2)(<i>a<\/i>) of the Medical Practitioners Act.  At this stage, a review has not taken place but is being planned.  An assessment team is being identified and pre-assessment visit information has been requested by the Medical Council from RCSI-Bahrain.<br \/>The Medical Council is conscious of the political developments in Bahrain; indeed, our earlier plans to review the basic medical education programme at RCSI-Bahrain were postponed owing to the political situation.  The former president of the Medical Council, Professor Kieran Murphy, and the current president of the Medical Council, Professor Freddie Wood, have both written to a number of political leaders, including the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Health, and to the Higher Education Authority expressing the Medical Council&rsquo;s concern about the situation.  In this accreditation visit, we will apply our standards and procedures to review the programme of basic medical education at RCSI-Bahrain and to inform a decision by the Medical Council in respect of that programme.  That decision will, as with every decision by the Medical Council, be made in an independent, informed and objective way.  The outcome of the decision and the report based on the review which informs it, including discussion of all issues germane to the standards and procedure used by the Medical Council to review the programme of basic medical education at RCSI Bahrain, will be available for public scrutiny.<br \/>I thank members for the opportunity to explain the role of the Medical Council in medical education and training and to set out for them the Medical Council&rsquo;s process for considering the accreditation of programmes of basic medical education and training and the bodies that provide the programmes.  At the present time, we must be careful not to pre-empt our visit and its findings, so as such we are somewhat limited in the information we can provide as we are constrained by the requirements of our work.  As previously stated, the council has plans to visit RCSI-Bahrain later this year and we would be pleased to provide an update to the committee later in the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040200004#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Spillane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396441200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Spillane.

It may be helpful to the committee if I give some background information first.  I will start with some general information on the National University of Ireland and explain the relationship between NUI and RCSI.  I will outline the process through which programmes at RCSI-Bahrain have been approved by NUI and are continually monitored.  I will mention the growing importance of internationalisation for Irish universities and the steps taken by NUI to support the NUI institutions in their international engagements.  I will refer specifically to the extremely difficult situation which developed in Bahrain in 2011 and the serious human rights concerns that had to be addressed.  I will conclude by setting out the NUI senate&rsquo;s view of RCSI&rsquo;s educational provision in Bahrain and of the response of the college to the difficulties experienced there.<\/p><p>  The National University of Ireland is a federal university.  It constitutes the largest element of the Irish university system, with campuses spread across the country and in the region of 70,000 students enrolled.  Established under the Irish Universities Act of 1908, the university received its charter in that year.  NUI was restructured under the Universities Act 1997 and now comprises four autonomous constituent universities - UCD, UCC, NUI Galway and NUI Maynooth.  Under its founding legislation and charter, NUI is empowered to recognise programmes of study and award its degrees and other qualifications in other higher education institutions which are granted the status of &lsquo;recognised colleges&rsquo; of the university.  Over the course of its existence, 13 higher education institutions have, at various times, been granted the status of recognised college of NUI.  The NUI constituent universities are fully autonomous self-governing institutions, with each constituent university having its own governing authority.  Degrees and other qualifications of the National University of Ireland are awarded by each of the NUI constituent universities.  These degrees and qualifications enjoy high standing and wide recognition nationally and internationally.  Overall, we estimate that there are more than 300,000 NUI graduates spread across the globe.<\/p><p>  Recognised colleges of NUI are also autonomous, self-governing entities, responsible for their own strategic and operational management.  However, in the case of the recognised colleges, NUI is the awarding body.  NUI-recognised colleges are required to seek approval from NUI in respect of their degree and other programmes and these programmes are subject to ongoing academic monitoring by the university.<\/p> <p>In approving and monitoring programmes, the concern of the NUI is to ensure that they are comparable in standard and quality with the programmes offered in the constituent universities, that their quality is maintained and enhanced over time and that the integrity and reputation of NUI awards are secured.<\/p><p> The central forum within the National University of Ireland, representative of all the NUI member institutions, is the NUI Senate.  The senate is chaired by Dr. Maurice Manning and, as registrar of the NUI, I act as its secretary.  The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, has been a recognised college of the NUI since 1977.  Since then, the NUI has approved programmes of study at the RCSI and awarded degrees and other qualifications to RCSI students on satisfactory completion of those programmes.  The relationship between the NUI and the RCSI has developed and grown stronger over the intervening period.  Recent legislation has renewed the legal basis for the relationship between the NUI and the RCSI.  The Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012, which commenced in November 2012, defines both the NUI and the RCSI as designated awarding bodies under the Act.  However, the Act also provides for the RCSI to continue as an NUI-recognised college and for the degrees and other qualifications awarded by the RCSI, where approved by the NUI, to be NUI degrees and qualifications.  Accordingly, the RCSI remains a recognised college of the NUI and the NUI&rsquo;s quality assurance policies and procedures continue to apply to RCSI programmes.  The working arrangements between the NUI and the RCSI take full account of the new legal framework underpinning the unique relationship between the two bodies.<\/p><p> The NUI has had an involvement in Bahrain since 2006, when the Senate approved the delivery of two master's programmes offered by the RCSI&rsquo;s Institute of Leadership in Bahrain and Dubai, as well as in Ireland.  NUI master's degrees were conferred for the first time in Bahrain in January 2008 on the students graduating from those programmes.  In 2008, the RCSI council decided that NUI recognition would be sought for all programmes delivered in RCSI-Bahrain.  Following that, applications for the approval of programmes were received and processed by NUI in accordance with its normal policies and procedures.  RCSI-Bahrain was officially opened by President Mary McAleese in February 2009.  Later that year, the senate approved the extension to Bahrain of the RCSI undergraduate medical programme, the BSc degree in nursing and a further MSc programme.  Since then, the extension to Bahrain of several other NUI qualifications based on RCSI programmes has also been approved.  NUI degrees and other qualifications have been conferred on students at RCSI&ndash;Bahrain annually since 2008.  The approval of programmes and the awarding of qualifications of the National University of Ireland in RCSI-Bahrain are wholly dependent on the status of the RCSI, a recognised college of the NUI.  RCSI-Bahrain is viewed by the NUI as a transnational location where RCSI delivers programmes approved by the university.  Most RCSI programmes offered in Bahrain have previously been approved for delivery in Ireland, but in a few cases approval for delivery in Dublin and in Bahrain has been simultaneous.<\/p><p> The process for the approval of programmes by the NUI is well developed, rigorous and consistent with European standards and guidelines for quality assurance in higher education.  Applications submitted to the NUI for the approval of new programmes or for significant changes to existing programmes, whether delivered domestically or internationally, are assessed by independent peer review, undertaken by external experts.  The reports of the programme assessors are processed within the NUI and recommendations are made to the Senate regarding programme approval.  In the case of the RCSI, as Professor Kelly has mentioned, we have a working group, which is the main forum for the conduct of academic and other business between the NUI and the college.  External examiners are appointed annually by the NUI to oversee taught programmes leading to NUI qualifications at undergraduate and postgraduate levels.  They play a vital support role to the university in assuring and enhancing academic standards and the quality of teaching, learning and assessment at home and abroad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040200005#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Attracta Halpin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396441800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>As we have a timeframe of approximately six minutes and Dr. Halpin is at approximately eight minutes, I ask her to summarise the rest.

The RCSI enterprise in Bahrain reflects the imperative for universities today to become increasingly international. Like other universities, NUI institutions seek actively to internationalise their campuses and increase their impact internationally.  Moreover, the NUI supports its member institutions in that endeavour.  As has been mentioned, NUI institutions frequently operate in countries with different human rights cultures, and human rights issues arise.  To support our institutions and on the initiative of our chancellor, Dr. Maurice Manning - who, as members of the Committee will be aware, chaired the Irish Human Rights Commission - the NUI sought expert advice and drew up a document, Human Rights Principles and Code of Conduct, for NUI and its member institutions, which was published in 2013.  The document is intended to help the NUI institutions in their international engagements in places such as Bahrain, but not exclusively in Bahrain.<\/p><p>  The outbreak of civil unrest and violence in Bahrain starting in February 2011 was viewed with great concern by the NUI.  The RCSI kept the university fully briefed on what was happening and Professor Cathal Kelly addressed the NUI senate on the situation in June 2011.  Following his address and having noted the college&rsquo;s unequivocal commitment to the safety and welfare of its students and staff, the senate endorsed the approach adopted by the RCSI and expressed confidence in the college&rsquo;s handling of a very difficult situation.  Based on its experience since 2006, the NUI has full confidence in the academic standards and quality of the programmes leading to its degrees and other qualifications in RCSI-Bahrain and the performance of students graduating from RCSI-Bahrain.  The Senate has confidence in the leadership provided and the judgment exercised by the RCSI in the continuing operation of its campus in Bahrain.  The University remains committed to the pursuit of knowledge and the promotion of learning nationally and internationally.  We will continue to support the RCSI and other NUI institutions in pursuing international opportunities.  Through the delivery of excellent academic programmes leading to NUI qualifications both within and outside Ireland, we believe the reputation of the university and of Irish higher education in general will continue to grow.  We are of course aware of the risks involved and will continue to develop our policies and processes with a view to minimising those risks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040200006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Attracta Halpin"},{"type":"speech","time":1396441800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Halpin and invite our final speaker, Ms Mary Doyle of the Department of Education and Skills, to make her presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040200006#F00400","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396441800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to address the joint committee on the accreditation of the Bahrain facility of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  I am accompanied by my colleague Mr. Keith Moynes.  In my presentation I would like to focus on four areas.  The first is the statutory framework for quality assurance and accreditation, which is relevant to the issues under discussion.  The second is the broad policy context in which the international activities of Irish higher education institutions are undertaken.  Third, I will outline the Government&rsquo;s perspective on the situation in Bahrain, which has been articulated consistently by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Finally, I wish to state the position the Government has taken on the RCSI&rsquo;s presence in Bahrain, again as articulated by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.<\/p><p>  On the first set of issues, namely, the statutory framework for quality assurance and Medical Council accreditation, a core mission of the Department of Education and Skills is to provide a strong framework for high-quality educational opportunities and outcomes across the spectrum of educational provision.  The Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012, which has been alluded to by a number of speakers, among other things makes Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, responsible for the external quality assurance role formerly undertaken by the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC, and the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, in the higher and further education and training sectors, respectively.  Furthermore, QQI was assigned this role in respect of what are termed designated awarding bodies - that is, the NUI, the universities, the Dublin Institute of Technology and the RCSI.<\/p><p>  The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (Charters Amendment) Act 2003 made provision for the RCSI to award its own degrees, subject to the relevant by-laws being agreed by the Minister for Education and Skills.  The RCSI submitted draft by-laws for approval in 2009 and the then Minister requested that the Higher Education Authority and the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, which is a predecessor body of QQI, conduct a review of the RCSI and advise him on the question of approval of the by-laws. Following that review, the by-laws were approved in 2010.<\/p> <p>The RCSI, similar to all other higher education institutions referred to in the 2012 Act, is subject to review and oversight by the relevant national external quality assurance body, QQI.  Review, in this context, refers to the formal review of the effectiveness of the institution-wide quality assurance policies and procedures established and implemented by the RCSI.  A further review of RCSI by QQI, in accordance with the provisions of the 2012 Act, was undertaken in 2013, and I understand that the report is due to be finalised and published by QQI in the coming weeks.<br \/>Dr. Halpin outlined the NUI role and I do not propose to repeat the provisions on NUI.<br \/>Under the legislative framework, separately to the external quality assurance role of QQI, the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, which falls under the remit of the Minister for Health, sets out the role of the Medical Council in assessing the fitness for purpose of programmes of basic medical education and training and the bodies, including the RCSI, which deliver those programmes.<br \/>The Medical Council has already outlined the relevant processes under that Act, but it is germane to mention that section 88 provides for consultation by the Medical Council with the Minister for Education and Skills as part of their process for approving or not approving programmes and bodies.  The Medical Council met, at its request, the Minister for Education and Skills on 6 February 2014 to &quot;discuss its programme of accreditation and in particular the accreditation programme in 2014 including Royal College of Surgeons Bahrain&quot;.  At that meeting, the Medical Council outlined to the Minister and the Department its intended programme of accreditation and the general principles which underpin its approach.  The Medical Council has not yet formally sought to consult the Minister for Education and Skills under the terms of the 2007 Act in respect of RCSI-Bahrain.<br \/>The second issue is the national policy context regarding the internationalisation of education.  The Department of Education and Skills has lead responsibility within Government for developing and implementing national policy to facilitate the internationalisation of higher education, in collaboration with other Departments and agencies.<br \/>Internationalisation is one of the major trends in modern higher education.  The OECD pointed out that &quot;in today's age of global knowledge and technology, an interconnected network and global awareness are increasingly viewed as major and sought-after assets.&quot;  In principle, Government policy is supportive of high-quality internationalisation.  It is important for Ireland, as an open economy which fundamentally relies on international engagement, to have institutions which are globally competitive and internationally oriented.<br \/>The ambition to enhance international collaboration and engagement by our education institutions is one of the seven key system objectives set out in our higher education performance framework for the period 2014 to 2016.  Our national policy document for enhancing internationalisation, Investing in Global Relationships: Ireland's International Education Strategy, identifies a range of benefits for Irish and international learners but also for Irish society more generally and the societies of our overseas partners.  In this context it is clear that many societies rely on international provision to fill gaps in their capacity to provide particular types of advanced education and training.  This is particularly the case in highly specialised and crucial areas, such as medical training.<br \/>Particular complexity arises in the delivery of programmes outside the jurisdiction.  To assist institutions in ensuring strong quality assurance in these circumstances, the Guidelines for the Approval, Monitoring and Review of Collaborative and Transnational Provision have been developed by the Irish Higher Quality Network, which comprises representatives of higher education institutions.  This builds on work previously done by HETAC and international bodies, including the OECD and UNESCO.<br \/>In the specific area of human rights, the National University of Ireland has developed, in co-operation with the Irish Human Rights Commission, guidelines entitled Human Rights Principles and Code of Conduct for the National University of Ireland and its Member Institutions, which sets out five core human rights principles that should underpin international engagement by the relevant institutions.  The Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade were supportive of this and met the NUI in the course of the development of these guidelines.<br \/>The third issue I will address is the Government's position on the situation in Bahrain as articulated by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  It is also important to say that at national level we align our internationalisation strategy closely with Ireland's foreign policy and with any EU and international obligations, including restricted measures such as sanctions that may be in force in respect of particular countries.  Individual higher education institutions, including RCSI, also keep in close contact with that Department and Ireland's diplomatic missions overseas.<br \/>On the specific question of the Government's position relating to the situation in Bahrain, this has been articulated by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which has been consistent in conveying its concern at every suitable opportunity regarding the human rights situation in Bahrain, including the Government's concerns regarding the cases of medical professionals and human rights defenders.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade most recently articulated what has been the Government's consistent position in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in response to parliamentary questions on 2 October 2013, stating:<blockquote>The overall human rights environment in Bahrain continues to be of serious concern.  Ireland shares the concerns recently expressed by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights regarding the deep polarization of society in Bahrain and the harsh clampdown on human rights defenders and peaceful protesters.  Such actions continue to make a durable political solution based on reconciliation and dialogue more difficult to secure.<\/blockquote>The T&aacute;naiste also stated that he has:<blockquote>ensured that Ireland's concerns on human rights issues in Bahrain have been conveyed regularly to the Bahraini authorities and [he] will continue to do so.  Ireland was one of 47 member states who participated in a joint statement expressing serious concern over the human rights situation in Bahrain at the ... UN Human Rights Council on 9 September.  In the statement, the signatories expressed their concern regarding the protection of human rights in Bahrain and called on the Government to expedite the implementation of the recommendations received from the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry in this regard.<\/blockquote>Finally, I will turn to the Government's position on RCSI's presence in Bahrain, again as articulated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  At the outset of the crisis in Bahrain, the T&aacute;naiste stated in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 6 July 2011 that he regarded the activities of the RCSI<blockquote>... in assisting with the training of foreign medical personnel overseas as a highly worthwhile activity through which the College makes a significant contribution to the quality of life of millions of people around the world.  The RCSI, as an educational provider, also has a responsibility to all of its students and ensuring they are able to complete their medical training.<\/blockquote>The T&aacute;naiste reiterated this position in the D&aacute;il on 17 October 2012 when he noted:<blockquote>The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and the Medical Council are independent organisations involved to varying degrees in the education of medical professionals in Bahrain.  It is important to distinguish between the involvement of Irish institutions in the education and training of Bahraini medical personnel, which is entirely positive both for this country and Bahrain, and the case of the imprisoned Bahraini doctors.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040200006#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Doyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396442400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>We will now go to questions.

Some of them stated in television interviews that they could not believe this was happening in their country and it was a disgrace.  Those doctors, for speaking out against what had happened, were arrested and thrown in jail, as has been documented in the independent commission into those events, and were also tortured.  I have met those doctors, both male and female, who were tortured.  I travelled to Bahrain with an Irish group and spoke to them.  That is the context to all of this and it is important to remember that.<\/p><p>  No-one is denying the importance of the internationalisation of Irish universities or the valuable role that Irish institutions can play in other countries in providing a high-quality education, and we are not questioning RCSI's presence in Bahrain, but internationalisation should not overlook basic human rights.<\/p> <p>It is notable in both submissions, particularly that of the college, that there is no reference to the human rights aspect.  The submission of the college is all about the quality of the academic education provided.  Half of the education provided is academic and delivered in lecture halls, but the other essential component is education provided on placements in hospitals.  As has been documented by international human rights bodies, the hospitals, as institutions, are not independent of the government in the way the Medical Council would prefer.  They are militarised and run by the Bahraini defence forces.  I have visited them.  There was a tank outside Salmaniya Hospital when I visited it.<br \/>There has been discrimination in the employment of RCSI students.  Forty students trained for jobs in King Hamad University Hospital, but only 15 were given jobs.  When they started, their expectation was that they would all be given positions.  The 25 who were not given jobs were all Shia.  Therefore, there has been sectarianism in the appointments process and the way both staff and students have been treated by the Bahraini regime.  There has been militarisation, as we said, and there are serious concerns about the safety and welfare of students and staff in RCSI Bahrain.<br \/>That the college&rsquo;s presentation does not mention these issues gives the sense that one can be apolitical and not comment on the political environment in Bahrain.  However, the silence is not non-political.  It is deeply politicised because it is an endorsement of the <i>status quo<\/i>.  The key aspects of medical training include medical neutrality, an essential part of the RCSI's code.  The documentation referred to non-discrimination in the provision of medical services.  It is precisely for such non-discrimination that the doctors were arrested for treating unarmed protesters.  The president of RCSI Bahrain found it necessary to resign over this issue.  He felt he could not stand over the circumstances involved when he went to Bahrain and saw what was occurring.  He could not stand over commitments to ensure the safety and welfare of his staff and students.  Mr. Tom Collins is a good man.  We have had him here to make presentations on other issues.  He is very well respected in the education sector.<br \/>The NUI's presentation makes reference to the responsibility of universities to uphold and promote human rights.  I draw attention to a weakness.  I would like the delegates to elaborate on what the NUI is actually doing to promote human rights.  It seems to have judged the events from afar in some respects and accepted the word of the Bahraini college that there is no issue and that the education being provided is safe and acceptable.<br \/>The delegates referred to the NUI's quality assurance guidelines for transnational collaborations.  The document submitted makes points not mentioned in the presentation.  It suggests organisations should be satisfied that &ldquo;the proposed environment is one in which human rights can be respected and the ethical values of the institution upheld&rdquo;.  In the light of comments made by the UN special rapporteur on torture, human rights bodies, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, I do not know how anybody could accept that there is no serious human rights issue in the case in question.  It is a case of protecting and upholding human rights.<br \/>Have the RCSI and the NUI taken any real step to become satisfied that these issues are being addressed?  What investigations have been carried out?  Can they be published in order that we can see what has actually happened?  There were recent reports of a sectarian attack on a student on the campus.  Has the RCSI investigated that incident and raised concerns with the college as a consequence?  Is the NUI, as the accreditation body, aware of it?  Is the NUI satisfied that the RCSI is meeting its expectations in Bahrain in regard to human rights, particularly given that even the departmental representatives here have acknowledged there is a problem?  The T&aacute;naiste is on record as acknowledging that there is a human rights problem in this case.  What steps has the NUI really taken to ensure the problem is being addressed?  Has it interviewed staff and students?  Has it interviewed the imprisoned medics who actually trained in RCSI Dublin?  Some of them are former staff of the college in Bahrain.  One of them, Dr. Fatima Haji, has still not been re-employed in her position in the college.  It is understood and she has stated the reason she has not been given her job back is that she has been very critical, both in Ireland and Bahrain, of the regime.<br \/>With respect to Professor Kelly, his presentation does not refer to the human rights issue.  Does the RCSI believe there is a human rights problem in Bahrain?  Does it accept that there have been major human rights abuses?  Does it accept that what happened in the hospitals on the day the protestors were admitted was wrong?  As an organisation representing Ireland in Bahrain, does it accept that it has a responsibility to meet human rights standards?<br \/>I will wrap up with a brief comment on the NUI and the Department of Education and Skills.  It is one thing for the RCSI to put its own reputation at stake in Bahrain and internationally by having a close relationship with such a dictatorial and violent regime, but it is quite another for the NUI and the Medical Council, if it is to grant accreditation, to put theirs on the line.  The same applies to the Department of Education and Skills.  I appreciate Ms Doyle's point that foreign affairs issues are generally matters for the T&aacute;naiste who has spoken out about this.  However, our policy needs to be consistent.  If the T&aacute;naiste is accepting that there is a human rights issue, it is important that the Department of Education and Skills be very careful, particularly in the context of internationalisation.  Internationalisation is very important to Irish institutions but reputation is everything.  The way the RCSI is behaving in Bahrain is putting the reputation of Irish education in jeopardy.  It is important that the Department of Education and Skills step in and ensure the matter is taken seriously.<br \/>Let me outline what I would like to see occurring pursuant to this meeting.  The only way those who are signing off on the programmes in the NUI and the Department can ensure the education being provided in Bahrain, particularly in the military hospital environment, is up to Irish standards is to have a credible international watchdog.  With respect to the college, because it has been so silent on human rights issues and not acknowledged them, it is not good enough for the NUI or the Department simply to accept its word.  A body such as <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res<\/font>or some other international group should carry out inspections, if, of course, it can gain access to Bahrain.  The authorities in Bahrain routinely refuse access - the UN special rapporteur on torture cannot even gain access to it.  The only way one can credibly stand over what is occurring is if one asks an international watchdog to carry out inspections and interview staff and students so as to be satisfied the system is up to scratch.  The same applies to Medical Council accreditation.  If the delegates&rsquo; visit is to be genuine, it is important they say they will meet staff and students and seek to talk to the imprisoned medics who are former staff and students of the college.  They should ensure they get both sides of the story.  I am very concerned that they will be chaperoned from the airport in Bahrain and hear only the views of the Minister for Health, whom I met when I was there.  While she is a very charming, articulate and well educated lady, it is important to hear both sides of the story.  The only means of credibly signing off on accreditation is if there is an independent watchdog on the ground to ensure professed standards are being upheld.<br \/>I appreciate the latitude given by the Chairman.  We are responding to very lengthy presentations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040200007#G00700","speaker":"1154","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396443000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I have just one question because Senator Averil Power has covered most of the main points.

I hope I will capture all of the points raised; if I do not, I am sure members will revert to me.  <\/p><p>  I will begin with a quotation from a press release issued by EU High Representative Catherine Ashton in January this year.  It gives a sense of the European Union's view on progress in Bahrain.  Obviously, we have stayed in very close contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, including through the T&aacute;naiste, and have been working through the United Nations and the European Union.<\/p> <p>According to a spokesperson for her:<blockquote><br \/>High Representative Catherine Ashton warmly welcomes the news that HRH Bahrain's Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, upon the request of HM King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, held wide ranging talks with participants in the National Dialogue in recent days, including in particular with Al-Wefaq's Secretary General Sheikh Ali Salman for the first time since the events of February 2011.  <\/blockquote>The spokesperson stated High Representative Ashton also welcomed the positive reaction of the opposition and looked forward to the resumption of national consensus dialogue.  On this occasion the European Union reiterated its conviction that there was no solution to the crisis other than a Bahraini one based on compromise and mutual trust.  Things are moving on.  <br \/>I was asked to come to the committee when I was on another Irish trade mission overseas about two weeks ago.  My understanding of the question was that it had to do with accreditation and the visit of the Medical Council to Bahrain.  Therefore, the thrust of our presentation is about accreditation.  I am not an advocate nor an apologist in any way for the government or country of Bahrain, but some credit must given to the country.  If one looks at the UN human development index, Bahrain ranks 84th out of 148 countries.  It is ahead of some European countries.  It has a better immunisation rate than we do.  It offers free primary care and free education up to university level; therefore, in some ways, it has made a awful lot of progress and is an exemplar in the region.  <br \/>On the points made about the hospitals being militarised, my colleague, Professor Finucane, has worked in Bahrain and could certainly talk more eloquently about that issue.  Throughout the Middle East, it is not unusual for a significant part of the public health service to be delivered through either military or police hospitals.  There are three public hospitals in Bahrain - Salmaniya Medical Complex, the Bahrain Defence Force, BDF, Hospital and King Hamad University Hospital.  Salmaniya Medical Complex is and has always been run by the Ministry of Health.  The BDF was a military hospital.  It caters for members of the military and their families and the wider local population.  For example, it hosts the national heart institute.  Again, it has always catered for it.  As is common in most countries during the development of a major new public hospital, there was considerable outrage and frustration in Bahrain caused by the delays in commissioning King Hamad University Hospital.  Long before any of the events that took place in 2011, out of frustration, the Government of Bahrain asked the military which had a significant record in project management and engineering experience to step in and run the hospital.  The military has opened the hospital which has 312 beds successfully and my understanding is that over time it plans to hand it over to the Ministry of Health.  In any country, including this one, public hospitals are the bedrock of clinical education and, by their nature, run by the government.  <br \/>Moving to the issue of jobs, we have said repeatedly that our first responsibility is to ensure our teaching and clinical education environment are non-sectarian and that is certainly the case.  Our next responsibility is to secure internships for our medical graduates.  Since 2010 only one Bahraini graduate has failed to secure an internship.  That individual has repeated the examinations, following which we will work on securing an internship.  There is no doubt that there has been considerable polarisation of the medical profession.  When people fail to secure a job, it is difficult to determine why they failed to get it.  Is it a question of qualifications or other issues?  Not that long ago in Dublin hospitals were characterised as Protestant or Catholic and people would frequently interpret appointments to them against that background, regardless of whether it was right or wrong to do so.  <br \/>The RCSI has repeatedly and publicly endorsed the findings of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry.  We welcomed its findings and publicly requested that clemency be shown to the arrested medic and that they be released.  We have continued to advocate in private.  My view is that different organisations and individuals have different responsibilities and opportunities.  Our responsibility is to our students and staff.  Our opportunity is to continue to engage with very senior officials in Bahrain - an opportunity many others in Ireland do not have.  We use this opportunity best by maintaining contact and continuing to advocate for just outcomes, which is what we have done.  <br \/>The Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry commented on the issue of medical neutrality and made the point that what had happened in Salmaniya Medical Complex was so complex it could not make a judgment on it.  It was a very substantial report based on 8,000 presentations and interviews carried out by an international panel that was beyond reproach.  It is very difficult, therefore, to give a truly neutral medical view on what happened in Bahrain.  No doubt, the profession is polarised and it will take time to heal the wounds.  The RCSI provides a valuable bridge in bringing about dialogue and healing these wounds.  <br \/>Taking into account the Chairman's statement at the beginning, I am loath to comment on individuals and will not do so, but Professor Tom Collins who resigned as president is a highly respected and valued colleague and a dear friend.  He resigned because of frustration at the lack of progress in organising a conference on medical professionalism involving MSF, the WHO, the United Nations and local participants.  I can understand this and do not think Professor Collins would mind me quoting him.  He has consistently been positive about the presence of the university as an agent for good.  Having met many members of the opposition, he is often quoted as saying he has yet to meet a member of the opposition who wishes RCSI Bahrain was not there.  He is uniformly positive about the university and a huge supporter of the students and would be very distressed by anything that endangered their opportunities or undermined the quality of the programme provided.<br \/>We have always acknowledged human rights problems and supported the findings of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, as has the Bahraini Government.  The government showed great courage in commissioning the report.  As ever, there is a frustration at the delays in processing the recommendations, but progress is being made.  <br \/>In terms of there being some sense of shame or undermining the reputation of Ireland, the RCSI has graduated 20,000 alumni all over the world.  The leader of the Chairman's own party has frequently told me that when he has been to foreign parts, the association is frequently an RCSI graduate.  Our graduates have opened doors to Irish business and other institutions all over the world.  What we are doing is the very definition of soft power.  We have demonstrated that when the going gets tough, an Irish institution does not cut and run but recognises its primary responsibility to students and graduate health care professionals to contribute to health care in the country in which it is operating.  I am very proud of this.  I am really proud of the achievements of our students and the work and commitment of our staff.  <br \/>I hope I have addressed some of the issues raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040200008#H00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Cathal Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396443600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I will address one of the points made about the NUI adopting an arm's length approach to the situation in Bahrain.  That is far from being the case.  We have had direct contact with Bahrain since 2006.  Our external examiners have visited the country annually; they have visited the hospital and reported back to us.  I have also visited Bahrain annually since about 2006.  Therefore, we have plenty of direct evidence.  Nobody is trying to pretend that Bahrain is an ideal society or that its human rights record is enviable.  I go back to a basic principle that underpins much of the NUI's policy on international engagement dating back to Thomas Davis - \"educate that you may be free\".  Education is a very powerful weapon in improving matters abroad.  To refer back to the numbers in Bahrain, we have graduated over 600 students, about half of whom are doctors and half of whom are nurses.  Some are postgraduates.  I understand a high proportion of the nursing graduates are from the Shia community and would be first-generation graduates.  They have been given tremendous life opportunities through their studies in RCSI Bahrain.  <\/p><p>  We list seven criteria for the accreditation of programmes.  There are general criteria that apply across the board and relate to learning outcomes, curricula, student support, resources, assessment procedures and professional requirements.  In the particular case of transnational engagement, we also make reference to human rights issues.  We would withdraw accreditation if we were to receive evidence from those whom we appoint to monitor our standards that standards were not being met.

In this case, it has the ability under the legislation to approve the programme and the body, to approve with conditions or to refuse approval.  The first stage of the process followed by the council is to issue a self-assessment questionnaire to the medical school in question.  This is based on the WFME standards and evaluated by an accreditation team.  A site visit is also conducted by the accreditation team which then draws up a draft report based on the site visit and the findings of the assessment.  The draft report is placed before the professional development committee of the Medical Council and the Medical Council.  The medical school concerned is asked to comment on factual inaccuracies, but it is not able to alter accurate reflections made in the report.  At the end of the process, the Act requires that the Minister for Education and Skills be consulted.<\/p><p>  The self-assessment and site visit are predicated on the WFME standards.  There are nine standards.  Where the accreditation team considers the standards are not met, its opinion will manifest itself in the report and recommendations.  It is composed of a combination of international experts in the field of medical education and training and recognised patient safety advocates.  Members of the Medical Council, both clinicians and lay members, are also represented on the team.  The information we receive is complemented by the accreditation team's ability to meet senior clinicians and managers during site visits.  Importantly, it will also meet a significant cohort of students from all years.  These meetings take place in private and are completely confidential, with the details of participating students remaining anonymous.  All of this information is triangulated to form a report that is sent to the Medical Council.  If the accreditation team reports a shortfall in the standards expected, the council will have a range of choices in regard to approval.

I agree with Professor Kelly that one of the best ways to bring about peace, ease, communication, equality of opportunity in education, justice and freedom is the training and nurturing of young people, especially in the area of medicine, which sometimes supersedes sociology, philosophy and psychology because it is about life and death and holding human beings sacred, as it says in one of the RCSI's charters, regardless of age, creed, colour, prejudice or sexuality.  Education through medicine is one way to bring about what Senator Power is correctly seeking.  I commend Professor Kelly on what he does given all the troubles in the country in which the RCSI finds itself.  Education, especially in medicine and all the tributaries that it allows, is for new generations consistently assessed and accredited every five to six years and that is the only way sometimes to get through regimes that are caught in old ways and mores.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040200012#M00400","speaker":"1170"},{"type":"speech","time":1396445400,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I am due in the Seanad for an education debate in a few minutes.

Professor Kelly referred to the distinction between the different hospitals.  No Shia muslims work in King Hamad hospital.  For anybody wondering why someone did or did not get a job, whatever about saying that the qualifications of a particular Shia individual might not stand up when applying for a job, the notion that no Shia Muslims would be qualified for a job is hard to believe.  We have to take that into account.  There is active discrimination and that is accepted by the international community.  Bahrain has rightly been criticised by independent groups for that.<\/p><p>  The key issue is the interaction between education and the political environment.  Ms Doyle made a point about drawing a distinction between the political situation and education.  I can understand that but there is only a logic to that if the two are distinct and separate.  The problem with Bahrain is that they are not.  Whatever about the academic aspect of the campus - there are concerns from that point of view in terms of the safety of staff because the security forces have had interactions with students and complaints have been made - the hospitals are also a key learning environment for students in RCSI colleges.  They are not independent and what medics went through has been well documented.  The treatment of injured protestors and giving television interviews are imprisonable offences in Bahrain.  I welcome any developments that might make it a more democratic or fair society.<\/p><p>  One of the doctors, Dr. al-Ekri, who was arrested, had trained and worked in Dublin and he is still in prison for treating injured protestors and talking about it in 2011.  Another human rights defender, Nabeel Rajab, is in prison for sending a tweet.  This is not a free society.  I do not dispute that, economically, it is a good society.  It is a well off country and traditionally women have been well educated, which is positive in the Middle East, but it has had the same prime minister since 1971 and power in the country is held by one family.  I appreciate that is a characteristic of the Middle East.  While there has been good aspects to political progress in Bahrain, the repression over the past few years has been appalling and it has not improved.  Talks have been on and off for the past three years.<\/p><p>  One cannot distinguish between the political and education and training environments when they are intertwined.  I am not calling on RCSI to withdraw from Bahrain but I am calling for a proper independent system to ensure the education being provided there is up to standard.  I am not basing my comments on my short visit to the country or my political views but on the independent commission and the international criticism of human rights in the country.  I do not see how what is happening there could be consistent with the NUI code of conduct, given the militarisation of the learning environment.

I am accompanied today by Mr. Stephen Curtis, financial operations manager and qualified financial adviser and personal insolvency practitioner, and Mr. Arthur Mullan and Ms Tracy Mullan, directors and solicitors with the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation.<\/p><p> The Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation was established in October 2012 as a not-for-profit organisation.  In addition to advocating for those in debt, we provide the only in-house, one-stop-shop for debtors where their pockets will not be picked nor will they be feasted upon by any external parties.  Behind the statistics with which we deal daily are families directly affected by the impact of debt.  Many people whom the IMHO represents have been individually, corporately and as a family destroyed by debt.  We would like to put a number of recommendations to the committee in the context of an imperfect and largely dysfunctional system that is dealing with distressed borrowers.  These debtors are reliant upon this committee to protect their interests where the Central Bank, Government and banks have failed.<\/p><p> We ask first that the committee recommend to the D&aacute;il that legislation be introduced to compel all lenders in this State to make available to borrowers in mortgage arrears four compulsory solutions, namely, mortgage to rent, debt for equity, split mortgage and no interest on the warehoused amount, and in the event of a property being sold, the residual debt will be resolved at the same time.  Not all lenders provide split mortgages.  Also, one of the pillar banks, the Bank of Ireland, provides for interest on the warehoused amount which accumulates on a monthly basis and is expected to be paid.<\/p><p> Second, the standard financial statement is too complicated, requires a significant amount of unnecessary information and needs to be urgently revised.  Third, the mortgage to rent scheme that helps to keep vulnerable families in their homes should be revised and streamlined.  It is overly cumbersome.  It is now cheaper for a bank to repossess a family home  than to participate in the mortgage to rent scheme.  This is a disgrace.  We have a client before the court next Monday who is perfectly suitable for the mortgage to rent scheme.  I am speaking in this regard of a family of a husband, wife and five children.  The lender, despite having pilot schemes with six other clients, is insistent on going through this system to repossess this family's home.  This is a wholly unnecessary repossession and must be fought at every turn.<\/p><p> We would further urge the committee to urgently review the personal insolvency process which is too prescriptive and is taking too long in the context of obtaining protective certificates.  This is not only about debt but about mortgage and personal debt.  All aspects of dealing with secured and unsecured debt must reviewed.  Yesterday, we announced a new partnership with Grant Thornton.  This will allow all debtors within the State, irrespective of their being current, future or potential mortgage holders, to avail of insolvency services, including bankruptcy, at no charge to the debtor, with the exception of court and Insolvency Service of Ireland fees.  This is a ground breaking initiative that will do what the State and the Oireachtas should have been ensuring was being done.  The IMHO will continue to provide free bankruptcy services through this initiative, funded through the project, which ultimately comes from creditors' funding.<\/p><p> For the past six years bankers have strangled our economy and society by failing to deal effectively with the mortgage crisis.  This has allowed unsecured creditors to run amok, sucking all they can from debtors in a menacing and threatening manner, which has risked mortgage holders losing their homes.  Irish people are honest and want to pay their debts.  Every effort is being made by those in debt to pay those debts.  They are not going on foreign holidays, replacing their expensive cars and spending money putting children through private schools.  Often the wrong debt is being prioritised.  Rather than creating a system to assist people, bankers have chosen to abuse mortgage holders by calling them strategic defaulters without any evidence.  In addition - this might appear strange coming from me - debtors have fallen into a false sense of security.  They have not been afforded an opportunity by creditors to deal with them in a humane and structured way.<\/p><p> Politicians and media have innocently raised debtors' expectations that a magic solution is coming, that nothing will happen to them and they are safe.  That is not the case.  The tide has changed.  The code of conduct on mortgage arrears introduced last year was a deafening blow to mortgage holders.  No information was forthcoming from the Central Bank in relation to the danger of people being deemed unco-operative.  The powers of the Central Bank in relation to targets are again a massive disadvantage to the borrower.  After six years of inaction banks are popping up and down trying to tick boxes.  The only people who can lose when someone jumps to provide an easy fix to keep the boss and the regulator happy are debtors.<\/p><p> In advance of this meeting we circulated the committee with details of the AIB and KBC joint initiatives.  We are happy to discuss these in more detail if members wish.  The IMHO has been dealing with every bank on behalf of clients.  The smallest amount owed by one of our clients is &euro;26,000 and the largest amount is &euro;52 million.  We have found that a wide variety of approaches are being adopted.  In my view, the three most difficult banks to deal with on behalf of mortgage holders are Bank of Scotland, Danske Bank and Bank of Ireland.  I cannot understand how they are resolving their mortgage arrears by stonewalling all reasonable efforts by debtors and those who represent them to try to find long term sustainable solutions.  I ask that the committee question those banks about what restructuring arrangements they have entered into.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040200003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Hall","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396443900,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I find it extraordinary to be before this committee again in 2014 discussing the issue of mortgage arrears and resolutions for consumers five or six years after this discussion was first commenced by the legislators and policy-makers of this country.  Today, I bring before the committee what has been the experience of FLAC in this regard.<\/p><p>  FLAC is a non-governmental organisation focused on access to justice.  It is clear that those who are in mortgage arrears and struggling to restructure or deal with their mortgage arrears and their debt are not getting access to justice.  We have identified nine different areas where reform is needed and where systems and structures need either to be changed or implemented.  In this regard, I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Paul Joyce.

Page 1 of the submission contains a number of statistics, the most significant of which, in our view, is the fact that as of the end of 2013, there are 33,500 mortgage accounts on principal dwelling houses that have been arrears for more than two years.  These are the intractable and difficult cases for which solutions are currently not being found.<\/p><p>  The Department of Finance now provides monthly statistics for the six main lenders under the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP.  Of the 80,000 accounts of those six lenders that have been in arrears for more than 90 days, only approximately 20,000 have been restructured.  This means 60,000 have not as of yet been addressed.  Of the 20,000 that have been restructured, only two in three are permanent restructures and one in three is temporary.  We do not have information on how sustainable those restructures are.<\/p><p>  In the last six months of 2013 more than 3,300 new proceedings were brought to enforced security on a mortgage on a principal dwelling house.  This indicates a ramping up of repossession activity.  The principal instrument protecting borrowers is the Central Bank's code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  The code was revised in 2013 to, we believe, the detriment of consumers.  The Central Bank devises, amends and clarifies these codes without any parliamentary scrutiny or oversight of which we are aware.  A number of consumer organisations made submissions on the revised code of conduct in 2013 to no avail.  We wonder whether the Central Bank should take upon itself or be given the power to take upon itself the role of quasi-legislator in terms of attempting to resolve the problem.  The code was adverse to borrowers in many respects.  It relaxed the requirements in relation to unsolicited contacts with borrowers and allowed for unsolicited personal visits.<\/p><p>  There is a fundamental imbalance in the decision-making process.  We would like the committee to note the following  The 2010 code of conduct on mortgage arrears obliged lenders to look at all the listed alternative repayment options.  There is a subtle amendment in the 2013 code that obliges lenders to look only at options which they themselves offer.  As such, they get to choose which options from the list they wish to offer.  This is the reason for the maddening inconsistency in this regard.  There are people waking up this morning lamenting the fact that their mortgage is one particular provider rather than another because there is no consistency in decision-making.  This imbalance of power is further emphasised by the fact that the code is lacking in the basic elements of fair procedure.<\/p> <p>The borrower does not have an explicit right to details of the lender's full decision-making process in whether an alternative repayment arrangement should be offered.  Equally, the appeals mechanism is from the lender's arrears support unit to the lender's appeals board.  The further referral to the Financial Services Ombudsman is also lacking in fair procedures and the ombudsman is on record as having stated he will not interfere with the commercial discretion of a lender to offer a restructuring process or not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040200004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Joyce","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396444500,"counter":101,"content":"<p>This is a good opportunity for us to speak before the committee.  I am joined by my colleague, Ms Anna Walsh, the co-ordinator of Waterford MABS.  Today we will bring her experience in dealing with families in mortgage arrears for the committee's interest.<\/p><p>  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, is a State service funded and supported by the Citizens Information Board, under the Department of Social Protection, and it has been in operation since 1992.  We have over 20 years of experience as a trusted intermediary in debt resolution, with that trust won through experience, expertise and outcome.  MABS operates a network of 51 local companies in over 65 locations, as well as two national companies, a helpline and a website, <i>mabs.ie<\/i>.  The work is supported by the websites <i>keepingyourhome.ie<\/i> and <i>citizensinformation.ie<\/i>.  There is also the mortgage arrears information helpline, run to date by the Citizens Information Board but which will transfer to MABS from 1 June this year.<\/p><p>  Committee members would be familiar with the MABS process, which centres on the particular circumstances of each unique client, seeking to maximise income, examine outgoings, control spend and establish reasonable and sustainable offers to make to creditors.  These offers are designed to create sustainable arrangements, which allow a client to discharge his or her obligations to a creditor while at the same time maintaining an acceptable standard of living.  It is our experience that sustainable arrangements are those which take a holistic approach to the individual client, examining all debts, commitments and income.  The complex, multi-layered problem which is over-indebtedness requires a solution which is equally multi-layered, and there is no silver bullet.  All debt and creditors must be examined in the context of the individual client.<\/p><p>  The current mortgage crisis is exceptional in its scale, both in terms of the numbers of families affected and the value of the debt involved.  Of 20,000 new clients who came to a MABS office in 2013, slightly less than half, at 48%, presented with mortgage difficulties.  Two thirds of calls to our MABS helpline pertain to mortgage debt, with support being provided through that channel as appropriate.  The vast majority of those living in mortgaged accommodation with debt difficulties, at 36.5%, have a recorded status of married with children.  Age of clients tends to be between 41 and 65, with 55% of clients in this age group.  Approximately 40% of clients are waged, with the next highest income source coming from the 18% of clients on jobseeker's allowance.  Geographically, there is the unsurprising finding that clients correlate with high population centres.<\/p><p>  Of those clients presenting with mortgage issues, 45% were already in the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, and being supported by lenders, with 54% outside that process.  The focus on mortgage debt is essential in that the consequences of failure to maintain payments on mortgage loans can result in the loss of a home.  MABS would add, however, that a balanced approach is essential if the client is not to be disadvantaged by the system designed to assist in the resolution of a debt.  One of the difficulties we see in participation in a MARP and its necessary focus is the negative consequences it can have for a client.  Failure to adequately address other pressing debt problems can result in exclusion from financial services and loss of access to credit.  We have seen considerable incidence of this within our client base, and lenders within the secondary tier of debt require a minimum level of repayment to maintain credit status.  When this is lost the client has no support for even the simplest household emergency.  In a recent case a client was left with no access to credit following a death in his family, with apparently no option but recourse to an unlicensed moneylender if support from charity or friends could not be sourced beyond an exceptional needs payment from the Department of Social Protection.  Clients can find affordable avenues for credit are closed and the only credit available is through high-cost moneylending.<\/p><p>  Some clients, having defaulted on payment arrangements, are forced to close otherwise functioning accounts in order to agree long-term sustainable solutions with their mortgage lender.  Without any social lending programme many distressed borrowers could be tempted to access finance from unlicensed sources.  MABS and the Citizens Information Board have made proposals on social lending models and look forward to seeing progression in this area.<\/p><p>  The cost associated with over-indebtedness and the loss of the family home is not confined to the individual, although that is where it is most keenly felt.  The cost is also borne to an extent by the Exchequer through the necessary resourcing of other supports, including potential accommodation provision.  There is therefore an imperative on an individual, societal and economic basis to deal with the crisis effectively.  We echo the comments of Mr. Joyce and Ms Blackwell in their critique of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  There are benefits in that there is a protocol in place, although our experience has not always been positive.

I welcome the representatives from the three groups before us.  The purpose of this engagement is for us to sharpen our questions to be put to representatives of the banks next week.  Last September, I found it a very frustrating experience not having an agreed template for information, with much data presented on the day.  We were bombarded with information and had to try to interpret it there and then.  Trying to get questions answered was like chasing a shadow but I hope next week's experience will be far more productive.  As a committee we have learned to refine and improve our approach.<\/p><p>  I will quickly come to the questions.  However bad a position is now with mortgage arrears - it continues to be an extremely serious national crisis - the elephant in the room is the historically low interest rates that we still have and how they relate to tracker mortgages in particular.  The European Central Bank base rate is 0.25%, which may reduce slightly but will eventually, as night follows day, begin to rise again.  We could potentially be sitting on an even more serious time bomb in that respect if tracker interest rates go up in line with the ECB rate.  Variable rates did not come down in line with the ECB rate but banks could use the excuse of the rate increasing to hike standard variable rates again.  I am laying down that marker as I have a serious concern in that respect.  Many people are just scraping by now and if rates increase by a 0.5% or 1% over a period, they will really struggle and more people could go into arrears.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge the great work being done by all the organisations today to help mortgage holders.  Statistics have indicated that 325 deals have been done with AIB alone since the alliance last November, and many of those have involved an element of mortgage write-off.  The profile of solutions being achieved by Mr. Hall's organisation for clients seems to be different from the overall profile of restructuring solutions put in place by the Central Bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040200005#D00600","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396444500,"counter":106,"content":"<p>We have been doing this for a number of years.

We met somebody who could capture information at the entrance but it would never get up the chain.  The structures in question are long-term and sustainable, teased out on a microscopic basis.  Would we like somebody to come with a magic wand and say everything is sorted?  Yes, but the reality is the system is not perfect but it allows for direct engagement with decision makers within the bank in a much speedier way.  The solutions outlined in the template demonstrate a long-term, sustainable and permanent solution, with less risk of it falling over.  It was mentioned earlier that there have been suites of solutions with people having short-term, interest-only periods, which everybody has criticised.  They are still being done and each of the monthly figures there is a significant cohort of such examples.

We see the cases that are being resolved by the mortgage holders group with AIB, for example, while other banks have a very strict policy of no debt forgiveness whatsoever.  While I accept that there must be an element of commercial discretion when banks are making decisions, it is a very frustrating experience for borrowers not knowing where they stand or what criteria are being used to assess their case.

Reducing the principal sum to a specified amount is specifically mentioned in the CCMA but there is no category in the statistics for debt write-down, even though it has been achieved on a sporadic basis with one lender in particular.  First, what is required is an obligation on lenders to look at each of the options and a proper appeals process, with full information provided to the borrower that the reasonableness of the lender's decisions can be inquired upon.  The FSO on its website and from what we have heard seems not to want to look at substantive decision making, just process.

One of the things about the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation model is that there is expertise for the borrowers and trained people in the banks.  The IMHO goes to the same people time and again on an agreed model.  That is not the experience of FLAC.  Over 3,000 people contacted FLAC last year through our centres and telephone lines in utter frustration at the lack of professionalism in the way they were being dealt with.  Even when we look at those cases we find it impossible to get the banks to grapple with the reality, because one is dealing with different people all the time.<\/p><p>  There is an absence of proper support for borrowers.  The only support available at present is an accountant, once the bank has made its offer, to explain the ramifications of that offer after it has been made.  What is required is proper support going through the system from financial advisers and legal advisers, a model whereby MABS and the Legal Aid Board are properly supported to give that advice to people who cannot afford it.  Absent that, people do not know what they are doing.  They make bad decisions, and they do so because they are talking about the roofs over their heads.  We have been pushing this angle for years.  It is extraordinary that people are being asked to do this on their own.  One sees how it can be done differently.  It need not cost the State because the lender could and should pay for it.

The first is that somebody in that situation can go to any of the six organisations represented at the committee today.  That causes a difficulty because there is an expectation on the part of the borrower that one or other of them will deliver the perfect solution.  In reality, there is an issue that perhaps echoes the point raised by Ms Blackwell.  Borrowers are very much on the back foot in terms of the CCMA and the MARP.  Everything is reactive.  They are given an offer and are told that is it.  Sections 39 and 40 of the code provide for a lender to explore a range of his options - not any specified options but the options he is willing to provide - and set it out.  However, all he is obliged to communicate to the debtor is the one he has chosen.  There is no alternative.  There is a requirement for anybody in mortgage arrears to access money advice, financial advice and legal advice on the particular circumstances with which they are faced and in an ideal scenario construct an offer to bring to their lender, rather than to be on the receiving end of that offer.<\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the mortgage arrears information helpline as part of the mortgage arrears information service.  The helpline has handled 11,000 calls since its establishment.  Of those calls, approximately one half was made after the people had already received a final offer from their lender and two thirds of those were sale or repossession.  That was the only offer on the table.  Interestingly, that service had been envisaged as being targeted at people who were in pre-arrears rather than arrears.  People must deal with it very quickly.  Our preference in MABS is that we would hear from people very early in the problem, before their lender is even aware that there is a difficulty.  The earlier it can be addressed, the more options that are open to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040200006#E00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Carol Dunne"},{"type":"speech","time":1396445100,"counter":113,"content":"<p>That is the end of the Deputy's slot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040200006#E00700","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1396445100,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I can keep going if the Chair wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040200006#E00800","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1396445100,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I must call Deputy Kieran O'Donnell, who has ten minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040200006#E00900","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1396445100,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  I wish to mention a few points that regularly arise on a practical level.  Mr. Hall referred to Danske Bank and Bank of Scotland.  I have been hearing from many people about Danske Bank in the last few weeks, where the bank has become extremely aggressive, in some cases involving the family home.  It is moving with receivers overnight.  I have one case where the individual is two months in arrears.  He brought the payments up to date but the bank still appointed a receiver.  In this case he could lose his family home because it is linked with a business asset which has equity, but ultimately it can be got back in terms of the family home.<\/p><p>  Danske Bank is effectively what was National Irish Bank, which was a long established bank with a network throughout the country.  Bank of Scotland is slightly different in that it emerged from an equity bank so it is a slightly different model.  We therefore have people coming out of an Irish banking system.  I have had two cases in the last two days where the people are literally not sleeping at night.  They brought their arrears up to date.  In one case the receiver has been appointed and in another case we are trying to find a way around it.  What is required to be done?  These banks are seeking to clean up their loan books over the next number of months.  Is the issue of the institutions seeking to clean up their loan books impinging on how they are dealing with people on the ground?<\/p><p>  Danske Bank is a big worry for me in both cases.  In one of the cases the person is a farmer who banked with National Irish Bank all his life.  The other person is in business but, once again, is worried about the family home.  The bank appears to be appallingly aggressive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040200006#E01000","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396445100,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I specifically mentioned those three banks.

There is nothing in it.<\/p><p>  The code of conduct hinges on what is called a standard financial statement, but there is no standard person.  Financial statements even for neighbouring families who have a similar composition in terms of make-up and income will not look the same.  Therefore, one will end up with problems when one tries to mechanise a system and move people through it.  Even in terms of the resolutions that have been reached, time will tell how sustainable they prove to be.  My organisation has serious concerns about building long-term resolutions on standard financial statements and their sustainability.

Out of those, 2,301 - 42% - were subsequently queried by the lenders.  It went into a bit of detail as to what it regarded as the vulnerability of its clients and some of the strategies in which banks engaged, including telephoning them.  The implication seemed to be that MABS was regarded as being \"too soft\" in the preparation of the standard financial statement.  The document suggested that MABS was queried on, for example, the costs it included for third level education, child care, lifestyle and entertainment, utilities and so forth.  What I took from this document, which I would like MABS to confirm, is that vulnerable people were being picked on and telephoned when they did not have advice available to them and after completing a standard financial statement with the assistance of MABS in a manner which it regarded as being fair and which would have set out the expenditure it regarded as reasonable.

In fairness, if budgeting was a simple act of arithmetic, we would all be out of business because there would be no need for our services.  What tends to happen is that people underestimate their spending; they do not know where the money goes.  If one asks them over the telephone what they are spending on food shopping, they will give a figure, but they will not actually know whether it is accurate.  They need a period of time to document what they are doing with their money and they can then look at areas where they are overspending.  Many people come back and tell us that they did not know they were overspending on certain things and they revisit that spending.  A reasonable period of time is required for this process, after which we would regard the starndard financial statement, SFS, as having been diligently compiled and providing a sound basis in moving forward.  The reported experience of clients coming to us is that many of them consider that, if they do not comply in completing the SFS over the telephone, their house will be repossessed and that they must do what the bank wants.

There is nothing to prevent the State, except policy interests alone, from putting in place an appeals system in order that the word of the creditor is not the final one.  Our policy is that each issue is dealt with on a case by case basis and the creditor has the final say.

The committee should note that the word \"appeal\" is not used in the CCMA; the word used is \"referral\".  The statement on the Financial Services Ombudsman's website is very clear.  He sees his role in terms of examining the conduct of the provider, determining whether the processes were adhered to and whether the boxes were ticked, not examining whether it was appropriate, in the circumstances, to restructure a mortgage.  There would clearly be a problem if legislation was passed obliging lenders to go down a certain road in that it could be challenged, but nobody has tried to do this yet.  The question of whether it is unconstitutional would need to be considered in the light of the public interest and the common good in clearing up a very large personal debt crisis.

One party to a mortgage comes to us looking for help but the other will not co-operate, engage or even fill in the paper work.

Then both parties are deemed to be unco-operative.  That is not fair on the people who have come to us seeking help and have gone to the lender with their paperwork and a planned solution.  Such persons are, clearly, co-operating and doing all they can.  However, the lenders will say that in order to put in place any kind of restructuring arrangement, they need the signatures of all parties to the mortgage and so forth.  That is fine in the sense that the contracts are in place, but it needs to be changed.  If there is a willing party who wants to stay in a house who can come up with some arrangement, he or she should not be precluded from doing so because another party with whom the mortgage was entered into no longer wants to engage or pay.  The situation is made worse by the fact that the people who are affected most are often the most vulnerable.  They have financial difficulties, certainly, but they also have lots of other difficulties which they are going through at the same time.  This exacerbates matters hugely.  Some of the most vulnerable people who come to us, the ones in need of most help, support and guidance are in that category.  When relationships break down, there are no longer joint finances.

It is exactly the same with the banks; the inconsistencies are absolutely horrific.  This is apparent whether one is speaking to bank officials, trying to arrange a solution, or, as the representative from MABS mentioned, determining the standard financial statement.  In reality, there is no functioning system that is in any shape or form consistent.  Trying to determine consistency within one lender is in and of itself dramatic.<\/p><p>  When the banks appeared before the joint committee previously, they were asked about the legal queue.  I suggest members put the question: \"What is a legal queue?\"  Some say a legal queue begins when a solicitor's letter issues, while others say a legal queue begins when they determine the entitled letter \"legal\".  The implications of getting out of a legal queue with some lenders involve a 50% payment of the mortgage arrears, while in other cases a 15% payment of the mortgage arrears is required.  That is a complete and utter inconsistency.  Of the 325 deals IMHO has done with AIB, 22% of those involved repossession proceedings.  Some 22% of existing clients are faced with repossession proceedings.  The Taoiseach is wrong; there are many hundreds of active repossession proceedings.  AIB handed out 1,800 cases to a number of organisations to try to intercept people prior to going to court.  Yes, there is sensitivity in AIB.  Bank of Ireland does not care.  There are monumental differences.<\/p><p>  To return to the issue of consistency around the CCMA, there is no consistency.  It is like the Gaza Strip.  Individual lenders can do anything.  Some are exiting the country, as Deputy O'Donnell said, some are trying to stay, and some are advertising that they got people a home, but they might not keep them in their homes.  There are inconsistencies all over the place.  There are land mines everywhere for the indebted person who is doing his best to try to navigate through an impossible situation with the help of under-resourced and under-funded organisations.  We and the other organisations should not be in existence.  The Government and the Oireachtas have failed miserably.  I should not be here.

One is sitting across from a person who thinks he or she will lose the family home, and may very well lose the family home, but in the back of one's mind one is calculating his or her chances, depending on the bank.  That shows the banks are completely inconsistent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040200010#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Hall"},{"type":"speech","time":1396447500,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hall.

I really wonder if the standard financial statements are sufficiently stress-tested.  I suggest they are not.  Further, I think there is a great need for some organisation such as MABS to monitor the arrangements post-resolution and continually review them, particularly split mortgages.  Somebody has to be there to assist and support the borrower in looking for review and monitoring post-resolution.

There is no capacity to have a proper conversation with the client.  It depends on how terrified the person at the other end is as well.  The borrower is terrified but sometimes it seems to us that the person who is trying to manage it for the creditor is terrified as well.  They are not trained.  They are not doing business in a professional way.

When I listened to what the witnesses had to say about the use of computers, it struck me that the comedy \"Little Britain\" was prescient when it depicted a customer being given the response \"computer says no\" regardless of what he or she asked.  That seems more or less to sum up what the banks are at.  I have to say that the bleak picture which has been painted by the witnesses is reflected in my clinic daily when I hear from people who are in dire straits.  One of the worst aspects of all of this is that people are threatened with homelessness.<\/p><p>  I do not know whether the witnesses would like to comment on a point that should be made.  I recently asked my local authority how much it costs weekly to look after someone who is homeless.  I was told it costs approximately &euro;800 a week, which means the State has to pay approximately &euro;3,200 a month to look after a homeless person.  Given that this is probably a fraction of the monthly mortgage repayment someone might be required to make, it is clear we are getting screwed.  I refer not only to those who are in danger of homelessness because of the activities of the banks, but also to the State and the public finances, which are screwed when repossessions take place.<\/p><p>  The witnesses seem to be saying that the banks will act as banks do by taking the fastest and most direct route to get money.  If that means repossessing people's houses, that is what they will do.  There is an onus on the Government to change this.  I would like the witnesses to set out specifically what the Government needs to do in that context.  Most ordinary people are wondering how the hell we can let the banks, which we bailed out, act as a law unto themselves to the detriment of mortgage holders and society as a whole.  Can the witnesses specify what they want the Government to tell the banks to do and how this should be done?<\/p><p>  Do the witnesses agree that unless someone refuses point blank to engage in any shape or form, the State should not allow repossessions to take place?  This is the proper approach for financial reasons and for humanitarian reasons of basic human decency.  No other approach makes any sense, as it will put people out on the street and we will have to pick up the bill.  Do the witnesses agree that the approach I have set out should be written clearly into the guidelines?  Do they agree that all this is simply about the bank veto, about which many of us kicked up at the time?

We need to start again tomorrow morning by designing a system that will succeed, rather than failing as the current system has.  When banks that are State-owned or partly State-funded evict people from homes, the local authorities are required to house them by making payments to landlords who then make payments to foreign banks.

It was intended as a short-term arrangement anyway.  We need to consider longer-term solutions.  If the type of client we are discussing is about to be made homeless and no other options are available to him or her, we have to revisit the mortgage to rent scheme.  As it stands, the scheme is not fit for purpose.  Senator Hayden spoke about separated couples.  Where is the equality for a family if a judgment is imposed on the family home because one of the separated partners has deserted that home?

However, I would not agree that the Government is in total denial or that it is delusional.  For the past five years, I have been adamant that the mortgage crisis, particularly as it affects my generation, is one of the biggest problems facing society.  I think the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 has the potential to take more people in this country out of trouble than any other legislation.  It is not yet doing that, however.  There are a couple of problems with it.  Prior to today's meeting, I heard some of the witnesses' opinions on how the legislation might be improved.<\/p><p>  I am of the belief that the fundamental problem in this regard revolves around money.  Some of the banks that we recapitalised for the purposes of dealing with mortgage distress have said they intend to pay that money back to the Government with some interest.  I did not ask the Government to give the banks money for the purposes of getting it back.  I wanted people to get a break on their loans and their mortgages.  I want us, as a community, to spread the distress among all members of society.  That is not happening.  The quintessential representation of how to deal with distressed mortgages in an equitable manner involves a mortgage to rent situation whereby there is an equity stake to be dealt with.  We must not forget that such a solution creates a fundamental problem for the banks.  Their fundamental legal obligation - their fiduciary duty - is not to their borrowers but to their shareholders.  That is why we ultimately need legislation to protect them.  What can we do to increase consumer knowledge of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012?  What can we do to make the process cheaper?  How can we improve these matters so that the banks are no longer looking after their shareholders only?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040200011#K01900","speaker":"1048"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396448700,"counter":198,"content":"<p>The personal insolvency legislation allows for both secured and unsecured debts to be written down by way of a personal insolvency arrangement.

The cost is too prohibitive, not just the PIP cost, which is unclear and uncertain, although many PIPs do not charge upfront.

The conventional wisdom is that it is a mortgage which is paid off in full by the time a person reaches retirement and enables the house to be mortgage-free for the children when the person dies 20 or 30 years later.  That conventional wisdom is incorporated in the Central Bank's definition of what constitutes a sustainable solution.  However, this view is leading to very many perfectly sustainable mortgages being classified as unsustainable.  The borrowers affected are receiving letters to tell them that there should be an assisted voluntary sale of their home.  That is wrong.  It is also leading in some cases but not as many to people with sustainable mortgages having split mortgages and other solutions at the expense of the taxpayer and which they should not be given.  If we do not have an understanding of the definition of a sustainable mortgage and if there is no proper definition, much of our analysis and policy decisions will be faulty.  I will argue that a mortgage does not have to be paid off by the time a person reaches retirement.  If a borrower can pay the interest on the mortgage at the standard variable rate, that mortgage is sustainable and it is sustainable whether the person is aged 25, 45 or 75 years.  People ask what will happen when a borrower retires while still owing a mortgage.  If the person can still pay interest at the standard variable rate on that mortgage, it is a sustainable mortgage and the mortgage will be repaid.  For some reason, a mortgage is the only expenditure that is regarded by conventional wisdom as an expenditure that it is necessary to repay in advance of retirement.  For example, we do not have to pay our health insurance or meet any other expense in full by the time we retire.  I met a woman who is in her mid-50s and has ten years before retirement.  She can pay the interest on a mortgage of &euro;150,000, while the house is worth &euro;250,000, but the bank has told her that her mortgage is unsustainable and that she has to sell her home.  She can easily afford to pay the interest and has done so for the past three or four years, but that is all she is able to do.  It does not suit her to do otherwise because she has children in school and college.<\/p><p>  The definition is completely wrong.  This arises from the Central Bank's insistence on having sustainable solutions for a certain percentage of customers.  This sustainable solution is not designed to help borrowers; it is designed as a prudential measure for the banks.  This is a very important point.  That is the reason repossession is a sustainable solution.  It is a sustainable solution for the banks, not for borrowers.  This is a point the committee needs to bear in mind when asking the banks about their targets.  What are their targets for treating customers properly?  That is the most important aspect.  The interest-only option is a fine solution for some borrowers, but we tend to dismiss interest-only payments as kicking the can down the road.  The Central Bank categorises it as a temporary solution, but it is nothing of the sort.  Interest-only payments offer a sustainable solution.  This should be remembered.<\/p><p>  When the committee makes policy decisions and prepares questions for the banks and the Central Bank, I suggest it asks them to state their attitude and ask why they repossess houses from borrowers in positive equity who are able to pay the interest in full.  The same definition also applies in cases of negative equity.  In cases of deep negative equity where a borrower has a mortgage of &euro;300,000 on a house worth &euro;100,000, if the borrower is unable to pay the interest on the loan but is able to pay the interest on the current value of the property, a sustainable solution involving a debt write-off or a split mortgage could be developed.  However, this is all based on a proper definition and understanding of what is a sustainable solution.  It is a little uncomfortable to challenge the conventional wisdom and most people react negatively when I put it to them.  However, once they have considered it for a while, which might be a few weeks, it sometimes sinks in that there is some sense to it.  I ask the committee to think about this and can discuss with members the implications for those with cheap tracker mortgages, as well as other unsecured debt, with other issues they wish to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040200015#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Burgess"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396450200,"counter":240,"content":"<p>My colleague, Mr. O'Reilly, will assist me.  I am a solicitor working with Phoenix Project Ireland, while Mr. O'Reilly is a financial adviser with many years experience in the financial services industry.  We have gathered some statistics from a wide range of people with whom we have dealt since the foundation of the project in 2008.  I will give details of the worrying aspects of the statistics, while Mr. O'Reilly will help to answer questions about these statistics and financial information.<\/p><p>  Ours is a unique organisation which was specifically formed in 2008 to deal with this crisis.  We are not funded by the Government or banks and do not charge fees.  We rely entirely on donations from the public to provide the service.  We have seen 20,000 people since our foundation.  Since the introduction of the MARP targets last August, we have seen more than 3,000 people and surveyed all of the details of their experiences.  That survey produced some startling results, showing that in the case of more than 50% of the people we had seen, their only resolution option was eviction.  That comes dressed in three sets of clothing.  Court proceedings have been issued in the case of 3.35%; 14% are being threatened with repossession by means of solicitors' letters; 33% have received letters from banks asking them to surrender their homes or, in some cases, offering them the option to sell their homes.  Interestingly, almost all of the letters contain a reference to the availability of a mortgage-to-rent option, yet I heard for the first time today that this was no longer available.  Up until today all I could see in statistics was that funding was available from the Government for 250 mortgages-to-rent this year.  From the statistics at our disposal, if, as the March Central Bank figures claim, there are 136,000 home loan mortgages in arrears across the banks covered in the Central Bank report, we calculate that just over 50% have received direct threats of proceedings for repossession or invitations to sell their properties.  All of the available official statistics from the Central Bank and the Department of Finance deal with court repossessions only.  They deal with restructuring offers and court repossessions.  We have provided the committee with a pie chart of repossessions not covered by official statistics; these are the voluntary surrender letters and the letters threatening legal proceedings.  We can give the committee more details about these statistics.<\/p><p>  One of our greatest concerns about the voluntary sale-voluntary surrender letters is the silence.  We have no idea how many people are offering up their keys every day.  Whenever we talk about the number of court repossession orders being one or two a day, we have no idea what is happening in this silent area and I am not sure if we will ever know.  This is a significant concern.  We see people daily who have no idea where they will go.  At this point they believe they have no choice but to hand over the keys.  In fact, one of our biggest roles is to advise people no to do so, that there is due process in law.<\/p> <p>If one waits for proceedings to issue, as one is entitled to do, it could take up to two years for due process to take place.  One may even be able to challenge some of this under the MARP code.  The High Court recently handed down a decision in which it refused repossession because the bank had not complied with the mortgage arrears code.  Part of our brief is to stop people from handing over the keys.  The bigger problem for such individuals relates to where they should go and where they should live.  They do not qualify for restructuring because they do not have enough money.  I was interested in the statistic produced by MABS to the effect that 60% of the people with which it dealt were unemployed.  This means that 40% of its clients are on wages, but we must ask what wages they are on.  That is our experience.  Another interesting statistic provided by MABS is that 55% of its clients are aged between 41 and 60 years.  Again, that is a common statistic for us.  The people concerned do not fit into the sustainable criteria to which Mr. Burgess referred.<\/p><p> Another worrying trend is that there is a huge focus on positive equity.  Anybody in positive equity is not being offered restructuring.  That is where the whole process is moving.  Unfortunately, as the groups which addressed the committee before us indicated, transparency around resolution options is completely absent.  Mr. Joyce from FLAC dealt with this matter in the context of provision 40 of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  I outlined the actual wording of that provision in the submission I made to the committee.  Provision 40 is not being adhered to.  We asked the banks, in line with the rules on data protection, to provide us with a detailed consideration of the options for borrowers, but they have failed to do so.  In the context of the rules on data protection, the banks are very willing to provide information on every other area within 40 days.  However, we are not receiving the information we are seeking on this matter.  We are really concerned about this.

We do not come across people who can pay but who do not want to do so.  The treatment of people on a case by case basis is another myth.  The banks have moved completely away from providing relationship-based services to using call centres and encouraging staff to use Christian names only.  When one contacts such centres, one can never speak to the same person twice.  The banks also have extremely draconian ways of defining people as being non-co-operative.

New Beginning believes that, at least in principle, the structures are in place to facilitate the working-out of a solution to this problem, whether it be through the code, the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, the Bankruptcy Act 1988 or section 2 of the new Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013, on which we worked with Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly.  The difficulty is - it cannot be underestimated - that waiting for banks to provide solutions is not the way to proceed anymore.  Debtors need to understand what is available to them.  In that regard, New Beginning has embarked on a national tour and will have visited every county in Ireland by the end of next week.  The idea in this regard is to make known to ordinary people the solutions available thanks to the introduction of the 2012 Act and, most importantly, the new bankruptcy laws.  I will deal with the issue of bankruptcy.<\/p><p>  Negotiation is the first step available via the MARP process.  The problem with this is that it is a completely opaque system.  As previous speakers pointed out, there is no transparency with regard to the criteria the banks apply.  In addition, some of these criteria are deeply unfair.  If, for example, one is in positive equity, one simply cannot obtain a deal.  The person living next door, however, who happened to purchase his or her home a few years later and is in negative equity will get a deal.  We are concerned about the lack of transparency because it leads to resentment on the part of those who do not obtain deals.  It can also lead to resentment on the part of the community in general who are, in the case of banks such as AIB, financing these deals.  For those who have business with a number of banks or debts with various parties, it is impossible to put everyone in the same room together in an informal sense.  We have grave concerns about transparency and recognise that in the case of multiple creditors, informal deals are almost impossible.<\/p><p>  The next part of the process involves the insolvency system.  While the take-up has been low thus far, international comparisons show that this is to be expected.  One would expect the rate to spike later this year and into 2015.  The idea behind the system is that one puts creditors in a room and forces them to agree to debt restructuring.  The question which arises is why would a creditor agree to such debt restructuring?  Why is it that over 94% of individual voluntary arrangements, IVAs, arrived at in the United Kingdom are accepted, particularly when, in the context of a standard IVA, one would expect a 70% or even greater write-down of unsecured debts?  The reason for this is the existence in Britain of a benign bankruptcy law.  While our laws are not quite as benign, they are sufficiently so to allow people to start to put pressure on banks.  People must understand that, for all its disadvantages, bankruptcy means that all of one's debts are written off in a moment and that one can start again there and then.  It is, therefore, a reboot.  It is not the case that everyone must go bankrupt.  However, it is a card that people now have at their disposal.  Their having it fundamentally changes the negotiation process involving creditors.  It is important that people understand what is involved.<\/p><p>  What are the negatives in bankruptcy?  People say there is a stigma attaching to it.  We just need to get over this in this country.  People here have faced a perfect storm.  On the one hand, there has been an enormous recession and the collapse of real estate prices, while, on the other, the fact that we are in the eurozone means that our debts have not deflated as they would have done if we still had our own currency.  The other aspect is that we have not had our own insolvency system up until now.  As a result, there was no way out.  The position in this regard has now changed and we hope this will force the banks to do the deals they ought to have been doing in 2008.  The other concern people have with regard to bankruptcy relates to the family home.  The assignee has repeatedly stated he does not want to sell family homes in bankruptcy.  He has indicated that he will do so if he has to do so, but in reality the houses in question were going to be lost.  In many cases, family homes will not necessarily be lost in bankruptcy.<\/p><p>  Bankruptcy does not make any difference in the context of employment, unless one is a pharmacist or an auctioneer.  It is bizarre that if one is bankrupt, one cannot be a pharmacist, but one can be a doctor and that one cannot be an auctioneer, but one can be a solicitor.  There are some anomalies in the system and I understand legislation is going through the Houses to facilitate people who are bankrupt and want to run in D&aacute;il elections.  That makes sense because we need to get over the stigma attaching to bankruptcy.  Many people, small business owners and the like, have been obliged to put up with this nightmare for the past five years.  For them, bankruptcy has no downside in the context of employment.  At the height of the crisis in the United Kingdom in 2008, there were 70,000 bankruptcies.  In Ireland last year the figure for bankruptcies stood somewhere in the mid-40s.  I inform people that Abraham Lincoln, Walt Disney and Donald Trump who recently visited Ireland in order to purchase the golf resort at Doonbeg were all bankrupts at one point.  We need to get over our difficulties with bankruptcy.  That, in my respectful submission to the committee, would have the effect of forcing through the deals which need to be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040200016#R00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ross Maguire"},{"type":"speech","time":1396450800,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them for the work they are doing on behalf of consumers and, in particular, those mortgage holders operating in very stressful circumstances.  Ms Sadlier referred to a key issue.  One of the most sinister developments in recent times was the change to the code of conduct and the option for banks, in certain circumstances, to declare people as not co-operating.  It is very much at the discretion of the banks to do this and this is happening at a time when their systems are still not up to standard.  During the break in proceedings I returned a number of calls, one of which was to somebody in mortgage arrears and who in the past two weeks received three conflicting letters from the bank.  The first declared the person in question to be not co-operating; the second offered a solution, while the third stated the current arrangement was going to expire.  The person's telephone calls are not being returned and on each occasion contact is made with the bank, it is with a different individual.  The bank is not prepared to facilitate proper engagement in writing, with the exception of the standard letters to which I refer.  It is extremely difficult for people to know where they stand.  The banks now have at their disposal the weapon of being able to declare people as not co-operating and, essentially, are in a position to move against them - in a legal sense - immediately.<\/p> <p> Ms Sadlier made a point also about the percentage of solutions that are in the repossession or voluntary surrender realm.  The official figures show that more than 60% of the offers of sustainable solutions under the MART framework are in that area whereby the family home will be lost.  It is difficult to understand how that can be stood over in any way.<\/p><p> Mr. Brendan Burgess put forward a different interpretation of a sustainable solution, which is not properly defined at present, but we read that the protocol the Central Bank is trying to put in place with lenders, whereby multiple debts can be dealt with under an agreed formula, is being resisted.  What would be the impact of his definition of sustainable mortgage on the other forms of debt, the unsecured debt?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040200016#R00500","speaker":"993","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396451400,"counter":247,"content":"<p>For a mortgage to be sustainable the borrower must be able to pay the standard variable rate of interest on it, and that can be extended to stage two.  If the borrower can pay the standard variable rate of interest on their unsecured debts, those debts are also sustainable.  If the borrower cannot pay the standard variable rate of interest on their mortgage and there has to be some sort of deal on their mortgage, the unsecured creditors should be taking a bit hit.  When one has a measure of sustainability, one can see what one would do with the unsecured creditors.  If a person has a mortgage of &euro;300,000, a house worth &euro;200,000 and owes another &euro;50,000 to the credit union, if the bank has to write down unsecured debt to make the mortgage sustainable, the other unsecured debt should be written off.  Against that, a bigger problem for the credit unions at present is they are being asked to write off debt under the Central Bank waterfall scheme in order that the borrower can repay capital on their mortgage.  That, to me, makes no sense.  There is no reason a credit union should have to write off debt to make a mortgage sustainable when that definition of \"sustainable\" means the mortgage has to be paid off by the age of 65 or so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040200017#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Burgess"},{"type":"speech","time":1396451400,"counter":248,"content":"<p>Mr. Maguire has put forward bankruptcy as a more attractive option than many people would have seen it as being up to now.

There is the stigma of becoming a bankrupt, but I agree with him that as a country we have to get over that and be more mature.  The reason people are so anxious to fight for their life to hold on to their home, whether it be by restructuring the mortgage or avoiding bankruptcy, if that means they would lose their home, is that they are afraid they will never get credit again.  That will become an issue in the next decade or so when all of this washes itself out and people have had write-offs, an insolvency arrangement or bilateral arrangement with their bank.  What are their prospects of ever buying a home again and getting credit?

In terms of a person getting credit again, there is a need for lenders in the State, whether it be a new lender, and that could well happen, to consider people who have gone through insolvency and see them as better credits.  In other words, I could say to someone that if they go bankrupt and eradicate their debt or enter an insolvency arrangement and eradicate their debts, I am here to lend.  Often people are in stable employment and are perfectly good credits.  The difficulty is that they have too much debt.  It would put huge pressure on the incumbents if someone came into the market to do that at a fair rate as opposed to a type of sub-prime loan.  That is something we are actively considering.   That would be the perfect solution where one could say to a person to fix their position by using the insolvency system or bankruptcy and one would be there for the person because that person was a better credit in three years time when they were free of debt than someone who had been trying to bail out a sinking ship for all that time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040200017#S00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ross Maguire"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396451400,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I would add that we have done some research on bankruptcy because many people have made inquiries about it, and even in the UK personal insolvency is a preferred resolution to bankruptcy from a banking point of view when the persons concerned are 20 something years old.

Approximately 50% of people have positive equity and they are very vulnerable.  The reason they are vulnerable is that the Central Bank is saying that the banks must hit these targets and the easiest target for the banks is someone who is in positive equity, and if they are in positive equity and have a cheap tracker, that is gold dust for the bank and it will say to the person that the Central Bank is forcing it to repossess their home.

Regarding the onslaught of repossessions that potentially may come, at what point in their experience are repossessions happening?  In some instances I am led to believe by media commentators that it might be only a couple of months after a borrower has fallen into arrears, and because there is no appeals process or no transparency, there is no real evidence of anyone from a banking perspective really engaging.  I know the anecdotal evidence is that they can do and say what they like and in may cases perhaps they do, but I would be concerned if we were genuinely expected to believe that a person, a number of months after falling into arrears or not being in a position to sustain some sort of acceptable payment, could face a repossession order.  What is the least time, in practice, a banking body would instigate repossession when a person has stopped making repayments?<\/p> <p>I ask the witnesses to please excuse my ignorance.  Reference was made to the fact that we need the stick, as is the case in the UK, that has developed in practice over a number of years, of having a shorter, more effective bankruptcy route, and that people do not use it because they do not really want that option and they use the normal insolvency process that we have established in recent months.  We do not have the same practice yet - first, because the process is not in place for long enough, but second, because we do not have the equivalent stick to use with the banks.  How effective is the stick when in most cases people in bankruptcy have lost everything?  I accept that the witnesses have said people are not losing their houses but in most cases the people I know have lost everything.  People who have gone to the UK have gone through the process in a shorter space of time and they can come back and rebuild again, which thankfully in many cases they do.  However, in most cases people do lose their family home.  Even if the stick was introduced tomorrow it seems that people have to lose everything in order to start again.  The vast majority of people with whom I am dealing do not want to lose everything.  I do not want them to lose everything.  We want to keep people in the family home.  From the limited knowledge I have I believe there are ways of doing that.  Could the witnesses explain to me what I am missing?

Even when one compares our arrears figures with those in the UK, it is a false comparison, because arrears get written off in the UK when a house gets repossessed.  They do not have a personal insolvency arrangement or anything like that in the UK for secured debt because the solution is that the house is repossessed and people move on.  That is the main thing that happens.  That is why I disagree with Mr. Maguire.  My forecast is different from his on bankruptcies.  The banks are not desperately worried about bankruptcies; what they will do is repossess the house and sell it.  We do not want to see bankruptcy as a solution.  It would be handy to have a few big test cases - dramatic cases - to let the banks realise that people are happy to go bankrupt.  Our primary target is that if people have sustainable mortgages or mortgages which could be made sustainable, they should keep their houses and they should not be repossessed.  Any bankers to whom I have spoken have said they are not worried about bankruptcy.  AIB might be a little different; the solutions it has reached in terms of write-offs are based on it working out that in this situation it is better to write off debt than let the person go bankrupt.  I do not think bankruptcy will feature largely.  The banks are not worried about it and borrowers do not want to choose that route.  I have been recommending for years to people that they should forget about dealing with the banks, go to the UK and come back after a year or a year and a half and they will be free.

It would be better to have a one-year stick but it is strong enough as it is.  What I am trying to get across to people - it is almost an educational issue - is that they do not necessarily lose their home in a case of bankruptcy.  What happens is that the assignee takes over one&rsquo;s legal interest in the property.  For example, in the case of a couple, if the husband were to go bankrupt, the house would now be owned by the non-bankrupt wife and the assignee.  The assignee does not want to sell the house and he repeatedly says that.  He will sell if it is in positive equity and the mortgage is unreasonable, but other than that he is very happy for people to continue to pay their way.  If the house is in negative equity he will want to get out, so he has to come up with a formula whereby he asks the non-bankrupt spouse to buy him out for a nominal sum - a figure of &euro;5,000, which might seem like a lot but could potentially be paid over a long period.  That means the house is taken out of bankruptcy.  With all the other unsecured debt gone, and a reasonable mortgage, those people will stay happily in their house.<\/p><p>  There are bankruptcy cases in which a person will lose their house, but they would lose it anyway.  The difference here is that they could potentially get more time in the house, but also, all the negative equity is gone.  The idea that one loses one&rsquo;s house in bankruptcy is simply not the case.  That is what we want to try to get across.  People say they will lose everything, but they will not.  For example, in the law at the moment one is allowed to retain the normal assets of life.  The value put on that is &euro;6,000.  We went through a case recently with a person who was a high earner who was looking at bankruptcy and when he looked around at the various things he had, knowing that his wife owned half of the table and half of the chair, he did not have anything that would be worth more than &euro;6,000.  He had an old car and it was needed for work, so in fact there was no down side for him in terms of the assets he would lose, even though his interests in the family home would transfer to the assignee.  He would go to work in the normal way, the assignee would take part of his income for a period if an excess was available, and life would go on.<\/p><p>  Part of what we are doing on the tour is trying to educate people to the effect that bankruptcy does not involve losing everything and in many cases there is no down side.  It allows one to reboot and the debt is gone.

Some of them are being forced to so do by the targets but one must also remember that many people are more than two years in arrears on their mortgages.  I disagree with the other speakers here and probably with the members in respect of a substantial element.  Most people who have a mortgage try to pay it, but a small percentage of the overall total are not actually particularly interested in paying their mortgages or they will pay as little as possible or prefer other unsecured debts.  Consequently, a significant proportion of people who are in deep arrears do not need to be in deep arrears.  Members should not get me wrong, as most people are in deep arrears out of no choice of their own.  However, some of them are in that position deliberately through not managing their affairs properly, through preferring to pay off unsecured creditors and through simply being financially irresponsible.  As for the way in which the banks can get them to engage, there has been an effective ban on repossessions for the last couple of years and consequently, that backlog will now come into the system.

The process is that a client or a homeowner will be issued with a letter stating whether the position is sustainable and the homeowner will then appeal that letter.  If such homeowners are found to be in an unsustainable position, they will not then be told that they will be repossessed but will be issued with a letter stating they can voluntarily surrender their homes or can voluntarily sell their homes.  Such people will be given six months to 12 months to sell the house in question.  Our statistics show that 33% of those who have been made offers have been offered the option of voluntary sale.  These voluntary sales will not happen for another six to 12 months and if a house does not sell, the follow-on then will be repossession.  Consequently, this probably is unlikely to show itself for another six to 12 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040200019#U00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1396452600,"counter":283,"content":"<p>As I am conscious that my time is ticking, I have another question for each witness.

A split mortgage comprises the parking of a part - it could be all of the capital, although that is unlikely.  However, in a split mortgage, for example, one would have a situation in which a mortgage holder would be paying interest only and the capital would be parked.  In his submission, however, Mr. Burgess for the most part has argued that anyone who can pay interest only should be afforded that option and it should be deemed to be sustainable.

I have been here all afternoon and the irony is that six years ago, as Mr. Maguire is aware, I busied myself with a deep analysis of the Irish owned banks in this regard.  I am now being asked to mow the Phoenix Park with a scissors.  It is pathetic.  I thank Ms Sadlier for giving us a good idea of what it is like at the grassroots level.  The witnesses are great people but I would like them to challenge the banks' boards.  They caused the bust.  I will give the witnesses copies of a paper I produced four and a half years ago.  Mr. Maguire has seen this paper, which shows unassailably that the banks caused the credit bubble which led to the asset price bubble and the bust over a cumulative period of at least six years.  Their loan to deposit ratios moved from the correct level of 90%, which is the keel for any bank balance sheet, to a weighted average of 173% over six Irish banks.  I ask that we challenge the banks' boards and get them in here because they have caused this crisis.  The difference between 90% and 173%, or 83%, is the proportion of the collapse in asset prices that is the responsibility of the banks.  How dare the banks seek to collect 100% of the loans they advanced to an asset price Ponzi bubble?  My logic in this regard is unassailable.<\/p><p>  I know of one house which was bought for &euro;700,000, based on a loan of &euro;600,000 and a supporting level of income.<\/p> <p>The asset price has collapsed to &euro;225,000, which is a loss in asset value of &euro;475,000, and the loan remains at &euro;600,000.  I know this because it is my area.  There is negative equity of &euro;375,000 and the asset price collapse is from &euro;700,000 to &euro;225,000.  This bank ignored the principles of fractional reserving at a level of 75% culpability, which means that of the negative equity the bank should immediately write off &euro;356,000.  Case by case, across the country, that exercise should be done by the bank.  The bank is like any business.  The people behind the counter should know what they are doing and, as Ms Sadlier said, we are now trying to deal with call centres, first names and an impossibility of correspondence.

Some of them have thick dossiers of their attempts to engage with the banks.  They tell me the biggest difficulty is that every time they telephone or write, a new person is doing with their case.  They get only the first name, not the surname, of the person who is dealing with their case.  This is seriously impeding people's ability to deliver for themselves some kind of deal with their banks.  Should the banks designate their own panels of people who will do this as their daily jobs?

It is not that I do not want to see people getting deals, but I want a level playing pitch for the people with whom I deal who are not getting deals.<\/p><p>  What would the witnesses think of the Government establishing an advisory group on the lines of a tier-two of MABS that could possibly move up a level to try to deal with these people?  Ms Sadlier said many people have engaged with her.  A huge number of people are in distress and I know many who are not engaging with anybody and do not know where to turn.  Should we do a national drive on the supports available and who to speak to.  We have not done this at a national level.  There are many websites but perhaps we should do a drive on national television to encourage people in distress to contact somebody and tell them that there are people here to help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040200024#Z00600","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speech","time":1396455600,"counter":399,"content":"<p>The banks should be doing this, and we should force them to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040200024#Z00700","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1396455600,"counter":400,"content":"<p>We should.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040200024#Z00800","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speech","time":1396455600,"counter":401,"content":"<p>It is absurd that six years have gone by.

Good afternoon, my name is Ellen Creedon and I am part of the young social innovators group which produced the report \"Life Leeches - Trafficking Changes Lives\" and which comes from Scoil Phobail Bh&eacute;ara, Castletownbere, County Cork.  We are 18 transition year students who volunteered to compile a report on this topic and we are very determined and passionate in terms of making a difference in respect of the issue to which it refers.<\/p><p>  Trafficking in human beings is a form of modern-day slavery.  It can be rooted in poverty, poor education, lack of opportunities, gender discrimination, social and political violence and demand for services.  Victims are often lured away from their homes with promises of better jobs.  Instead, they are forced into dangerous, illegal or abusive work.  For the purposes of our project, we set out to learn about human trafficking and to educate our peers and the community about it.  We set out to raise awareness of the topic locally, nationally and internationally.  We hope to use our research and make recommendations on the issue to the media, the Government and the travel and hospitality sectors and education bodies.  We want to be agents for change in order that we might in some way make a difference.  We discovered that both adults' and our peers' level of knowledge or awareness of the scale of this issue is poor.<\/p> <p>Only 14% of our peers surveyed were interested in the topic, while 42% of adults surveyed said they were.  We decided that we wanted to do something about this.  <\/p><p> Human trafficking is often hidden and forgotten about and people do not realise the extent of trafficking into, out of and within Ireland.  As the members probably know, in 2012 in Ireland, the Department of Justice and Equality dealt with 48 cases of victims of human trafficking.  Of these, 39 were cases of sexual exploitation, six were cases of labour exploitation and three were uncategorised; 31 of those involved were female, 17 were male, 25 were adults and 23 were minors.  Of these 23 minors, 19 were involved in sexual exploitation.<\/p><p> The life of a victim is never really profiled in detail and people are not exposed to the effects on the victim, how much they have suffered and how to identify a victim of human trafficking.  Human trafficking ruins lives before they have even begun.  Some people are simply born at the wrong time in the wrong place and into the wrong families.  Ireland is a destination, a source and a transit country for men, women and children subjected to sex trafficking and forced labour.  Irish people have been trafficked for labour in Australia and for prostitution in the Netherlands.  <\/p><p> It is estimated that 27 million people worldwide are trafficked each year and 2.4 million people throughout the world are lured into forced labour as a result of human trafficking.  Women and girls account for about 80% of the detected victims while child trafficking accounts for about 15% to 20%.  Sexual exploitation accounts for about 80% of the detected cases.  In 30% of the countries where the gender of the offender was known, more women were convicted for human-trafficking-related offences than men.  An estimated 2.5 million people are in forced labour, including sexual exploitation, at any given time as a result of human trafficking.  The majority of trafficking victims are between the ages of 18 and 24 years.  <\/p><p> Human trafficking affects every country in the world, even if it is to varying degrees.  It affects every continent and every type of economy.  Every country is affected, whether as a country of origin, transit or destination of victims.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040200002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Ellen Creedon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396443600,"counter":419,"content":"<p>In doing this project we have learned and developed new skills and have had many new experiences working at raising awareness and educating our entire school community, our local area and the country on human trafficking through the medium of the Young Social Innovator.  We have used social media such as Facebook and Twitter to raise awareness of the topic, to educate people on human trafficking and to keep people informed of our work on this cause.  Through reports, statistics, quotes, photography, videos and music, we have maintained interest, informed many minds and challenged many people to be more vigilant.<\/p><p>  Throughout our work we have sought advice, information and guidance from the Department of Justice and Equality, the office of the European Anti-Trafficking Coordinator, the human trafficking investigation and co-ordination unit in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the anti-human-trafficking team in the HSE.  We have worked with a number of non-governmental organisations such as Ruhama, Cois Tine, APT Ireland, the Immigrant Council of Ireland and the Sexual Violence Centre Cork as well as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.  We have joined and promoted campaigns such as Turn off the Red Light, Don&rsquo;t Close Your Eyes to Human Trafficking, Stop the Traffik, Blue Blindfold, Blue Heart and Purple Teardrop among others.  We have circulated our report and recommendations to all interested parties, including our local TDs, Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, Se&aacute;n Kelly, MEP for Ireland South, interested NGOs, faith-based groups such as APT Ireland and MECPATH and local and national media.  We are making our research and material available to various NGOs and interested bodies to help continue to raise awareness and educate people on this crime, which shames every one of us.  We hope that our novel and comprehensive approach to the topic will in some way help the cause of eradicating this modern-day slavery not only in Ireland but worldwide.<\/p><p>  We are a far more educated and aware group of young people on the reality of human trafficking in our country and worldwide.  We are even more motivated and enthusiastic about doing something to make a difference.  We have done things that we never thought possible, such as attending the meeting today and interviewing trafficking victims.  We dealt with much media attention, particularly local print media, and <i>Face Up<\/i> magazine will be doing an article on our research and our recommendations.  People in NGOs are taking our endeavours seriously and are willing to listen to our recommendations.  In May we will meet with the Immigrant Council to discuss our work.  We are following media coverage of the international conference entitled Stop the Traffick, which was held in Dublin last Thursday, which is the most recent report published.<\/p><p>  We would like to help and be involved in new ventures such as the REACH campaign launched last week, the detection training for airport staff being offered by the Immigrant Council of Ireland, developing an educational app on trafficking and designing a short course on human trafficking\/modern-day slavery for the new junior certificate curriculum.

From completing surveys, interviews and questionnaires and talking to professionals, it was clear that awareness was needed right now.  We attempted to identify the best way to educate our peers and society.   We designed and ordered wristbands using the colour blue, which is the international colour for sex trafficking.  Our wristbands also glow in the dark, in order to show people that there is always light through the darkness.  These were distributed to all pupils and staff in our school.  In school, we showed regular material on digital notice boards.  We had a presentation at a whole assembly, lesson plans for CSPE classes, a presentation to staff, and a poster campaign which highlighted the dangers of human trafficking in all rooms around the school.  We set up a Facebook page, Life Leeches, and a Twitter page, @LifeLeeches.  Each of these pages is very active and informative with regular posts including statistics, quotations, poetry, posters, photography, media articles, art, music and events.  We gave out an information booklet on trafficking to parents in the first-year pack.  This booklet could be made available nationally or via the websites of national parents' associations.  The booklet is similar in content and design to that published by the Donegal anti-trafficking group.<\/p><p>  Creative members of our group designed a board game as well as a story book for younger children to help them understand the dangers of human trafficking.  A photography exhibition on the theme was held in the town library, including images of child labour, child brides, organ and tissue removal and child soldiers.  We have compiled a CD with a playlist of songs and poetry and we have completed a YouTube video on the theme of human trafficking.  One of our group members wrote and performed a song on the theme entitled &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; which is also a hit on YouTube.  We worked with Soulwaves Media Productions to create a radio and television advertisement which we have distributed to local and national radio and television stations.  We wrote our own drama on human trafficking and used this as part of our speak-out for the Young Social Innovator.  In it we focused on sex exploitation, labour exploitation and organ removal.  This was powerful in conveying our anti-trafficking message.  We completed a leaflet with film and book reviews and made a collage of art by people from around the world based on the theme.  We created an art piece that we hope could be used on various products, including the trays in food outlets, in-flight magazines and ferries or even on napkins and coffee cups.  Three experts from the organisation APT Ireland travelled to our school and together we discussed our research as well as their work.  They have been most helpful with our project.  We continue to work together on this topic.<\/p><p>  We feel that the approach that we have taken to human trafficking has been comprehensive and somewhat effective on a local and national level.  We would like to think that we have made some difference, but we also hope that the various interested organisations across our country can use our approach, our research and our enthusiasm to continue to make people aware and to educate and motivate young people like us to do something for all those who are voiceless worldwide.  As President Barack Obama said: <blockquote>[W]e see you.  We hear you.  We insist on your dignity.  And we share your belief that if just given the chance, you will forge a life equal to your talents and worthy of your dreams.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040200003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Elaine O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396443600,"counter":421,"content":"<p>I am here today to share with the members what we would like to see happen in regard to human trafficking in our country.  It has been internationally recognised that our Government has fully complied with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking.  However, we suggest a number of possible approaches to addressing the issue.  We would like to see our Government enact legislation, lead policy development and provide resources.<\/p> <p>We feel strongly that the approach needs to be multifaceted and must include raising awareness, education, legislation, regulation, technology and help and support.<br \/><b><\/b>In terms of raising awareness, we have made positive use of social media and we feel this should be replicated in future awareness work.  We would like to see TV and radio advertisements like those for road safety and cancer involving the late Gerry Collins.  We suggest posters on billboards, bus shelters and road signage.  We think a broadening of focus is necessary.  It is more than sexual exploitation; more focus is needed on labour exploitation.  We think goodwill ambassadors in all countries highlighting the issue would be positive.  We hope our material, research and experiences can be used to further the cause.  We would like to see anti-trafficking groups such as the Donegal group working on a local level under the umbrella of an all-Ireland national anti-trafficking plan.<\/p><p> On education, we would like to see a module for the new junior certificate on human trafficking.  We recommend the development of an educational app.  There should be ongoing and compulsory up-to-date training for all staff at points of entry to the country.  Indicator cards need to be freely available on how to recognise a victim.  More public information campaigns are necessary in libraries, schools, colleges, on computer search engines, airports and ferry ports.  A variety of up-to-date resources need to be created for schools - both primary and secondary.  We believe information leaflets must be distributed by car hire and travel agents.<\/p><p> On the legislative front, there is an urgent need for a clear, concise and comprehensive definition of human trafficking which will encompass all forms of modern day slavery &ndash; within or between countries, criminal or otherwise, and not differentiating between victim or form of exploitation.  We want to see health and safety protection for victims and meeting the needs of the victims enshrined in the law.  We believe international co-operation is paramount in the sharing of information, vigilance, prosecutions and the movement of people.<\/p><p> We would like to see buyer and seller prosecuted and sentences given, which would deter others from engaging in the crime.  To quote the APT presentation to the committee in 2006, &ldquo;sentences must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.  Similar to drug trafficking or money laundering.&rdquo;  Just yesterday, the Parliamentary Assembly of the European Parliament recognised that sex-buyer legislation is the most effective method of combatting the problem.  The Government needs to remove the demand for the sex trade.  This lucrative, low-risk business needs to be tackled.  Victims must be treated as innocent victims and not as criminals and cared for by the Department best equipped to deal with their specific needs and given time in suitable care before a decision is made about their future.  There must be specified care for trafficked children and the family of origin.  Care must be provided to victims, regardless of involvement in helping with prosecutions or immigration status.  A clear distinction must be made between trafficked person and illegal immigrant.  We believe it is urgent that there is statutory requirement for the ongoing training for all those dealing with trafficked people.<\/p><p> We firmly believe labour exploitation needs to be tackled in the hospitality sector, domestic, child minding, restaurants and agricultural work by means of regulation.  Property owners must be made to account for the purpose of premises they rent out.  There must be a register of dance clubs, massage parlours, au pairs and language school students.<\/p><p> We must investigate whether a Nike tracker technology could be used to tackle this issue.  This is a tracking device installed in the shoe.  We must also investigate whether Bluetooth technology could be used to promote an important international hotline number.  We think there should be a pre-installed help app for victims on all mobile phones.  We want to see employment locations, such as escort agencies and massage parlours, obliged to display a legal notice of help available for staff.  Trafficking and other social issues need to be highlighted by search engines such as Google.  We insist that mobile phone companies should be obliged to request ID for all SIM card purchases, hence a database of ownership.  We feel map pins of mobile phone movement patterns might be able to aid mapping the movement of suspected victims.<\/p><p> On the help and support front, we want to see a continent-wide helpline in Europe with easily memorable numbers.  There should be a 24-hour phone line with a human response which is well advertised and promoted.  All embassies and consulates worldwide must update information and promote awareness of trafficking.  We need a co-ordinated central website with links to all 68 agencies and interested parties.  All care must be culturally sensitive for the victim.  Ireland needs to develop support networks and structures in all counties.  We believe the Government must provide human and financial resources to tackle awareness, education, research, care and support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040200003#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Harrington","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396444200,"counter":423,"content":"<p>If members think this does not happen in their constituency they should think again.

We constantly deal with major problems in the public sphere and challenges in the State but every now and again one is pleasantly surprised in politics when one least expects it.  I found the presentation inspirational.  It gives me much excitement as to what the future holds for this country to see young women of such calibre make an outstanding presentation.<\/p><p>  I wish to indulge the students.  Ms O&rsquo;Shea quoted William Wilberforce.<\/p> <p>I am from Buncrana, County Donegal, which is at the extreme other end of the country.  The students will be familiar with the hymn, &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, the first lines of which are:<blockquote><br \/>Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,<br \/>That saved a wretch like me.<\/blockquote>I promise I am going somewhere with this story, because the Chairman will cut me short otherwise, but the man who wrote that hymn many years ago was called John Newton, who himself was involved in the slave trade at the time.  He was a wretch, as the hymn would suggest.  In any event, he was on board a ship called the <i>Greyhound<\/i>which got into difficulties off the coast of Donegal when it hit a huge storm.  Miraculously, the ship got through the storm and found its way into Lough Swilly, which is right beside Buncrana.  They found shelter and took a few days there and eventually, John Newton turned his entire life around.  He became a huge champion of the campaign to end the slave trade and was a mentor for William Wilberforce.  I consider William Wilberforce to be the greatest parliamentarian who ever lived but he is internationally renowned as the man who campaigned and started the beginning to the end of slavery as it was at that time.  I like to believe that Ireland and John Newton were the influences for the beginning of that turning around.  I wished to share with the witnesses that Ireland has a big part in the story of William Wilberforce and so on.<\/p><p> However, the challenge continues, as there is modern-day slavery.  Although a huge advance was made in the time of William Wilberforce, modern-day slavery persists.  It is hidden, not open, as people are not brought in through the ports and openly sold.  The practice is hidden, comes in through the airports and works its way through businesses.  However, the recommendations made by the students are practical and logical and were they implemented, would make a huge difference in taking on this insidious industry.  Once again, this was a really inspirational presentation and I thank them so much for lifting my spirits today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040200004#C01400","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396444800,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for that and for sharing that very interesting story with us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040200005#D00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1396444800,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I am still blown away by that story about William Wilberforce, with which I was not familiar.

It is very good to hear, as this is an area of great interest to this committee.  Members reported last year on the issue of prostitution and of course as the witnesses pointed out, trafficking and prostitution have a very strong linkage.  The joint committee's report argues specifically that demand should be tackled through criminalising the purchase of sexual services, which itself would have a knock-on effect in reducing the extent of trafficking.  Consequently, members are very interested in this area and I thank the students for this presentation.  I absolutely support the proposal that the report should be referred on to the Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>  I am glad to hear the students are visiting Trinity.

In common with my colleagues, I thought their presentation was absolutely excellent.  It contains a lot of detail and many new ideas and as my colleagues have noted, the joint committee will be bringing forward some of these ideas to deal with and react to the issue of human trafficking.  As for the new creative stuff, I loved the idea of the wristbands, which I thought was a great idea.  I also liked how the students mentioned the storybook for younger children, the CD and the involvement of Soul Waves media productions, as well as how they have written a drama on human trafficking.<\/p><p>  I refer to a problem the students will have seen from their own research, in that when they asked their own classmates, only 14% of them knew about the issue, in comparison with a figure of 42% for adults.  The issue on which the witnesses have shone a light is the necessity to find other ways to bring people along and to educate them.  The students have given the joint committee ideas in this respect, of which adults of necessity would not think.  While they might think to mount an exhibition or something like that, the students have provided five or six highly constructive ideas and I reiterate the need to get out there in this regard.<\/p><p>  I have a couple of questions, if that is all right?

I have been following their Facebook campaign for a while and thank them for the presentation.  Members have heard many presentations in recent years from different organisations and it was very refreshing to hear a presentation from people of the students' age.  They gave the figures on the low percentage of people of their age group who knew about trafficking and even the percentage of adults is also quite slow.  Because members work in this area, they assume that everyone knows about these issues but in fact they do not.  I propose to the Chairman that in addition to sending a copy to the Minister for Justice and Equality, one should also be sent to the Minister for Education and Skills.  The students mentioned in their submission the possibility of having a programme in the junior cycle to educate students in this regard.<\/p><p>  It is extremely important that young people are aware of and are campaigning on this issue from a young age.  Trafficking for work and for labour, as well as for sexual exploitation, is a huge issue.  Members heard a presentation yesterday about trafficking slaves for cannabis growing.  This is on the rise here in Ireland, where people are brought over and are sent into places to grow cannabis.  If those people are found and arrested, it is those who have come over who will be in trouble and arrested, not the person who trafficked them over.  Consequently, trafficking has many aspects and I again congratulate the students and urge them to keep it going.

I also was delighted that my colleague, Deputy Mac Lochlainn, mentioned William Wilberforce.  The witnesses have chosen the ideal exemplar, to whom John Newton's conversion was such an inspiration.  William Wilberforce stated that God has set him two tasks, namely, the abolition of the slave trade and the reformation of manners.  He of course was not referring to good manners as were that the case, reform still would be necessary around here.  He meant the change of behaviour in society, because it was a very brutal time in which there were many social problems.<\/p> <p>This report and work shows that it is not just about changing laws; it is about changing public attitudes.  It is about changing the way men and women see each other.  Just looking at the array of different ideas and suggestions they have here, they are clearly in touch with so much of what needs to be done culturally.<\/p><p> What I would like to ask them is this.  Social media are often seen as both a blessing and a curse.  Social media can be used for tremendous good but they can also be the place where people are cruel to each other, cynical, laddish, etc.  Do they see social media as more of an opportunity than a threat in trying to promote the kinds of attitude that will make the exploitation of people and their trafficking a thing of the past?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040200005#D02100","speaker":"1146","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396445400,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I would most definitely say it is an opportunity.

The first proposal is as follows:<blockquote><br \/>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the report by the Minister for Defence regarding service by the Defence Forces with the United Nations in 2013, copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 11th March, 2014, in accordance with Section 13 of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006.<\/blockquote>The second proposal is as follows:<blockquote>That the proposal that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the report by the Minister for Defence regarding service by the Defence Forces with the United Nations in 2013, copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 11th March 2014, in accordance with section 13 of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006, to be referred to the Select Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, in accordance with Stranding Order 82A(3)(<i>b<\/i>) and paragraph (8) of the Orders of Reference of Select Committees, which, not later than 8th April, 2014, shall send a message to the D&aacute;il in the manner prescribed in Standing Order 87, and Standing Order 86(2) shall accordingly apply.&quot;.<\/blockquote>I welcome the Minister and his official to the meeting.  I now invite the Minister to make an opening statement on the first proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014040200003#B00100","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1396447800,"counter":477,"content":"<p>As the Chairman has indicated, the following motion was placed on the Order Paper of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<blockquote><br \/>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the participation by Ireland in a European Defence Agency Category B Project on Counter Improvised Explosive Devices Manual Neutralisation Techniques pursuant to section 2 of the Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.<\/blockquote>In commending the motion, I will briefly outline the function of the European Defence Agency and the background to the programme that Ireland wishes to participate in.<\/p><p>  The European Defence Agency, EDA, was established by a joint action of the Council of the European Union in 2004, &quot;to support the Member States and the Council in their effort to improve European defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the European Security and Defence Policy as it stands now and develops in the future&rdquo;.  On 6 July 2004, the Government approved Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the framework of the European Defence Agency on the basis of a memorandum submitted by the Minister for Defence in association with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  <\/p><p>  The EDA is an agency of the European Union.  The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice President of the Commission, Baroness Cathy Ashton, is head of the agency.  Baroness Ashton is also chairman of the EDA steering board, its decision-making body which is composed of Defence Ministers of the 27 participating member states, that is, all EU member states except Denmark, which has an opt out on defence matters under Protocol 5 to the Treaty of Amsterdam, and the European Commission.  <\/p><p>  Ireland participates in the framework of the agency and contributes &euro;300,000 to the annual costs of running the agency, including its annual work programme.  Outside of the annual general work programme, the agency also supports a range of other work programmes and projects funded on an <i>ad hoc<\/i> basis by the member states in various compositions.  In some instances, all member states will participate in these projects and programmes unless they specifically decide to opt out.  These are referred to as Category A projects or programmes.  In other cases, a small number of member states will group together to pursue a particular initiative, referred to as a Category B project or programme.  <\/p><p>  In a climate of diminishing defence budgets, there is a need for greater efficiency and effectiveness in defence expenditure.  Therefore, the European Defence Agency is focused on assisting member states in obtaining better value for existing spending levels, improving competitiveness, securing greater efficiency, particularly in the area of research, technology, manufacturing and procurement, which have been notable for fragmentation and duplication. <\/p><p>  I now wish to reference in particular Ireland's involvement in EDA projects and programmes.  Following Government and D&aacute;il approval, as appropriate, Ireland has participated and is currently participating in the following programmes or projects.  There is a Category A programme on force protection, now completed, which involved measures to protect military forces engaged in operational activities which is a key issue for the Defence Forces engaged in peace support and crisis management operations overseas.  There is also an ongoing Category A programme concerning chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear protection.  This is a key capability area for the Defence Forces.  Participation in this programme and access to the results of the research, studies and development work packages to be undertaken by the programme will enable the Defence Forces to remain at the leading edge of capability development in this key area.<\/p><p>  In addition there is an ongoing Category B project concerning maritime surveillance.  The aim of this programme is to further develop the recognised maritime picture, RMP, exchange network technology that allows for the sharing of information among the wider EU defence community in support of the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy.  It is complementary to the EU Commission initiative to establish a common information sharing environment for the exchange of maritime data.  The programme involves improving network and systems security to allow classified information to be shared in the future and also developing a user interface which will allow member states without access to their own RMP system to view data.<br \/>The proposal I am putting to the committee today is to seek approval for Ireland to participate in an EDA programme in the area of counter improvised<br \/>explosives devices in manual techniques.  Manual Neutralisation Techniques, MNT, is a method used by explosive ordnance disposal and<br \/>improvised explosive device disposal operators who, on occasions, cannot use remote or semi-remote techniques to render an improvised explosive<br \/>device, IED, safe.<\/p> <p>As a result, these complex explosive devices have to be neutralised manually.  For example, MNT is used where there is an immediate threat to the life of a hostage who has an IED attached to him or her.  This is a four year category B project which will involve researching, developing and delivering a range of training courses and exercises to address the use of manual neutralisation techniques.  The objective is to enable personnel to conduct a proper threat and risk assessment which is of substantial importance in this context; to analyse the design of complex IEDs - clearly, if one is unable to do this, one will not know the necessary steps to take in the neutralisation process; to develop and plan the needed course of action; and to render safe the explosive chain or remove the explosives from the device.  The activities, courses and exercises are aimed at enhancing participating member states' national counter improvised explosive devices capabilities in support of operations and missions, both at home and abroad.  There are five member states interested in participating in the project, with Austria acting as lead nation.<\/p><p> The Defence Forces have identified a capability gap in the area of manual neutralisation techniques, specifically in relation to bomb disposal operations.  The Defence Forces ordnance school which has responsibility for training bomb disposal personnel strongly supports Ireland&rsquo;s involvement in the project.  The courses and exercises over four years will allow for the upskilling of explosive ordnance disposal and improvised explosive device disposal operators on a consistent basis and their skills to be tested in an international environment.<\/p><p> Manual neutralisation techniques are required where there is an immediate danger to life as a result of an IED being placed in such a location that evacuation will take too long or is just not possible - in this case, the IED would present a direct threat to human life, critical military or civilian infrastructure or location; IEDs contain dangerous payloads - if the IED contains a payload that may cause enormous damage or casualties such as a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear threat, it may be necessary to ensure the device does not function; there are sensitive explosives when disruption would cause them to initiate &ndash; if very sensitive home-made explosives have been used, it may be inappropriate to use conventional remote techniques.  In the event that one of the situations outlined occurs, having operators trained in the use of manual neutralisation techniques is crucial.  Safety and preservation of life and property are enhanced when the operators possess advanced manual render safe procedure skills.  That is what the course is designed to ensure.<\/p><p> The benefit to Ireland of participation in the programme is that it will address all future Defence Forces manual neutralisation techniques, MNT, training requirements.  The training of manual neutralisers is very costly and it would be difficult to justify separate national training programmes.  To date, the Defence Forces have not participated in any MNT training abroad as the costs associated with it are extremely high - approximately &euro;28,000 per student for the initial training course.  Explosive ordnance disposal and improvised explosive device disposal operators are also required to undertake refresher courses on a continuous basis.  To this end, participation in the project will provide seven weeks of training each year for four years, that is, a two week refresher course, including the full exercising of operators in various manual neutralisation techniques scenarios, and a five week comprehensive course.<\/p><p> Currently, there are no MNT instructors or assessors trained within Ireland.  To continue to enhance and operate this essential capability, outside instructors and assessors would need to be approved at a substantial cost to the State.  However, if Ireland participates in the project, the Defence Forces will be in a position to train its own personnel and offer courses to foreign students who could be charged a course fee.  This four year project will allow up to six Defence Forces personnel to refresh their skills and qualify to the required level of MNT per year.  Defence Forces participation in this category B project will greatly enhance their capability and increase EOD-IEDD operators&rsquo; skills and address safety issues in a cost effective manner.  It will also improve Defence Forces interoperability and operational effectiveness across EU and UN-mandated missions.   Under the programme, the cost per student for initial training will be approximately &euro;10,000.  The total cost of the programme, including refresher courses, will be in the region of &euro;230,000 over the four years.  I am satisfied that the cost of participating in the programme will deliver value for money and can be met from within the proposed financial allocations for the Department of Defence.  <\/p><p> I reiterate the benefits of our participation in the programme.  The Defence Forces have extensive expertise in countering IEDs and identified manual neutralisation techniques as an important area to reduce the effects of IEDs on operations.  To date, the Defence Forces have contributed to and benefited from the work of the European Defence Agency.  As preservation of life is the primary concern in bomb disposal, it is important that the Defence Forces continue to develop their capability in this key area.  The role of manual neutralisers is life saving and a priority for participating member states.  However, as I have stated, the training of manual neutralisers at a national level would be highly cost-intensive owing to the equipment and specialist advisory role required.  Should the Defence Forces participate in this category B project all future manual neutralisation techniques training will be addressed internally.  I hope members will give their support to what is proposed.  To put it in very straightforward terms, it is in the interests of enhancing the skills set of members of the Defence Forces and ensuring they have the maximum knowledge in dealing with this very difficult area.  It is in the public interest should we have difficulties in dealing with improvised explosive devices.  It is in the interests of the safety of members of the Defence Forces in the context of the difficulties that arise when they are engaged in UN-mandated missions in conflict zones across the world.  I hope members will be supportive of the proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014040200003#B00300","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396448400,"counter":479,"content":"<p>A number of committee members who visited Defence Forces installations in the past few years were briefed on the work of bomb disposal personnel.  What struck me at the time - I am sure colleagues will agree - was the exceptional courage and bravery involved in neutralising some of the explosives used.  The officers iinvolved had to put their own lives at risk.  The Minister listed three scenarios.  Where an improvised explosive device is placed in a location from which evacuation would take too long and-or is not possible, there is no other way to deal with it except that a person must manually interact with the device that could explode at any time.  The person concerned has protection but depending on the payload used, it may not be sufficient.  In the second scenario the person has to interact with improvised explosive devices that may contain a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear threat, while in the third the person has to interact with sensitive home-made explosives which cannot be disarmed using remote techniques.  It takes tremendous courage and bravery to do this work.  We met young soldiers mainly, both men and women, who put their lives on the line and I was impressed by their professionalism.  We see more and more of these explosive devices in Ireland.  There was a recent case in Cork.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could tell us, if he has the information to hand, the number of devices the Defence Forces have dealt with in Ireland in the past couple of months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014040200004#C00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1396448400,"counter":480,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation and concur with the Chairman's remarks.  My party has been supportive of the work of the European Defence Agency since it was initiated.  It would be appropriate for the select committee to acknowledge the contribution and achievements of all those who have participated in the various programmes undertaken since 1994.  One appreciates the importance of this programme and the development of manual neutralisation techniques which is obviously vital for the Defence Forces in so far as they have a responsibility to deal with crises, both at home and internationally.<\/p> <p>It seems to be a very practical approach to dealing with a very real challenge.  We can achieve maximum cost-efficiency by co-operating with other member states in acquiring the additional skills we need.  I note that the Department of Defence ordnance school is enthusiastic in its support of this initiative.  To that end, I fully support the proposal.<\/p><p> I would like to put two brief questions to the Minister.  He said a four year training programme for six personnel would meet all future Defence Forces training requirements.  Are we to take it that he is satisfied that when these personnel are trained, they will become the trainers?  Will we subsequently be in a position to provide opportunities for other countries' defence forces personnel to come here?<\/p><p> The Minister alluded to figures for the numbers of devices.  According to the figures available to me, there were 70 call-outs to deal with IEDs in 2011 and 96 in 2012.  Such figures are frightening in a country as small and peaceful as Ireland.  We know about the reasons for the continuous call-outs that had to be dealt with in the past, when the Defence Forces developed skills to deal with appalling situations.  In the Minister's view, is there a strong correlation between the development of gangland crime and the drugs industry and the use of IEDs that has led to an ever-increasing number of call-outs which have to be dealt with by the Defence Forces?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014040200004#C00300","speaker":"1054","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396449000,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I remind the Deputy that the nature of these courses means that the individual members of the Defence Forces who participate in them will become our future trainers.  They will have the necessary qualifications and skills which will be updated and upgraded to carry out future training in the very areas in which they will receive training on foot of this proposal.  Apart from the benefit of their participating at this level and receiving training without the need for outside trainers to be formally brought in, it is also beneficial that they will become our trainers in future years.  That is particularly advantageous.<\/p><p>  I will respond to some of the Deputy's queries.  Of course, very particular skills have been developed within the Defence Forces to neutralise IEDs.  This goes back to the time of the Troubles when the Provisional IRA and others used such devices.  They occasionally manufactured them on this side of the island to be taken to the other side.  The use of these devices has now transferred to criminal gangs.  I know from the justice side of my brief that these devices have been used in the gang warfare between members of differet drug gangs.  Some of those who may previously have been engaged in terrorism on the island have facilitated the use of their skills to assist in the creation of these devices.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked about the number of engagements the Defence Forces have had in the last couple of years.  I do not have an exact breakdown that shows how many cases were identified with criminal gangs not engaged in terrorism.  There is an overlap between those engaged in terrorism and those engaged in criminality.  I think the Deputy knows some of the groups I have in mind, but I do not intend to enter into that aspect of the matter at this forum.  However, there is an overlap.  This is a continuing cause of concern.  These devices should not be created in this country by individuals engaged in criminal and terrorist activities.  The lives of those who engage in criminal activities are put at risk when these devices are manufactured and used to target other members of the criminal and terrorist fraternity with whom they are at war.  The lives of ordinary people who might be in the wrong location at the wrong moment are also placed at risk in such circumstances.<\/p><p>  I was asked for the most recent statistics.  I am told that, as of 11 March, the Army bomb disposal team has been called out on 27 occasions to date this year.  Eleven IEDs were made safe during these call-outs.  The figures cover just over two months of the year.  During 2013 there were 250 call-outs or taskings during which 81 IEDs were made safe.  Call-outs can be necessary when people are not certain about what is contained in a particular bundle.  They might be concerned that it is an IED, but it might not turn out to be.  There are also items that are discovered to be hoax bombs.  One cannot take risks in such circumstances.  Untrained individuals cannot be asked to deal with something that might turn out to be a hoax, but equally it might be real.  This is a continuing and ongoing issue and it is important that we maintain our skills set at the highest level possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014040200005#D00200","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1396449000,"counter":483,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for attending this meeting.  Having listened to his presentation, I fully support the proposed investment.  It is critical in the light of the suspicious activity taking place in our society.  Children are finding suspicious devices - it does not matter whether they are viable - in playgrounds and on waste ground.  It is in all our interests and of safety that the Defence Forces have the expertise to deal with them.  For that reason, I support the proposal before the committee.<\/p><p>  With the indulgence of the Chair, I take the opportunity afforded by the presence of the Minister to commend the wonderful women in the Navy and the Army who were on parade in Glasnevin Cemetery this morning at the Cumann na mBan commemoration.  It was wonderful to see and they are a credit to us all.  As a citizen and a parliamentarian, I was very proud of the female members of the Defence Forces, and their male colleagues, who were in attendance.  We should all be proud of them.  I would like the Department to convey our thoughts to them because they deserve to be acknowledged.

Members may be interested to know that as part of the current process of recruiting additional members of the Defence Forces, I have asked that particular attention be paid to efforts to improve the gender balance within the forces.  I am concerned that we are not recruiting enough women.  Unfortunately, working in the Defence Forces is not seen by many women and second level schools as a career for women.  I emphasise that women can make a great contribution to the Defence Forces, while developing their personal skills in a way that will set them up to obtain other employment of great interest after they have finished in the Defence Forces.  I have asked those working on the recruitment drive to place a particular focus on trying to improve the gender balance in the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>  I am also keen to ensure greater cross-community representation in the Defence Forces.  We know that over 12% of the population of the State is made up by individuals who were not born here.  We have engaged in citizenship ceremonies since March 2011.<\/p> <p>We have over 68,000 new Irish citizens.  Many of these are young people, including children and teenagers.  It is important our Defence Forces represent today's face of Ireland.

The member states interested in the project are those with particular concerns in this area and whose own forces do not provide skill set training in these areas.  The project is the coming together of particular member states in a manner that is economically wise and co-ordinated to ensure their individual defence forces either acquire or maintain skills in this area.  This is important, particularly in an era when none of us is immune to terrorism.  Leaving aside the gang warfare mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l and myself earlier, we do not know when an incident no one ever anticipated may occur in our country.  If we do not have these skill sets, this could be a concern and problem.  This skill-set is also of crucial relevance to UN peacekeeping missions.  I cannot over-emphasise its importance in the context of devices.  Whether we are talking about our troops in the Lebanon, on the Golan Heights or in the other 12 locations where they are engaged in UN peacekeeping, we cannot be sure when this skill may be required.  It is an important skill and this project facilitates countries coming together in a way that is economically useful for the countries concerned.<\/p><p>  In regard to whether our missions abroad are still based on UN mandates, the answer is \"Yes\".  On the question of how all of this fits in with Ireland's general position, I suppose we can on occasion become unnecessarily concerned about our participation in the European Security and Defence Policy on the one side and neutrality on the other.  The Deputy also raised issues about expenditure.  Ireland's traditional policy on neutrality is completely unaffected by the treaty on the European Union, as amended in the Lisbon treaty.  The treaty will not result in Ireland having to become part of any alliance or military formation.  The legally binding guarantees secured by Ireland at the European Council prior to the second Lisbon treaty referendum clearly state the Lisbon treaty does not affect or prejudice Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality.  Nor does our engagement with the European Defence Agency affect our traditional policy.  We are members of NATO's partnership for peace, which is focused on humanitarian intervention and peacekeeping missions, and we work with other EU member states on some of these missions.  Our engagement with the EDA is valuable, because it ensures our capabilities can be maintained at the highest levels and ensures the possibility of interoperability with other member states. <\/p><p>  In regard to military expenditure, I always wonder about questions raised on this issue.  If we look, for example, at the issue of peacekeeping missions in conflict zones, we need an arms industry.  We cannot send our soldiers to the Lebanon with toy guns, in ordinary family cars or without proper reinforcements.  We cannot provide vehicles that do not have the necessary weaponry defence required.  Therefore, if we recognise we need armies, we need an arms industry.  Otherwise, we cannot operate in real situations.  I doubt anybody would suggest we should send people to the Golan Heights where, unfortunately, part of the tragic Syrian civil war is being re-enacted between the official forces of President Assad and the various other groupings without them being armed.  Either we must manufacture arms - we do not - or we must purchase them from people who do.<\/p><p>  Europe has and needs an arms industry therefore.  The importance of this industry was recognised in the declaration of heads of state at the December meeting of EU leaders and it contributes a great deal of employment for young people across the Union.  I wonder, if Russia invaded the rest of Ukraine and positioned its troops directly on the borders of the European Union, with the threat of it perhaps invading Poland or some other EU country, whether we would just say \"You are very welcome, come in\" or is it important the countries faced with that position have sufficiently large armies and armaments to act as a deterrent to that sort of event.  One of the difficulties is that in a perfect world no-one should have arms or need armies.  I do not know when that perfect world will exist.  As far as I know, it has never existed, not for as long as mankind has existed.  Even in the age of the caveman, people went around with clubs beating each other's heads in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014040200006#E00500","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1396449600,"counter":491,"content":"<p>The Minister is bringing us on a nice tour there, but my question is directed at the issue of nuclear and chemical weapons and so on.

The report for 2013 was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 11 March 2014 and the following motion has been placed on the Order Paper:<blockquote><br \/>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the report by the Minister for Defence regarding service by the Defence Forces with the United Nations in 2013, copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 11 March 2014, in accordance with section 13 of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006.<\/blockquote>In commending the motion I will shortly outline some of the key aspects of Ireland&rsquo;s involvement with the United Nations in the past couple of years.  A central tenet of Irish foreign policy is support for the multilateral system of collective security represented by the United Nations.  In this regard, Ireland has worked to uphold the primary role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security.  This commitment has found expression in Ireland&rsquo;s long-standing tradition of participation in UN peacekeeping operations.  Ireland has participated continuously in UN peacekeeping operations since 1958, a service which comprises more than 63,000 individual tours of duty, an extraordinary number if we compare the size of the Defence Forces with those of other states.  Participation in overseas peacekeeping missions is a key element of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and has been an important dimension in meeting Ireland&rsquo;s international obligations as a member of the United Nations and the European Union.  Irish foreign policy is directed at supporting co-operative arrangements for collective security through the development of international organisations, especially the United Nations.  This has included supporting effective international action in areas such as disarmament, peacekeeping, development and human rights.  This approach continues to define Irish priorities within the UN system.  Notwithstanding our current economic difficulties, Ireland continues to willingly play a full role in contributing to the security of Europe and the world, providing professional peacekeepers for a range of missions throughout the world.<\/p><p>  During 2013 the Defence Forces continued to make a major contribution to international peacekeeping through their participation in UN-led and UN-authorised missions.  Defence Forces personnel deployed to two additional UN-led operations in 2013, namely, the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, on the Golan Heights in Syria and the United Nations Mine Action Service, UNMAS, in South Sudan.  The Defence Forces also deployed personnel to the European Union Training Mission in Mali known as EUTM Mali.<\/p><p>  Our main mission in the year under review was the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL.  The UNIFIL mission continues to represent Ireland&rsquo;s largest overseas deployment.  For most of 2013, a total of 361 Defence Forces personnel were serving with UNIFIL.  Ireland commanded the joint Irish-Finnish battalion until 26 November 2013 when Finland assumed command and deployed an additional company.  There were two rotations of Irish personnel during 2013.  The joint battalion is based in sector west of UNIFIL&rsquo;s area of operations in an area designated by the force commander, in the vicinity of At Tiri and with two posts on the &quot;Blue Line&quot; which separates Lebanon and Israel.  Last November I had the honour of visiting the 42nd infantry group currently serving with UNIFIL when I attended the transfer-of-authority ceremony to mark the hand-over of command of the joint Irish-Finnish battalion to Finland.   Reflecting the high regard in which Irish peacekeepers are held, Brigadier General Patrick Phelan of the Defence Forces who was appointed deputy force commander of UNIFIL in April 2012 had his appointment extended for a further year until the end of this month at the request of the United Nations.<\/p><p>  Partnership with other like-minded states has become an increasing element of our overseas peacekeeping operations.  The participation of both Finland and Ireland in the UNIFIL mission is but one example that demonstrates our joint contribution to international peace and security.  In the absence of partners such as Finland, the range and nature of overseas operations which Ireland could undertake in support of international peace and security would be notably curtailed.  Such joint deployments further support interoperability and build experience.  They also significantly contribute to the range and nature of operations we can undertake in support of the United Nations and further deepen the excellent bilateral relationship between partnering countries.  The United Nations has stated UNIFIL plays a vital role in stabilising southern Lebanon, in particular the area adjacent to Israel where Irish troops are deployed.<\/p><p>  Ireland is contributing approximately 404 Defence Forces personnel to 14 missions throughout the world.  The year under review saw a new Irish deployment overseas to UNDOF on the Golan Heights in Syria.  UNDOF is assisted by military observers from the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation&rsquo;s observer group for the Golan Heights which includes six Irish officers.   Members of the 44th infantry group are deploying to the UNDOF mission and will replace the 43rd infantry group which has successfully completed its tour of duty.  I take the opportunity to thank the personnel returning home from Syria for the contribution they have made to the peace and security of the region.  I also wish each and every member of the 44th infantry group a safe and successful mission.<\/p><p>  At the request of the United Nations and following Government approval, four members of the Permanent Defence Force deployed for service with the United Nations Mine Action Service, UNMAS, in South Sudan in August 2013.  Their role is to provide a specialist training team on conventional munitions disposal, landmines and specialist search awareness for South Sudan police personnel.  In addition, following Government approval, eight members of the Permanent Defence Force were deployed for service with the EU Training Mission in Mali, EUTM Mali, as part of a joint training contingent with the United Kingdom armed forces.  Irish personnel were deployed to the mission on 23 March 2013 and rotated in September 2013.  Training by EUTM Mali has been making good progress and the mission&rsquo;s mandate has been extended until May 2016.  EUTM Mali is recognised as an essential partner in the reconstruction of the Malian state and the main instrument for the reconstruction of its armed forces.<\/p><p>  The deployment of some 404 personnel to overseas missions is a very significant contribution in the context of the reduced resources available for defence.  It reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to our responsibilities in the area of international peace and security.  It is important for Ireland to continue to build on our long tradition of service to the founding principles of the United Nations by making practical commitments of personnel to peace support operations.  I assure the committee that, notwithstanding the economic challenges we are facing, the Government is committed to ensuring the Defence Forces will continue to contribute in a meaningful way to overseas operations.  However, our contributions will be practical and sustainable within the resources available for defence.  Relative to our size and available resources and capabilities, both financial and military, Ireland is, proportionately, a very large peacekeeping contributor within the international community.  In 2013 it was the fourth largest EU contributor to United Nations missions. <\/p><p>  The Government and I place high importance on the valuable work being done by members of the Defence Forces throughout the world.  I fully recognise the importance of operational experience in peace support operations for the ongoing development of the Defence Forces.  I had the honour to see at first hand the dedication and professionalism of our military personnel serving overseas when I visited the Irish battalion serving with UNIFIL on two occasions last year.  I look forward to a return visit to our troops in Lebanon in the near future, possibly during the second half of the year.<\/p><p>  A key facet of Ireland&rsquo;s approach to international peace support operations is the engagement of Defence Forces personnel, at all levels, with the local communities they are called on to serve.  Irish troops serving overseas display not alone their professional commitment in fulfilling the United Nations mandate, but also support and encourage local communities through humanitarian and community projects.  In Lebanon previous Irish battalions have completed a number of projects during the years with financial help from Irish Aid.  I am delighted to see that recent battalions have continued this excellent tradition.  Overseas service has become a core activity of the Defence Forces.  Ireland's record of service in UN-authorised peace support operations is second to none.  The Defence Forces have made and continue to make a significant contribution to such operations throughout the world.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge the significant demands placed on personnel who serve overseas and their families.  Without their loyal and continuing support, our strong tradition of service overseas, under the auspices of the United Nations, would not be possible.<\/p> <p>Their committed and dedicated service in overseas missions reflects well, not alone on the Defence Forces, but on the nation as a whole and contributes to the excellent reputation which Ireland holds among peacekeepers throughout the world.<\/p><p> Some of my EU counterparts have remarked with some amazement that when they visit their troops abroad on UN peacekeeping missions, they always meet some members of our Defence Forces.  One asked me before Christmas how many tens of thousands of troops we have.  When I told him the objective strength of our Defence Forces is 9,500 he thought I was misleading him for security reasons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014040200007#F00100","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396450800,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation and echo all his good words about our Defence Forces overseas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014040200008#G00200","speaker":"1105"},{"type":"speech","time":1396450800,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I do not wish to delay business unnecessarily but I would like to raise two issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014040200008#G00300","speaker":"1054"},{"type":"speech","time":1396450800,"counter":508,"content":"<p>We do not have time to deal with them now as there is a vote in the D&aacute;il.

The committee initially considered it at a meeting on 27 November 2013.  At that point, the committee agreed to forward the petition to the Minister for Finance for consideration.  Following a somewhat negative response from the Minister, the committee agreed to invite the members of the campaign to appear before it to elaborate on the petition.  Members will be aware that budgetary decisions and their impact on the most vulnerable warrant close consideration before they are finalised.  As a committee, we look forward to hearing the case for equality budgeting and how Departments and agencies could make greater use of internal and external policy analysis to capture the full impact of budget decisions and economic inequality.

Through equality audits and impact assessments, equality budgeting provides information on how different sections of society are impacted by specific economic policy  measures.  The objective of equality budgeting lies in ensuring this information is made available to public representatives in order that they can make informed policy decisions that achieve the best outcomes for specific disadvantaged groups but also for society at large.  Equality budgeting goes beyond traditional approaches to policy making and planning by, first, assessing the impact of expenditure resources on different sections of society, assessing who does and does not benefit, integrating equality as a driving principle and perhaps, more crucially, increasing transparency in the budgetary process.<\/p> <p>Equality budgeting provides the following benefits: increased levels of information, including disaggregated data and impact assessment; increased levels of equality, including knowledge of who is disproportionately impacted, and evidence-based policy design, implementation and review; increased levels of transparency through the publication of information to show members of the public how they are affected; and reform to budgetary process, such as draft budget and meaningful engagement of stakeholder and legislators.<\/p><p> I will briefly outline how equality budgeting operates in other jurisdictions, as per the request of the committee.  Equality budgeting originated in the 1980s in the form of gender budgeting and was pioneered by Australia.  More than 60 countries have implemented or worked towards equality budgeting since then, including Canada, South Africa, the United Kingdom, Tanzania and Uganda.  Some work was done in Ireland toward this, especially within the gender-mainstreaming unit of the Department of Justice and Equality.  However, much of this was subsequently reversed with the dismantling of equality infrastructure.<\/p><p> I will focus in a little more depth on how equality budgeting works in Scotland, as this model has been especially useful to us in developing the ideas of our campaign.  Scotland's Equality and Budget Advisory Group, EBAG, made up of government and civil society actors, works with the government on devising the budget and equality-proofing economic policy measures.  A draft budget is published in September before being finalised in January.  An equality statement is published alongside the budget, which highlights equality outcomes by theme, for example, health and well-being, and by equality characteristics - gender, race, age, etc.  A full impact analysis is done.<\/p><p> As an example of how this works, the equality statement published alongside the most recent draft budget in Scotland in September 2013 describes how evidence from previous equality impact assessments had been used to steer funding decisions on the national parenting strategy.  For instance, based on that research, money was allocated to projects aimed at tackling the higher costs faced by parents bringing up disabled children; targeting fathers in parenting programmes; and providing translated resources so that programmes are more inclusive of parents and children from ethnic minorities.  In-depth research on the effects of the economic crisis as well as the EBAG meeting minutes are published on the Scottish Government website.  Recently, representatives of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, Deputies Tuffy and &Oacute; Snodaigh, visited Scotland to liaise with government officials there on the subject of implementing equality budgeting.<\/p><p> As Ireland now holds a seat on the UN Human Rights Council, it is essential to make good on promises regarding economic, social and cultural rights.  In January 2011, a UN expert, Magdalena Sepuleda Carmona, investigated Ireland and criticised it for failing to respect the economic, social and cultural rights of its citizens during the time of economic crisis.<\/p><p> We are lobbying for equality budgeting to be introduced by setting up a unit with responsibility for integrating equality horizontally across all economic policy processes and planning, with particular reference to the nine grounds of the Equal Status Acts; giving this unit the power and resources to undertake or commission research on the impact of the economic crisis; and to equality-proof existing and future economic policy measures.<\/p><p> The committee has asked how such a unit would operate with regard to having a veto over budgets.  Our proposal does not envisage the unit having or requiring veto powers.  Instead, the unit would provide legislators with full information on the equality-impact of a proposed budget in advance of voting in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Thus, the unit itself would have no veto power, but its work would enable elected representatives to make a far more informed decision than is currently possible on whether to vote for a Finance Bill.<\/p><p> The committee has also inquired about how the work of the proposed unit would be quality-impact assessed.  We suggest that the aims of the unit be set out clearly at an early stage.  Following the first year of the unit&rsquo;s work, a review board should be set up comprising unit representatives, stakeholders in the budgeting process, and external experts, for instance, an economic researcher from a different state.  The board would assess whether the unit&rsquo;s aims had been met thus far and how its work might be improved.  Reviews by international authorities such as the European Commission and the World Bank would also provide useful measures of quality impact.  In a World Bank study from 2005, Ireland&rsquo;s financial scrutiny of legislation was rated as the second worst in the developed world.  We would expect an effective equality budgeting unit to significantly improve ratings of Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary process on the European and world stages.<\/p><p> We would argue strongly that there is a need for equality budgeting.  Budget 2012 was acknowledged to have had the most detrimental impact on lone parents and according to the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s own analysis, this trend continued in budget 2013.  It stated that the budget that year had the most negative impact on working lone parents.  Yet if we look at the data on poverty and deprivation in Ireland, this would appear to be an unjustified move as they had the highest levels of poverty and deprivation of any groups measured.<\/p><p> The EU survey of income and living conditions, SILC, report 2011 provides the most up-to-date figures we have on poverty and deprivation.  Some 24.4% of the general population suffered two or more forms of deprivation, rising to 56% in the case of lone parents and their children, which is 230% higher than for the general population.  The consistent poverty rate was 6.9 % for the general population, but for lone parent families was 16.4% or 238% higher.  While the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s analysis was very welcome, it was carried out after the budget had been passed rather than before.  We are arguing for prospective as well as retrospective analysis, which would take account of existing research and allow for informed decision-making.<\/p><p> We would also offer two examples of decisions made which have unintended consequences and which involve both the Departments of Social Protection, and Education and Skills.  In both these cases, prior equality audits could have prevented unforeseen long-term consequences that are turning out to be very damaging to the groups affected.<\/p><p> Ireland has an excellent education system and should be applauded for its efforts to make third level education accessible to all socio-economic groups through grants and indeed the excellent HEAR scheme.  However, when child benefit was cut for all 18 year olds, there was no provision made for dependent 18-year olds who may be still in school and where a parent is wholly reliant on social welfare.  The child dependant rate is &euro;29.80 but for children aged under 18 this is supplemented by the &euro;30 per week child benefit.  That &euro;29.80 does not support the needs of an 18 year old.  Although no research has yet been carried out, anecdotally, we have heard cases were children are being forced to leave school early and not complete the leaving certificate.<\/p><p> In July 2015, an estimated 63,000 lone parents will lose their entitlement to one-parent family allowance.  This is the year they need to avail of training and education to become job ready, yet in budget 2014, second payments have ceased to lone parents who avail of F&Aacute;S or VEC courses, now the education and training board courses.

The witnesses said 60 other countries had already introduced some kind of equality budgeting, and in 2005 the World Bank said we were poor at budgeting.  What strong evidence is there that having a unit or expertise translated into people having more money to spend?  What evidence is there that governments did not just set up an equality budgeting unit to look clever, but that it made a difference?  What countries would the witnesses point to as examples to show it works?  I do not want to be part of recommending another piece of window dressing on the window dressing, merely appointing experts for the sake of it.

A trip to the Scottish Parliament did not dampen my enthusiasm for it, but some practicalities were brought home to me.  They are the same as the ones in Stormont.  There is a slight difference between those jurisdictions and ours - our budgets deal with tax rates, social welfare rates and so on, whereas theirs do not.  They address tax changes subsequently, but they cannot influence them in the same way that Deputies can influence a Minister for Finance or Social Protection after the fact.<\/p><p>  The Scottish Parliament has put together an elaborate mechanism for engaging with various Ministers and Departments and is enthusiastic about it.  Given the forthcoming referendum, however, it is considering major changes in the event of independence, as it will have the added burden of dealing with tax rates, etc.  It is confident that the groundwork it has laid will stand to it.  We, on the other hand, only approach issues after the fact.  Before it moves to full budgeting and so forth in the near future, the Scottish Parliament has already managed to ingrain the concepts of equality budgeting and consideration of the impacts on various sectors of society in advance of decisions being taken.<\/p><p>  Interestingly, committees in the Northern Ireland Assembly have been dealing with the welfare reform process for two years.  It has taken that long because the impacts of major changes in social welfare rates and how the social welfare system operated under Westminster - it wanted assemblies to rubber-stamp changes - were not examined.  In fairness to MLAs from all parties, they called a halt to that because the impact, how many people would be affected and whether other methods could achieve the same desired outcome needed to be considered.  The Scottish did a little work in this regard, but they had already changed some of their rates.<\/p><p>  The delay in welfare reform in the North has proven to be the right approach, given the fact that a number of court cases have been taken in Britain on the basis that the impacts of the changes are disproportionate.  This debate is worth considering - if the courts come out in favour of those who have been disproportionately affected, it would be a useful tool in Ireland.  If the decision goes the other way, we will still need to champion the approach that has been conveyed at this meeting, namely, a longer lead-in time ahead of a budget.  Previously, Estimates would be published early, there would be a debate and taxation measures would eventually be decided.  In recent years, however, we have been landed with everything on one day.  That does not allow society as a whole enough time.<\/p><p>  A major failure of this and the previous Governments is the fact that the legislation that flowed from budgets, particularly the Finance and Social Welfare Bills, followed quickly and usually had the guillotine applied to them.  That hampered the debate when we wanted to tease out the full effects.  If nothing else, we should avoid the use of guillotines on Bills that have an impact on various groups in society.<\/p><p>  I wish the witnesses well.

There has been a small improvement in that regard.<\/p><p>  In terms of inequalities, there could be a crude system preventing people's salaries from being changed overnight, but changes could still be made through the tax system, levies and so on.  For example, the maximum and minimum rates of social protection can be changed.  How would legislation change this situation?  I am in favour of legislating.  I have studied how it did not make one blind bit of difference when some countries inserted such clauses in their constitutions.

On this occasion, I am representing an amalgamation of a huge number of umbrella groups to ensure that no new decisions are made that unfairly impact any specific group.  While what is proposed is not revolutionary or dramatic and will not change the world overnight, it would ensure that there is information at hand to at least underpin the concept of equality.  I believe this is a moderate step, one which commences the idea and raises people's consciousness of the need for equality underpinning.  This may not be as dramatic as I or members would like but I must be conscious that today I am representing an umbrella group, all of whose members do not have those viewpoints.  The viewpoint I am representing today would be that from now on there should be information available to ensure that decisions made are made with full impact assessment and an understanding of the difference being made to people's lives.

In response to Deputy Kitt's comments, while a legislative approach is probably warranted, how far or how minimal it goes then becomes an issue.  At a meeting I attended last Monday a speaker from the Scottish equivalent of the HSE referred to that agency having a positive duty to equality-proof all of its services, in respect of which he listed a number of actions.  I have not heard of this being done here, even though we have had a pioneering Equality Authority.  It seems to me that the authority's agenda here has been nobbled for the past decade.  We have lost track a little.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to data.  There is specialist knowledge available from the former Equality Authority CEO, Niall Crowley, the great think-tank TASC, and NERI, which has produced assessments of the budgets.  It is not that we cannot reach out to resources, know-how and skills that are located close to this building.  In my view, legislation is needed to underpin the fact that the Government has a positive duty in this area.  This means that when questions arise, which undoubtedly will come from the Department of Finance, in regard to feasibility, cost and so on, members can point to the research from Wilkinson and Pickett which states that egalitarian societies are more cohesive societies.  When there is a cost-benefit analysis, we all win.  Empirical data and research are available.<\/p><p>  I welcome the opportunity presented by this meeting to tease out all of these aspects.  The committee has a duty to make the same recommendation that was made by Deputies Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh and Joanna Tuffy at another committee.

We have highlighted five issues to explain why Irish hauliers will be registering abroad.  A total of 10% of our fleet is already gone.  As of midnight last Monday, the UK introduced the road tax levy of &pound;10 on the roads of Northern Ireland and the UK.  That has probably been the catalyst for this meeting.  However, other issues have also arisen in the last three or four years which have resulted in 10% of the fleet going, with probably another 70% to follow.  These are vehicles that will no longer be registered or taxed in the Republic of Ireland.  They are businesses that will no longer be part of the local economy.<\/p><p>  The first of the five issues is the interpretation over the last four or five years of Republic of Ireland unaccompanied trailers that cross the Irish Sea into mainland Britain, that is, the interpretation of the UK authorities of how those trailers should be handled and the licensing arrangements for them.  There is also the interpretation of Republic of Ireland traffic in and out of Northern Ireland across the Border on a daily basis and how the Northern authorities have interpreted Republic of Ireland vehicles.<\/p><p>  The second issue is the lorry road user levy that was introduced on the roads of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from 1 April.<\/p> <p> The third issue is the commercial vehicle road tax in Ireland, for example, the cost of taxing an articulated truck in Dundalk versus the cost of taxing the same vehicle in Newry and how we compare with our European counterparts.<\/p><p> The fourth issue is the Road Safety Authority and commercial vehicle testing.  New changes in commercial vehicle testing have left us approximately &euro;50 or &euro;60 more expensive than our United Kingdom counterparts.  It is also a more cumbersome way of testing vehicles, trucks and trailers.<\/p><p> The fifth is the National Employment Rights Agency and its refusal to recognise the tachograph in a vehicle as means of recording the times of drivers on a weekly basis.  The method is recognised across Europe and Ireland is the only part of Europe that does not recognise the tachograph, either digitally or analogue, as a recording mechanism.<\/p><p> My colleagues, Mr. Eugene Drennan and Mr. Richard Nolan, will explain in detail the road taxation issues, the cabotage issues, the NERA matter and the vehicle testing issue.  We would welcome questions from the committee.  Some of the issues are quite complex.  The basis of our presentation is that it is now uncompetitive to run a truck south of the Border in Ireland.  It costs in the region of &euro;30,000 per annum more to run an articulated truck when one is based in County Clare as opposed to Manchester, which means the business is unsustainable.  We have lost 10% of the industry and we will lose 70% more between now and next January if serious action is not taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040200003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Gavin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396433100,"counter":572,"content":"<p>I shall expand on two points, the UK regulator's interpretation of both unaccompanied Republic of Ireland trailers to Great Britain in the main, and daily Republic of Ireland traffic in and out of Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>  The Single European Act came into force in 1992 which meant free movement of goods and services.  That provision led to the growth of a very efficient industry and one that delivered goods in the most efficient way possible.  In terms of crossing the Irish Sea, it meant that trucks dropped trailers onto ferries, the ferries moved overnight at an off-peak time and other drivers picked up the trailer on the UK side and delivered the goods while Irish trucks rested.  All the new law has done is add costs and now invariably the tractor unit must be attached to the trailer to do the very same journey and carry the very same goods which are international all of the way, just as they were before.  Let me give an analogy.  If we crossed a bridge, no one would argue about the matter because it would be deemed as international.  However, when it involves a ferry crossing and the goods trailers are unhooked, because that is an efficient way to do business, it is viewed as wrong.  The new provision does not serve health and safety regulations, the environment or efficiency.  It simply causes unnecessary angst, bureaucracy and cost.<\/p><p>  The second point that I shall expand on is the UK's enforcement of a tax on Irish trucks in Northern Ireland and Great Britain from yesterday.  The second point, even more so than my first one, is the point that will drive trucks to the other state.  For instance, depending on how one buys the tax it ranges between &pound;10 to &pound;20 per day.  If one forgets to purchase that tax on the day in question, one will be fined &pound;300.  The reality is that one is better to pay the tax for the full year or re-register the truck in that state, thus incurring no tax and no problems.  The provision is unnecessary but that is the way that the UK has dealt with the matter.<\/p><p>  The IRHA can suggest three obvious possibilities to fix the problem.  First, we can use the Ireland Act 1949 which is a British Act of Parliament that states that Irish people will not be treated as a foreign country for the purposes of a British law.  That is a British Act of Parliament and has nothing to do with us.  Second, we could have a focused unilateral agreement instead of a bilateral agreement which would isolate the area of Northern Ireland as well as the ro-ro ports of Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland.  Third, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport put forward a solution and called it a functional area for the peoples of these islands.  He made the suggestion in his speech at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 14 May 2012.  His suggestion is the best of the three options but any one of them will work to resolve the issue we face today regarding these two points.  That is enough on that matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040200004#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Nolan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396433100,"counter":573,"content":"<p>I will deal with the issue of road tax.  The main problem is that it is too expensive.  The commercial road vehicle tax is having a strangling effect on competitiveness here in Ireland and has left numerous operators with no other choice but to re-register their vehicles and trailers in other jurisdictions.  That means they will re-flag their business to another jurisdiction, they will pay no tax to the Irish State and their overheads will be depleted substantially while retaining the business out of Ireland.  To that end, for the budget before last, the IRHA commissioned a set of proposals and examined the whole scenario of taxing commercial vehicles in Ireland.  At the time we took cognisance of the state of moneys in this country and where we were in the recession.  Initially, we sought to have wayleave for the tax in some way but then we saw there may be room for re-appropriating what tax goes on what vehicles.  To that end, we compiled a table that I hope has been circulated to members.  It shows that the total tax take of all commercial vehicles in Ireland is &euro;143.5 million.  By rejigging that table ever so slightly we can have a substantial lifting of the financial load yet the Exchequer will have the same tax take as the provision is revenue neutral.<br \/>We brought our proposal to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government two years ago or a year and nine months ago.  To date, we have been told the matter is in hand and something may happen but nothing has happened.  Everyone can do the maths easily.  Let us say it costs &euro;4,500 in road tax for larger commercial vehicles in Dundalk - and I have used Dundalk as an analogy again but perhaps it is unfair to always mention the town - as opposed to &pound;650 or &pound;750 in Newry because in that jurisdiction axle weight, environmental impact and a few other things are taken into account.  Clearly, there is a colossal gap in expenditure even for small and medium-sized enterprises.  At my local tax section it costs me &euro;28,000 for five trucks but I have twice as many trucks and I give them &euro;50,000 every day.  This man seated beside me owns a huge business and I would not like to mention the figure he must pay.  Tax is a very significant overhead.<br \/>The IRHA has submitted its proposal.  I hope that we can kick-start its implementation and that something will be done about the matter.  The delegation has outlined its proposals but we are not asking the Government to stick to them.  We have, without a shadow of a doubt, pointed out that our overheads are way out of sync with the rest of Europe.  No other jurisdiction or country in Europe has a road tax regime that is so high or so costly.  Some of them may be close or on a par with us but they have different trading conditions and different fuels, etc. and compared with us <i>pro rata<\/i>Ireland is way out of sync.  Those are our tax proposals in a nutshell and we will take questions after a little while on the matter.<br \/>The other matter that I emphasise is commercial vehicle testing by the RSA.  Testing has gone pear shaped since it took over the revised testing regime for commercial vehicles.  The RSA does the work on behalf of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  There have been a number of very negative consequences resulting from the revised approach the RSA has taken to testing.<br \/>I refer to the cost.  We can break down the costs for members.  There is a difference of approximately &euro;50 per year when compared with the UK.  We are &euro;50 per truck and per trailer in excess.  When the NRA took over the testing, it increased the initial test fee by between 8%, 10% or something and also imposed a levy to finance its programme.  This is a water change of movement and legislation in this country that we have been asked via a levy to pay for a body of the State to enforce this on us.<\/p> <p>When they go to court, they seek expenses and whatever other moneys they perceive it has cost them to do so.  However, that is an aside.<\/p><p> Again, the cost basis and the way it is done and how we go about our business in this is excessive.  To that end, they also brought in a regime where they want one to test one's vehicle on its birth date.  This could be perceived as very practical in its own right but because of the downturn in business and the type of business we do, a lot of our vehicles are off the road for quite considerable periods of time, especially in the articulated sector in which one has drop trailers.  With the lack of business in the construction industry, a huge amount of equipment has been left idle.  If someone gets a bit of work, the vehicle will be taken out and tested.  Heretofore one did the annual test and paid one's fee.  Now when one goes to the station, one pays up to the birth date.  I did an annual test the other day but I got six weeks on a vehicle.  It passed the test but it was only good for six weeks.  They say they have decreased the cost but in that case, they have tripled or maybe quadrupled, it.<\/p><p> If I had the same vehicle off the road in Northern Ireland or if I purchased that truck from Northern Ireland, England or mainland Europe and went in to get the same test, even if it was off the road in another country, it would not have mattered.  It was new to Ireland and it had a birth date from which I would be given a year.<\/p><p> The basic cost, the levy and the way they have gone about their business has heightened the cost hugely.  When this testing regime came in in Ireland some years ago, we were the first who had to go about doing it, and rightly so.  We had no qualms with it and we adhered to it.  We do not know why the ante had to be upped and why it has become so much more expensive.  I do not want to delay members as we have a timeline and I am sure I will get questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040200004#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Drennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396433700,"counter":575,"content":"<p>Has the charge been implemented since yesterday?

The Government could try to address it with the English.  We believe their definition of cabotage is too narrow.  The cabotage legislation was brought in following a directive from Europe.  As we have seen many times, it is down to how a country interprets these rules and regulations.  England allows one into the country in three movements within seven days and then one must leave the country.  They count the import load and the export load as two of the movements, or they can do, depending on which vehicle inspector one meets and his or her interpretation.  One is not going to change English law on the side of the road or how they interpret it.<\/p><p>  However, if the overall English interpretation of this directive was a little bit more lenient, it would give a little bit of room.

The testing system is operated on the basis of legislation and we have no problem with the law.  The RSA was concerned about the fact that vehicles were not being tested on the public road.  The new system put in place by the authority imposes a financial penalty on those who do not test their vehicles within a 12 month birth-date period.  In the UK, for example, if a test is carried out on 1 January, the vehicle is not tested again until December, regardless of what happens prior to that date.  The RSA has said that if a vehicle due for testing in January is not produced until July, it will only be given a six-month test and the owner pays for the full year that he or she missed.  Approximately 30% of our vehicles are not on the road at any given time.  They are either sitting in forecourts or elsewhere.  They tried the birth-date system in the UK seven or eight years ago but it did not work.  It is very convoluted.  The Minister has granted a derogation up to 7 October while the review of the RSA testing procedures is taking place.  In that sense, the Department has acknowledged that there is a problem.  We would like, through this committee, to feed into the review in October and to indicate to the Department that the system does not make either economic or practical sense.  Enforcement needs to happen through Garda checkpoints and RSA spot checks, with very severe penalties.  Why penalise somebody who is bringing a vehicle for testing and who genuinely had that vehicle off the road because of lack of work?

I had tabled questions on this issue and the Minister acknowledged at Question Time this morning that there was a crisis.  It is not just the 1948 Act but this is also breaking the spirt of the Good Friday Agreement, an agreement for mutual co-operation, and the Minister indicated that he was worried about it.  There is no mechanism in place in the North for the PSNI to deal with this issue or collect the levy.  Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled a motion in the Assembly.  While it may be in place, I do not see how the charge can be imposed and it is extremely worrying that 10% of the haulage fleet has relocated.  When I questioned the Minister on the issue this morning, he acknowledged that hauliers had registered and would register their vehicles in the North.  This significant loss of revenue must be addressed and the Minister must find a mechanism to deal with it.<\/p><p>  Will Mr. Gavin elaborate on the tachograph and the implications of the way it is used in the United Kingdom as compared to the Republic?  Attempts have been made to exclude certain roads in the North, but that does not address the core problem.  The ports are also an issue.  Even when one unloads the carriage, if a vehicle is picked up, the haulier faces a levy.  This will have a major effect on transport in this jurisdiction.  The Minister has indicated that he has been considering a number of ideas, including a change in motor tax, but I would like to hear Mr. Gavin's opinion on whether this is a workable solution.  It was also indicated that cabotage or other new mechanisms were under consideration.  If the numbers indicated by Mr. Gavin register in the North, that will be a major issue in terms of where we go from there.<\/p><p>  Mr. Gavin has mentioned that under the provisions of the Single European Act, there are no borders.  Could we make a case that these impositions on hauliers are in breach of the principle of fair play across borders?

Many have moved to eastern Europe.  How can we solve this problem?  There are two international issues, cabotage and the lorry road user charge in the United Kingdom.  It is difficult to change what is happening in the United Kingdom; however, there is a British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, as well as an Irish-UK trade body, which allows room for negotiation.  Ireland and the United Kingdom could consider a model similar to what operates in the Benelux counties where, for example, operators in Belgium, Luxembourg, Holland and Denmark pay one charge when they operate in these four countries.  They were part of the Schengen agreement, unlike Ireland and the United Kingdom.  That system works quite well, as one may be in and out of each jurisdiction perhaps two or three times a day.<\/p><p>  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government needs to come to the table to discuss the issue of motor tax before the budget.  Road tax for an articulated truck is &euro;4,000 compared to &pound;650 in the North and &euro;640 in Belgium.  The Government could change the road tax structure immediately.  It was stated last week that the Twenty-six Counties could do a deal with the North on a road tax, but they cannot to do a deal while the road tax structure for haulage vehicles dating from 1956 is still in place.  The United Kingdom authorities have laughed at what happens here.  In the Republic a truck is weighted when it is empty and the tax is based on unladen weight.  Some three years ago we raised this issue with the joint committee which recommended that there was a need to change it, but we are still waiting for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to come to the table.  Mr. Eugene Drennan went through our very strong recommendations.  As they would be cost neutral, they could be included in the budget, but we need to get to the table with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.

Through the process of the Good Friday Agreement we are trying to create an all-Ireland economy.  On Monday I was appointed as rapporteur on behalf of the Government at the British-Irish Assembly and have been charged with producing a report on foreign toll taxes and cabotage.  Unlike what Deputy Dessie Ellis stated, I have engaged with the UUP, for which Mr. Danny Kinahan has been appointed co-rapporteur.  He will liaise with the Transport Minister in the North, Mr. Danny Kennedy.  We will bring the report to the next plenary session and hope to have a resolution of the issue of cabotage which is wider than the North and the South.  The Assembly covers a number of islands, including Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, and includes representatives of the Welsh Assembly and the Parliaments in Scotland, at Westminster and in Dublin.  We can create a functional area for all of the islands similar to the system which operates in the Benelux countries.  We need to take a wider view than simply at the North-South dimension.  We could try to ensure that none of our jurisdictions will impose a foreign toll on operators from any other member country of the Assembly.  It is also better to look at the issue of cabotage in terms of how it applies in a functional area.  We will give serious consideration to this issue which I raised with the Taoiseach when he spoke at the Assembly.

We want all roads in the North of Ireland to be exempt.  The A5 and the Dundalk to Castleblayney road have been mentioned.  One needs to travel on other roads to get onto those roads.  We would be looking for all roads to be exempt as any other approach would not make practical sense.<\/p><p>  Deputy McEntee also asked about the cost of leaving.  We have come up with some quite scary figures with regard to the five issues.  The cabotage issue is a significant one.  A person based in Letterkenny who works for Donegal Creameries and has to go to the port of Derry every day to unload for the creamery can only do three loads before he has to go home.  The cost of that is enormous.  If person based in Dublin Port who wants to send trailers to Holyhead has to send a driver and a truck on the ferry as well, he will have to pay for the extra berth and the extra space on the ferry.  The cost of that alone would be approximately &euro;25,000 per annum, which is a massive cost.  Our road tax structure is &euro;4,000 more expensive.  Our testing fees are more expensive by between &euro;50 and &euro;60 per vehicle.  The overall saving per vehicle adds up to approximately &euro;30,000.  Each vehicle represents 3.8 jobs in this economy.  I refer to those who fit tyres, those who work on the mechanic side, those involved in finance and leasing and the officials in the Road Safety Authority and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We have proven over the past 20 years that there are 3.8 jobs for every truck in Ireland.  We would be talking about a big bleed in the economy.<\/p><p>  We have representatives here from the Border areas, the north west, the north east and the south east, which are regions of very high unemployment - up to 20% in some areas.  The biggest fleets in the country are in those areas.  It is possible that those fleets will relocate outside this jurisdiction, in another economy altogether.  The risk is not that they will move to Dublin or centralise.  It is that this whole sector of the economy will decentralise.  Given that transport is of great importance to our export-led economy, this could have significant costs at the end of the day.<\/p><p>  Deputy McEntee also asked how we have gone about lobbying our people in the North of Ireland.  We have a very close relationship with the hauliers there.  We compete in the same business.  There are 7,000 trucks in the North and 15,000 trucks in the South.  There is a big transport industry up there.  They do come south of the Border.  Approximately 70% of their business is south of the Border.  We have a good relationship with them.  Initially, they were saying we should be paying something in the North because they pay tolls down here.  They subsequently realised that the tolls apply to good quality motorway infrastructure, which was built to get people from A to B more quickly, whereas the roads in the North are not motorways.  We still have to pay road tax on our national routes here.<\/p><p>  Deputy Conlan alluded to the possibility of proceeding on an all-island basis.  The hauliers in the North have moved closer to our position in that regard.  They would be more likely to be in favour of working towards that if a common road tax structure were in place.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government needs to change our current road tax structure, which operates on the basis of unladen weight and dates back to 1956, immediately.  We would be wasting our time by going to the Assembly and asking for co-operation because they would turn around and ask about the kind of road tax structures we have in place.  They would laugh at us.  It is important for the current structure to change immediately.  We welcome the support that has been expressed by Deputy Conlan in his capacity as rapporteur on behalf of the Government at the British-Irish Assembly.  As he attended the meeting we had with the Minister, Deputy Hogan, in November, he knows exactly where we stand.  He has seen our figures.  I strongly believe he will put his best foot forward in this regard.<\/p><p>  The Chairman asked about the fuel rebate, which was most unwelcome.  The recommendation that was made by this committee in its 2012 report definitely helped to bring about the decision that was made by the Minister, Deputy Noonan.  It has separated the rogue operator from the legitimate operator.  One needs to have one's road licensing in place and one's tax up to date.  It has attracted a great deal of additional revenue into the Irish coffers.  We have had two periods of pay-out.  The third one kicked in yesterday.  There is still a slow take-up with the IT system but we are working through it.  The Revenue online service is a very good system when people get used to it.  We are working through it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040200008#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Gavin"},{"type":"speech","time":1396435200,"counter":605,"content":"<p>If the system is so good, why have people been so slow to take it up?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040200008#K00300","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396435200,"counter":606,"content":"<p>Many hauliers might not be used to working with IT systems.  Some hauliers rely on their agents or their accountants to do this work for them.  The registration process is a little different from that used under the PAYE and VAT systems.  I refer to the allocation of fuel cards, for example.  The fuel reporting legislation, which was designed to combat the use of the laundered fuel when more than 2,000 litres are in question, created havoc.  It required oil distributors to report anything over 2,000 litres, with no reporting of anything under that level.  We are going through the difficulties to iron them out.  Overall, the new fuel rebate system is welcome.  The ironic thing is that if any of us were to register north of the Border tomorrow morning, we would still claim that rebate and still avail of the corporation tax rate, but this country would lose the benefits it gets from our trucks leaving this economy.  We would be soaking out.<\/p><p>  The IMOD has launched a proposal aimed at making Ireland a shipping transport hub.  It has spoken to people in the association about making Ireland a friendly place to do transport and shipping business.  This proposal is similar to the IFSC and aircraft leasing proposals that were made some years ago.  If this country's road tax structure and the charges between Ireland and the UK were to be sorted, we would be in a very good place.  I mentioned to the Minister at our conference in Kilkenny last weekend that this is a very good place to do business because the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is very efficient, our corporation tax structure is very good, the fuel rebate system has been improved and upskilled and there are well-educated drivers and other people involved in the industry.

All of these port-to-port routes are important.  No one specific route is more important than another.  The imposition of this charge on all of them will have serious consequences for transport across the Border.  We need to think more widely about this.

This money is predominantly spent in the jurisdiction in which the truck is based.  If the truck's base moves, the procurement that goes with it follows it.  I have to make the point that approximately 28,000 jobs would be in jeopardy if all of this were to happen.  It is close to happening.  One of our hubs is based in the south east.  It will go to Wales, England or France because it will make sense to do so.  It is already happening.  It is good that recommendations are being made.  We have been talking about the functional area for a long time.  All of this makes sense.  The irony is that there is a development coming into Dublin.  If we can hold what we have, we can turn an absolute negative into a triple positive.

If this business moves, the only way we will get it back - ironically - will be to use IDA Ireland to bring it back as foreign direct investment, which would be madness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040200008#K01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1396435200,"counter":616,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nolan.<\/p> <p>I thank the group for its presentation and for its engagement with members.

The Freight Transport Association of Ireland has operated in Ireland for the past five years or so.  The employers and companies we represent employ approximately 25,000 people and use 6,000 heavy goods vehicles and buses in the retail and passenger transport sectors.<\/p><p>  The UK's HGV Road User Levy Act 2013 became effective yesterday for Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  However, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands will be treated as foreign operators for the purposes of the Act.  The interesting fact is that for UK operators, the levy is cost neutral.  It operates like road tax does here for our transport companies.  Therefore, if companies pay their road tax in the UK, they will have paid their UK road levy.  However, the effect of this Act for us means that the typical truck that crosses the Border or takes the ferry to Britain will pay up to &pound;1,000 per annum.<\/p><p>  We want to speak in particular about the effect of this levy in regard to the north west.  Like our colleagues in the Irish Road Haulage Association, we would prefer if the road user levy, RUL, did not apply anywhere on the island of Ireland and would love it if there was political consensus north of the Border on it, but there is not.  A clear majority north of the Border wants it imposed.  Therefore, we are afraid that if we pursue this as a policy goal, we will get nothing.  That is not an option for our operators.<\/p><p>  I am accompanied by Mr. Mick O'Dwyer and I will call on him to speak on this issue in a moment.  He is the regional transport manager for the Musgrave Group, Ireland's largest domestic retailer and one of the largest employers in Ireland.  It is expected that soon it will be the largest retailer on the island.   The reason the north west is unique is that our people in the north west are in a situation that is almost unique in Europe, in that they must transit another jurisdiction to access their sea ports and airport.  I am conscious of Deputy Conlan's comment earlier regarding an exemption for certain roads, but we do not concur with that view.<\/p><p>  The A5 is a primary trunk route through Northern Ireland.  Many people may not be aware - we have included this information in the annex to our submission - that Ireland will pay &pound;50 million over the next two years to the British Exchequer to upgrade the A5 because of its importance as a transit route.  As far as we are concerned, we have paid for that route and Irish hauliers should, as of right, be able to use it without having to pay the UK road user levy.  The primary route from the south of Donegal and north Sligo is the A49-A509.  This route is very important to the Donegal fishing industry and we would like to see this route exempted also.  Despite the perception, an exemption could be done more easily done than expected because the same rules that would apply to cabotage could be used to ensure truckers could transit Northern Ireland and not pay the road user levy.<\/p><p>  In regard to hauliers that who the Border, they do so for three main reasons.  They cross to do business in Northern Ireland, to go through Northern Ireland or to get services such as services from garages or tyre companies.  We would love to see 100% of that type of traffic to be exempt from the UK road user levy, but we do not think that will happen.  We have provided some figures, but I have asked the secretary of our group to ensure these are not made available under freedom of information after this meeting because they include commercially sensitive data.  However, up to 40% of the traffic by our members across the Border is transit traffic.  These hauliers do not do business in Northern Ireland, but travel from the Republic, north into Donegal or come from Donegal back into the Republic.  We believe it is justifiable, reasonable and legitimate to expect this traffic should not pay the UK road user levy, because all they are doing is travelling from one part of the Republic to another.<\/p><p>  We were asked to comment on a number of other issues in our correspondence.  On road tax, we concur with the views heard earlier.  We included the OECD figures in our submission, because they are incontrovertible and show the extent to which people pay road tax.  We already pay the highest road tax of the European nations in the OECD.  Like the IRHA, we have experienced reflagging of our members.  Mr. Flynn and I negotiate annually with members in regard to renewal.  However, we are being told that people are sorry, but they will not pay us the same as the previous year because they have moved X numbers of their trucks to Newry or to Wales.<\/p><p>  In regard to the Minister's announcement in January that he is considering a road user charge for Irish trucks, we would ask that any proposal the Minister introduces would be like that in the United Kingdom and be cost neutral for Irish hauliers.<\/p> <p>If that is not going to be a runner, we would like the Minister to consider free tolls.  He organised a toll holiday in November which we understood resulted in a substantial uptake in the use of the motorways by truckers.  Clearly this is an issue.  We have truckers going through small towns who should not be doing so.  We ask the Minister to consider that.<\/p><p> I must say on behalf of the Freight Transport Association of Ireland that we strongly support commercial vehicle roadworthiness testing, or CVRT.  It has demonstrably saved lives.  It is also ensuring fair competition for operators like the Musgrave Group, which spends time, effort and money on its kit.  We strongly support what the Road Safety Authority is doing in that regard.<\/p><p> While the rules on cabotage are a little tricky, they were introduced in the first place to allow international transport to take place in an economic and environmentally friendly manner.  A haulier goes to another jurisdiction and delivers his load, and in order to make it viable economically, he picks up a load in that jurisdiction and can stay up to seven days and carry out three loads on the way home.  These rules are very fair and we want them retained but the big issue in Ireland is that they are not enforced.  When our hauliers go to Northern Ireland, Britain or the Continent, they will have their paperwork checked to ensure that they are obeying cabotage rules.  The same does not happen to foreign operators here, and we have people openly operating non-domestic registered trucks out of depots in the Republic, and this is just not acceptable.  Some are of the view that cabotage restrictions should be relaxed entirely but our submission shows that road tax on a Latvian truck is &euro;543 per annum, so where do Deputies think the trucks doing domestic transport in the Republic will be coming from if those rules are relaxed?  We should think long and hard about that before we decide we are going to bin the cabotage rules.<\/p><p> We were asked to comment on NERA and our members have similar experience to those of our colleagues in the IRHA.  It is clear that the Labour Court and the National Employment Rights Authority are misinterpreting the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  They are not applying the relevant EU directive, which is 2002\/15 EC.  This is leading to a misinterpretation of the working week in terms of hours worked, and it is leading to unfair outcomes for employers.  Some are being accused of working employees for too long, others are being accused of paying below the minimum wage, but none of this is true.  We wrote to the chief executive of the Labour Court and the head of NERA in December 2013 to point this out.  Our legal advice is that the Labour Court and NERA are misapplying the law.  When we met with officials from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, they acknowledged internal legal opinions that also state that the Labour Court and NERA are misapplying the law, which quite frankly we think is a farcical situation.  At a minimum, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation needs to ensure immediately that  there is a moratorium on any determinations against employers under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 until this is addressed.<\/p><p> The last issue on which we were asked to comment was outsourcing in the sector.  We know from our member renewals that there is a re-flagging of Irish transport north of the Border, typically into Newry, or into Wales.  When we were renewing with him in January, one of our members said directly to our face that he could now register in Anglesea and claim the road user rebate.  We have actually given them a free pass to take their trucks out of Ireland but claim the levy from the Revenue Commissioners in Ireland, and this is causing a severe issue for us.  The other reason outsourcing is occurring is that aside from the rebate which makes it viable for them to do so, not enforcing the cabotage restrictions here means that there is a positive inducement for them to leave the country.  Due to the unfair interpretation of the law by the Labour Court, by NERA, and by the cowboy sector that is paying our transport workers below the minimum wage, legitimate operators are under attack from all fronts over here.<\/p><p> The last comment before I hand over to Mr. O'Dwyer-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040200009#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396436400,"counter":622,"content":"<p>We are under pressure on time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040200010#M00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396436400,"counter":623,"content":"<p>I would like to pose one question to the Deputies before I hand over.

The truckers have organisations North and South.  In the South they want the charge to be cost-neutral.  In the North, however, the charge is imposed.  People have talked about an exemption for the A5 and other roads but it is a difficult matter to police because there are roads criss-crossing everywhere.  Mr. O&rsquo;Dwyer spoke about Musgraves.  Transport goes into the North, heading up to Donegal, and crossing the Border.  That will be badly hit if we cannot find some other arrangement.  I agree there are serious problems about this in the Northern Ireland Assembly.  Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled a motion on this but it will not be implemented because there are no clear rules for the PSNI, which is supposed to police it but does not know what to do.  There is a window of opportunity to consider this.  Pressure must be applied to the British Government.  We need an exemption.  We need to be tied in with some of the other countries mentioned.

It is extremely important for the truckers to send out a strong message when the budget is being formulated because there is no doubt the association will lose some members, who will go North.  That has already happened.  The same has happened to the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, which has lost 10% and the figure will continue to rise.  There are major losses.  The issue is not just between North and South on the roads but also South to North at the ports.  There is a big problem there.  If we focus on one area at the Border we forget that we have to deal with freight from Wales, Scotland and England.  I am not sure the association's focus is right.

The committee is acutely aware of them and has discussed them over the past weeks and months.  The major concern is the international or cross-border issue.  It is extremely difficult for us as Irish parliamentarians to find a way to resolve this.  That is why I asked if the association had made representations at committee level to the relevant transport committees in the Northern Ireland Assembly and to the British Parliament.  That would have been the appropriate place to go, before the new legislation came into force in Northern Ireland and the UK.  I find it extremely strange that the association has not acted on behalf of its members at that level prior to the regulation&rsquo;s being implemented because the horse has bolted.  We are trying to defend a rear-guard action and do what we as Irish parliamentarians can to address it.  The association is sending out conflicting messages.  That is my honest appraisal.  It is trying to represent members on one side of the Border who are being treated in a different way from those on the other side.  I find it hard to accept that conflict.  The association cannot have it every way. <\/p><p>  I am concerned about the operators based in the Irish Republic who are members of the FTA and of the IRHA and how to assist them.  Whatever strategic approach the FTA takes to representing them must align with what we and others are trying to do.  I am not telling the witnesses how to do their business but I sense conflict there and it does not sit well with me.<\/p><p>  We need to try to achieve an all-Ireland approach that will level the playing pitch.  How to achieve it is the problem.  We have to acknowledge that the Minister and  the Department officials are working at diplomatic level with their UK counterparts to try to find common ground.  I am open to advice.  In fairness to the IRHA, it mentioned three solutions, the Ireland Act 1949, a unilateral agreement and a functional area, as proposed by the Minister.  The functional area proposal would be the best solution for an all-Ireland approach.  What is the FRA&rsquo;s view of that? <\/p> <p>Does the association have support or otherwise for that type of approach?  On the matter of overheads, the cost of doing business in Ireland and the threats of displacement to other countries, it should be acknowledged - I note that the Irish Road Haulage Association and the Freight Transport Association have acknowledged the support of the Irish Government by means of the essential user fuel rebate - that a genuine effort is being made by the Government to assist the industry.  I recognise the association's concerns about road tax but, speaking as a public representative, I am aware that we need to be responsible.  To be fair, we have a smaller critical mass of road users in the Republic than in the UK, so it is quite easy for them to have a lower road tax rate than it is for us.  This is a difficulty we will have to overcome.  I agree with the principle that those who use the roads the most should pay the most.  That is only fair, in my view.  However, the challenge is how to reduce the rate and to find the funding.  I am a Government Deputy and if I want to support a budget and also see a reduction in the rate of road tax then I have to be able to show where the money will come from to make that saving.  I hope the association will understand my position.  I will support a reduction in road tax in any way possible.<br \/>I share the concerns with regard to tachographs.  I am not fully <i>au fait<\/i>with the issue and I ask Mr. McDonnell to explain the Labour Court ruling or why it refused to take account of tachographs.  This is a matter that the committee should revisit and possibly explore further because if it is accepted as the Road Safety Authority measurement for working hours it is a cause for concern if another State agency does not accept it.  To be fair to all parties, we need a bit of consistency.  It is a problem the committee needs to deal with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040200011#N01500","speaker":"1092","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1396437600,"counter":647,"content":"<p>In answer to the perception that there is a different message on either side of the Border, the Road Haulage Association in the UK and the Freight Transport Association went to the UK Minister for Transport and asked for a good deal for their hauliers and they got it.  That is exactly what we are doing here.  We represent our members in the Republic and we want the best deal that is going.  If that means we do not have to pay any road user levy North of the Border that is great, and we wish the committee every success in achieving that.  However, I caution that we know there is not a political consensus north of the Border and coming back to us with a glorious failure is not an option in our view, especially when the Irish taxpayer will be paying &pound;50 million.  I ask the committee to consider, if the tables were turned, what would they be saying in London about being asked to pay a levy on a stretch of road which they have paid for.  We are in exactly the same position as the Road Haulage Association in the UK, which asked for a good deal for its hauliers.  We are doing the very same here; it is as simple as that.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked me about the fine detail of the Labour Court ruling.  I will send the determinations by e-mail and I caution that they are written in very dense legalese and are very tricky.  The reason we raised a red flag on the issue is because Labour Court divisions have different chairmen and members but have used the same formulation in words.  The tachograph records have no probative value in establishing compliance with the Act.  For two entirely independent divisions of the Labour Court to have the same wording in determinations against different companies, frankly, I find it a little strange.  Perhaps it is pure coincidence.  When it is also the case that people in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport are saying that these people have got it wrong legally, it is of real concern to our members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040200012#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1396437600,"counter":648,"content":"<p>I raised some of these issues this morning in the D&aacute;il with the Minister, Deputy Varadkar.  It is unusual that Ireland and the UK are unable to come to a more amicable and common-sense arrangement.  The Minister was at pains to point out that the UK was governed by some EU regulations - the cabotage rules - and he was making the point that the EU regulations were the reason.  If the road hauliers want to get a better deal it will have to come from the Irish Government and be an internal arrangement.  When the hotels were on their knees they were given a VAT reduction to avoid hotel closures.  The haulage industry will ship out 20,000 jobs to outsourcing if it does not get a better deal.  It is a case of doing the maths and deciding what is the most sensible action.  A loss of approximately &euro;15 million to &euro;30 million in VAT resulted in a reduction of the VAT rate for restaurants, but there was an all-round saving because the measure made economic sense.  The hauliers will have to push the Government to get a deal rather than expecting to get the UK to throw any crumbs their way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040200012#O00300","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1396437600,"counter":649,"content":"<p>I ask for a comment on the functional area proposal being mooted by the Minister, to which the Irish Road Haulage Association referred.

In answer to Deputy Wallace, I will be quite open in saying that there would definitely be a split between our Unionist and Nationalist members about their relative perceptions of the levy.  We have sounded out both sides of the fence on this matter.  The majority opinion would be that the road user levy stays.  However, when we pointed out to people North of the Border that the Minister is considering a similar levy south of the Border, the tone moderated a little, especially with regard to the notion that Northern Ireland hauliers might have to pay anything similar to Irish road tax rates south of the Border.  I can say that this changed the perception in the room of what might be available.  In that regard I would say that there is political scope to negotiate about what might happen either side of the Border.  From our point of view, we want to make a strong representation on the A5, because almost half of the transport of our members crosses the A5, not to do business in Northern Ireland but just to get over and back to Donegal.  I would advise the Deputy that one of the concerns of people North of the Border is that the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, would impose a charge on the M1.  If that were to occur, I could suggest that there might be a very different approach North of the Border.  The difficulty we have right now is that we do not have any proposal on the table with regard to an Irish road user levy.<\/p> <p>I am putting that forward as something that might possibly move the situation on more quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040200012#O00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1396438200,"counter":656,"content":"<p>My question is to Mr. O'Dwyer.
