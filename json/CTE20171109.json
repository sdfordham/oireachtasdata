He is accompanied by Ms Georgina O'Mahony, deputy director of audit.  We have received apologies from Deputy Mary Lou McDonald.<\/p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meetings of 24 and 26 October.  Are they agreed t?  Agreed.  As any matter that may arise from the minutes will arise in the course of our work this morning, we will move straightaway to the third item on the agenda, which is correspondence.  <\/p> <p>  There are three categories of correspondence.  Category A is correspondence specific to this meeting.  Items Nos. 869A and 876A are the briefing document and opening statement from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We will note and publish them.  <\/p> <p>  Category B is correspondence received from Accounting Officers and Ministers in a follow-up on previous meetings, with other items for publication.  Item No. 839B( i-ii) is correspondence, dated 24 October 2017, received from Mr. Gordon Bond in the remuneration, industrial relations and pensions division of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is in response to the committee&rsquo;s request for information on the terms and conditions of employment of certain State employees.  It appears from the information provided that there are approximately 230,000 people who are paid by and entitled to pensions from the State but who are not employees of it.<\/p><p>The same applies to work in agencies funded by the HSE and the schools and universities in the country.<\/p><p> The committee followed up the matter, which was raised by an individual, in respect of teachers in particular.  The individual has copied us with other correspondence, which we will deal with later.  The individual raised the question of how teachers can be in receipt of State salaries if they are employed by the local school boards of management.  It is an interesting question.<\/p><p> From previous correspondence, I understand that the relationship of the State and schools is derived from the provisions of the Constitution.  The State has a constitutional obligation to provide for free primary education.  The Department says that the State discharges its obligations by paying teachers in national schools owned by the churches; making grants available for renovation, repairs and, at times, building of new national schools; and paying for heating in schools, books and the provision of proper curriculum and appropriate supervision.  In accordance with the provisions of the Education Acts, the board of a school manages the school on behalf of the patron.  The Minister for Education and Skills operates a payroll service in respect of teachers and special needs assistants on behalf of the boards of management.  The Minister has statutory functions in terms of setting terms and conditions of employment for teachers and special needs assistants.<\/p><p> I am unsure whether this is clear in legislation and I would like to receive a note from the Department on the matter.  I note the correspondence did not deal with secondary schools or third level institutions.  We will seek specific further information on the legal position.  The Department has outlined the general position.  Can we agree to get a further note on that before we consider it further?  Agreed.<\/p><p> The next item is 840B, correspondence dated 24 October, from Barry O'Connor, president of Cork Institute of Technology, providing details, as requested by the committee, regarding a retirement function for the previous president of the college.  The retirement function cost a little under &euro;13,000 and was signed off by the outgoing president himself.  That is an issue we specifically asked about and I imagine many people will have trouble with it.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  The details include &euro;4,892 spent on catering and &euro;5,000 spent on tables, frames, drapes, carpets and audio-visual set-up.  A total of &euro;1,840 was spent on senior staff invitees at the president's dinner.  There were cleaning costs and caretaker overtime costs.  A music quartet played as well.<\/p><p> The account has been paid in full but I believe some element of control within the finance section of Cork Institute of Technology must not have been followed.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  We will ask the Higher Education Authority to examine the controls that were in place and whether it could happen again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017110900002#B00200","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I propose that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017110900002#C00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>That is grand.  You are happy with that, Deputy.  We will proceed on that basis.  I thank the Deputy.  We will get further information on it.  Although that particular horse has bolted, we have no wish for another to bolt.<\/p> <p>  The next item is correspondence No. 841, dated 24 October, from Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills.  As requested by the committee, the correspondence follows up on the transfer of properties as part of the redress scheme and costs of the child abuse inquiry.  The Department says that it will continue to provide regular updates to the committee in respect of the progress.<\/p> <p>  I have a proposal in this regard.  Some of this is 15 years old.  If someone said the Department of Education and Skills was to start something today in respect of the transfer of properties and that in 15 years' time the Committee of Public Accounts was still being told that the matter had not been finalised, it would be outrageous.<\/p> <p>  Representatives of the Department of Education and Skills will be before the committee next Thursday in any event to discuss educational and training boards.  I propose that we allocate the first 15 minutes of the meeting specifically to this matter.  It is 15 years on and it has not been dealt with.  We might allow two speakers five minutes each.  We will not all get in but we cannot let this pass.  We will note and publish the correspondence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017110900002#C00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>This is a matter that I have followed up and raised repeatedly.  Certainly, if representatives of the Department are appearing before the committee to answer questions, I would like to ask some questions.  This would have gone completely under the carpet only for the Committee of Public Accounts and the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That report set out the total cost of the redress board, the commission of inquiry and so on.<\/p> <p>  I zoned in on one building in Galway, which has remained empty since 2009.  It was offered in 2009.  I see from the latest clarification that the Government considered offers in 2011.  It went from 2009 to 2011.  The Government considered it again in July 2013.  At that point, the Department took over.  That is only one example.  That building has remained empty all this time.  It has an upsetting history, which I know intimately.  The council in Galway called by motion for the building to be given over but it was refused.  Rather than give it over and be used, it remained empty.<\/p> <p>  I am keen to go through all these buildings to discern precisely the position.  First, this is a waste of money.  Second, the deterioration in the building from that time is remarkable.  That is only one example.  It has now been handed over with a contribution of &euro;750,000.  That has been hailed as a donation to the city.  In reality, it is part of a redress scheme.  Certainly, it is the second part of the voluntary redress scheme.<\/p> <p>  I am dwelling on the matter because it has taken this much time to highlight the matter.  At the same time, a different narrative was being shared with the people of Galway in respect of the matter.  There are all sorts of narratives going on, but really the only narrative is that this building has been scandalously empty.  The money that has now been handed over will not even come close to dealing with the deterioration of the building.  Perhaps 15 minutes is not enough but certainly I welcome the opportunity to put questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017110900002#C00400","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Do you want us to put the Secretary General on notice to have specific details in respect of the Galway property?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017110900002#C00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Yes.

Given that the man will be here and we have a letter from him today, I believe we should have a short discussion on the matter while he is before the committee prior to getting in to the main business.  That is agreed.  We will note and publish the correspondence.<\/p> <p>  Next item is correspondence 844B, dating from 24 October, from Graham Doyle, Secretary General of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, providing information, as requested, on projects funded by the Department that are processed via the Transport Infrastructure Ireland payment management system.  At our last meeting we asked for funding directly from the Department for various road projects.  The correspondence refers to road restoration, maintenance, road improvement grants, discretionary grants, bridge rehabilitation, safety improvement, works training grants, special grants and strategic projects, various bypasses in Sallins, Adamstown, Portlaoise, Shannon, Laytown and Bettystown, Garavogue, Dingle and the Athy southern distributor road.  However, not one item of money was attached to any of the projects.  It is extraordinary to get a letter in reply when the Committee of Public Accounts asks for specific information in respect of the projects under 20 headings.  The Department has not put one figure on anything.<\/p> <p>  We are sending the letter back and asking the Department to give us a proper reply with the appropriate money.  We will publish the letter but we are sending it back.

Matters covered include risk profiling in HIQA and the lease for HIQA's office in Smithfield.  We will note and publish that correspondence.<\/p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 875B, dated 7 November.  This is also from Mr. Marty Whelan of HIQA providing a note on interactions between Mr. Brian McEnery on the establishment of Letsbuyhealthcare scheme as a partner in BDO and a copy of the invitation of Nursing Homes Ireland to Mr. Brian McEnery to attend a Nursing Homes Ireland meeting on October 2015, as requested at the committee meeting on 19 October 2017.  We will note and publish that.  For the record, we discussed yesterday in private session correspondence that the committee received, namely, the note of the meeting from Eversheds to Nursing Homes Ireland.  The committee decided in private session that it will not be circulating that document and will not be referring to it in public session because the owner of that document, Nursing Homes Ireland, has claimed legal privilege.  By and large, however, the contents of that document are already in the public arena and have been well publicised.  Any discussion we will have will be in relation to the information that is already in the public arena but not in relation to that specific document.  <\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 879B, dated 7 November 2017, from Mr. Marty Whelan of HIQA providing a note on the appeals mechanism for bodies which do not accept HIQA decisions.  This is important given the issues raised by a particular nursing home discussed at our meeting two weeks ago.  HIQA also includes an explanatory note, as requested, on the role and function of the chief inspector and delegation of that function.  This is an issue to which we will return.

Given the repetitive nature of the correspondence, I propose we direct the clerk not to circulate further items on which we are copied in relation to this matter.  Documents are being supplied to this committee which are also being sent to the Taoiseach and others.  We are not being asked to do anything with those documents.  It amounts to a lot of correspondence and the issue has been raised with other people.

The matter remains <i>sub judice <\/i>and has not been progressed by the individual in question.  I propose that we send the individual a copy of the correspondence and advise him that it is up to him to progress the matter further through the legal process that has been initiated.  If the individual has initiated legal proceedings he cannot come to us and ask us to operate in parallel to such proceedings.  It is one or the other and given that the legal process is still in existence, I propose that we write to him accordingly on that matter.<\/p><p>The next item, No. 846C, is correspondence dated 25 October from Mr. Hubert Loftus of the Department of Education and Skills providing a clarification in relation to the Education and Training Board Ireland, ETBI.  The Department provides funding to the tune of &euro;168,000 to ETBI for which it has a service level agreement.  We will note that.

The replies state that no costs have been incurred in 2016 or 2017 to date.  We will note these answers.  We had a lot of discussion on this issue and I understand that a further parliamentary question has recently been replied to by the Minister for Justice and Equality.

Details are provided of breaches of the requirements and the CEO points out that there is ongoing work to formalise what had been historical relationships and to reduce the level of non-compliant expenditure in the future.  There is a detailed letter which emerged from us noting breaches of procurement rules in its annual accounts.  I will just refer to one sentence in regard to Noel Recruitment and the sum of &euro;365,000.  It was pointed out that this recruitment is not fully subject to the procurement regulations as it is an Annex II B service under the Directive 2014\/18\/ EC and an Article 74 service under the Directive 2014\/24\/EU.  It is not considered a cross-border interest and that is why it probably did not advertise it on that basis, but it anticipates that it will bring such matters into line.

We received a similar resolution from Monaghan County Council in January.  Eirgrid does not come within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts as it is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is a commercial semi-State operation.  At the time we requested a note from the Minister on the matter and forwarded the reply to Monaghan County Council.  We also wrote to the sectoral committee which I believe had an engagement with Eirgrid in May of this year.  I also understand from the clerk that that committee has received further correspondence from Monaghan County Council in the past month.  I propose that we write to Monaghan County Council and include Deputy Brendan Smith in the correspondence, enclosing copies of previous correspondence, pointing out that the sectoral committee has more latitude than the PAC in this area.

Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 854C, correspondence dated 24 October 2017 from the Rehab group, in regard to the funding of section 39 organisations to pay staff in line with public sector increases.  Rehab claims that funding has not been provided to restore pay to their employees even though the employees took the same cuts as public sector employees during the austerity years and that its ability to retain staff is affected.  This was a matter which was discussed at our recent meeting with the HSE.  That exact point was well discussed with the HSE and it is an issue for the National Treatment Purchase Fund and nursing homes as well.  The costs for some organisations are increasing but that is not being matched by an increase in funding from the State body.

An article from a magazine plus documents obtained through a freedom of information request are attached.  The individual was in contact with the committee previously and we received a note from the Department explaining the purchase process and rationale.  With the agreement of the individual, I propose that we forward this correspondence to the Department to address any further issues raised.  Just to refresh everyone's memory, this is about a school in Wicklow.  The matter came before the committee a few months ago as an issue arose with regard to the location of a new school.

I propose that we write to the group stating that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be allowed to carry out its investigation.

We are not talking about Government Departments here, rather we are talking about all the other agencies.  Of these, 60% failed to produce their financial accounts for audit within the required three-month period.  This is unacceptable and we have already indicated that the Committee of Public Accounts will not be prepared to tolerate this any longer.  Primarily these organisations have received public funding and they have not produced financial statements to account for that.<\/p><p>The job of the Committee of Public Accounts is to hold these organisations to account, and we would not be doing our job.

If we are going to change behaviour, there has to be a mechanism for doing so, and I do not think just appearing before the Committee for Public Accounts, or the risk of that, is enough, given the length of time some of these are outstanding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017110900002#H02000","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I agree with you, Chair.

Almost all public sector bodies, with the exception of third level education bodies and one or two others, are on a calendar year basis.  What we face, therefore, is a very highly peaked demand for work.  There are a number of strategies that we try to follow to deal with that peak.  One of the things we would like to do more of is audit testing in-year.  It is called interim audit testing.  That works quite well with the HSE, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and so on, that is, larger entities with bigger budgets and more transactions.  Due to the fact that there are organisations that are in arrears, it is a bit of a job to shift the emphasis to carrying out the audit after delivery of the financial statements in total.  That is one of the strategies, and it will take time to turn the ship and get into a more efficient situation.<\/p> <p>  The second thing we do is contract out a certain number of sets of financial statements for audit to private sector auditors.  They carry out the audit work and report to me.  I still issue the audit opinion, so we would have a certain amount of review.  That helps us.  It gives us additional resources at the time when the peak occurs.  Those are the kind of strategies that we need to undertake.  <\/p> <p>  Obviously, the first and most important issue for us is to get the financial statements delivered.  We have been taking a harder line in recent years whereby if the financial statements are thrown in but they are not ready for the audit, we discount that.  We do not regard that as having been received.  They have to be ready for audit when they submit the financial statements, and then we try to schedule as optimally as possible.  Realistically, however, without an enormous increase in the resource level, we could not have all the financial statements audited within, say, the first half of the year.  That just would not be possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017110900002#H02200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":124,"content":"<p>Chair-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017110900002#H02300","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510218000,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Can I just finish the point?   When we do our scheduling, we do it on the basis that the financial statements as presented are correct, and that our work will effectively be focused on validating that, and checking that what they have presented is correct.  The difficulty we run into is when there are errors in the financial statements, or particularly if there are propriety matters or report matters that cause a concern.  The process then gets slowed down.  In that situation, we have carried out the audit but it takes a long time to get follow-up explanations.  It is difficult for us to do it right in a very narrow timeframe.  We take a very wide view of the business of an organisation.<\/p><p>We consider propriety issues that may not be considered to the same degree by a private sector auditor doing standard financial statements and the question arises of whether the financial statements were correct.  That creates a complication for us, slows the process and knocks out other schedules, for instance, if we are scheduled to do an audit and find they are not ready we may not have anybody else lined up immediately.  It takes a week or so and we lose time.  There are many aspects to this.  We try to assist and to be as helpful as possible but if somebody misses their slot, for whatever reason, we cannot necessarily go back and do it.  We also cannot walk away from a client.

Mr. O'Brien said that in respect of every organisation, and there are hundreds of them, that get a grant from the HSE in excess of &euro;150,000, it is in receipt of 100% of the 2015 accounts, completed.  It is well over 70% of the way through the 2016 accounts and we are not near the end of the year.  He did not threaten to cut their funding but to delay it until such time as they got their accounts in.  That resulted in 100% compliance by the sections 38 and 39 organisations.  That has not happened in any other section.  There is a great lesson to be learned from how the HSE did it, without any statutory authority, just a straight business approach, if they delayed sending in accounts it would delay sending out next year's cheques.  It brought them all to heel.  That is remarkable.  I asked him if he could second some of the staff who achieved that to another Department.  We had a good laugh at the end of it.  I am not saying we should go that far but the HSE is one third of the public service.  It has achieved this as a result of the pressure from what goes on here.  We can actually achieve something.  The first step is to get the audited accounts in.  We do our job and we put the pressure on others to do their job.<\/p> <p>  The work programme for today is to meet the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment.  Next week we will meet the Department of Education and Skills, Solas, City of Dublin Education and Training Board, ETB, Kilkenny and Carlow ETB, Kildare and Wicklow ETB and Tipperary ETB.  That is four ETBs.

That is part of its role, and perhaps it takes up most of our time, but a significant part of the role of the Committee of Public Accounts is to look at the income side of things, including revenue collection and taxation receipts.  In this case the Comptroller and Auditor General has produced a specific chapter on the corporation tax receipts, and we will deal with that specifically.  <\/p><p> Everyone who has written about this issue has mentioned the volatility of corporation tax receipts and the risk to the Exchequer and public services by heavy reliance for a large proportion of that tax - some 75% - on the multinational sector.  In addition to that, I believe that ten Irish companies are paying a very high proportion of that corporation tax; perhaps as high as 36%.  It is a risky business and an issue we need to examine.  We will be examining the Revenue Commissioners on that issue, but it is important for the Committee of Public Accounts and the public at large to hear from the Revenue on one side and the multinational companies on the other, including their understanding of how the taxation system works in Ireland.  There has been much discussion on this matter, and because corporation tax is a specific chapter we need to examine the interactions between the multinational sector and the State on tax receipts.  We will not be able to look at information other than what has been published.  These companies are all listed on the stock exchange.  However, I believe we should invite some of these major companies in to assist us.  I have looked at the situation and had the Oireachtas Library and Research Service prepare a paper for me in the last couple of weeks on corporation tax receipts.  The main areas concerned are the financial-insurance sector, the IT sector and the manufacturing sector.  I am proposing that we write to these companies.  It is likely to be early in the new year before they are able to avail of the opportunity to come in.  We will ask those parties to send the person who is most equipped to deal with taxation issues and with the Exchequer.  We will ask these companies to provide assistance to us.  These companies, and many similar companies, have attended in Westminster and the House of Representatives.  They all have a big footprint in Ireland, and they should show the same respect to our Parliament as they have shown to other national parliaments.  <\/p><p> I have had a look at some of the biggest players.  If any of the members of the committee notes that a major player has been left out we will discuss it.  I am proposing that from the finance sector we invite JP Morgan and CitiBank, from the IT sector we invite Apple and Google, and from the pharmaceutical and medical devices sector we invite GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer.  They are six big companies, and it would help our understanding of how the system operates enormously.  We will draft a suitably worded letter of invitation.  It is a voluntary attendance of course, but when we worked on Project Eagle companies such as Lazard from outside the State came to the committee to assist us in our work.  Hopefully these organisations will show the same respect to the Irish national parliament as they have shown to other national parliaments.  I would like to get this in motion.  No letter will issue until we clear the content.  It is slightly unusual, so we have to frame it in a proper way.

It is a caveat to this.<\/p> <p>  Much of this focusses on alleged loopholes that these companies were operating to avoid paying tax.  This is all legal and above board, but the companies were allowed to use structures to reduce their tax liability.

Can we get a briefing for the members of this committee on what the lie of the land and the tax code was before the changes?  There were changes made in 2013 and 2015.  Perhaps that is contained in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, but I doubt all of it is.  It would be useful to have as much information as possible available to us to prepare for those meetings.

This was distributed across six expenditure programmes, including a new programme in 2016 reflecting the additional responsibility for environment policy transferred to the Department as part of the restructuring of portfolios following Government formation.  As part of that transfer, the Department also took on responsibility for management of the environment fund, which had a budget of around &euro;35 million for 2016.<\/p> <p>  The expenditure under the Vote was divided between the various programmes is as follows.  The largest expenditure programme - accounting for &euro;241 million, or more than half of the total spent &ndash; related to broadcasting.  That programme was substantially funded by television licence fee receipts, which totalled just under &euro;214 million in 2016.  Most of the expenditure under the programme was in the form of grants of just over &euro;179 million paid to RT&Eacute;, and &euro;35.4 million to Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge.  &euro;13.7 million was paid into the broadcasting fund, and &euro;11.5 million was paid to An Post in respect of its costs of collecting the broadcasting licence fees on behalf of the Department.<\/p> <p>  The Department spent &euro;86 million on the energy programme in 2016, &euro;66 million of which was committed for energy efficiency programmes promoted by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The Department spent just over &euro;43 million on the environment and waste management programme in 2016.  More than half of the programme spending in 2016 was to support the operations of the Environmental Protection Agency.  In addition, the Department had a budget under the environment fund in 2016 of around &euro;35 million for environmental projects and initiatives.  That expenditure is accounted for separately.<\/p> <p>  The voted provision for the communications programme in 2016 was &euro;34.7 million, but the expenditure outturn was just over &euro;19 million, an underspend of &euro;15.7 million, or 45%.  Almost three quarters of this arose because of unexpected delays in the procurement process for the roll-out of national broadband.<\/p> <p>  The Department spent just over &euro;30 million under the inland fisheries programme, mainly in grant support for Inland Fisheries Ireland and the North-South Loughs Agency.  Spending on this programme was over &euro;2 million higher than originally provided, mainly due to additional funding provided for the fit-out of a new national warehouse and the purchase of new equipment for Inland Fisheries Ireland.  The Department spent almost &euro;20 million on a range of services covered by the natural resources programme.  About half of the expenditure related to the specialist functions and services of the Geological Survey of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The net expenditure on the Vote was around &euro;32 million less than was provided for in the 2016 Estimate.  The Department got the agreement of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to carry over &euro;12 million in unspent capital funding to 2017.  The balance of the surplus of &euro;20 million was due for surrender.<\/p> <p>  This brief outline of the Vote expenditure indicates that the Department oversees and funds a broad range of public sector bodies.  It also has responsibility for oversight of a number of major commercial State bodies that do not receive ongoing grant funding.

I will introduce them now: Orla Ryan, principal officer; Triona Quill, principal officer; Brian Walsh, assistant principal; and Frank Groome, assistant principal.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned at the outset, our Department has changed in formation since the last time I appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts.  We are now the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, whereas the last time I appeared here we were the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  I ask the committee not to be fooled by the name change because the Department obviously still holds the energy and natural resources functions.  Our remit, then, expands significantly beyond functions relating to communications, broadcasting, postal, energy, natural resources and inland fisheries to encompass responsibility for the areas of climate change, waste management, resource efficiency, air quality and environmental policy.  These new structures have been in place since May 2016.<\/p> <p>  The Department made significant progress in 2016 on a range of commitments set out in the programme for Government and in the Department&rsquo;s statement of strategy 2016-19.  Total gross expenditure under the Vote in 2016 amounted to just under &euro;439 million, some &euro;42 million or 8.7% below the budgetary allocation of &euro;481 million.  The underspend related primarily to lower than expected expenditure on the national broadband plan, energy research projects and the demand-led sustainable energy schemes, the delayed commencement of landfill remediation projects and reduced broadcasting expenditure due to lower than forecast TV licence receipts. <\/p> <p>  I will set out briefly the key strategic priorities supported from the Vote in 2016.   Delivering a &ldquo;connected&rdquo; economy and society where every citizen, company and community can realise the full social and economic potential of the digital world is a policy priority.  Some &euro;14 million was spent on communications, multimedia developments and the information society.  The Department continued to progress the procurement process under the national broadband plan.  The plan has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector so that to date approximately 1.5 million or 65% of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland can get access to high-speed broadband and this footprint is expanding.  By 2020, through a combination of commercial investment and State intervention, about nine out of ten premises in Ireland will have access to high-speed broadband.<\/p> <p>  The Department continued to support digital entrepreneurship and to promote engagement by small businesses with the digital economy.  To date, some 4,000 businesses have been awarded grant assistance under the Department&rsquo;s trading online voucher scheme, while 9,000 businesses have benefitted from advice and peer-to-peer support under the scheme.  A new digital skills for citizens scheme was launched in 2016 under which community and voluntary organisations will provide 25,000 people annually with ten hours of free digital skills training. <\/p> <p>  Expenditure in 2016 in the broadcasting area amounted to almost &euro;240 million.  Of this, some &euro;179 million was paid in grant aid to RT&Eacute; in respect of revenue from the sale of television licences.  Exchequer funding of &euro;26.1 million and TV licence fee funding of &euro;9.3 million was provided to TG4 to deliver on programme commitments.  Licence fee funding of &euro;13.65 million was provided to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to support the audio and audiovisual media sector in the production of new television and radio programmes on Irish culture, heritage and experience, as well as programmes in the Irish language.<\/p> <p>  Some &euro;80 million in Exchequer funding was spent in the energy area in 2016.  Using less energy, and using it more efficiently, is the most cost-effective and accessible way for us all to take action on climate change.  Expenditure of just under &euro;58 million under the better energy programme, which is delivered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, supported energy efficiency upgrades to approximately 25,000 homes and 385 community and commercial buildings in the drive to reduce CO2 emissions. <\/p> <p>  The warmth and well-being pilot scheme to provide deep energy efficiency upgrades to people suffering from acute respiratory conditions who live in poor quality homes has grown from a base of 72 home completions following its launch last year to approximately 400 this year.  To date, Government investment in energy efficiency has supported the upgrade of more than 350,000 homes, or one in every five homes in the country. <\/p> <p>  The purchase of more than 600 new electric vehicles was grant-aided in 2016.  This will need to increase significantly in the coming years and the decisions taken in this year&rsquo;s budget and Estimates will allow us to ramp up support for low-emissions vehicles.  Renewable transport, renewable heat and renewable electricity generation all must significantly increase over the coming years as we move progressively towards the national objective of a competitive, low-carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050. <\/p> <p>  Some &euro;9.8 million was spent on various geoscience projects, including INFOMAR, the national seabed mapping project, and the Tellus programme, which is updating the State&rsquo;s geological mapping data sets.  <\/p> <p>  Just over &euro;29 million was paid to meet the administration and operational costs of Inland Fisheries Ireland, and the Loughs Agency in 2016.  This funding enabled Inland Fisheries Ireland to undertake some 188,000 patrol hours and 36,000 inspections.  The Department provided &euro;24.9 million to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, in 2016 to support the delivery of its core functions.  In the area of waste management, funding of &euro;7.8 million was made available to local authorities in respect of landfill remediation projects. <\/p> <p>  In conclusion, the Department continued during 2016 to oversee and implement a wide range of policies and programmes which have a significant strategic national importance and which are essential to our national economic and sustainable development.   I look forward to assisting committee members with any questions they may have today. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017110900002#M01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Griffin.

Perhaps Mr. Griffin could clarify some things for me here on this remediation.  The Estimate provision was substantial but the outturn was much less.  There is also a note here stating the reason for the delay.  The report also refers to a consultant's report.  Can Mr. Griffin explain that to me?  There was a delay because of a consultant's report and there was a delay because of complexity.  How many remediation projects are we talking about in total?  How many of those were delayed?  I would appreciate it if Mr. Griffin could just give me the answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017110900002#M01900","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510218000,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I will be guided by Deputy Connolly herself in this regard.<\/p><p>When one focuses on 2016, one gets one part of the picture.  When one broadens it out, one gets a different perspective.  I will be guided by the Deputy in terms of the amount of information she wants.<\/p><p> There was an underspend of approximately 41% in 2016 in the context of the amount we had expected to expend.  When one looks at the nature of the beast with which one is dealing - Deputy Catherine Murphy will be very familiar with this regarding Kerdiffstown - one realises that these are very complex projects.  They require statutory consent before proceeding.  They must meet the relevant procurement rules.  They may also involve complex legal cases and that is the case in terms of a number of them.  There is a need for a technical assessment to be undertaken on each project that we are proposing to fund in order to ensure that we understand: the nature of the problem and the options available; that stakeholder engagement has taken place; that funding is available; and the position on the scope of works we are proposing to fund.<\/p><p> Looking at 2016 specifically, there were six projects that we had proposed to fund to a greater extent than actually occurred in 2016.  The first was Kerdiffstown in County Kildare.  The delay there arose because of time taken to prepare the planning application, the EIA and the waste licence application.  Fingal Harriers in Timoole, County Meath, was the subject of ongoing legal action.  Stackallan in Slane, County Meath, was the subject of ongoing negotiations between the site liquidator and Meath County Council.  The progress anticipated in respect of Portlaw Cotton Mill in County Waterford was not made.  The site is in private ownership and it has a complex character involving environmental, heritage and social interests.  The final one that did not progress to the extent that the local authorities and ourselves expected was that relating to Shannon Vermicomposting.<\/p><p> One can see that there are delays.  From our perspective, we want this to happen as quickly as possible in terms of the remediation action that is required because this has very significant impacts on the local communities, significant impacts on the environment and potential significant impacts on watercourses.  As I said, if one takes 2016 in isolation, we would not be satisfied with the level of progress made.  However, there are justifiable reasons why matters did not progress in the way we had foreseen.<\/p><p> The picture is probably a lot better when one looks at it in its broadest sense.  If one goes back to the genesis of this, which is a European Court of Justice case in 2012 whereby the court found against Ireland in respect of systemic problems with aspects of our waste system, including the extent of legacy local authority dumps and illegal landfills in particular.  A commitment given by the Government at the time to the effect that a programme of measures would be put in place.  One of those measures would be to provide funding for the remediation of these landfills.  Of the 58 to which that case related, I would say that in excess of 40 have now been completed.  We are left with a number that have yet to be addressed, albeit some of them quite complex.<\/p><p> In the context of the six that we have identified, we would expect that progress will have been made during the course of this year.  Money has been provided in the Vote for that and, indeed, we have provided money into 2018 to continue the programme of works.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017110900002#M02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":210,"content":"<p>There are 58 legacy sites.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017110900002#N00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510218000,"counter":211,"content":"<p>There were approximately 50 at that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017110900002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":212,"content":"<p>At that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017110900002#N00400","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510218000,"counter":213,"content":"<p>That is a very important statement to make because if one looks at the work that was done in 2015 as part of the regional waste management plans, which were updated at that point, the local authorities did a further assessment in respect of whether there were additional landfills that would fall into this category.  Each of the three regional waste management plans have identified legacy landfills of high, medium or low-risk categorisation.  The ones that fall into the high-risk categorisation come to 70 or 71 - I am not sure of the exact figure.  They are spread right across the country.

The variability is one reason.  The other reason we would expect to have seen an increase is the efforts An Post has taken to tackle evasion.  There was a major advertising campaign and an increase in recruitment of temporary inspectors.  Another factor we would have programmed in during 2015 when we were doing the Estimate was the expectation that legislation would have been introduced in 2016 to allow the Minister hire procurement agents.  We saw what happened in the UK when it outsourced its collection of TV licences: the evasion rate went from approximately 13% to 7%.  A number of things were factored in that we expected would have had an effect.  One can add to that the economic growth that was expected during 2016.

That has been agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We have asked each Department to appoint an officer at senior level, generally someone at assistant secretary level, to be an energy advocate within his or her Department or agency.

If one looks at the national mitigation plan that was published during the year, we have listed 60 measures that are under way which will have a very significant impact on our emissions profile in the State.  We have an emissions trading scheme in place.  We have a carbon tax in place and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, has committed to reviewing it next year before the next budget is announced.  We have renewable electricity support schemes.  We have financial supports available through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland which I have mentioned for energy efficiency improvements.  There is a lot of investment in the social housing programme in energy efficiency upgrades.  We support large industries with expert advice on what they can do on their own energy efficiency programmes.  There is investment in public transport, a smarter travel initiative and a biofuels obligation scheme.<\/p> <p>  That is just what is under way.  If one looks at what is planned, it includes a new renewable electricity support scheme, a new renewable heat incentive, smart metering, further incentives for low emission vehicles and further investment in public transport.  There is an array of things that are happening right across the system.  If I had a blank cheque, I would spend a lot more on climate action, but I do not.  Like every Department, we have to compete for funding with health, justice, education and water services.  We are comfortable that the strategic approach being taken to addressing this issue is sound.  I mentioned the national mitigation plan.  We are doing work in the national adaptation framework and expect to see a substantial and visible ramping up of activity to tackle climate action in the next couple of years.<\/p> <p>  The other thing I did not mention, one linked with the work of the Citizens' Assembly, is the fact that we have established a national dialogue on climate action to try to have engagement with the public to effect behavioural change across the State on the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017110900002#P00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":325,"content":"<p>People are way ahead of us on this issue.

It is important that I do because I do not want people to be under the impression that things have not been happening in the past few years.  In 2012 some 700,000 properties were connected to high speed broadband.  By April 2016 the figure had increased to 1.2 million or 52% of premises.  In September 2017, 1.5 million or 65% of premises had access to high speed broadband.  By the end of next year the figure will be 1.8 million or 77% of premises and by the end of 2020 it will be 2.1 million or 90% premises.  A huge amount is happening and what one is seeing is a significant ramping up by the commercial sector.  We had eir 300,000, which was launched in April this year and on which the Minister signed a commitment agreement.  We had SIRO, which agreed to invest &euro;450 million in 51 towns, providing 500 connections across the State.  Virgin Media has agreed to extend its footprint, while enet decided to invest &euro;100 million in 115,000 premises in nine locations in the west and north west. <\/p> <p>  I have heard Deputies across the House refer to the national broadband plan as the next rural electrification scheme.  Back in 1927 those involved in the rural electrification scheme did not have to deal with public procurement procedures.  If they did, it might have been delayed a lot longer and some of us might still be in the dark.  The reality is that we have to comply fully with public procurement procedures.  I would much prefer to have a process that was robust and that stood up to scrutiny should any party involved in the procurement process decide to take the State to court by way of a judicial review at the end of it.<\/p> <p>  We actually put the project out to tender in December 2015.  After the first phase, the pre-qualification questionnaire, we had five consortia, comprising 32 companies.  All of them had to be evaluated.  We had to enter into detailed dialogue with the companies that were still part of the process.  We are talking about a contract that runs to about 1,500 pages.  It is a very complex procurement process.  While I understand the frustration, I would be much more comfortable in having a robust procurement process over which the Minister, the Department and I could stand at the end, having delivered a preferred tender or tenderer in a position to hit the ground running to deliver high speed broadband to the 542,000 properties without high speed broadband.<\/p><p>There was also an intention to establish a mobile phone and broadband task force - a clear commitment of the Minister when he came into government - and that has taken place.  It has done a lot of work on the intermediate steps that could be put in place to remedy some of these inefficiencies, especially around mobile phone signal issues across the State.  The Minister has optioned the additional spectrum at 3.6 GHz, which will provide spectrum to private sector companies to roll out broadband.

We have to get it up to a certain standard before we can go back fishing again.  I have asked the Minister on several occasions about the buy-out scheme that was in place approximately ten years ago for various forms of fishing, including rod fishing and the traditional forms of fishing like snap-net, draft-net and drift-net fishing that are found in my locality.  All of these fishermen have been off the river for the past three, four or five years.  Some of them have been off the river for longer.  Many people were able to make a partial living out of fishing when they were in their 30s and 40s.  They made a lot of money out of salmon when they were plentiful.  Small farmers and people living in labour were able to use this activity as a back-up.  Could another buy-out scheme be considered?  Many of these people are getting old now.

We had a target to achieve a reduction of 20% in emissions by 2020.  That was one of the highest targets in the European Union when it was established in 2009.  The simple fact is that we had a decade of lost investment.  We wanted to do certain things, whether it be renewable energy or energy efficiency projects, that we simply were not able to do because the money was not available.  That is the context in which we have to discuss the issue.  Based on the most recent estimates which the CPA will update in April 2018, we will hit a figure between 4% and 6% of the 20% target.  That leaves quite a distance to reach the target.  There are mechanisms in the European Union which allow us to buy carbon credits at a price.  However, we do not know the price or the quantum of credits we will need to buy.  <\/p> <p>  There is an acknowledgement by the European Commission of the \"lack of realism\" - I cannot come up with a better way to describe it at this stage - in the target set for Ireland in 2009.  It was reflected in the approach the Commission had decided to take in setting the starting point for member states in progressing towards the 2030 target, average emissions between 2016 and 2018.  In the Department we are working to assess the various scenarios in terms of the potential cost to the Exchequer, if we must pay.  I would not use the term \"fines\" because that would require the Commission to issue infringement proceedings against a member state.  There are statistical transfer mechanisms in place which will allow us buy allowances.  We have acquired allowances in the past few years that will be offset any cost that will arise.  <\/p> <p>  I covered the level of ambition in the Department.  I only focused on the Department, but one would also need to look at the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Housing, Planning and Local Government in terms of the work being done on the built environment and the housing stock.

I will begin by referring to RT&Eacute;, although the issue was discussed earlier.<\/p> <p>  Many like to bash the State broadcaster.  On various discussion programmes one will hear contributors refer to the headline figures for presenters' pay and so forth.  That seems to be the popular thing to do, but I do not subscribe to it at all.  If we value the national broadcaster, we need to foster it at a time when the traditional media are under immense attack.  As politicians, we should be conscious that this issue goes to the very heart of our democracy.  In a functioning democracy an integral element is a functioning independent journalistic system.  To use a phrase that has made its way into the dictionary, thanks to the man in the office in America, we now live in the age of fake news.  We should, therefore, value and foster the traditional media outlets at a time when they are coming under increasing attack.  Do we value high quality journalism?  Do we value the special \"Prime Time\" report last week, about which Members spoke this week?  It takes investment to commission such a report from respected journalists.  When people castigate RT&Eacute; for not being successful in bidding for major international sports events, they forget that it is competing on a global scale and that takes money.  When we look at the Comptroller and Auditor General's assessment of the Appropriation Accounts, it comes down to factors such as the television licence fee evasion rate and the intense digital competition.  I fear for the State broadcasting service.  RT&Eacute; has had to make staff cuts this year.  It has sold land to try to tide itself over, but this can be done only once.  Does the Secretary General share my fear for RT&Eacute; because of the pressures it is operating under?  I know that there was a discussion earlier about service level agreements and so forth, but RT&Eacute;'s public service obligations are immense and it must cover items that are not mainstream.  We should try to bring balance to our discussion.  Has the Secretary General undertaken an analysis of things that could be done to help the State broadcaster?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017110900002#X00500","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510218000,"counter":701,"content":"<p>I am glad that the Deputy raised that issue, as I unequivocally share his concerns.  There has been a reduction in the TV licence fee income and commercial revenues in the past few years.  Since 2008 RT&Eacute; is down &euro;85 million in commercial revenues.  This is having a real and direct effect.  If one looks at the capacity of RT&Eacute; to invest in independent productions, in 2007, when the economy was its peak, it was spending &euro;79 million in that sector.  In 2016 it spent &euro;40 million.  The inability to invest in the sector is costing jobs across the State.  In fact, it is affecting the quality of what viewers see on RT&Eacute;, the ability of the company to produce high quality output and media content.  In the Department we have a real concern about the future funding of the company.  If I was to be brutally honest, I would say the TV licence fee model was broken and I am not sure whether it can be fixed.  The level of evasion is 14.6% and we are losing &euro;40 million per annum.  That affects not only RT&Eacute; but also the broadcasting fund, from which good works, both audio and audio-visual, are commissioned.  There has been a major reduction in the capacity of the fund to deliver such programmes.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has asked the Oireachtas joint committee to look at the funding of public sector broadcasting and it has done a body of work in the past few months.  We expect to see its report in the next few weeks.  The Minister will bring it to the Government with proposals as to how the issue can be dealt it.  We need to take a serious look at how we approach the funding of public sector broadcasting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017110900002#X00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":702,"content":"<p>The Secretary General has stated the TV licence fee model to fund broadcasting is broken.  The figures back that up.  The licence fee has remained the same at &euro;160 since 2008.  Population and household numbers have risen, but RT&Eacute;'s TV licence fee income has fallen by more than 10%.<\/p><p>Along with that, the figure for uncollected tax on TV sets exceeds RT&Eacute;'s annual losses.  Mr. Colm McCarthy produced a piece on this earlier in the year in which he used similar language in speaking about the \"broken\" model, saying it was not fit for purpose, given the proliferation of media on which one could access content.  What are the potential replacement models?  A doubling of the licence fee has been looked at, but commercial revenue has also dropped this year and which has been attributed to the impact of Brexit.  I have been talking to advertising executives and believe viewing patterns are also changing.  People go home in the evening and watch Netflix.  They are not even watching mainstream media.  Advertising executives realise that their spot at 9.15 p.m., during the break in the RT&Eacute; news programme, is not as valuable as it once was.  As a consequence, they are going to lower the amount they spend and it becomes a race to the bottom.  The commercial side could also end up being banjaxed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017110900002#X00700","speaker":"1218","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510218000,"counter":704,"content":"<p>Totally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017110900002#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":705,"content":"<p>How are we going to fix this?

The postcode system is being used by the HSE National Ambulance Service very effectively.  The Central Statistics Office is using the system for its residential property price index.  The National Transport Authority has included the system in its journey planner.  It may be of interest to Deputy Cullinane to note that Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council has incorporated Eircode into the online customer management system.  The HSE has incorporated it into its primary care reimbursement service and patient care administration system.  We are seeing several large logistics companies using it, including CityPOST, DHL and Niteline.  The Property Registration Authority is using the system, as is Ordnance Survey Ireland.  We have statistics available to suggest that 7,500 active courier delivery drivers used the Eircode app during October.  That app has been used 600,000 times since its launch in May 2016.  We are seeing the system used far more in retail and e-commerce.  A recent Government decision held that all public authorities that are upgrading systems in which there is an address field are to use Eircode.  I will add to what I said earlier about the National Ambulance Service.  The service is upgrading its fleet.  The new fleet will have satnav included and Eircode will be built into the technology.<\/p> <p>  I am satisfied that we have made considerable progress.

It is &euro;1 a day and &euro;7 a week for a person in receipt of social welfare payments.  I used to travel through towns years ago and practically every house had a wheelie bin.  They are a rarity in some communities now because of the cost.  All the talk the Department engages in on waste management and everything it measures relates only to what is collected through the system.  I maintain, however, and my own instinct is, that at least 50% of houses are not even being counted or considered because they cannot afford a wheelie bin for recycling or whatever.

I am sorry I was not in a position to provide the level of detail required by the Chairman and Deputy Cullinane this morning.  If one looks at what is required by a service level agreement, a great deal of it is covered by the Broadcasting Act 2009.  The Act sets out the public service objects of the public service broadcasters, which are RT&Eacute; and TG4.  RT&Eacute; and TG4 must provide public service statements, statements of strategy and annual statements of performance commitments.  Annual reviews are carried out by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and presented to the Minister.  There is a five-year review on the adequacy of funding.  As I said earlier, the accounts are independently audited, published by the organisations and go before the Government and so on.  We obtained legal advice at a point in time - I will need to check when - and it said that a service level agreement was not appropriate given the comprehensive provisions governing strategy objects in the Broadcasting Act and, separately, the fact that RT&Eacute; and TG4 are independent in their functions.  I also note that, in accordance with the 2016 code of governance, we will be putting in place an oversight agreement between the Department and RT&Eacute; before the end of the year.  It is also the case, of course, that RT&Eacute; reports to the relevant joint committee on a regular basis on a whole range of issues.  On the point Deputy Cullinane raised, presenters' fees account for 1% of overall company costs.  I will set this out in a more structured way in a response to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017110900002#OO03300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":991,"content":"<p>The only thing I want to concentrate on now is the oversight agreement the Secretary General has just mentioned.

I mentioned earlier that he has given RT&Eacute; &euro;8 million to do a class of a digital switchover, which will allow it to get out of using some of the spectrum that is used for television broadcasting and free that up for mobile phones.

A number of pilot local authorities, including the Chairman's local authority in County Laois, are under way to see where are the blackspots.

I will set an example and turn mine off.<\/p><p>On behalf of all the members of the committee, I very much welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Helen McEntee, and her officials from the Department back to the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  Since taking up her role, the Minister of State has been very busy between Council meetings and engagements in other member states, certainly a very strong start to her Ministry.  On behalf of the members, I thank her for the invitation to the launch of the Government's programme of engagements on the future of Europe.  As she knows, this committee has undertaken in a very detailed way its own work in this regard, which will continue, but we are interested in seeing this discussion broadened to include as many citizens as possible.  That is exactly what our colleague from France is doing.  It is part of our task in Ireland to see where the French can go in this regard.  I am sure all members of the committee will be interested in the work the Minister of State has been doing on her plans for the future of Europe debate on recent and future developments in the General Affairs Council and the European Council and her impressions of how the Brexit negotiations are going.<\/p><p>Before we begin with the Minister of State's opening statement, I must remind everyone of the rules of privilege in this Parliament.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege.  However, this does not apply because the Minister of State has full privilege as a Member of the House, so I do not need to continue reading the notice.  I now ask the Minister of State to make her opening statement.  Again, I personally welcome her here and congratulate her on the work she is doing.  I know she has made a very big impression throughout the European countries.  I think she has visited most of the 28 member states.  I know she continues to meet her colleague Ministers throughout Europe.  She is in a most crucial position in the Brexit discussions and negotiations, so we look forward to hearing her statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017110900002#A00200","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1510236000,"counter":1129,"content":"<p>I thank the Vice Chairman and Senator.  I have not quite made it to all the member states yet but I hope to achieve that sooner rather than later.  I thank the committee for the invitation to be before it again.  I welcome Ms Gomez-Bassac and her team from France as well.  We look forward to engaging with them while they are in Ireland.  With the Vice Chairman's permission, I will probably speak for about 15 minutes, which is perhaps a little longer than normal, but normally we outline past work, whereas I wish to outline what we are planning on doing in the future as well, particularly regarding the future of Europe debate.<\/p> <p>  I am very pleased to be back before the committee.  This is the second time I have had the pleasure of engaging with the committee since I was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs in June.  I look forward to updating the committee on some of the key developments within my area of responsibility and answering any questions members of the committee might have.  With the Vice Chairman's agreement, I will take about 15 minutes to cover the specific areas of the future of Europe and October's European Council and then give the committee a summary of the General Affairs Councils in September and October along with developments in the ever-discussed Brexit.  I am happy to take questions afterwards.<\/p> <p>  Next week the Taoiseach and I, together with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, will formally launch the Citizens' Dialogue on the Future of Europe at the Science Gallery in Trinity College Dublin.  This will mark the formal start of a process designed to engage the Irish public directly in a debate on the kind of Europe it wants to see evolve.  Our aim is to raise awareness of the issues involved, to encourage participation in the debate and to use this engagement process to formulate Ireland's contribution to the wider European debate.  Before I go any further, I wish to acknowledge the committee's own work in this regard and the leadership role the committee has shown in launching its own public consultation process on the future of Europe.  I know the committee has already heard from a number of interest groups, including the National Youth Council of Ireland, Macra na Feirme, IBEC and European Movement Ireland.  I know too that the French ambassador to Ireland made a presentation to the committee, and I would be very interested to know in due course what the committee's findings are in this regard.<\/p> <p>  As the debate on Europe's future post-Brexit gains momentum, it is extremely important that Ireland's position is informed and supported by the views and interests of our citizens.  The Government's starting point is to focus on the needs of our own people.  This includes a focus on jobs and growth, opportunities for our young people, completion of the Single Market and the key role of the EU in meeting many of the key challenges that will face us, including climate change and violent extremism.<\/p><p>Later this month, the Taoiseach will represent Ireland at the EU social summit in Sweden and I will attend with him.  It will be an opportunity to ensure there is a social dimension to the wider future of Europe debate.  To date, the debate on the future of Europe has been informed by inputs from a variety of sources.  In March, the European Commission published a White Paper and followed it up with a series of reflection papers on important policy areas including globalisation, EU finances and defence.  These papers are for the most part cross-cutting in nature and are being examined across a number of Departments.<\/p><p> At last month&rsquo;s European Council, President Donald Tusk formally launched his leaders&rsquo; agenda.  What he is proposing is an ambitious work programme for the next two years.  His intention is to maintain unity among the 27 member states by facilitating a more dynamic process, restoring ownership to the European Council and seeking to find pragmatic ways forward.  He is proposing that future discussions be around a set of decision papers on issues on which there has been no agreement as yet.  The increased tempo would see discussions at scheduled meetings of the European Council as well as a number of additional informal summits.  President Tusk&rsquo;s approach should ensure an inclusive approach, building on the Bratislava process and ensuring the initiative is not left to others to set the agenda. <\/p><p> We strongly support President Tusk&rsquo;s positive forward-looking agenda, focused on some of the key challenges facing European, including Irish, citizens.  We are cautious about any element of the agenda that focusses on institutional change, for example a eurozone budget or eurozone parliament, and would not support reform that required treaty change.  <\/p><p> As EU members of 44 years standing we have amassed considerable knowledge and experience and it is only right that we should share our insights and assessments throughout the process.  If any members have questions on the launch next week and what will be entailed in it, I am happy to answer.  <\/p><p> I will now turn to last month&rsquo;s European Council meeting, which I attended with the Taoiseach.  The main agenda items were migration, security and defence, digital Europe and external relations with a focus on Turkey.  The Taoiseach made a comprehensive statement to the D&aacute;il so I do not propose to go into them in great detail now but I will touch on a few of the key issues I addressed. <\/p><p> EU leaders agreed their comprehensive migration strategy was bringing results and should be consolidated.  At the same time they highlighted the need for vigilance on all migration routes and readiness to react to any new trends or developments.  The Taoiseach raised the distressing human rights reports from M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res on the reception facilities in Libya.  He also spoke about the question of support for Africa more generally and what needs to be done to remove the root causes of migration.  At the meeting, he confirmed Ireland will double its commitment to the EU Trust Fund for Africa up to 2020, taking it from &euro;3 million to &euro;6 million, which was received well and is a positive move forward.  <\/p><p> On digital Europe, leaders examined how the EU could seize the opportunities and address the challenges posed by digitalisation.  They agreed on a series of priorities to build a successful digital Europe including bringing governments and public sectors fully into the digital age and completing the digital single market strategy by the end of 2018.  As members will know, completion of the digital Single Market is a Government priority.  The language agreed for the European Council conclusions was substantially proposed by Ireland and a group of like-minded countries.  The conclusions included a high level of ambition for completing the digital Single Market, including the free flow of data and agreeing a future-oriented regulatory framework.  There was a good exchange on the issue of taxation of digital companies.  The Taoiseach emphasised that in a globalised world, a solution on tax must be global in nature and this is reflected in the conclusions that were adopted.  He insisted that the OECD is the best forum for dealing with this. <\/p><p> On security and defence, given the challenges the EU faces both from external threats and home-grown terrorism, there is an increasing focus within the EU on security and defence issues.  Most of our partners want to press ahead with permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, and this is provided for in the treaties.  Ireland has been taking a realistic and constructive approach to the discussions on PESCO and we hope to be able to participate in it in a way that respects our long-standing policy of neutrality and constitutional guarantees as reflected in the Lisbon Treaty protocol.  Ireland is neutral but not when it comes to issues such as human trafficking, terrorism or cyber-crime.  We are very much in favour of co-operating with EU partners on a range of security issues.  The Government will approach PESCO and the other issues on the agenda in that spirit.  The European Council agreed to have a fuller discussion and a progress assessment of PESCO and other security and defence issues in December.<\/p><p> On the external relations item, the Council held a very wide-ranging debate on Turkey.  Given the negative trends in Turkey on human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy, it is clear that it cannot be business as usual with Turkey.  However, our position, and that of many other member states, is that we need to keep the lines of communication open, including through the accession process and that we must be open and frank in our engagement.  <\/p><p> The European Council called on the DPRK, often referred to as North Korea, to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, stressing that lasting peace and denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula must be achieved through peaceful means.  The European Council also reaffirmed its full commitment to the Iran nuclear deal and endorsed the statement by the Foreign Affairs Council of 16 October 2017.<\/p><p> I will move on to Brexit and will brief the committee on the most recent developments, taking into account that we are looking at a new phase beginning today.  Both the General Affairs Council and the European Council met in their Article 50 formation during the month of October.  I attended both these meetings, which represented an important opportunity for all EU 27 member states to take stock of the progress made in the Article 50 negotiations to date.  At the European Council, the EU&rsquo;s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, briefed Heads of State and Government on the five negotiation rounds that had taken place from June to October.  Taking account of his assessment, the European Council welcomed progress to date but agreed further work is needed before it can agree that sufficient progress has be made on all three exit issues - citizens&rsquo; rights, the financial settlements and Irish-specific issues.  The conclusions of the European Council also called for the negotiations to continue and that it will reassess progress at its next meeting in December.  In this regard, I welcome that a sixth round of negotiations is under way in Brussels today.  The European Council asked Michel Barnier and the Council to start preparations within the EU 27 member states for phase two and that if sufficient progress is made by the UK on the three exit issues, additional guidelines will be agreed on the framework for the future relationship and on possible transitional arrangements.  Overall, the conclusions were fair and balanced.  They were clear on what the EU expects from the UK in phase one but also recognised the positive momentum created by Prime Minister, Theresa May&rsquo;s Florence speech and the EU's willingness to begin discussions on transitional arrangements and future relationship issues once there has been sufficient progress in the first phase.<\/p><p> The strong language on Ireland was also welcome.  While acknowledging that progress is being made, the conclusions made clear that more work is needed and that the UK must present and commit to flexible and imaginative solutions called for by the unique situation Ireland finds itself in.  More broadly, the support we enjoy from our EU partners on these issues also remains clear.  This is a message that I and my Government colleagues consistently receive through our continuing extensive engagement with our EU counterparts.  The visit of Guy Verhofstadt to Ireland in September was also very welcome in this regard.  I know members of the committee engaged with him also and found it very useful and informative.  <\/p><p> In the immediate term I am hopeful progress can be made in the negotiations in the coming weeks so that by the end of the year a decision can be taken by the European Council that discussions with the UK can begin on future relationship issues, including on trade and sectoral concerns.  We want to move on to this phase as soon as possible.  <\/p><p> Our overall objectives for the negotiations remain clear and have not changed.  They are to protect the gains of the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts; to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, to maintain the common travel area, which is something that is specific to Ireland and the UK; to put in place an effective transitional arrangement leading to the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK and; to work for the future of the European Union with Ireland at its heart.  <\/p><p> I will say a brief word about the September and October General Affairs Council, GAC, I attended.  As is the norm, preparation of the European Council is the main work of the GAC.  Since I have already spoken about the European Council, I will deal here only with items addressed by the GAC other than Brexit, migration, digital Europe, security and defence, and external relations.  At the September meeting all member states intervened in the discussion on the rule of law situation in Poland.  Interventions were broadly supportive of the importance of the rule of law and urged the resumption of a dialogue to try to find a reasonable solution to the difficulties there.  <\/p><p> Over lunch, Ministers discussed issues related to the composition of the European Parliament post-2019.  While there was broad agreement that at least some of the seats being lost by the UK must be eliminated, there is no agreement yet on how to go about any possible redistribution of some of them after Brexit.<\/p><p>The October General Affairs Council, GAC, dealt with the annual rule of law dialogue.  The dialogue has formed part of the agenda since 2014.  The topic - media pluralism in a digital age - was strongly influenced by the murder the previous day of a prominent journalist in Malta.  The assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia was an unspeakable attack on freedom of expression and we extend our condolences to her family and the bereaved.  The two main themes of interventions in the dialogue from member states were that more needs to be done to educate the public on matters of digital literacy so they can better identify fake news and that, in the efforts to tackle them, more needs to be done to involve the online platforms that host both fake news and illegal content.<br\/><br\/>I once again offer my apologies for speaking for so long but there was a lot of material to cover and I wanted to make sure that the Deputies and Senators were as informed as possible.  I welcome my MEP colleague.I thank the committee for the invite to attend here and I look forward to members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017110900002#A00300","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510236000,"counter":1132,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee.

We could also ask Mr. Brian Hayes MEP a few questions on these issues while he is here.  I thank the Minister of State for her contribution.  She has been very busy, obviously.  The Taoiseach has also outlined Ireland's position on many of these issues in the D&aacute;il, having regard to pre-council meetings, pre-council discussion and post-council discussion.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of Brexit, yesterday the Taoiseach informed the D&aacute;il that he was optimistic that sufficient progress will have been made by the December council meeting to allow it to move on to the next phase of the negotiations; the future relationship and the transitional arrangements.  Would the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee agree with this?  Is there any basis for that optimism?  Are we making progress on the issues of particular concern to Ireland, citizens' rights and financial settlements?  Perhaps the Minister of State could give us an insight into the Taoiseach's optimism around the December Council meeting.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the General Affairs Council, I understand that a decision will be made at its next meeting on relocation of the European Medicines Agency and the European Banking Authority.  Where stands Ireland's bids for these agencies?  I get negative vibes in the media about Ireland's bids but perhaps the Minister of State will enlighten us on that.<\/p> <p>  The Taoiseach informed the D&aacute;il yesterday that the situation in Catalonia was not discussed at the European Council meeting at all, but that the Spanish Prime Minister was asked if he would like to speak on the issue and he declined.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee was there and there was a lot of discussion.  It is a big issue facing Spain and the wider community and I wonder what the feeling is around it.  We certainly have concerns about how citizens were treated when they went out to vote.  While respecting the legalities of the situation there are concerns there and perhaps the Minister of State could comment on them. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017110900002#C00300","speaker":"1360"},{"type":"speech","time":1510236000,"counter":1134,"content":"<p>As Deputy Haughey has to go to another meeting I will ask the Minister of State to respond to his questions before we move on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017110900002#C00400","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1510236000,"counter":1135,"content":"<p>Absolutely.  I thank Deputy Haughey for raising these issues.  I will address the first question on the Taoiseach's optimism.  It is important that we are optimistic.  Obviously I cannot base his words on any specific progress that has been made since the last set of dialogues because it is only starting today.  It probably takes into account the fact that in the last set of negotiations we saw a significant amount of progress and movement, especially from Prime Minister Theresa May's Florence speech, talking about a transition period, which had not been discussed in a previous phase, and talking about ensuring that no member state is left out of pocket, which also had not been made clear in previous rounds.  There was movement in particular around Ireland and the very clear and firm commitment that there would be no border on the island of Ireland, which had not been made clear previous to that.  To see that progress has been made in all three areas we need to be optimistic that we can make further progress on those issues between now and Christmas.  Time is ticking on and we should not allow this to go on for any longer than it needs to.  At the same time I believe there is willingness from both sides.  I have been to London, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney has been to the UK.  I get a sense that there is a willingness there to work with Michel Barnier and the task force to progress to stage 2 of the negotiations.  This shows the EU 27's willingness to move to phase 2, and by beginning our own discussions on the transition period it sends a very clear message to the UK that we want to move on to phase 2, but not at any cost.  The Taoiseach is optimistic, as am I, that we can reach the significant progress by December but it has to be based on very clear actions and movement following on from today.<\/p> <p>  I shall now turn to the General Affairs Council and the European agencies.  We are still in negotiations and discussions with all the member states.  We feel that we have two very credible bids and that we have two industries that would very much be able to support the European Banking Agency and the European Medicines Agency.  Ireland has the proximity to London and the advantage of being the only English speaking country left in the EU.  We have very clear access and routes via our ports and airports through Dublin and in to surrounding areas.  We continue to engage with the EU member states in this respect and the Ministers in Health and Finance are engaging in the process as are all the other Members who are working abroad at the moment.  In less than two weeks time Ireland will have more of an idea about where it stands in both bids.<\/p> <p>  Catalonia was not raised at the European Council meeting.  It was also not raised at the General Affairs Council meeting.  I believe, however, that there is a very clear consensus from the majority of member states that Ireland is in unity with Spain on this issue.  We need to ensure there is no threat to the rule of law here.  As a Government, the Taoiseach has made it very clear that we do not accept or recognise the Catalan unilateral declaration of independence.  We do not, of course, agree with or condone any violence.  Any scenes that were seen around the time of the referendum cannot be, and should not be, condoned.  We would, however, agree that there needs to be a dialogue and further discussion around this issue.  It is not something that we, as Government, will interfere in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017110900002#C00500","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1510236000,"counter":1136,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017110900002#C00600","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1510236000,"counter":1137,"content":"<p>I thank the Vice Chairman.  I apologise for missing the beginning of the Minister of State's opening address as we had a vote in the Seanad that I could not miss.  I am sure it was vitally important.<\/p> <p>  There are four areas I wish to discuss, and I will be as brief as possible.  I want to get a bit more detail on the issues already raised by the Minister of State.  With regard to the future of Europe, I very much welcome the initiative being led by the Taoiseach and the Minister of State.  I look forward to attending the event next week in Trinity College Dublin.  We in Ireland have had quite a lot of experience around citizens' dialogues.  We did a lot of it during our last rotating presidency of the European Council, and since then.  I look forward to that experience.  I wish to repeat comments that I made to the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, in the Seanad when we debated the future of the EU some weeks ago.  It was a really good debate, even if some contributors missed the idea that it was a discussion on the future of the EU and a debate on the white paper; others just used it to talk about various other issues.  During that debate I stressed the need for a really strong detailed speech from the Taoiseach to lay out Ireland's vision for the future of Europe, similar to the speech given by President Junker or President Macron.  I repeat that call now.  I am aware that we may be going through this process but there is a huge opportunity for Ireland to lay out an alternative vision for the future Europe that is not necessarily dominated by an original member state of the European Coal and Steel Community, or a larger member state, but which may have something a bit more palatable for other member states than EU accession countries, and which might allow us to drive the EU in a direction that will make sure we can keep the 27 members that remain and make it palatable and attractive to those who seek to join the EU.<\/p> <p>  I shall now turn to security and defence, issues which the Minister of State touched upon at the most recent European Council meeting and that was very important.  The area of cybercrime, which the Minister of State briefly mentioned, is becoming more relevant and is increasingly in the news.<\/p><p>Will the Minister of State go into more detail on what discussions were held and what plans are in place at European level to deal with the ever increasing role of outside forces and commercial entities in influencing business transactions, elections and behavioural attitudes, especially when online and using social media?<\/p><p> On Monday, Senator Craughwell and I joined about 20 colleagues from a cross-party delegation from the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, organised by Senator Frank Feighan, to visit Westminster.  It was a productive engagement and gave us a great insight into the real appetite for interparliamentary discussion in the Brexit debate.  I fear that is being left behind.  Irish parliamentarians - not necessarily Ministers - need to up their game in ensuring we meet as many other parliamentarians as possible.  We had a good meeting with a delegation from Hungary yesterday.  Today, I am meeting several French parliamentarians at 5 p.m.  We have met with the Danish Brexit committee here.  We could do much more, however.<\/p><p> Some of the discussions we held in Westminster were reassuring but some were disappointing.  The discussion with the leaders of the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party in Westminster was a great big love-in.  Discussions, however, with the UK Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, and the shadow Foreign Secretary were a little more revealing, however.  These are areas which will become difficult if we are going to mark sufficient progress in the Brexit discussions when it comes to Ireland before the December European Council meeting.<\/p><p> It comes back again to the customs union.  I picked up an air of a veiled threat from the Foreign Secretary that if they do not get what they want, there are forces within the British Cabinet - which is falling apart everyday - who are quite willing to pull plug on this process.  The hard Brexit no-deal scenario is something about which we should be concerned.  Will the Minister of State give us more detail about the proposals for the customs union?  The Taoiseach made reasonable proposals and the British Labour Party has tweaked its position on this.  However, it is not a position of the British Government.  It is not the British Opposition which is in discussions with Michel Barnier, however.<\/p><p> The Taoiseach mentioned he would favour a five-year transition period.  What is the exact Irish aim on this?  Hopefully, it is not too premature to go into the phase 2 priority.  The Minister of State referred to sectorial and trading interests.  Will she give more detail on this?  I raised the urgent priority, well before the March 2019 phase 2 discussions, for an EU-US-UK open skies agreement with the European Commissioner for Transport, Violeta Bulc, and Brian Hayes, MEP.<\/p><p> In recent weeks, Ireland has applied to be observers of the Nordic Council and La Francophonie, Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie.  These are welcome but belated endeavours.  There are other councils such as the Arctic Council to which we should apply.  Obviously, I am a long-time supporter of re-joining the British Commonwealth, as popular as that seems to be with 98% of the rest of Oireachtas Members.  This is important and gives us opportunities to strengthen existing alliances.  Will the Minister of State give an update from a European Council perspective on the work being achieved and our position in Ireland as a leading member in an EU of 27, after March 2019?  Who will be our obvious allies?  Once the UK leaves the EU, our strongest and oldest ally in it is gone.  We joined the European Economic Community with the UK.  France is our next nearest neighbour.  We have good ties with France when it comes to the Common Agricultural Policy, energy security, building the interconnector.  We also have good ties with the Benelux and Nordic countries.  Will the Minister of State give more detail on how the work on strengthening and developing alliances is going?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017110900002#C00700","speaker":"1399","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510236000,"counter":1139,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is most welcome to the committee.  I also welcome my colleague, Brian Hayes, MEP, who always makes himself available to Members, as do his colleagues, Marian Harkin and Nessa Childers.  Every time I turn around, Brian Hayes is here listening to what is going on and bringing back information from Brussels.  For that, I am deeply appreciative, although he is a tough guy to debate against on radio.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State, her predecessor and the Government are to be congratulated on the work they are doing.  As we enter this phase of rediscovering or reappraising where we are going with Europe, I hope they will take on board the presentation made to the committee by the National Youth Council.  It was looking forward to a more socially aware Europe, one more interested in the citizen than in the corporate world.  I realise one cannot have a Europe without the corporate world, but the citizens somehow or other, have to be central to everything we do.  Expanding youth operations and programmes, such as ERASMUS+, are extremely important.  The greater integration and co-operation for our young, the more secure Europe will be as we go forward.  That was evidenced in the Brexit referendum in the UK.  The youth of England were not really that motivated towards breaking from Europe.  There is a lesson to be learned from that.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State averted to defence and neutrality at the same time.  Sometimes in this country we get a little bogged down on the neutrality issue.  Ireland is a neutral country.  If there was an attempt to establish a European army, I would be the first person to shout, \"Down with that sort of thing\".  Unfortunately, our security services, the Garda and the Defence Forces, wear two hats, a security and policing hat and a security and defence hat respectively.  There is nothing wrong with greater integration in the security of Europe.  I do not believe it undermines our neutrality in any way.  For example, we need to integrate intelligence services right across Europe.  On several occasions, I have called for the establishment of an Irish security service with a director of intelligence.  It is extremely important if we are to deal with organisations such as MI5 and its European equivalents.  We have to have someone of equal standing.  It is simply not good enough for a Garda Commissioner to expect to deal with the director of MI5.<\/p> <p>  We need greater integration, particularly with the threats which exist across Europe today.  We should not fool ourselves in Ireland that there are not terrorists being radicalised and trained here or being exported to other parts of the world.  They are there under the surface.  Our own police are to be congratulated because they have uncovered several terrorist cells in recent years and have brought people to justice.  However, I would like to see greater integration in this area.<\/p> <p>  We always talk about defence co-operation in Europe but rarely talk about police co-operation.  While there is a police co-operative service through Europe, I would like to see it enhanced and better resourced.  Counter-terrorism has to be at the front of everything we do today.  The other day in London with Senator Frank Feighan's delegation, someone pointed out how a busy street is an ideal target for a lone wolf terrorist.  Everyone is aware of what happened in Barcelona recently and New York earlier this week.  One is not safe anywhere.  The only way to tackle that is by having a good intelligence and solution service, working hand in hand.<\/p> <p>  For the sake of argument - I do not want to be accused of scaremongering - if a group decided to hijack a bus of tourists in Moll's Gap, Clifden or Westport, how quickly could we get troops to that part of the country?  The truth of the matter is we do not have the military hardware to get them there.  Being part of a joint purchasing scheme through Europe, we possibly could buy military equipment at a much cheaper cost and equip our services much better.<\/p><p>I have made a similar point several times on the purchase of medicines.  I cannot understand the reason Europe does not use its purchasing power.  While we are capable of establishing common policies in agriculture and other areas, we appear to be incapable of forcing the major drug companies to provide drugs at the same price across Europe.  I am sure Mr. Hayes will offer a reason for this in a few moments.  I would like the European Union to act on this issue.<\/p><p> My welcome for President Tusk's vision is qualified.  The Taoiseach has taken a proactive approach to various issues, including telling the European Union to keep its hands off our corporate tax rate.  We will watch how this develops over time.  It is great that Europe has spoken out on the nuclear deal with Iran, which is extremely important for world peace.  The world has enough problems without offending the Iranians.  I was a member of a recent parliamentary delegation which visited Iran where we were treated extremely well.  Everywhere we went people spoke about the dangers presented by the rejection of the nuclear deal, not only to Iran, the only stable society in the region, but also to the rest of the world.  It is excellent that Europe has spoken out on this issue.  If the Minister of State wishes to make a comment, I would love to hear it.<\/p><p> Having spoken to the British this week, I am concerned that there is not enough pressure on the Brexit negotiations.  At this stage, we have heard so much about Brexit that the yawn factor is beginning to emerge.  When an issue such as this becomes boring, it becomes dangerous.  Any move to negotiating on trade without first resolving the Northern Ireland issue leaves us in a position where the Border issue could very well be pushed aside over a period.  I understand there may be a requirement to enter phase two of the negotiations in some areas.  For example, one cannot talk about tariffs and customs without exploring where one is going there but I am not sure we should move fully into phase two negotiations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017110900002#D00200","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510236000,"counter":1141,"content":"<p>I apologising for interrupting the Senator.

I thank the Minister of State for appearing before the joint committee.  Senator Richmond asked many of the questions I intended to ask and I do not propose repeating the points he made.  The Senator referred to the terminology of a speech made by the Taoiseach on the Irish position.  While I like consultation as a process, the party the Taoiseach leads has a very strong tradition in Europe and a very clear position on the matter.  Speaking as a member of the Fine Gael Party and a Deputy, there is a clear need for an enunciation by the Government of what we would like to see in terms of the federal future of Europe.<\/p> <p>  During my most recent conversation with the Minister of State, I noted that one of the greatest threats to the long-term future security of Europe is the belief among certain large member states that they have ownership of Europe and their view that the rest of us are almost an inconvenience who are along for the ride.  This view must be challenged by all the smaller member states.  The belief that this view is held among certain member states may not be shared at governmental level but it is certainly felt by citizens of the European Union, particularly in smaller member states.  It is not helped by the Franco-German axis behaving in a way that sometimes gives the impression that their view of Europe is the only view of Europe.  Many other member states, notably new eastern European and smaller states, hold similar views to those of Ireland.  We need a stronger, deeper and more integrated Europe but it must be a confederation of equal states that are proud of their traditions and heritage and want to work together in a stronger deeper Europe.  We must get this message out very clearly.  My party has believed in this approach for many years.  All Irish Governments have held the same view of where we should go on Europe and we should be at the forefront of leading this approach. <\/p> <p>  I am particularly anxious to find out what our thinking will be in the event of the Brexit negotiations failing.  We consistently monopolise the view that negotiations will fail because the British will be awkward or obstinate.  However, the ratification process for the Brexit deal through the European Union structures is as likely to result in the deal failing as the British stance.  If a deal is reached, as I believe probable, what is our position on the possibility that it will not be ratified?<\/p> <p>  In the context of the position that there should not be a border on this island, what is our position on where the border should be?  There is a significant amount of east-west movement and many goods are transported across the United Kingdom into the Continent.  Given that we will be on the wrong side of the UK after Brexit, what is our position on the swathe of industry which needs to access the continental market?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017110900002#E00700","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1510236000,"counter":1147,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Brian Hayes, MEP.

I thank her for the work she has done since her appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for European Union affairs.  She has brought to her role great energy and a new perspective, which is always useful in government.<\/p> <p>  In my day job in Brussels and Strasbourg, I see daily the extraordinary work of officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, other Departments and the diplomatic service.  They work very hard on the Brexit negotiations.  I noted some announcements in the recent budget on additional support and funding for diplomatic efforts.  Will the Minister of State provide further detail on this funding?  As a result of the economic crisis, a smaller group of people had to do the same amount of work as was done prior to the crisis.  If we are serious about advancing Irish and European Union interests, we must support our colleagues at permanent representation level in Brussels who do extraordinary work.  Additional resources will be crucial and I would appreciate further information in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State referred to the importance of having this debate now.  President Juncker, in his state of the union speech in Strasbourg two months ago, stated he hoped that by the time of the Romanian Presidency in March 2019, just before elections to the European Parliament are due, we will have reached some finality regarding the White Paper and what conclusions can be drawn from it.  We have, therefore, an 18-month period in which to engage in a nationwide public dialogue to be led by the Minister of State and Taoiseach.<\/p><p>It is really important that we have this dialogue now.  We have it in a vacuum, in a sense, as we have a White Paper but, in fairness to Jean-Claude Juncker, he has said it is just the Commission's view.  The Council will come to a view.  The Parliament has already come to a view, in terms of the work we have concluded on the report of the five Presidents.  In this 18 month period, it is important for all political parties to sketch out what are our priorities.  Too often in the past we have responded to treaties.  I do not believe, quite frankly, there is any appetite in the Council, and certainly not a majority of Parliament, for treaty change at present.  I see the next two years as a period of mini-bargains and mini-deals as we move forward.  I do not think there is support for a full federation, but equally there is no support for leaving things as they are.  We must work for something in between, such as a twin-track approach which, effectively, we have at the moment with the eurozone, or working out a more co-ordinated policy in economic affairs.  We have an opportunity.  I ask the Government to work with all of the political parties in trying to map out our priorities and be part of the debate.<\/p><p> Not only have we had the White Paper published by President Juncker earlier this year, but five reflection papers have also been published.  One is on social Europe, on which a point has been made, and the others are on globalisation, defence and security, the question of deeper economic and monetary union, and future financing and the question of the EU budget.  Does the Government plan to respond officially to these five papers, either by a collection of Departments or centrally?  If so, what is the timeline on it?<\/p><p> I want to pick up on remarks made on defence and security.  I agree fully with what my colleagues have said on all sides of the debate.  The Taoiseach said yesterday the debate on where we go with regard to permanent structured co-operation on security and defence, PESCO, is very interesting, and obviously the Government will contribute to it.  This is an opportunity for Ireland to look at defence and security differently.  No one is suggesting there will be any challenge to our traditional policy of being militarily non-aligned.  I have never accepted the principle of neutrality.  I do not think we are neutral on the question of European, Irish or western values.  We are not neutral on these questions.  We are non-aligned militarily.  No one is suggesting there will ever be a challenge to this.  No one is suggesting a common mutual defence pact a bit like the old WEU Article 4 commitments, whereby once one country is attacked another country automatically comes to its defence.  No one is suggesting this, and no one is suggesting dragooning our children into a common European army, but we can do things differently to show our common cause to other member states.  One could argue solidarity clauses already exist in the treaties.  We could possibly have a reworking of the triple lock for circumstances where at the UN, for political reasons, for example, China and the rest cannot agree on a resolution.  Perhaps it is an EU response that is required.<\/p><p> On the question Senator Craughwell raised on economies of scale and procurement, we have less than 0.4% spending on defence at present.  It is not enough in a circumstance of threats.  Even if one looks at the White Paper on Defence from some years ago, there have been rapid changes in the past two years with cybersecurity and other issues regarding terrorism.<\/p><p> I am aware of the debate on PESCO at present.  There are things we can do which will show our solidarity to the 27 other member states, soon to be 26, which will not cut across our traditional policy.  We can do these in an open, honest, transparent way rather than pretending to some people and dressing it up as neutrality when it is not.<\/p><p> My final remark on Brexit, knowing the committee has a lot on his plate, is that assuming we get to a deal, and I welcome what the Taoiseach said recently, it would be a disaster for Europe, the UK and especially for us if, by December, we cannot get to phase 2.  We have to show a degree of flexibility around this in my view.  I appreciate it is more difficult for the Government to say this.  We need flexibility on the European side as well as on the British side.  We need some sequencing.  The question of transitioning is the most important issue at present for our businesses throughout the country.  Will the Government ensure that as part of the EU negotiations an early commitment will be given on transitioning, rather than a commitment at one minute to midnight, because if that is the case we will lose so much time in the negotiations?  Businesses are making their decisions now, or will have to make their decisions by the first quarter of next year.  This is the challenge we face on the business front.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017110900002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Hayes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510236000,"counter":1150,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hayes.

If I miss any questions I ask committee members to alert me and I will try to come back to them.  I thank all of the members for their contributions and questions.  To answer Senator Richmond on the debate on the future of Europe, which is starting next week, it has been catapulted forward because of what is happening with Brexit.  While Brexit is one of our key priorities, we will not be left behind on the discussion on the future of Europe.  However, we are very much at the beginning of that process.  While I understand that people want the Taoiseach to make a speech that is one or two hours long to set out where we are going, this is much harder while we are at the beginning of the process.  He will speak next week, obviously, and set out some of the priorities, but we are at the beginning of this process and what we hope to see following next Wednesday is this initial phase bringing us up until May and that it will have two elements.<\/p><p>Probably the most difficult issue, and I am sure our French colleagues and those from other member states would agree, is to engage people who would not normally engage on politics and European issues.  Getting the conversation going will be the challenge, but we very much hope we will be able to do this with the support of members here and through our various institutions, schools, colleges and local authorities, so that throughout the country we will be able to engage on all of the issues we have discussed today, including jobs, growth, opportunities available for our young people, environment, security, defence and migration.  People need to have a say on all of these key issues.<\/p><p>What I would like to see happening throughout the debate is that we have a very positive discussion on the benefits of Europe and how Ireland has already benefitted.  The statistic that most surprised me recently was that more than 50% of people here were not born when Ireland became a member of the European Union.  For most people, it is the <i>status quo<\/i>and it has always been there.  Senator Craughwell spoke about social issues and our young people.  We receive &euro;610 million from Europe to add to our programme on employability and training.  We have additional funding for our youth guarantee scheme, which is for those under the age of 25.  We have the Erasmus programme, which allows our young people to live, work and travel abroad and allow people to come to us here.  We must get all of this positive message out, build on it and ask how it can be improved and work better for our citizens.  I thank the committee for its work to date on this, and I look forward to working with it, all Members and our MEPs as the debate moves forward.  We are engaging with other member states to see how they carry out this process.  While there needs to be a discussion within countries and among leaders, there also needs to be a discussion among citizens.  Some member states have already started this process.  They have already started their engagement and debate, so it will be very interesting to see how we can work with them on these areas.<\/p><p>With regard to Brexit, Senator Richmond touched on our engagement and the fact we are losing our nearest friend and closest ally and how will we look to make new friends.  It is very positive that the Taoiseach was asked to join the Nordic and Baltic meeting before the Council meeting.  Denmark was also invited.  In the past week, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, had a meeting with similar member states at an informal lunch prior to the finance committee meeting.  We have a very high attendance rate by Ministers, at almost 100%, at all of our Council meetings.  We are also engaging with all of the other institutions.  Between now and next June, we will have at least one Minister attending all of the European Parliament sessions.  It is very important that we engage with our MEPs and MEPs from other countries.  This is something we see as a priority and something we can build on and improve with time.<\/p><p> In the context of the Minister being quoted as seeking a five-year transition period, I do not believe that is the case.  The UK has suggested two years.  We have all seen how things have taken a little longer than the British would like.  Given that start talking about a transitional period and what that might look like, it would be unwise to give an exact timeline until we know what it actually might be.  There is a suggestion that it could take up to five years or anything around that amount of time.  There is no specific timeline at this stage.<\/p><p> In phase 2 of the negotiations, consideration will be given to different industries and scenarios.  We will do as much as we can to prepare ourselves in the absence of knowing what phase 2 will look like.  The all-island civil dialogue has taken place a number of times.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, will chair the cross-party civil forum, which is a smaller version of the dialogue group.  It will bring together the various stakeholder forums, representatives bodies and organisations.  We want this process to remain as open and transparent as possible but it is a two-way system.  We inform the industries and bodies about our work and what is happening but we also want them to give us feedback on what they feel we should be doing and on what is happening to them.  In the absence of any clear vision of what phase 2 will look like, as much work as possible is being done in that regard within each Department.<\/p><p> A question was asked about a hard Brexit scenario and whether the Government in the UK pushed for that.  My view is that the latter was not the case.  That is just on the basis of the engagement I have had with Members of Parliament across the board in the UK.  Again, it is very difficult to identify what that might be when we are not in that scenario.<\/p><p> Senator Craughwell discussed a more socially aware European Union.  When we talk about the future of Europe, we often hear about the Single Market, the digital Single Market, security and defence.  We will also focus on and debate opportunities for our young people, what the Single Market means and how its full implementation will transpire into jobs.  We have seen that ourselves in our economy and with the number of people back in employment.  This is proof of how that can have a massive impact on the social aspect of people's lives.  When a Government spends more money on those elements, there is a huge impact.  All of these aspects feed into that element.  Obviously, we need to ensure that people are aware of that.  The Taoiseach, possibly, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and I will attend the EU Social Summit for Fair Jobs and Growth in Gothenburg next week and I hope that signals our commitment in this area.<\/p><p> On security and defence, we have been very insistent.  Previously, the debate tended to focus more on defence.  Security has come into the equation more.  In fact, so much so that the term \"security and defence\" is now being used.  I agree with what Mr. Brian Hayes, MEP, has said.  We cannot stand by and say that we are neutral because we know that in certain areas this is not and should not be the case.  We need to discuss the matter with citizens.  We must discover, if we are to keep our military neutrality, where we stand when it comes to terrorism online, supporting other member states and supporting our families and friends in the UK when attacks take place, as was recently the case.  Where do we stand when it comes to people being attacked indiscriminately in the middle of the street?  How do we work together in such circumstances?<\/p><p> In terms of PESCO, it is something that we will working towards at the December Council meeting.  It will allow us and enhance our capability to engage in crises management around those key issues.  We are very keen to bring that debate back to the D&aacute;il and the Seanad and I hope we can reach agreement in respect of it.  Again, that feeds into better police co-operation, integration, etc.<\/p><p> I accept the comments that were made on the nuclear deal.  Deputy Brophy mentioned the federal future of Europe and other member states.  It is any member state's prerogative to set out its ideas.  There have been some strong statements on some key issues with which we might not necessarily agree.  Again, they are just member states setting out their priorities and agenda.  Jean-Claude Junker's priorities, agendas and scenarios are not exclusive or exhaustive.  They can act as a springboard or a mechanism to commence debate.  We can participate in the debate.  While we might not agree on areas of taxation, or changes to our institutions, we must have that debate ourselves and bring it forward.   A number of countries of similar size - and with similar priorities - to Ireland would probably agree with us in other key areas in respect of which some of the larger countries, for example, France and Germany, would not agree.  While we may be small we have shown in the past that we conveyed our views across and our voice was heard.<\/p><p> Members asked what happens if negotiations fail.  We are working to ensure that does not happen.  All 27 members states are making every effort to ensure that negotiations do not fail.  To see the unity that has remained among the 27 member states on all issues, particularly on those relating to Ireland, has been wonderful.  This shows that while some thought the European Union might crumble and fall apart following Brexit, the EU has actually become stronger.  At the same time, we are not there to strong-arm the United Kingdom or put it under pressure.  We have reached the current stage based on negotiation, having a mutual respect and through co-operation.  The negotiations must continue in that manner.  We have shown a willingness to move on to phase 2 and to discuss the transition period again.  I hope that all shows we are willing to engage and are ready to move on to phase 2.<\/p><p> In terms of our exact views on the Border issue, we have made it very clear that no physical infrastructure can be put in place on the island of Ireland.  This matter is not just about customs and trade, is a political issue.  We very much feel that the United Kingdom needs to come forward with a solution.  We welcome its commitment to having no frontier but it is a contradiction for the UK to leave the Single Market and the customs union.  Our preference would be for the UK to remain within the Single Market and the customs union in order that there would be no hard border.  In the absence of that, it needs to be acknowledged that the scenario in Ireland is very unique and thus requires a unique and imaginative political solution.  Nothing needs to be fully resolved by the conclusion of phase 1 but further progress needs to be made than heretofore has been the case.<\/p><p> In terms of Brian Hayes, MEP, and doubling our footprint, the Taoiseach has given such a commitment, as has the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  It was announced in the budget that Ireland wants to double its global footprint.  I think we gave a very clear commitment during the economic and financial crisis here that we did not close any of our missions within Europe or any of our embassies.  We did not close them because we understood the significance and importance of maintaining close relations and ties with all of our European counterparts and those further afield.  As things change and we seek to expand, we have already increased staff numbers at our various offices in Brussels and Paris.  However, we are also looking further afield.  The President announced a new office in New Zealand.  We already have an office in Vancouver and other offices will be opened.  We have an ideal to establish an Ireland house in countries where we may be weaker and in places where our institutions and bodies, such as Bord Bia or Enterprise Ireland, do not have as strong a footprint.  An Ireland House would allow them to work together under the same roof thus ensuring a stronger connection to the host countries.  We are working on the initiative and funding has been made available.  We hope to develop the initiative further in the new year.<\/p><p> On the 18-month dialogue, we agree with President Tusk's view that it should be up to a two-year process, which we are starting now.  When we have that engagement, we will be able to see where we need to move on from, what we need to consider in greater detail and whether we must consult the citizens of Ireland on any key specific issues.<\/p><p> In terms of the five reflection papers, so far the Minister for Finance is the only member of Cabinet who has done specific work on one of the papers.  We have asked the Institute of International and European Affairs, IIEA, to analyse all of the five papers and report back to us in the near future.  I shall keep the committee updated on all of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017110900002#F00300","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510236000,"counter":1153,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017110900002#G00200","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1510236000,"counter":1154,"content":"<p>I wish to ask a brief question on cybersecurity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017110900002#G00300","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1510236000,"counter":1155,"content":"<p>It must be brief.

There was some discussion on this yesterday with Deputy Burton, where reference was made to the provision in the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 of a restriction limiting the amount of trading losses incurred by a NAMA-participating bank that could be set off against future trading profits.  The set-off was limited to 50% of the profit in any given year but, in the Finance Act 2014, the Minister's predecessor removed that restriction.  Our awareness of the current position of the banks comes from their published accounts.  As at June 2017, Bank of Ireland's deferred tax assets included an amount of &euro;1.251 billion in respect of tax losses available to relieve future profits from tax.  AIB, at December 2016, had deferred tax assets of &euro;2.928 billion.  In its 2016 annual report, Permanent TSB showed a deferred tax asset on tax losses carried forward of &euro;373 million.  This equates to tax losses of some &euro;2.98 billion and the estimation is that it will take 22 years for those losses to be utilised.  We heard similar estimates from the other banks when their representatives appeared before the committee recently.<\/p><p>What is the Government's position on this issue, with specific reference to the change introduced in 2014?  Is the Minister holding the possibility of a potential change to the provision as a stick he may use in his dealings with the banks concerning the tracker mortgage issue?  Is it one of the weapons he hinted he might use in the event the banks do not meet their responsibilities in this regard?  I am well aware that trading losses carried forward are an important feature of our corporation tax code.  However, the circumstances here are truly exceptional and the provision does, therefore, warrant examination.  Will the Minister comment on the capital position of the banks in which we own shares?  Has an analysis been done, for example, of what a change in the existing provision would mean for them from a capital perspective?  As I understand it, these deferred tax assets are recognised as core tier 1 capital.  As such, has the Department done an assessment of whether or not a change which impacted on the figures might require the State to stump up more capital to put into the banks?  I would want to see that analysis before making any decision on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#B00600","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1172,"content":"<p>My amendment No. 45, like Deputy McGrath's amendment, relates to the carrying forward of bank losses.  I have been raising this issue since 2014, when the then Fine Gael-Labour Party Government decided to change the provision which allowed for only 50% of losses to be carried forward.  That provision was a deliberate inclusion in the NAMA Act 2009 by the then Minister, the late Brian Lenihan, who made the point when he introduced it in the Seanad - the Minister and I were both in that House at the time - that it was necessary because of the magnitude of bank losses that were being recorded.  It was important, Mr. Lenihan noted, that these banks should start to pay a proportion of tax as soon as possible.  Limiting the carrying forward capacity to 50% of losses showed the then Minister's foresight.  He knew the banks would enter into profitability at some point and that if the standard 100% carry forward of losses in our tax code applied, then the banks would not be paying tax for decades.  He did the right thing at that time.<\/p>  <p>  However, the then Government decided to change that provision in 2014.  I am not immune to the reasons this was done.  Deputy McGrath referred to core tier 1 capital ratios and the fact that if the change was not made, some of the banks, including the pillar banks, may have needed to raise additional capital .  If they could not raise it in the markets, it might have fallen to the Government to stump up more, which would not have been palatable to the Irish public.<\/p>  <p>  However, we are now in 2017 and in a position where all of these banks have returned to profitability.  AIB is on course to record a profit this year of &euro;1.5 billion and to be one of the most profitable banks in Europe.  Bank of Ireland made a profit of &euro;1 billion last year and Permanent TSB entered into profitability last year, although it slipped back a little in the first six months of 2017.  Taking AIB and Bank of Ireland, their combined profit of &euro;2.5 billion would require a payment of &euro;300 million if they had to pay corporation tax.  They are paying nothing, however, because they are able to carry forward their losses.  AIB told us it would be 20 years before it starts paying taxes and Permanent TSB said it would be in excess of 20 years before it begins making payments.  The Bank of Ireland delegates indicated that it will be quite a number of years before their bank pays tax in the State.  These banks have played fast and loose with Irish people's money.  They have deprived Irish families of their homes and their futures, which has had an impact on individuals' sense of well-being and mental health.  We are all familiar with this from the tracker mortgage scandal and many other scandals over the years.<\/p>  <p>  The core issue here is the question of why the Government has not re-introduced the provision in the 2009 Act which was intended to be there for the duration of the banks' losses.  That restriction was not intended by Brian Lenihan to operate only for a year or two.  The late Minister knew the banks were never going to make a profit for a number of years.  The provision was introduced with an eye to the situation we are in now, and the Late Mr. Lenihan knew we would reach this point some time in the future.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, will talk about the bank levy but that is not the same.  It is not based on profitability and is wider in its application than those institutions which have the major losses.  One can argue that this is about deferred tax and the banks will end up paying the tax at some stage, when the losses are all used up.  If we reverted to the 50% provision, we would just be allowing the banks to continue paying their losses over a longer period of time.  The point is that we need the taxes now, not in 20 years time.  We do not know what circumstances will prevail in the State in two decades but we do know we could use this revenue now to address the serious crises in health and housing.  I strongly commend these amendments, which are merely seeking a report on this issue, incorporating the pre-2014 capital position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#B00700","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1173,"content":"<p>Loss relief is a standard feature of corporate tax regimes worldwide.  Under the Irish corporate tax regime, losses incurred in the course of a business are allowed to be taken into account in calculating the appropriate amount of tax due by companies.  Loss relief recognises the fact that business cycles run over a longer period than just a single year and that it would be inequitable to tax profits in one year and not allow loss relief in the next.<\/p>  <p>  Under existing loss relief provisions in the tax Acts, any unrelieved trading losses of a company for an accounting period may be carried forward for offset against trading income of the same trade in future accounting periods.  Alternatively, a company may claim to have the loss set off against profits of any description for the same accounting period in which the loss was incurred or of an immediately preceding accounting period of the same length.  The provision of relief for such losses is a standard feature of our tax code and of the tax codes of all other OECD countries.  It would be difficult to justify the taxation of business profits without also taking due account of business losses.<\/p>  <p>  As both Deputies have acknowledged, under the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 a new section, section 396C, was inserted into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The provision limited the amount of prior year losses that a NAMA participating institution could offset against trading profits to 50% of trading profit for each accounting period.  It should be noted that it did not disallow any tax losses from being utilised but instead lengthened the period over which they could be used.  In 2013, the Minister for Finance decided it was appropriate to remove the restriction on relief for losses in participating institutions with effect from accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.  This was done against the backdrop of the introduction of new capital rules.<\/p>  <p>  The removal of the restriction has protected the carrying value of deferred tax assets at the banks in which the State has a significant stake, thus improving capital ratios under the new Basel III rules and consequently increasing the value of the State's investment.  The removal of section 396C enabled the banks to absorb their losses over a shorter timeframe than would be the case with a 50% limit in place.  While corporation tax will not be payable on the banks' trading profits until their losses are fully absorbed, the net effect of the measure in terms of tax receipts is one of timing.  This will be offset by an improvement in the valuation of the State's equity stakes in the banks as well as its debt investments, while the risk to the State as backstop provider of capital is also reduced.  Rather than interfere with the deferred tax assets by changing tax policy, the Government has ensured a contribution from the sector by introducing a bank levy which has been payable since 2014.  This provided an annual contribution of approximately &euro;150 million to the Exchequer for the period from 2014 to 2016.  In budget 2016, the payment of this levy was extended until 2021.  It is anticipated that the bank levy will to raise &euro;750 million over five years.<\/p>  <p>  To deal with each of the amendments in turn, it is important to acknowledge that they are different even though they are grouped together.  Deputy McGrath's amendment seeks to outline what the impacts could be of restricting loss relief, whereas the amendment tabled by Deputy Pearse Doherty seeks to examine what options there would be for going ahead and doing it.  From a policy perspective the first amendment asks me to outline what the consequences would be of pursuing a policy while the second amendment more clearly reflects the view of Deputy Pearse Doherty that this is a policy direction the Government should take.  The strong advice I have received is that any indication that we are going to change the taxation status of the deferred losses would have an effect on other objectives we are seeking to fulfil with the banks in terms of what we want the future capital position to be and the ability of the State to recover the investment the Irish taxpayer has made in those banks.<\/p>  <p>  I do not have any intention of changing how we tax the deferred losses in the Irish banking system because I believe there would be consequences that would make it difficult for me to fulfil other objectives that the House and the Irish people want me to fulfil in respect of the Irish banking code.  If the committee wants me to refer back to it at a later point and outline the consequences of such a policy action I am willing to do so.  Deputy Michael McGrath asked me a direct question about the capital consequences of doing this.  I do not have that information with me today.  I have asked my officials to check whether such a piece of work has been done, so I will have to refer back to the committee on that.  However, I wish to emphasise that from my perspective changing how we tax what are referred to as \"assets\" would have other consequences for which I would be held responsible by the committee.  My firm view is that the medium-term response to how we deal with this issue is the maintenance of the bank levy.  If the committee wants me to outline what would be the consequences of other courses of action I will do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#C00100","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1174,"content":"<p>I accept the principle of losses forward in the corporation tax code.

It is a timing issue but it is a timing issue over a long horizon of more than 20 years in certain cases.

I and my party want the Minister to revert back to the pre-2014 position.  I do not want the Minister to justify the fact that AIB will pay no taxes for 20 years and Permanent TSB will pay no taxes for 22 years.  Some of these banks are recording &euro;1.5 billion in profit.  Bank of Ireland will not pay any taxes to the Irish State for a number of years.  The public wants those banks to start paying their taxes and they want those taxes used to fix the health service and the housing and homelessness crisis.  They want the banks and bankers to start paying fair taxes.  <\/p>  <p>                 That is why I am pressing amendment No. 45.  I want an informed discussion and debate and the report would allow us to do that.  The options will include all of those issues, but I want to steer the Parliament in a direction such that we no longer tolerate a situation whereby a bank that records &euro;1.5 billion of profit in 2017 does not pay a penny of tax to the State.<\/p> <p> Like Deputy McGrath, I value the issue of losses being carried forward.  I have not argued for that to be taken out of the tax code.  However, I have argued against the position resulting from the NAMA Act 2009, put in place by the late Brian Lenihan.  Obviously there was pressure at the time because of the bailout of the banks and a massive guarantee had been issued to the banks at the time.  The then Minister had the foresight to see that these banks were going to be profitable at some point in future and that they needed to start paying their taxes as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p> The 2013 situation no longer arises.  Representatives from Allied Irish Banks appeared before the committee and I questioned them on the matter.  They referred to the fact that if they did not have this provision in 2013, and taking effect in 2014, there would be need for additional capital.  However, they also confirmed that if we went back to the 50% figure, there would be no requirement for additional capital to be raised.  Moreover, even if additional capital were to be raised, those banks are likely to be able to raise that capital on the international markets instead of drawing from the public purse.<\/p> <p> This is why I am pressing amendment No. 45.  The Minister is saying that he will give us the information, but he is not going to change his position.  The Minister is doing that deliberately and I understand why he is doing it.  He is sending a clear signal to the markets, potential investors and the banks to the effect that everything is fine and not to worry, and that as long as Fine Gael is in government, they will be able to continue not paying taxes on the massive profits they make for the coming 20 years.  The Minister is signalling to the bankers that Fine Gael has their back and that the party is for opportunists.  I am saying that is wrong.  There is no point in the Minister providing information to us but then saying he is not going to change his position.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 45 tries to allow members present to decide whether it is the right course of action to allows banks in the State that have been bailed out with tens of billions of euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money to pay no taxes for the next 20 years.  We can decide through a vote that this situation needs to come to an end.  We can have an options paper within six months on how to bring it to an end and it will include all the information that has the effect of the capital allowance.  From there, we can make the decision on which option is preferred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#C00400","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1178,"content":"<p>I wish to make an additional point.

The public paid for these first time around.  By the time we head for the 20 year mark, it will be a post-privatisation scenario if the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il, presumably, have their way.  That will mean the public effectively pays again in terms of not getting tax.  It is a double bailout for the banks paid for by the taxpayer.  This is not a normal situation.

Given Deputy Doherty's understandable focus &ndash; it is one I share &ndash; in trying to have evidence, facts and views available to him before he reaches a policy view, I would have thought that a consistent position would be to allow me to spell out in the coming period the consequences of a move like this.<\/p>  <p>  That is not what Deputy Doherty is asking me to do with this amendment.  He is saying this is what he wants to happen, as he has already said.  The main interest of my party is not, as Deputy Doherty suggests, to look after the interests of the privileged few.  My objectives fall into two different areas.  First, I want to ensure taxpayers have a path to get back the money invested in these banks.  I thought Deputy Doherty had a similar view.  I want to ensure that we get back all of the &euro;28 billion invested in the banks and I hope Deputy Doherty shares that view &ndash; I believe he does.  The advice and information available to me suggests the maintenance of the bank levy in the medium term and the ability for us to regain the investment over time.  If the Government decides to dispose of its shares in those banks, we can then have a debate on what we do with the proceedings of those disposals.  The path to regain that money is best served by indicating that we believe the current tax policy is the appropriate one.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate the point in respect of what Deputy Murphy said.  I want taxpayers to get their money back and I want to ensure the money we have invested in those banks comes back to us.  While these banks have returned to profitability, it is a return to profitability after many years of losses.  Otherwise, I would not be in this situation or dealing with the questions that Deputy Murphy is putting to me.  I am keen to ensure that as soon as possible we have a banking system that is capable of meeting the other needs of people.  At a bare minimum, this includes handling and resolving promptly issues relating to tracker mortgages, which I expect to see happen in the way I have outlined before.  The system must also be capable of meeting other needs in terms of being able to provide the right levels of credit to small and medium-sized enterprises as well as for investment opportunities and purchases that families want to make throughout the length and breadth of the country.<\/p>  <p>  These are the reasons that the course of action I outlined on budget day and again today is the best one to take.  I can outline to the committee the consequences of an alternative approach.  However, I want to do that clearly in the spirit of saying that I believe the course of action I have outlined in recent statements is the right one.

Perhaps it might be helpful to look at some principles.  One of the first principles relates to someone who is earning a good deal or has a business where that business is making a large profit.  If that business is a key domestic business, such as banking, and it is profitable on a current basis notwithstanding a history of losses, then it should contribute.  That should apply notwithstanding the extraordinary history of the collapse of the banks and their extraordinary behaviour, which contributed to that collapse.  I presume we can agree that this is what the common good requires as well as common decency and any notion of fairness or equality.  All of these aspects are fairly accepted principles in a good taxation system.  The Minister has indicated that he broadly supports such a system.  <\/p>  <p>               Essentially what we are talking about here, in the context of Irish law, custom and practice, as referred to by the Minister, is the recognition of losses.  What this is doing is restricting the ability of the banks to avail of the losses over time, or indefinitely, as is now the case now, and for as much loss as has accrued, and without any recognition - because it would probably be very difficult to apply it to all businesses - of whether they were at fault in any way regarding the creation of these losses.<\/p> <p>  Previously when I was in opposition and the late Brian Lenihan was in government, we came to an agreement that there should be a restriction on the ability of very high-net-worth individuals to use losses here and now so that, in the current period and not the indefinite future, they would have to make a minimum contribution.  The reason for that was very simple.  A series of reports was produced by the Revenue Commissioners on my request to show there were people with incomes in excess of &euro;500,000 and &euro;1 million.  It sounds like much more innocent days because those sums were considered to be a great deal ten or 15 years ago.  The agreement was that the individuals concerned could not end up paying zero tax while those working in their houses, estates, farms or stud farms would be paying tax on a much more modest weekly income.  The Government at the time in question agreed to increase the levy, as the Minister knows.  His officials will say the agreement was very successful.  Did it result in a flight of people from Ireland?  Did it result in a collapse of their enterprises?  If their enterprises collapsed, it was not because of the agreement but it was a matter of basic equity.<\/p> <p> If the Minister examines the history of this &mdash; he said he will revert to the committee on this &mdash; he will note it is very offensive to somebody who is going to take the new Luas through St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green to point to the Bank of Ireland, tot up what it cost people in this country, notwithstanding that it is in recovery mode, and say it is great and that while it is currently making &euro;0.5 billion in profit, it will, I am sure, be making a profit well beyond &euro;1 billion in a couple of years.  The same will be said about AIB.  It is very difficult to understand.  Losses do not matter when profits are not being made because the banks have nothing to claim against.  That is why the argument is only gaining ground now and why we are only understanding it now.  I discussed this matter when in government and I am not going to talk about the details of the discussions.  The levy, which the Labour Party put forward, is still a lesser mechanism than actually restricting the use of the losses.<\/p> <p> On grounds of broad business efficiency in the economy, the hangover from the losses is wrong.  It is wrong from the perspective of other people in business, perhaps competing with the same banks or perhaps having an interest in providing services, that the banks have this extraordinary leeway.<\/p> <p> At a minimum, the reports should be produced but the Government should also consider my proposal actively.  It is a bit of a warning shot across the banks' bows but it also tells the people who bailed them out collectively and ensured much hardship and many reductions that there is some notion of fairness, equity and horizontal equality in the Irish tax system that addresses the matter of significant earnings.  We can pick a figure.  We could create a company earnings threshold of &euro;200 million, for example.  With regard to the indefinite hangover, we have been talking about using or losing development land.  It is wrong, at a time when we need significant funds to fund the kinds of services we expect and, more particularly, the infrastructure we need to remain competitive after Brexit, that they are not being asked to make a contribution.  Their not doing so makes them feel like masters of the universe all over again.  Hence, they do not feel obliged to treat their customers with the kind of sensitivity and understanding the Minister is displaying towards them because of what they experienced.  Their former leadership was much more culpable than an ordinary person who bought a mortgage in good faith and went into debt.  At times, the banks suggested to couples that they hold on to their existing apartment and let it, with the result that they ended up with the nightmare of being accidental buy-to-let landlords in the market.<\/p> <p> I welcome the fact that the Minister sounds open to discussing and examining this.  I do not believe it is difficult for the Department to support the production of the reports.  If the Minister has an alternative basis on which a report might be produced - he might bring it to us on Report Stage - I, for one, would certainly be prepared to consider it.  It relates to an important issue concerning principles in the Irish tax system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#D00900","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1187,"content":"<p>I will make two points in response to Deputy Burton.  We have debated this before.  I have exchanged views on the matter with the other Deputies here this morning.  The banks to which the Deputy is referring and that are the subject of this debate are banks in which the Irish taxpayer has an investment or equity of between &euro;11 billion and &euro;11.5 billion, as she well knows.  One of the greatest contributions I can make back to meet the needs of the taxpayers who supported the banking system at a time of crisis is to get their money back.  The Irish State had to borrow to put money into the banks.  Our national debt, as a result, is higher than it should be.  I want to get the money back.  The Deputy has a different view on what we should do with the money when it comes back, as was the case when receiving some back from the disposal of the share in AIB.  The Deputy has put a different case forward regarding how it should be invested.  I believe the right thing to do was to put the money we got towards paying back the additional debt we incurred as a result of having to put money into the banks.<\/p>  <p>  My assessment and recommendation to the Deputy today is that if she shares my view on trying to get the money back and also on some of the other points she touched upon, such as the need for more investment in infrastructure, we should use the banking levy as I propose.   We know we need our banking system supplying more credit to allow more homes to be built, for example.  We know issues arise over the pricing of products within Ireland by comparison with other countries we might compare ourselves to.  I want to see improvements and changes in this regard.  When I consider all the competing objectives, my assessment is that the best course of action for us, up to 2021, is to use the banking levy as a way of regaining revenue and getting value back for the taxpayer, as opposed to what Deputy Doherty is asking me to do today.<\/p>  <p>  I repeat what I indicated earlier, namely, that while I am not going to indicate I am changing my policy direction on the banking levy, I will revert to the committee.  Perhaps we can deal with this matter on Report Stage and outline the consequences of alternative courses of action.  Based on my understanding of those consequences, I believe the retention of the banking levy is the most sensible option to allow us to get money back while also delivering on the other objectives I know the Deputy would want me to achieve for our banks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#E00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1188,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

We saw these changes brought in and they were welcome, but there was a carve-out built in with regard to non-bank landers involved in the loan origination business.  This means that non-bank lenders with hundreds of millions lent to Irish businesses, and with profits in the millions, could continue to pay tax of as little as &euro;250 per year.<\/p><p>Let us look at an example of one such lender.  BlueBay has issued debt to the fast food business, Abrakebabra, and the Mater Private Hospital, among others.

That would mean profits of well over &euro;9 million in 2016 where BlueBay had &euro;160 million loaned out, a blended rate of 6% and profits of &euro;9 million.  Does the Minister know how much tax it paid?  It paid &euro;250 on profits of &euro;9 million.  That is not acceptable, and it is not fair in light of everything we have seen.  We talk about tax avoidance, the Paradise Papers and so on, and politicians will tut-tut at this and tut-tut at that.  This is about really smart accountants trying to find loopholes.  The Minister is engineering the loopholes into the Finance Bill.  This was done deliberately last year.  How can the Minister stand over a company which loaned out &euro;160 million and made in the region of &euro;9 million profit on those loans to Irish businesses, including the Mater Private Hospital and Abrakebabra as examples, paying only &euro;250 tax on its profits?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#F00700","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1195,"content":"<p>Section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 sets out the Irish regime for the taxation of special purpose companies set up to securitise assets.  The tax provisions are intended to create a tax neutral regime for securitisation and structured finance purposes.<\/p>  <p>  Loan originations involve a section 110 company fronting for a foreign bank and either lending directly to larger more sophisticated borrowers, or immediately issuing newly made loans to smaller borrowers from the foreign bank.  Provided the foreign bank is established in one of the countries with which we have signed a double tax agreement, no Irish tax would have arisen on its interest income had it lent directly to the Irish borrowers.  As the original creditor, there can be no taxable capital gain on any subsequent sale of the loans.  If the loan origination company is a qualifying company, within the meaning of section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, it can to operate in a tax neutral manner in Ireland using a section 110 company.  <\/p>  <p>  In respect of the Finance Act 2016 changes, the desire was to address behaviour and issues in the area of property and property-based loans.  I acknowledge, however, that issues outside property are more complex and I want to ensure that section 110 operates in a proper manner.  If concerns are raised about the operation of section 110 in the loan origination space, I will ask the Revenue Commissioners and my officials to investigate these concerns.  I am not, therefore, in a position to accept the amendment.<\/p>  <p>  I will make two points.  First, neither I nor the Revenue Commissioners are engaged in any kind of engineering or drafting of legislation to allow companies or individuals to avoid tax we believe they should pay.  Second, I know some of this was touched on yesterday with the Minister of State, Michael D'Arcy, but I am aware of all of the debate on, and changes which were subsequently made to, the Finance Bill 2016 with regard to section 110 companies and organisations as well as property transactions and lending in that regard.  I am aware of concerns that have been raised recently, but the Revenue Commissioners have told me that its assessment is that no tax which could have been due has been lost in this space.  However, if I receive any indication from the Revenue Commissioners or from my Department that is no longer the case and that issues are developing in the loan origination space which need to be addressed, I will look at those issues.  <\/p>  <p>  I will not comment on the information which the Deputy has offered in respect of an individual company because it is not appropriate for me to do so, but any companies in the loan origination space should be meeting their tax commitments in Ireland.

I would not suggest otherwise.  Last year, when the Oireachtas dealt with section 110, a carve-out for loan origination was clearly written into the Bill.  These changes did not apply to loan origination.  Therefore, these companies can still use section 110 vehicles to write down their tax liabilities.  They have special purpose vehicles under section 110 which neutralise, or almost neutralise, their tax liabilities.  Therefore, neither the Revenue Commissioners nor I would in any way suggest that Revenue is developing policy for tax avoidance.  I have huge regard for the Revenue Commissioners.  The accusation I made was about the Minister and his Government, not the Revenue Commissioners.  Let us be clear - the Revenue Commissioners are not losing any tax on this because it has to apply the law and the law says that companies can use this vehicle in order to pay such low taxes.<\/p>  <p>  We can talk about section 110, we can talk about special purpose vehicles and we can talk about loan origination, but my basic question is as follows.  I gave BlueBay as an example.  I know the Minister cannot talk about an individual company but its files are on record.  It paid &euro;250 in tax.  It is involved with the State through the Irish Strategic Investment Fund.  Cardinal Capital Group is using the exact same vehicle.  It has not filed its returns yet, but it is likely that the same figure of &euro;250 will appear.  The key question is that if a company has loaned out &euro;160 million, for example, at a rate of 6% and made profit of in the region of &euro;9 million, how does the Minister for Finance stand over the fact that it only paid &euro;250 in tax on that profit.

We do not maintain the same taxing rights over loans that derive their value from other sources, for example, a business within the State.  As I touched on earlier, loan origination involves a section 110 company which is fronting for a foreign bank and lending directly to larger borrowers, etc.  If that bank is established in a country with which we have signed a double taxation treaty, no Irish tax would have arisen on its interest income had it lent directly to the Irish borrowers.

In this context, it is strikingly obvious from the report of the Paradise Papers and the Panama Papers that significant numbers of individuals and companies do not just want low taxes.  Rather, they want to pay no tax in whatever global situation or company they work in.<\/p><p>I have raised this issue on a number of occasions over a long period of time.  In the context of the most recent revelations and the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, regardless of whether there is a long transition period, this is something we in Ireland have to address.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the fact that we have a very clearly stated rate of corporation tax and other taxes, people who operate with the intention to avoid or evade taxation and use a globalised financial, taxation and legal system to do so can avoid paying any tax in Ireland.  It is in that context that I put forward this amendment.<\/p><p>I heard a representative of the OECD, whom I have met on many occasions, speak on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; earlier.  When I was a member of the previous Government, I was probably the strongest advocate for Ireland joining the OECD process in regard to broad tax reform with a view to benefiting all countries, including Ireland.  I did not want the country's eyes wiped by accountants, lawyers and others who play a globalised game, in terms of desperately needed tax revenues for this country.<\/p><p>Ultimately, such behaviour is probably one of the greatest threats to modern democracies because it is resulting in a skewed and unfair system.  As revelations in various disclosures have shown - there will be more - some people are getting away with it because of the global structures in which they are involved.<\/p><p>Ireland has an extensive range of tax treaties with other jurisdictions.  Jurisdictions which were part of the British empire are the most effective and efficient forms of tax avoidance locations anyone in the world has seen.  <\/p>  <p>               There are a number of states in the United States which specialise in this area as well.<br\/><br\/>We have a problem.  We also have a problem, as the Minister is well aware, with our neighbours in the European Union who, understandably, at times have a concern and at times pick unfairly on Ireland because they believe that, due to our corporation tax regime, we are a major facilitator.  We know the current discussions in regard to the Apple case.  What I am suggesting to the Minister is that he produce a report on a minimum effective tax rate.  His predecessor had certain objections to this, which I have to confess I never fully understood.  A minimum tax rate can be set very low but it does a couple of things.  From a tax point of view, it means that the corporation comes into a potentially meaningful relationship, a documentary relationship, with the tax authorities in this country, other than filing a simple return at the end of which is a big nought, because it does not have anything to pay, or at the end of which is an amount that is so low in regard to its taxable profit that it defies the understanding of ordinary citizens.  I do not believe the Government has anything to fear from such a report.  In fact, in the context of the current revelations, and perhaps the strategic communications unit could be consulted on this, there is much to be said for the Irish Government not disregarding Irish interests but addressing these issues and developing an awareness of what is coming down the tracks.<br\/><br\/>What is coming down the tracks is a way of doing this that a number of jurisdictions have already shown and debated. ?  Obviously, I do not know if this is this going to take a short or a long time, although the Minister may have more information on that.  He is attending ECOFIN and I am sure some of these issues will come up.  As I said, this issue in regard to income tax was addressed by one of his predecessors quite a long time ago.  That was done by agreement and the sky did not fall in, although many were fearful the sky would fall in.  Instead, very wealthy people who are resident in this country have to contribute a minimum effective tax rate whereas the Revenue Commissioners' reports had previously shown that people earning in excess of &euro;1 million annually were paying no tax at all because of the arrangements they had entered into.<br\/><br\/>The report is to be on the merits of a minimum effective tax rate.  This would require whoever was drawing up the report on behalf of the Government to address the downsides of having a structure which is riddled with loopholes like a sieve and which, because of the secrecy surrounding taxation affairs, we always learn about some years later.  That we are not doing this is absolutely undermining our democracy and the democracy of many other countries.  I am sure there are people, particularly within the Revenue Commissioners, who are very knowledgeable about this and who could produce a measured and thoughtful report about what this is doing to the country, the implications for democracy, the implications for the fairness and equity of the tax system and fairness to different classes of taxpayer and the implications for the future strong, positive and robust development of the country.  We are at risk, post-Brexit, not just of becoming an outlier but, in the eyes of some, of acquiring a kind of pariah status, which is deeply unfair to this country and, strategically, is something the Government should be very careful about.  As I said, there was a lot of opposition in previous Governments, at a time when I do not think the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, was a member of Government, to the idea that we would, for example, pursue the OECD process.  We pursued the OECD process and, if anything, it has been very helpful to the country in that the OECD was able to come out at various stages and say that Ireland is not a tax haven <i>per se<\/i>, which has been very important for our international reputation.  It would also be very important to future investments in this country as very big global investors will seek to be in environments that are not labelled simply as tax-dodging entities.<br\/><br\/>I would be interested in what the Minister has to say on this as I think it is fundamental to securing the future of this country.  The Minister referred to banks not having any scheme to mitigate the use of carrying losses forward.  He talked about that in terms of giving a payback to the taxpayers for what they had done for the banks.  However, the Minister must seek to defend in a serious way the reputation of the country, which is being shredded.  The Taoiseach may be very friendly with the President of France, Mr. Macron, but that is not going to cut much ice when Italy and France join up effectively, as they are doing at the moment and have been doing for some time, to address these issues.<br\/><br\/>The other issue is that some of the companies involved are so large that it is relatively easy to identify, say, the ten or 15 which may be most involved, certainly from our point of view.  The old excuse is that we cannot discuss this on grounds of secrecy but these entities are so large and so much part of people's day-to-day lives that they are not secret.  I totally agree with the adherence to secrecy in terms of taxpayers' affairs but, when the entity has multiples of the entire output of Ireland and multiples of the reach of Ireland, while it is not a country and is a company, fresh thinking is required.<br\/><br\/>The process began two budgets ago when the Government began to bring in people like Seamus Coffey to prepare reports.  All I can say is that, whether one agrees with those reports or not, their production has been extremely useful and helpful to the country and its reputation.  I am interested to hear whether the Minister is going to pretend this is not the world we are living in now.  We need to look at this issue and be able to talk about it.  We need to defend the rights of Ireland to attract foreign direct investment and the jobs it brings.  We need to have a fair tax system, but one that results in corporations paying minimum taxes.  There is no point in saying that, in practice, these very big companies actually do pay something; we need to have a structure that we can point to, and we need to pick a figure, for example, 6.5% or 7.5%, which is a very modest figure.  We need to do that so we are able to turn around in the future and defend our location as a very attractive location for foreign direct investment.  We need also to be able to reassure those companies that the environment in which they are operating is genuinely lawful and not damaging to the rest of the world.<br\/><br\/>These are very big issues.  The proposal is to look at minimum effective tax rates.  One can pick different kinds of minimum effective tax rates and it would be for whoever the Minister might commission to work on this.  Ten years ago we could not get any information about how much the highest and lowest individual taxpayers paid in tax.  <\/p>  <p>               Gradually we got information about that and that enabled us to change the system.<\/p> <p> At the moment Ireland is being called out and named, unfairly in some respects, as being among the worst culprits mentioned in the recent revelations.  We need to put our collective information and intelligence on this matter together because otherwise we risk becoming a pariah country, something we do not deserve.  We should not receive such treatment but the Minister is going to have to take some decisions to address this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#J00900","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1221,"content":"<p>We are indeed taking decisions on these matters and implementing them.  I am well aware of the consequences of the growing public debate over the international and domestic taxation of massive companies.  I am also well aware of the legitimacy challenges that this poses for individual taxpayers and of the consequences for our national reputation.  As one might expect given the gravity of the matter, I put a huge amount of my time as Minister for Finance into managing this.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate a number of points here.  I am completely committed to the OECD process because it has, to date, generated a global template for dealing with corporate tax matters.  I have avoided commenting on the details of any particular company mentioned in the Paradise Papers or in the Panama Papers before that.  As was reiterated by the OECD contributor on Morning Ireland today, however, we can draw the broad conclusion that a global solution is required here.  Part of such a global solution would involve many companies moving at the same time or having the same pathway towards resolving this matter.  We have both the OECD agenda and the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, BEPS, process at the heart of much of what we have done and are looking to do.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the contribution made by Mr. Seamus Coffey's report on this matter and I have put it out for public consultation.  The Finance Bill 2017 lays the foundations for many of the other changes and decisions I will be making into the next year and beyond in order to continue to bring the Irish corporate tax code into line with the OECD recommendations.  I will carry all of this out.  I want our corporate tax code to be both acknowledged by all to be legitimate and to leave us competitive.  We will pursue both of these objectives and are on a path to doing so.  The OECD contributor on Morning Ireland today recognised that, after a period of debate which is understandable given the open nature of our economy, Ireland has indeed put in place actions to ensure that we play our part in the co-ordinated actions necessary to deal with the consequences of unco-ordinated tax regimes all over world and with what certain companies and very wealthy have been trying to do.  At the next Eurogroup and ECOFIN meeting, for example, recommendations will come from the European Commission on the creation and consequences of a so-called blacklist.  Ireland will play its full role in dealing with these matters because it is in our national interest to have them resolved. This is what we are trying to do here.<\/p>  <p>  What I have to manage, however, is the other side of the coin, namely, the fact that we have a corporate tax model that is both a legitimate response and a legitimate element of the economic model of a small, open country located where we are in Europe.  As a result of Brexit and the process of  moving towards leaving the European Union by the end of transition period, the United Kingdom is now already committed to making choices on its corporate tax model and on reducing the headline rate.  This means that companies will look at what the United Kingdom is doing as well as at their own locations and investments here in Ireland, and this is something of which I also have to be aware as I outline a path for how we want to ensure that our own corporate tax model is both competitive and legitimate.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Burton talked about our reputation being shredded.  I ask her to also take into account, however, the efforts we have made to deal with matters over the past few years as well as our clear commitment to the OECD process.  The Deputy talked about secrecy but I think she also acknowledged that I, as Minister for Finance, owe it to anybody with tax relationships and commitments here in Ireland to be able to have private exchanges of information with the Revenue Commissioners.  I cannot comment on that.  It is a principle to which I must adhere but it must be fair and equal to all.  Deputy Burton mentioned our reputation as being among the worst culprits.  Again, however, the OECD representative acknowledged this morning that Ireland is playing and has played its part in already inserting OECD recommendations into our tax code.  The former Minister, Deputy Noonan, signed up to further elements of the BEPS process some time ago and I look forward to enacting these measures.  Further recommendations will come from the OECD across the first half of next year.  We will work with these constructively so as to see how a consensus can be generated on how to deal with other aspects now emerging as important:  digital taxation, for example.  This committee would of course also hold me accountable if I were to follow any course of action that then turned out to be responsible for the loss of Irish jobs and investment.  What I have described here is the pathway that I am following and what it is that I am seeking to manage.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to what Deputy Burton proposes in this amendment, a paper of this nature was, as the Deputy is aware, produced in 2014.   This paper acknowledged that there is no internationally agreed standard for calculating effective rates of tax.  It agreed on three different methodologies for doing so, laid out the different options for each, and analysed in greater detail eight different figures quoted in respect of Ireland.  The paper also concluded that the approach based on national aggregate statistics from the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Statistics Office is the most suitable.  Based on data from the Central Statistics Office, using the net operating surplus, and from the Revenue Commissioners, using the taxable income, the report highlighted that since 2003 the effective corporate tax rate has averaged 10.9% and 10.7% respectively.  More recent analysis by the Revenue Commissioners noted that the effective tax rate of companies in 2015 was provisionally calculated as 9.8%, representing an only marginal increase on the 2014 rate of 9.7%.  In 2012 and 2013, the effective rate was 10.1%.  I would note that while these percentages are lower than the 12.5% headline rate, this can be attributed to the availability of the small number of targeted measures, such as the research and development tax credit. <\/p>  <p>   Given how recently this paper was produced, then, and given my commitment to the implementation of the OECD process to date, I do not accept Deputy Burton's amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#L00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1222,"content":"<p>I am sure that the Minister knows that the premise on which that particular 2014 report was produced is not appropriate to the dilemma now faced by this country on this matter.  We have already had a number of examples in this debate of  prominent companies and structures of one kind or another which have had the happy result for their owners of being able to avoid paying practically any corporation tax.  <\/p>  <p>               If the Minister tells me that the shops on the main street of a town or the SMEs or the like on industrial estates and in warehouses on the outskirts of towns are paying between 7% and 11%, I have no difficulty in accepting that.  They are not able to avail of the types of structure available to certain categories which we have already discussed during the debate on the Bill.<\/p> <p> Second, I did not say Ireland was the worst.  That is not my view.  I said something different, that the country's reputation was being shredded at a time when we needed friends.  Yes, people might admire some of what is happening in Ireland, but the fact that we have some of the largest global companies and that we have a finance sector and a number of others that involve not SMEs but the very wealthy in very effective tax avoidance and tax evasion schemes ought to be of serious concern to the Minister.  It ought to be of particular concern because of what is coming down the road post-Brexit and may start within the transition period, as we do not know how long it will be.  It is also something that is gnawing at the foundations of democracy.  In the long run it is a short-sighted view to try to argue, as the Minister is doing, that we should continue in this way.  During the last Government it was part of the reason Ireland signed up to the OECD process, with which not everybody agreed.  The views of Fine Gael on this issue are very different from those of the Labour Party and it was a difficult debate in that Government.  However, it resulted in a process that improved Irish compliance with international tax norms while retaining Ireland's attraction as a foreign direct investment location.<\/p> <p> The report to which the Minister referred is interesting, but I would not put too much faith in it addressing the types of issue I am addressing.  I am not addressing people and companies in Ireland who are tax compliant and pay their fair share.  Nobody has a problem with any of them as they are providing employment throughout the country.  However, I do have a problem with situations where zero or close to zero - we had an example this morning - ends up being the contribution they make to this society.  All I am suggesting is a simple mechanism.  It does not have to be at a high, punitive rate.  It also means that the Revenue Commissioners would be put in a stronger position to deal with those companies and get behind how such situations are facilitated.<\/p> <p> On a wider basis, the country must respond to what is in contained the Paradise Papers and what was previously in the Panama Papers.  I had discussions on this issue with the Minister's predecessor and the then Taoiseach.  It is not avoidable in the long term.  This is a very simple mechanism.  The Minister can go to the OECD and the ECOFIN meetings and say we are looking at bringing it into effect.  Fine Gael is part of the European People's Party in the European Union.  It is a union of very conservative parties.  The Labour Party belongs to the group of socialist parties.  There are genuine differences that have to be resolved in the interests of the continuation and viability of the European Union.<\/p> <p> I am very disappointed by the Minister's response.  He made a charge about me that I did not make.  I ask him to note this.  However, I did say our reputation was being shredded.  I am a strong supporter of Ireland in attracting international investment.  I have worked with multinational companies, both professionally and politically, in my career.  In the long run they cannot avoid what is happening to them in the exposure of their tax avoidance.  The country needs to address that issue and this is an element of doing it.  There were good examples in the debate earlier this morning of situations that were broadly unacceptable.  This is always a game of catch-up.  The Revenue Commissioners simply do not have enough resources to keep up with all of the loopholes as they inevitably develop.  Nobody is asking the Minister to be able to see the future, but we must deal with what we know and, whether he Minister likes it, we all know now about the Paradise Papers.  Some of it is what we suspected and some of it is material of which we had no knowledge.<\/p> <p> This is a very modest proposal to address an important issue for the country.  If the Minister wishes to put it into another format, I will be happy to hear what suggestions he might have to make.  That has been done previously and it worked out to everybody's advantage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#L00300","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1224,"content":"<p>I support Deputy Joan Burton's amendment which is a sensible one.  It proposes that we examine the merits of having such an effective tax rate.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to comment on and question the Minister's current position on a number of matters.  Listening to him one would think the Government was great in leading the charge on the issue of tax transparency in the global process and whatnot and that it should be patted on the back for all of the things it has done.  I have mentioned the OECD report on which the Government continues to rely, but only one country in the world, Trinidad and Tobago, is non-compliant.  All of the rest are either compliant or partially compliant.  In addition, it is only about the transfer of tax information.  It does not delve into the issue with which the Minister is dealing - State-sponsored tax evasion.  What he is doing, with the support of Fianna F&aacute;il, is engaging in State-sponsored tax evasion.  As I said about the previous amendment, it allows companies to pay &euro;250 in tax on profits of &euro;9 million.  It allows a company such as AIB in which we have large a shareholding to record profits of &euro;1.5 billion and pay no corporation tax.  If that is not State-sponsored tax evasion, I do not know what is.<\/p>  <p>  The issue is that the Government has been dragged kicking and screaming on many of these matters.  Yes, it closed the double Irish, but did it really do so?  It will still be in place until 2020.  That should not be forgotten if we wish to be accurate about all of the information available.  Anybody who used the double Irish can continue to use it until 2020.  However, the Government did it under massive pressure from us in the Opposition - I will not rehash all of was said to the effect that nothing could be done - and international pressure.  With regard to the stateless companies which I wrote legislation to close, the Government denied time and again that it had the ability to close them.  Then it had to do it because the CEO of Apple gave sworn testimony before the US Senate that he had done a deal - I was going to say a dirty deal - with the Irish authorities to reduce its tax liability to single digits.  At the time he referred to a figure of 2%.  Both he and the head of tax, Mr. Bullock, gave that sworn testimony and there was an international outcry that Ireland was doing this.  What did we do?  We eventually closed the stateless companies.  It was known to the authorities here that they were operating in the State.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the black list the Minister mentioned, does he now support the Commission's view that there should be a black list?  Does he also now support public country by country reporting?  I remind him, if he needs to be reminded, that he and his colleagues in Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il voted in the D&aacute;il last year to block an EU directive that would have required public country by country reporting, not privately or what takes place in the information being shared by revenue authorities.  It is the public part of that information which relates to companies with a turnover or profits of &euro;750 million.  The Minister, with his colleagues in Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, voted against the European directive.  <\/p>  <p>               At the time the Government argued that the Commission should not have a role as regards black lists which was an issue which should only be determined by national parliaments.  Does the Minister support that view?  The Irish Parliament, against the wishes of Sinn F&eacute;in, Solidarity and a number of other smaller parties, voted to use the provisions of the Lisbon treaty to fly the flag of subsidiarity and argued that the European Commission did not have the right to introduce the directive which was related to tax transparency.  The Minister should not try to pretend that the Government is leading the charge in any of this.  It tried to block the European Commission directive on public transparency which sought to provide for country by country reporting.  Imagine if it had come in; we would have been able to see where the taxes of Apple or other larger multi-national companies were being paid.  This is State-sponsored tax evasion, but there is nothing illegal about it because the Government is in charge.  <\/p> <p> Big companies can engage in tax evasion because of Governments such as the one of which the Minister is a member.  He can sit before this committee and justify the banks not having to pay tax for the next 20 years.  Companies which record profits running to millions of euro can use vehicles that allow them to reduce their tax liability to &euro;250.   Ireland has opened the door to intellectual property and intangible assets being placed onshore.  This allowed Apple to write-off billions of euro in tax.  This Finance Bill will ensure Apple will not pay any of these taxes because the Minister is ensuring any of the intellectual property placed onshore until the date of the budget may be used as a capital allowance against profits.  That is what he is doing.  We can talk about competitiveness and so on, but I have a responsibility to spell it out that this is State-sponsored tax evasion.  <\/p> <p> I am sick of hearing politicians on \"Morning Ireland\" or other radio and television programmes tut-tutting about these companies getting away with blue murder when they sit on the finance committee and vote through legislation that enables them to do precisely that.  If it was illegal, those doing it would be behind bars, but it is perfectly legal because people like the Minister, with his friends in Fianna F&aacute;il, allow legislation to be drafted in a way which enables multinational corporations and the elites in society not to pay their fair share of taxes.  Does the Minister now support the European Commission in introducing a black list of tax havens?  Does he support the European Commission's directive on public country by country reporting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#M00200","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1226,"content":"<p>I will make two points about Ireland's effective corporation tax rate as it relates to Brexit.  We are using a great deal of diplomatic capital on Brexit.  Inevitably, during conversations with European colleagues the isse of Ireland's corporation tax rate is raised.  We will come under pressure over it.  Much has been done in recent years, including the placing onshore of intellectual property, the closing of the double Irish and much more.  New Commission data have been released which are independent and which show the effective corporate tax rates of all European countries.  Ireland's performance is fine.  The data strip away the headline rates of 35% or 40% for some of the bigger countries and look at what is being paid.  In that context, Ireland is fine.  It might be worth circulating the data. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has an opportunity to communicate better in this area.  Recently I was discussing Brexit with a European politician, one of those leading the work on European tax rates, and he raised the issue of Ireland's corporation tax rate.  I outlined the various changes which had been made and noted that in 2015, as a result of some of these changes, our corporation tax take had increased by 50%, which was unheard of and cash proof that the loopholes had been closed.  He said that information was not well known in the Commission.  It is very powerful information which shows that corporation tax returns here have increased. <\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has been sniping away bombastically for ten minutes about Fianna F&aacute;il and I want to respond.  The single greatest tax avoidance measure was section 110 used by vulture funds.  I worked on the matter last year and it was Deputy Michael McGrath who said Fianna F&aacute;il would not support the budget unless the changes were made.  That was Fianna F&aacute;il's contribution, rather than hiding behind the couch and telling others what they should do.  Fianna F&aacute;il stated it would not support the Finance Bill unless there were changes to section 110 and those changes were made.  When Sinn F&eacute;in was in charge in Northern Ireland - it no longer is because it is unwilling to form an executive - it was a Sinn F&eacute;in member of the finance committee who proudly announced that they were reducing the corporation tax rate in Northern Ireland to 12.5%.  In the one jurisdiction where it could do something it provided for a massive reduction in corporation tax rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#N00200","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1227,"content":"<p>That did not happen.

That was one of the main points raised.  It is clear that there is no consensus on how minimum effective rates should be calculated.  The Coffey report of 2014 was a very good one.  Perhaps it should be updated, but it did not substantiate the frequently made claims that the effective rates were in the order of between 2% and 5%.  I am concerned about some of the long-established reliefs which were limited because we had a very broad tax base, notwithstanding our discussion on how losses affected the banks which was most exceptional, rather we should discuss the issue of losses generally, research and development tax credits and the treatment of capital allowances.  If after applying all of these, one was to arrive at a certain taxable profit and apply the 12.5% rate and it came into conflict with the minimum effective rate one might set in a hypothetical scenario, would the achievement of the minimum effective rate supersede retaining the key pillars of the corporation tax code for research and development, capital allowances and losses?  There is a potential conflict which must be acknowledged.  These are legitimate deductions which are part of the corporation tax code and which could potentially come into conflict with achieving a certain minimum effective rate, depending on how one would measure it.  Anyone who reads the report which runs to over 40 pages will see clearly that there is no consensus on how minimum effective rates could be achieved.  It is the case that Ireland does not have as many reliefs and allowable tax deductions as many other jurisdictions in Europe.  We have seen the analysis in which countries such as France which have higher headline rates end up with much lower effective corporation tax rates.  That should be acknowledged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#N00400","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1229,"content":"<p>If I was to participate in anything which had the immediate effect of risking the loss of Irish jobs, the first party that would condemn me would be Sinn F&eacute;in.

I have to ensure we change the tax code in a way that is compliant and consistent with the evolving international consensus.  We have done so and will continue to do so.  Deputy Pearse Doherty can point to the role he played in that debate, but the then Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, recognised the need in key areas and made the changes at a time when there was a risk that they could undermine Irish jobs and the contribution corporation tax receipts made in funding public services.  <\/p>  <p>               For the Deputy to come in here and suggest the previous Minister made those changes because of the role of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party in the debate that took place ill serves the contribution Deputy Noonan made to putting in place the foundations for the reforms that are needed in regard to corporation tax, changes that were acknowledged this morning by the OECD.  We are a small open economy and changes like these can, of course, have a significant effect on the economic fortunes of our country.  The then Minister, Deputy Noonan, through the changes he made in respect of stateless companies and the double Irish arrangement, which were touched on by other speakers, began the process of change that was needed and which he proceeded to implement in regard to corporation tax.  Nobody should be under any doubt that if I went ahead and did things which undermined the predictability and competitiveness of the Irish corporation tax model, which has played a valuable role in creating Irish jobs, one of the first parties to condemn me for doing so would be Sinn F&eacute;in, led by Deputy Doherty.  The agenda I need to deliver now and in the coming years requires implementing the changes that are needed to ensure our business and tax models meet the expectations and requirements that are there from an OECD perspective and elsewhere while at the same time ensuring the competitiveness of our country is not undermined in a changing Europe and a changing world.

I am aware of the changes we have signed up to and of the new environment in which our corporate tax model is operating.  I am seeking a pathway that will enable us to maintain Irish employment and Irish investment while also creating a sustainable route to addressing the issues and needs that are there.  We have a pathway to how we will do some of that and I expect we will get further ideas and contributions from the consultation that is under way on the Coffey report on corporation tax, all of which I will respond to in the new year.  I am aware of the debate that is ongoing on changing taxation models and the evolving views on how larger companies operate.  As I said earlier, it continues to be my view that companies should pay a fair share of tax and should make their contribution to the societies upon which they depend.<\/p>  <p> Deputy Doherty asked about the European Council's EU tax blacklist.  I look forward to seeing that report, which we expect will be presented at the European Council of Finance Ministers, ECOFIN, meeting on 5 December.

I look forward to Commissioner Moscovici and the other members of the Council getting back to me with the work in that area throughout November.<\/p>  <p>  I do not support public country-by-country reporting for the very good reason that we have a long-standing principle in this country that the exchange of information between companies or individuals and the tax authority is confidential.  That confidentiality in managing information will allow us to continue to make progress on the different issues we need to address.  To reiterate, here in Ireland, exchange of information between the Revenue Commissioners and a company or individual is private.  That is not the same as saying I support tax evasion.  In recent years, the Revenue Commissioners have collected an extra &euro;1 billion by dealing with activity that is illegal in regard to tax avoidance, including offshore tax avoidance.  They will continue to do that work and I will provide any resources or further powers needed to allow them to do it.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Donnelly spoke about the need to tell our story when it comes to the discussion around corporation tax.  I have been telling that story in this committee in recent days and it is a story I tell on almost a monthly basis in our Eurogroup and ECOFIN meetings.  Together with the Finance Ministers of Italy, Germany and the Netherlands, I went before the PANA Committee of the European Parliament some weeks ago and outlined what Ireland has done in respect of corporate tax.  It is a story we need to keep telling.  I have met Commissioner Moscovici and Commissioner Dombrovskis on several occasions, both of whom are involved in this area, and outlined what Ireland has done and our commitment to playing a constructive role in this debate in the future.  We must continue to point to what we have achieved, including the growth in Irish corporation tax receipts and the progress we have made in eliminating issues which we acknowledged needed to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy McGrath cuts to the heart of all this when he asks what the trade off would be between a minimum effective tax rate, on the one hand and, on the other, the fact we have a broad corporation tax base with a limited number of credits against which companies can reduce their liability and where the difference between our headline tax rate and the effective rate is far narrower than is the case for other interests who make charges against our country in this area.  The journey between Ireland's effective tax rate and nominal tax rate is far smaller than it is in other European Union jurisdictions.  The desire to be predictable, competitive and legitimate is at the heart of our tax model.  Deputy Burton understands these issues well because she has participated, as she acknowledged, in the types of missions in which we seek to work with international companies to retain the jobs they have created in Ireland and encourage them to create even more employment here.  The Deputy knows that the value of predictability and certainty in our tax code is really important.  It is for this reason that I am not in a position to support a minimum tax rate.  For me to signal in this committee that I will support a proposal for the bringing forward of a report outlining the merits of that approach would undermine our efforts to tell the strong story we have to tell in regard to our efforts at implementing corporate tax reform while also retaining the jobs we have and attracting more jobs into our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#O00700","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1237,"content":"<p>I wish to reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#P00100","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1238,"content":"<p>I will go back to the Deputy in a moment.

The discussion earlier was in relation to the banks and their very significant profits running into the hundreds of millions, and probably into billions in the next year or two.  It does not matter what the tax rules are.  There is something absurd in a country where there is a desperate need to fund both investment and services to have extraordinarily profitable institutions bailed out by the taxpayer who are not making any current contribution.  The remedy on that is very simple.  It is brought in at a certain level of profit so that there is no problem for a company in a run-of-the mill situation where it has had a lot of capital investment and it may have had losses in the context of building a start-up.  It is set at a certain level and once a company has attained a certain level of profitability it must contribute.  That is what we have done in regard to high net worth individuals and therefore it just affects that category of people.  It is a targeted approach.  SMEs are highly unlikely ever to be affected by this.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the contacts with other European countries, I think the baseline studies that have been done to establish what real effective tax levels exist in different countries are very important because every country has different rules and there is no compatibility in those rules.  However, in terms of the BEPS process, it is a long-range one, which I support.  I have publicly and privately supported it.  I am happy to say the Government of which I was a member eventually supported it.  That made a lot of sense for Ireland.  I am basically challenging the Minister to continue that work in a way that will develop and protect Ireland's reputation rather than make us the target for future punitive action.<\/p>  <p>  From what the Minister said in terms of ECOFIN, it may well be that most European countries have now decided to take a bit of a step back from all of this and to talk the talk but not particularly to take action.  In terms of the European Union itself, unless there is a way in which the fairness and equity of taxation is visible to citizens in terms of how they are treated for taxation purposes by government in all sorts of different ways and compare that with companies, in particular a clutch of key, globalised companies who effectively are outside the jurisdiction of most countries.  What has been shown in the Paradise and Panama papers is the use of globalised mechanisms.  All we can do is to address those mechanisms as they arise.  We had some debates on the issue here.  There was an example of a company with significant profits paying &euro;250 in tax.  It is very reasonable to ask how that happens.  If somebody earns &euro;30,000 a year he or she will still make some contribution even though in the scheme of things it is not a lot of money.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister and his fellow ECOFIN Ministers must consider the principles of equity and what in the long run is the best for sustaining countries.  I am interested in the long run in Ireland being attractive to foreign direct investment.  I am interested in Ireland being attractive for Irish SMEs and in Ireland creating employment.  I have always stood by that and the Labour Party has always stood by that.  The Minister is running away from the issue and seeking to wrap it up in a message that all is now fine; there is nothing to see here, move on.  That is not true.  We know, for instance, from the report of the Revenue Commissioners themselves on the black box and the R&amp;D tax credit that we are now paying refunds to companies that are paying no corporation tax.  On the scale of things that is a small problem but it is a problem that requires to be addressed.  I put it to the Minister that the essence of taxation is that it is something that is in a constant state of flux and development and I am seeking that Ireland protects the integrity of its tax system as regards companies and corporations by having a structure on minimum effective tax rates.  That is all.  It is going to protect Ireland not cause any damage and it is going to improve fairness relative to ordinary taxpayers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#P00500","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1242,"content":"<p>Is Deputy Burton pressing the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#P00600","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1243,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#P00700","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"vote","time":1510221600,"counter":1244,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 3; N\u00edl, 3.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p><\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#Q00100","aye":["1253","1288","1433"],"nay":["1369","1292","1328"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510221600,"counter":1245,"content":"<p>Staon: Deputy Michael McGrath and Deputy John McGuinness.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510221600,"counter":1246,"content":"<p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1247,"content":"<p>Deputies Michael McGrath and I have voted to abstain.

My amendment on intangible assets to change the date to an earlier one has been ruled out of order because it involves a potential cost on the people.

It is not just for development land but all types of land and commercial assets bought during the period.  I have made the point, for example, that somebody who purchased a hotel some years ago, for whom the seven-year timeframe has not elapsed and who plans to sell it next year, will not pay capital gains tax at the rate of 33% on the gains made.  That is wrong.  I support the principle behind the amendment and the rationale for it that has been played out publicly.  It also fits in with what I said about the five-year dividend withholding tax exemption.

As regards land, the relief makes no distinction as to how the land is being utilised or whether it has development potential.  This is in line with the original relief introduced in the Finance Act 2012, which is now section 604A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The legislation was framed in this way because it is not possible to treat one type of land more favourably than another.  That is the rationale for my not accepting the Deputy's amendment.  I believe this change is justified given the current status of the property market and the need for land to be released for development use.  I anticipate that some of this land will be used for residential development.  This is a policy change that should be seen in the light of the decision I have made in regard to stamp duty on commercial property.  These two measures should be viewed together.<\/p> <p> In regard to Deputy McGrath's point, we do not have a register of property to which this might apply but I do have ample indications to show that this does have the potential to stimulate the release of property throughout the course of next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#Q01500","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1263,"content":"<p>The Minister's point is that it is not possible to differentiate between development land and non-development land, which was the focus of my amendment.

I think that reduction in timeframe should only be available in respect of disposals which we know will result in development.  However, the Minister has responded that no such differentiation can be made, which is fair enough.  It being the case that this measure will apply to all land whether it has development potential or not, why are buildings included?  I refer members to the case of the hotel purchased in 2003.  As things stand, if the owners of properties purchased between the 2011 and 2014 window, be that an office block, a shopping centre and so on, propose to sell next year because they need to raise capital for other business ventures etc., and the uplift on their properties is &euro;500 million, they would have to pay approximately &euro;165 million in taxes, but following the implementation of this measure they will pay nothing in terms of capital gains tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#R00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1264,"content":"<p>Yes.

As far as I remember, in the run-up to this budget we did not get any estimates but our figures suggested that the net sum raised by the 0.1% and 0.01% would now be up to &euro;610 million given the growth of the financial sector.<\/p><p>The previous Minister for Finance always rejected this.  He always said, in terms of the European Union discussions, that the Government wanted an international solution and therefore did not want a European solution, which was effectively a recipe for doing nothing and certainly not taking any initiative from the point of view of Ireland.

I appreciate the study may be somewhat dated at this point but the report's conclusions are a useful indicator of the possible impact of introducing a financial transaction tax, FTT, in Ireland.  Given that it is Government policy not to introduce an FTT, I do not consider it prudent to allocate resources to further studies or exercises in this regard at this time.<\/p> <p> The joint Central Bank and Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, report recognises that assessing the likely impact on employment and tax yields due to migration of activity is difficult.  This continues to be the case as it is difficult to assess behaviour arising from the introduction of such a tax and second round impacts on investment and employment.  In 2012, the financial sector's share of overall economic output in Ireland was around twice as large as that of many other European countries and in 2016 it remained a significant element within the economy in terms of employment and gross value added.  There is significant employment in the sector with around 40,000 individuals employed in international financial services and 90,000 employed in general financial services.  The Central Bank and ESRI report sought to identify financial services sectors that could be impacted by an FTT.  It suggested that insurance, banking and financial intermediation, and fund management and security brokering were potentially vulnerable to an FTT.  Fund management in particular has been one of the growth areas of the financial services sector in Ireland, with some large employers and with a total estimated 14,500 employed in the sector.<\/p> <p> The UK intention to commence the process of leaving the European Union increases the difficulties of introducing such a tax given the potential for the UK to compete more strongly using different domestic measures for such financial services activities outside the EU.  The international financial services sector in Ireland is now a truly national industry, extending far-beyond the original Irish Financial Services Centre in Dublin&rsquo;s docklands.  The sector generates direct employment for approximately 40,000 people across over 400 companies, with an estimated one third of those jobs located outside the greater Dublin area.  It is a thriving and vibrant sector, which makes an important economic contribution to this country.  Indeed, the Government&rsquo;s 2015 strategy for the international financial services sector, IFS 2020, is to grow jobs to 45,000 by 2020.<\/p> <p> The firms with the highest propensity to migrate following the introduction of an FTT are likely to be in the non-banking sectors, which account for the smallest share of gross value added.  Nevertheless, it indicates that the relocation of even a small number of large international banks or fund administration firms would result in a loss of income tax revenue, corporation tax revenue and an increase in unemployment.  This would likely still be the impact now of introducing an FTT.  Ireland already has a tax on financial transactions, a stamp duty on transfers of shares in Irish incorporated companies, which currently stands at 1%.  The yield from this charge in 2016 was &euro;391.94 million and I understand receipts to the end of October 2017 were over &euro;361.41 million.  If Ireland was to participate in the FTT it would require us to abolish this stamp duty.<\/p> <p> With regard to discussions at EU level, the position taken by this Government and the previous Government&rsquo;s consistent position is that a financial transactions tax would be best applied on a wide international basis to include the major financial centres.  This would prevent the danger of activities gravitating to jurisdictions where taxes are not levied on financial transactions with a likely loss of employment and tax revenue.  Notwithstanding this, the previous Government was not prepared to stand in the way of EU member states that wished to work together to implement a financial transactions tax; in this regard, adoption of a decision formally authorising enhanced co-operation took place during the Irish Presidency of the European Union in January 2013.<\/p> <p> In any event, despite significant engagement by the relevant Member States there has been no agreement on the introduction of an FTT and it is not clear whether agreement will be achieved in the near future.  I am of the view there are potentially significant negative employment, economic, and tax yield impacts from introducing an FTT in Ireland and I have no plans to introduce such a tax.  Consequently, I oppose the Deputies' amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#AA00500","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1314,"content":"<p>The Government's rationale for not going for an FTT is revealing, as it is a reference to Brexit.  There is the possibility that the Brexit we see will be, as Mr. Jeremy Corbyn deemed it, a bargain basement Brexit, with Britain attempting a further race to the bottom in terms of tax of corporations and financial transactions etc. in the City of London.  The idea is that this is a particularly bad time for Ireland to consider a financial transaction tax because Britain may be going in that direction.  It is completely in thrall to the idea of a race to the bottom and the consequent logic.  From that, the only people who win will be the corporations and the people who lose will be those who depend on public services around the world.  That is the Government's logic.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Ireland being a tax haven, one can say something so many times one might even begin to believe it.  The idea that Ireland is not a tax haven but at the forefront of the fight against tax avoidance and tax evasion does not wash.  Oxfam did a report last year and found Ireland was the sixth worst country in the world in terms of being a corporate tax haven.  Mr. Philip Alston, UN special rapporteur on poverty, said that nobody believes Ireland is not a tax haven.  It stands in reality and a big part of that is the IFSC.  The Minister previously mentioned that 40,000 people are employed in the industry but this can be contrasted with the level of assets controlled in the IFSC or supposedly located there.  There is the classic example of 5 Harbourmaster Place.  I am not sure what the current position is but there were &euro;2 billion in assets and 250 companies located there but not a single employee.  There is very little social benefit as a result of these activities but a way of getting a social benefit would be to have a study for and ultimately to introduce a financial transactions tax.  The Government will not even consider it or having a study for that purpose, which is very revealing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#BB00200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510221600,"counter":1315,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1316,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 52:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 42, after line 36, to insert the following: <\/blockquote>  <p>&ldquo;CHAPTER 7<\/p><p><i>Landlords&rsquo; Tax<\/i><\/p> <blockquote> \t<b>30. <\/b>The Minister shall, within 6 months of the passing of this Act, bring a report on abolishing the Local Property Tax and replacing it with a Landlords&rsquo; Tax of &euro;600 per annum on a second home and &euro;1,000 per annum on a third and all subsequent homes.&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>  <p>This calls for a report on the abolition of the local property tax and replacing it with a landlords' tax of &euro;600 per annum on a second home and &euro;1,000 per annum on third and subsequent homes.

The local property tax is also a significant base-broadening measure.  The level of income expected to be generated by the local property tax in 2018 is in the region of &euro;470 million.  <\/p>  <p>               Deputies will be aware that, under the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact, Ireland may not introduce discretional revenue reductions unless they are matched by other revenue increases or expenditure reductions.  This means that the Government must consider carefully any tax changes as any reductions will have to be offset elsewhere.<\/p> <p> As regards abolition of the local property tax, LPT, it is now well established that the taxation of property through an annual recurring tax is less economically distortionary than the imposition of tax on either income or capital.  This is supported by economic literature and OECD analysis which underscores how an annual tax on land and buildings has a relatively small adverse impact on economic performance.  Both international and domestic research indicate that property taxes are more growth friendly than taxes on labour.<\/p> <p> The introduction of a property tax is part of a broader approach to the taxation of property.  The aim is to replace some of the revenue from transaction based taxes, which have proven to be an unstable source of Government revenue, with an annual recurring property tax, which international experience has shown to be a stable source of funding.<\/p> <p> In the local property tax we have a stable source of funding which is fair and progressive with the owners of the most valuable properties paying most.  The tax is equitable, has reference to ability to pay, conforms to international norms and significantly broadens the domestic tax base.<\/p> <p> We have seen in the past how over-reliance on revenue from transaction-based taxes, such as stamp duty, capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax, led to a significant fall in tax revenue when the number and value of transactions decreased sharply from 2007 onwards as a result of the economic and banking crisis thus creating enormous problems for Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal position.  I understand that a tax on second and subsequent non-family homes levied at &euro;600 for the second homes and &euro;1,000 on all subsequent properties would have an annual yield in the region of &euro;229 million.  This is based on those properties indicated to be non-principal private residencies by their owners in their LPT returns.

I appreciate it is tangential to the amendment, but deals with the taxation of landlords.<\/p>  <p>  For several years I have tabled amendments to try to create an exemption for accidental landlords to stop them from being double taxed.  This year I want to raise it and have a short conversation on it on Committee Stage in the hope that the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, and the Minister will introduce a Government amendment on Report Stage.  I am meeting the Minister, Deputy Donohoe on this matter later on this week.<\/p>  <p>  Let me take a brief moment to explain what is involved here.  Some people bought very small houses or apartments prior to 2008, when they did not have any children or perhaps one child.  They are in negative equity and now, ten or 11 years on from that, they have growing families.  They are in a trap.  The apartment which they own is too small.  I spoke to a family with young children living in an apartment not to long ago and they were wondering if their children would climb up and jump over the balcony.  They were not at all comfortable with raising their children in the apartment in which they lived.  People in this situation cannot sell the property because they are in negative equity.  They have one of the following options.  First, they can remain in the property and try to raise their children in a property that arguably was not designed for raising children and in which they are not comfortable for their children to be raised.  Second, they can move out and rent out their apartment and try to find a two or three bed semidetached house somewhere further out.  While their household finances have not changed at all, they are earning the same amount of money, and are paying out in rent the same as they receive for the rent of their apartment.<\/p>  <p>  The problem with this scenario is that their rental income is taxed at the marginal rate.  I have provided analysis to the previous Minister for Finance that showed that many people under very modest assumptions end up with tax bills of &euro;5,000 to &euro;6,000.  They are trapped.  They can do one of two things if they want to move, they can move and hope that the taxman never finds them because they do not have the money pay or they can move and pay the tax bill.  I have dealt with a number of cases where the couple's ability to save and dig their way out of negative equity is wiped out because all their saving goes in paying the huge tax bill that materialises.  They are trapped.  I know people who have left the country and moved abroad in order to be non-domiciled in the hope that it will all work out.  It is that serious.<\/p>  <p>  People's lives have been destroyed by this trap that has continued for ten years.  The tax system was never meant to do this.  The notion of negative equity creating accidental landlords was not considered when the taxation of rental income of landlords was considered.  I put it to the Minister of State that it is an unintended consequence of the tax system.<\/p>  <p>  When I previously tabled amendments to address this issue before, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, came back and consistently refused to accept them on the basis that it could be a loophole for other people to avoid paying taxes.  He said it was too easy to game the system.  Last year when I had this conversation with him, he laid out specific issues he had in terms of people being able to abuse it.  These people were not in fact accidental landlords at all.  I have met nobody in Government or anywhere in the House who believes that in the specific kind of case to which I have referred, the genuine accidental landlords should be taxed an extra &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000.  Nobody thinks that is just or right, or good for the children and their parents.<\/p>  <p>  We need to construct an amendment that stops people gaming the system.  Last year I did that and I got expert input as to how we could deal with the issue of gaming the system for the Report Stage amendment I tabled.  The conditions were as follows.  First, the property had to have been bought between 2002 and 2008 and no more than 113 sq. m in size, which is the average size of a three bed semi detached house.  Second, the property that the family were moving to had to have more bedrooms than the property from which they were moving, the logic being that they were moving to a larger premises to raise their children.  The people in question could only own one property.  Third, the property they were moving from had to have been purchased as their principal private residence, so it could not be an investment purchase and they had to have lived in the property for at least two years, they had to have been first time buyers when they bought the property and they had to be moving full-time into the new rented property and they could only deduct as much from the rental income as they were paying out in rent.  This all amounted to a very restrictive provision, which basically said that if one was a first time buyer who bought a very modest apartment in 2005, lived in for several years and did not own anything else and were in good faith moving to a larger property in order to raise a family, then one will not be penalised for doing so.  There is no way in which one can benefit and one could reduce one's tax liability from what one was paying when living in the apartment.  I will provide this amendment to the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.  <\/p>  <p>  People in this situation have been through hell for ten years.  Their lives have been destroyed and they have been caught by something that was never intended to catch people.  It is particularly galling when we look at the scale of the tax breaks that property developers, investors and land got, yet these people have been destroyed.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Chairman for allowing me to raise it.  My hope is that between the Minister of State and the Minister, a Government amendment will be tabled on Report Stage so that finally this cohort of people can get some relief ten years on from the trap that they are in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#CC00600","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1324,"content":"<p>Will the Minister of State note that point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#CC00700","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1325,"content":"<p>I remember Deputy Donnelly raising this issue in the past number of years.  <\/p>  <p>               While I am not committing to anything, I would appreciate if the Deputy could provide me with that note.

Linked to that, the amendment provides for the compiling of a national database on the distribution of wealth and assets to allow accurate information be compiled on what a wealth tax would raise and, ultimately, to allow such a tax to be implemented.  This is linked to global crisis of rising inequality.  I am sure the Minister of State has seen the Oxfam figures which indicate that, two years ago, approximately 160 people controlled the same amount of wealth as the bottom 50% of the world's population.  That dropped to 8 people last January and had decreased to 6 people in February.  Inequality is rising at an extremely quick pace and wealth is being concentrated in very few hands.  <\/p><p>The same is reflected in Ireland.  There are different studies here, including the CSO's household finance and consumption survey of 2013.  The Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, analysed this survey in its report The Distribution of Wealth in Ireland.  There was also an ESRI working paper in 2016.  From that information it can be concluded that the top 1% of the population in Ireland holds 14.8% of the total wealth, the top 5% controls 37.7%, the top 10% controls 53.8% and the bottom 50% controls less than 5% - only 4.9%.  Separately, the Central Bank currently estimates household net wealth at &euro;654 billion.  That figure has increased dramatically over the course of the last year.  According to the <i>Sunday Independent <\/i>rich list, the 300 richest people have effectively doubled their personal wealth from &euro;50 billion five years ago to &euro;100 billion at the moment.  <\/p><p>Ireland is an enormously wealthy country.  The issue is that wealth is owned and controlled by a very small number of people at the top, hence the proposal for a millionaires' tax.  We did the maths and, taking the Central Bank's figures for overall household net wealth and breaking them down according to the figures we have on the distribution of wealth, we determined that a 2% tax on net wealth exceeding &euro;1 million would raise &euro;3.238 billion.  That would affect only the top 5% of wealth holders in the economy - fewer than 85,000 households.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#DD00300","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1329,"content":"<p>The Government has no plans to introduce a wealth tax, although all taxes and potential taxation options are of course constantly reviewed.  Wealth can be taxed in a variety of ways, some of which are already in place in Ireland.  Capital gains tax, CGT, and capital acquisitions tax, CAT, are, in effect, taxes on wealth, as they are levied on an individual or company, on the disposal of an asset in the case of CGT or the acquisition of an asset through gift or inheritance, in the case of CAT.<\/p>  <p>  The local property tax, LPT, which was introduced in 2013, is a tax based on the market value of residential properties.  The domicile levy introduced in budget 2010 also constitutes a form of wealth tax.  It is aimed at high wealth individuals with a substantial connection to Ireland, whether they are tax resident or not, to ensure they make a tax contribution to this country in a year of at least &euro;200,000.  The rate of deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, on deposit accounts is now 39%, having been 41% from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016.  It was reduced by 2% in budget 2017, which also provided for further 2% cuts from 1 January in each of the next three years, so that the rate of DIRT will be 33% from 1 January 2020.  There is a stamp duty levy on the transfer of shares which yielded &euro;391.94 million in 2016. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the joint research programme agreed between the Department of Finance and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, covering macroeconomic and taxation issues, a research project involving detailed analysis of household wealth distribution in Ireland and taxation was recently undertaken.  The research was based on data collected by the CSO in 2013 as part of the household finance and consumption survey and involved analysing a wide variety of wealth tax scenarios, including scenarios based on wealth taxes currently in operation in a number of European countries that could hypothetically be applied to households in Ireland.  The research aimed to provide as comprehensive an analysis as possible of the wealth holdings of Irish households as of 2013 and the potential implications that a wealth tax could have if applied on the prevailing structure of assets and household composition. <\/p>  <p>  To provide a broad range of estimates and to illustrate the different effects of adjusting threshold levels and including or exempting specific assets, wealth tax revenues and households liable were calculated using two different approaches.  The first took the existing wealth tax structures of a number of European countries and applied them to the Irish household structure.  The second used a range of hypothetical combinations of threshold level and asset exemptions to go more deeply into their respective impacts on the revenues and numbers of households that would be liable under different tax designs.  The aim was not to make recommendations on any particular system but rather to provide a broad range of estimates to demonstrate the factors that would need to be considered in formulating a wealth tax and how they would impact the overall tax returns and the numbers and types of households that would be affected. <\/p>  <p>  The results gave a wide range of possible scenarios.  Applying other countries' models showed how variations in the exemptions and thresholds could result in less than 1% up to almost 50% of households being liable to a wealth tax.  The alternative scenarios investigated show that varying the level of the threshold was the key determinant of the number of households which would be affected, which is in keeping with the concentration of wealth at the upper end of the wealth distribution.  Given the numbers of households affected, the treatment of the household&rsquo;s main residence, which is the largest asset for almost all households apart from the very wealthiest, is an important factor in the level of average tax payment and hence total revenues raised.  Looking at the composition of households under the different tax scenarios, it was found that even with a narrow base and high threshold, some households in low income deciles were affected.  This is because of the imperfect correlation between income and wealth.  Applying an income restriction would remove many of the lower decile households from the tax net in most cases but would also reduce the numbers liable in the higher income deciles as well.<\/p>  <p>  Wealth taxes form part of a broader taxation system and may operate as both complements and substitutes to other forms of taxation.  The potential implications of wealth taxes would need to be considered in conjunction with the burden of these other taxes.  From the wide variety of scenario outcomes, in terms of the tax base, revenue raised and the number and characteristics of households that can be affected, it is evident that the impacts of a wealth tax in Ireland would depend crucially on the detail of its design.  The extent to which a value can be assigned to an asset varies substantially.  For instance, it may not be possible for an individual to value or sell his or her human capital or pension funds, which can comprise a significant proportion of wealth.  Additionally, accurately valuing assets which are not regularly bought and sold can be administratively burdensome.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Finance will continue to monitor and consider any additional information and data that comes to light and will continue to examine potential taxation sources on an ongoing basis.  Having regard to the foregoing I do not intend to support this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#DD00400","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1330,"content":"<p>Obviously the Government's response does not surprise me.  To pick up on a couple of points, the idea that being unable to value assets is a major obstacle to a wealth tax does not seem to be credible because there are wealth taxes in other countries, for example France.  They are not at the level we are proposing but they exist, they operate and people pay them.  Any difficulties in the valuation of assets and so on are overcome in these cases.  The Minister of State is correct when he says that there is an imperfect correlation between income and wealth.  <\/p>  <p>               Five minutes ago he argued that the property tax was progressive because people with more expensive homes pay more.  I agree there is an imperfect correlation but that is precisely why the idea of having a ceiling or a net level of &euro;1 million under which one pays no wealth tax deals with that problem.  I do not believe there is any one in this country in a low decile in terms of income who has more than &euro;1 million in net assets.  The net aspect is important.  People can have big homes and so forth but they also have debts that go with them, generally.  The &euro;1 million in net assets is quite generous in terms of an allowance.  The tax would not be applied until people go above that point. <\/p> <p> Ireland is a very unequal society.  Indications are that the distribution of wealth is more unequal than the average across the EU.  This is one of the measures which would address that inequality but the Government has repeatedly ridiculed it and suggested that it is in no way feasible.

The Minister of State's response was not surprising because it is very clear that this Government is not willing to look that any tax measure that applies to the elites, whether it is a wealth tax, closing down section 110 entities or making the banks, which are hugely profitable again, pay taxes.  The latter two proposals were blocked by the Government with the support of Fianna F&aacute;il.  As the news was filtering through to the boardrooms of the banks that Fine Gael had blocked Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment aimed at ensuring that the banks paid an appropriate level of tax this year, next year and every year thereafter, Bank of Ireland was putting the finishing touches to a statement that it has just released acknowledging that it had screwed over another 6,000 Irish tracker mortgage customers.  This is in addition to the 4,300 customers who were denied a return to their tracker mortgages.  We understand, as does the Minister of State, the hardship those customers went through and we have just learned that another 6,000 customers were similarly affected.  This is the type of institution or company that the Government has decided, in the context of votes cast in the last few minutes, should not be paying any tax.  However, having read the CEO's statement, we still have no certainty as to when those individuals will be compensated and when the compensation process will be completed.  The CEO refers to a \"pathway\", but there is no end date in sight for those 6,000 additional customers on top of the original 4,300.  This is the kind of individual thinking with which we are dealing, but the Government has decided not to tax the bankers and other elites in society.

That amendment sought a report on the impact of the tax after its implementation and an assessment of how regressive it is as a tax.  There has been debate and some research on so-called sugar taxes in the US which concluded that people of colour and people on low incomes were hit substantially harder by what was called the soda tax in America.  I believe that would also be the case here and that this would be another regressive tax.  That does not mean that I am in favour of soft drinks or soft drinks companies.  On the contrary, I agree with all of the analysis that points to the major role that they play in childhood obesity in particular, but it is a question of how we deal with that.  Do we impose an indirect tax which, based on evidence from the US, will overwhelmingly be passed on to consumers or do we regulate the industry by ensuring, for example, that vending machines are not allowed in schools, community centres and so forth?  Do we have a ban on advertising of highly sugared drinks at sporting events, which is something that is also being discussed with regard to alcoholic drinks?  Do we tax those corporations directly, which I favour, as opposed to taxing the consumers in the manner proposed in this Bill?  If the Government were serious about tackling obesity, it would be looking at issues like physical education in schools.  Children in primary school in Ireland only get an average of 46 minutes of physical education per week but they get two and a half hours of religious education per week.  Experts recommend an increase of at least 90 minutes per week in physical education.

Chapter 1 of the Bill provides that a sugar-sweetened drinks tax will apply when such drinks are first supplied in the State.  The introduction of this tax forms part of the Government's comprehensive plan, A Healthy Weight for Ireland, which aims to tackle the obesity and overweight problem in this country.  The tax will apply to non-alcoholic water and juice-based drinks which contain added sugar and which have a total sugar content of 5 grams or more per 100 ml.  Liable products will be identified by reference to the combined nomenclature classifications of goods to nutritional information required under the EU-wide food labelling regime.  <\/p>  <p>               I am not quite sure what the word \"nomenclature\" means.  However, it refers to classifications of goods and to nutritional information required under the EU wide food labelling regime.

One of the purposes of the tax is to encourage people to switch from drinking full sugar soft drinks to other drinks be they diet drinks or other types of drinks.  I hope people would choose water as it is the best option.  I accept that the dangers are lesser.  However, artificial sweeteners are not without their problems, although I accept that they are probably lesser than the problems associated with sugar.  By disincentivising the consumption of very highly sugared soft drinks the Government is incentivising consumption, relatively speaking, if people want to get the same taste, of saccharine and aspartame.  A number of studies have indicated that there are health risks associated with both.  Has the Department considered the matter?<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps it is just a turn of phrase.  Is this really the finishing piece of the Department of Health's action plan on obesity?  It has not had much of an impact, in terms of all of the things that could be done.  Even if I agreed with this taxation measure and thought it would have a substantial impact and was not concerned about it being regressive, I would still have a serious question mark over this tax being the final finishing piece.  Surely there are many more things that can be done, not least the question of physical education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#FF00200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1345,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy, fundamentally, in terms of physical education in schools but the matter is outside the scope of the Finance Bill.

Some matters in other jurisdictions have been assessed.  There was an evaluation of the impact on consumption.  The Mexican sugar sweetened drinks tax indicated that consumption fell in response to the tax and it fell more sharply for those people in low socio-economic groups.  That is the type of information we have available to us.  <\/p>  <p>  The objective is not to get more money from people in lower socio-economic groups.  The objective is to reduce the consumption of sugary drinks.

We ask that the provision is given a fair chance.

A range applies in this case.  The Minister of State has decided again to go with the upper end of the range.<\/p>  <p>  I have looked at figures from 2007.  I know there was a change in the middle in the percentage on the retail price.  Let us consider the rate of duty on tobacco products for 1,000 cigarettes.  In 2007, the figure was &euro;151.  I have no wish to bombard the committee with figures.  The corresponding figure went up to &euro;288.  During that period the amount of excise paid on cigarettes came down.  Indeed, excise on cigarettes had been falling all during that period bar the past two years and, in the case of one of those two years, the change is explained because of plain packaging.<\/p>  <p>  I am pointing out that the Government cannot go with the &euro;64 million figure.  It simply does not stack up.  There is a point where people will stop smoking cigarettes, and that is important.  This should be done for health promotion reasons and not to raise money.  However, the Government has decided to go with the upper end of the Revenue's expectations.  The Government did the same thing between 2015 and 2016.  The actual increase in excise duty during that period was &euro;16 million.  In previous years, the figure dropped significantly.  I hope that next year the figure will drop significantly as well, but the Government is banking on everyone staying smoking and buying the more expensive cigarettes, and that is not the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#HH01300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1399,"content":"<p>I am aware of the possibility that an increase in the price of cigarettes could result in a disproportionate change in consumer behaviour and this is reflected in tax revenue provided by Revenue.

However, I wish to refer to a particular aspect, the definition of &quot;qualifying organisation&quot; in the regulations mandated under the Finance Act 1989.  The definition states an organisation is a qualifying organisation for the purposes of the scheme if it is &quot;chiefly engaged in the care and transport of severely and permanently disabled persons&quot;.  The case that has been brought to my attention involves a school.  All of the pupils attending it have special needs and a good share of them are profoundly disabled.  As I understand it, the school which is a registered charity wants to buy a bus, but it is being told that it falls outside the definition in the regulations because it is not &quot;chiefly engaged in the care and transport of severely and permanently disabled persons&quot;; therefore, it cannot avail of the scheme.  I am sure the spirit of the scheme provides for such an organisation to be accommodated.

Unless Revenue or the Department can show otherwise, I do not believe the amendments would constitute a mechanism that would facilitate the widespread abuse of the scheme.  As the Chairman said, in terms of their quality of life and access to the ordinary activities of life which, by virtue of their disability, may be confined somewhat, these are enormous issues for people with disabilities and institutions and organisations dealing with people with a serious and permanent disability; as such, I do not understand the approach being taken.  For many years I have assumed that it relates to a risk of abuse which has never been defined.  If it is possible to receive some clarification as to what exactly is the problem from the point of view of the Department and Revenue, perhaps we might be able to fix it.  The census and social welfare statistics and so on show that a significant number of adults and children have a disability.  This means that the scheme which is not easy to access and not transparent and effective is putting another barrier and enormous difficulty in the path of people with disabilities.  Like other members, I can produce examples where, in some cases, people eventually qualified but in others they have never fully qualified.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to hear from the Minister of State on this matter.  Time has passed and it is now possible to carry out a lot of data collection and identification processes.  For example, the development of the public services card should allow for relatively easy verification.  In the school about which Deputy Michael McGrath was speaking the parents of a majority of the children would be in receipt of domiciliary care allowance.  In the case of adults, those concerned are receiving a disability allowance from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  There are ways and means to cross-check data.  For instance, to receive a permanent or long-term payment such as domiciliary care allowance from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, whether for a child or an adult, there is a recognised medical evaluation procedure and a examination of the applicant's means.  All of this process is now computerised and there are programmes which, with the permission of applicants, allow the cross-checking of their data which Revenue accepts for other tax purposes.  Because of developments in the use of technology in the public service, I am at a loss to know why this is such a problem, given that it has been dealt with in other areas.  <\/p>  <p>               The Department of Education and Skills has also done a lot of similar work in the case of special educational needs organisers, SENO.  There is a huge volume of work being done in the public realm that should allow much easier verification of these data.  I do not believe preparation of a report, as proposed by Deputy Michael McGrath in the amendment, would in any way pose a threat to the budget.  I cannot understand why it is not possible for the Minister of State to accept the proposal in principle and come back on Report Stage with his own draft of what might be acceptable.  It is past time we addressed this problem which is an enormous one in people's lives, particularly the parents of children with a disability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#JJ01600","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1436,"content":"<p>I support the amendments which do not deal with the primary medical certificate issue raised by the Chairman.

The entire area needs to be reviewed.  The amendments are worthy of support.  The wording of the provision should be changed from \"chiefly engaged in the care and transport of\" to \"engaged in the care and transport of\".  That would be a fair definition.

The scheme is a significant tax expenditure, costing approximately &euro;65 million in taxes forgone and grant payments in 2016.  This figure does not include the revenue forgone to the local government fund in the relief from motor tax provided for members of the scheme.  In accordance with SI 353 of 1994, registered charitable organisations are eligible to become members of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme where they are chiefly engaged in the care and transport of disabled persons who have obtained a primary medical certificate.<\/p>  <p>  The effect of the amendments, in removing the word \"chiefly\", would be to significantly broaden access to the scheme for charitable organisations.  This could open up the scheme to organisations that are not primarily involved in the care and transport of persons with disabilities.  As such, it could result in a poorly targeted scheme and also a large additional liability for the Exchequer.  Deputy Michael McGrath will be aware that the criteria for the scheme are necessarily precise and while this means that many persons with more general mobility disabilities do not qualify for the scheme, given its scale and scope, I have no plans to change the eligibility criteria.  The Deputy will also be aware that the Minister announced in the budget the introduction of a new VAT compensation scheme for charities in recognition of the work undertaken by the charities sector.

It is about professional contractors who provide IT, engineering, pharma, bio-pharma and other services on projects and who, on that basis, are classified in tax legislation in Schedule D, Case II as distinct from Case I.  The issue I am raising is that of the treatment of the travel and subsistence expenses they incur, not flat rate claims and so on.  A question arises as to whether persons who are legitimately self-employed are incurring these expenses wholly and exclusively for the purposes of their work, the current definition used.  There is an additional leg to this test for employees in that their expenses have to be incurred necessarily as well as wholly and exclusively for the purposes of their work.  What is the attitude of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department to this cohort which is not huge in number who are self-employed and centrally involved in delivering major capital projects for companies in the pharma, bio-pharma and IT sectors and so on?  In a situation where a self-employed person based in Cork travels to Dublin to work on a project for a number of weeks or months and pays his or her own accommodation and travel costs, should such costs be allowed as an expense for tax purposes?  <\/p><p>Those raising this issue, including the consulting firms involved in projects, the companies hiring them and the independent contractors, make the argument that rates are increasing, that business is becoming less competitive and that there has been a flight of expertise and talent from Ireland because of unfavourable tax treatment.  I have been trying for some time to get a straight answer from the Department and the Revenue Commissioners as to whether they have a case.  It seems they do.  I am not advocating special treatment for anyone.  I just want to know whether persons who are genuinely self-employed and incurring expenses as they move from one project to the next should, from a tax treatment point of view, be able to deduct them accordingly.

In addition, whereas officeholders and employees must necessarily incur travel expenses and subsistence relating to that travel in the performance of their duties in order to qualify for tax-free reimbursement, there is no requirement that self-employed contractors must necessarily incur the expense.  The necessity of the expense is irrelevant once it is incurred in furtherance of the trade, subject, of course, to the restriction on travel to a place of work, as I have already mentioned.

I expected there would have been some progress.  We read in the newspapers that Paddy Power Betfair hired Fergal O'Rourke and did a bit of lobbying with the Minister which put an end to the idea of increasing the rate above 1%.  It was stated by the Minister of State's predecessors going back as far as the former Minister of State, Brian Hayes, that we would be better to get the 1% bedded in and then look at increasing the rate.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have argued for some time that this rate should increase to 3% and that the burden should be placed on the punter.  This would actually be a benefit for small operators because, at the minute, they are absorbing the 1% and this would, therefore, increase their profitability by that amount.  We looked at a 3% rate because we believe that is a rate the larger operators could not afford to absorb themselves.  This would obviously bring in revenue which would properly fund the horse and greyhound fund but it would also provide money for addiction services and other services.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment calls for a report to allow us to look at the options and to find how we could increase this rate over time.  I think it is important that we have a signal, given I thought we were to move in this direction this year.  I am not surprised at Paddy Power Betfair, and in fairness to Feargal O'Rourke, his company does professional work for Paddy Power Betfair and there is nothing untoward there, because that is what lobbying is.  Nonetheless, I believe there is a requirement to do this.<\/p>  <p>  Betting is also a vice.  Many people do this, and I make a punt myself and I enjoy it, but it should be taxed appropriately.  I can remember going to the bookies for my father - I was probably doing it illegally - and I would have been paying 10 pence to the pound, because that was what the punter had to pay at the time in tax.  We are now talking about 3%, which is what is already captured online.

The report explored gambling behaviour in Ireland, specifically the issue of problem gambling and its impact on the individual, the gambler&rsquo;s relationships with social connections and the wider impact of problem gambling behaviour on community and society.  The Betting (Amendment) Act 2015 brought remote bookmakers and betting intermediaries offering betting services in Ireland into the regulatory regime for the first time.  At the same time, these operations were brought into the betting tax net, effectively doubling the revenue receipts from this source.<\/p>  <p>  The 2015 Act was seen as a temporary measure pending the introduction of a wider Government approach to gambling under the gambling control Bill being prepared by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The Bill, as proposed, will update all existing laws on the regulation and licensing of gambling activities, including betting and gaming.  It also includes a proposal to establish a social fund to assist in counteracting the ill effects for society, as well as for persons and their families, of irresponsible gambling.  The scheme does not include the national lottery, whose activities are separately regulated under the National Lotteries Act 2013.  Having been given special responsibility in this area, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is working to ensure that legislation providing for the regulation of the gambling sector can be published at the earliest opportunity.  Discussions with the Office of the Attorney General are under way.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy Doherty&rsquo;s amendment to prepare a report on increasing betting tax to 3% to be paid by the customer, my predecessor committed to reviewing the betting duty regime through the work of the Tax Strategy Group during the debate on last year&rsquo;s Finance Bill.  The Deputy will be aware that this report was published in the Tax Strategy Group paper earlier this year.  As part of this review, which included consultation with stakeholders and interested parties, consideration was given to the impacts, benefits and drawbacks of both imposing betting duty on the customer and also of increasing betting duty rates.  The review found, among other things, that applying a charge directly to the customer is problematic.  Betting customers are price sensitive and such a change to taxing the customer could encourage a move towards alternative forms of gambling that are not subject to tax or to seek out unlicensed operators.<\/p>  <p>  I might add that, as part of the process, Department officials met with various stakeholders, including the advocacy groups Problem Gambling Ireland and the Rutland Centre.  I do not propose to accept these amendments.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to add one point.  I accept the Deputy's view in regard to problem gambling.  From speaking with the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, I agree the legislation he is seeking to have passed should be prioritised.  <\/p>  <p>               Everybody in the House should try to facilitate that.  That would be a huge help.

The projected reduction for the coming year, according to the answers we got back in preparation for the budget, is &euro;491 million.  This, in reality, ends up in the pockets of employers in a highly profitable low-wage sector.  I have not seen any evidence to suggest that this kind of foregone revenue is worth the benefits that it brings because it ends up in the pockets of the already quite wealthy employers in this sector.

My party does not argue for the 9% rate to revert to the 13.5% rate across the board, although there are quite legitimate arguments to do so in certain sectors.  I can see the rationale, for example, for newspapers, to continue to enjoy a 9% VAT rate but I presume there is a reason that they are grouped together and that is why it has to happen.<\/p>  <p>  What we have looked at is the cost of the hotel beds sector.  This particular part makes up approximately 40% of the revenue lost, given that vacancy rates have increased, that we have high costs in terms of hotel accommodation, and that hotel accommodation here is among the dearest in Europe and enjoys the highest occupancy rates in Europe.  We are conscious that this is not the case across the board.  I come from west Donegal.  The hotels in that area enjoy a short window of reasonable occupancy of between six and eight weeks.  The rest of the time is really challenging for them.  That said, the majority of the hotel beds are in Dublin where occupancy rates are the highest in Europe and prices have increased 6% in the past year.  There is no need to subsidise that sector anymore.<\/p>  <p>  We need to find ways to support other sectors in areas which are struggling, such as hotels in more rural, isolated areas.  The Wild Atlantic Way is one way of doing that but there is a need for other interventions.<\/p>  <p>  We need to learn the lesson, when we introduce a VAT relief or tax relief that works, to have the courage to start to taper it off.  This, in my view, is the cycle of tapering it off.  It is about producing a report looking at the implications which will catch all of the issues that I have addressed in terms of price, affordability, availability, the disparities in different regions, and isolating whether it is possible to introduce a relief for the non-hotel beds sector that has been identified but where the hotel beds rate would revert to the 13.5% rate.  When I talk about hotel beds, I am conscious that those hotel beds also include guest houses and other such forms of accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#MM00900","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1469,"content":"<p>The 9% reduced rate of VAT is reviewed annually in the context of the budget, including the costs and economic benefits and the additional revenue that could be raised by bringing the rate back to 13.5%.  Revenue's most recent estimate for reverting the reduced 9% VAT rate back to 13.5% is that it would bring in extra revenue of &euro;491 million.  A 1% increase or decrease would yield or cost &euro;109 million.  The estimated cost to the Exchequer of the reduced 9% VAT rate, since its introduction in 2011 to end 2016, is of the order of &euro;2.2 billion.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of economic benefit, employment in the accommodation and food service sector has grown significantly since the introduction of the 9% VAT rate.  Employment in these sectors has increased gradually each year since 2011, with an increase of over 35% in the period of Q2 2011 to Q1 2017 &ndash; an increase of 40,500 jobs in the sector.  The rate of increase in employment in this sector was significantly greater than the overall level of employment increase.  In terms of overseas trips to Ireland by non-residents, the number of trips increased from 6.5 million in 2011 to 9.6 million in 2016, an increase of 48%.  However, these benefits could be attributed to other factors, such as the general and strong recovery in the economy and better economic performance in the target markets.<\/p>  <p>  I decided in budget 2018 not to make any change to the 9% VAT rate as it continues to benefit the tourism sector throughout the country and any change in the rate could impact greatly on the tourism sector outside of the capital.  I am also conscious of the impact the decline in the value of sterling is having on UK visitor numbers and how any increase in the VAT rate might exacerbate this.<\/p>  <p>  While it is noted that hotel prices in Dublin continue to rise, this is partly a function of supply which is being addressed.  Furthermore, because of EU fiscal neutrality constraints, different VAT rates cannot apply to different geographical areas in the country.  In this context, VAT policy must be decided in the context of the national interest.<\/p>  <p>  However, I accept the position of the Deputies that the 9% VAT rate must be subject to ongoing analysis.  In this context I have asked my Department to undertake a comprehensive study of all aspects of the 9% VAT rate ahead of next year's budget.  This will better inform any decision in relation to the reduced rate going forward.

The legal position is that children's shoes and clothing are zero rated for VAT purposes.  The definition is in relation to clothing.  It is not exceeding the size appropriate to children of average build up to ten years of age and similarly for footwear.  In practice, the administration of that by Revenue is that zero rating applies to the following criteria in relation to children's clothing, namely, sizes up to and including a 32 in. chest or 26 in. waist and children's footwear up to and including a size 5.5.  Those sizes were determined in 1984 after consultation with clothing and footwear trade interests at both manufacturing and distribution levels.<\/p>  <p>  There is an EU context in terms of the EU VAT directive and a zero rating can be drawn from the derogation under Article 110 of the EU VAT directive.  What I have learnt so far from replies to parliamentary questions is that the position of Revenue and the Department is that the age cannot be increased, but the average sizes can potentially be changed, but only if there is evidence that the average sizes need to be increased.<\/p>  <p>  The issue I wish to highlight is that if one takes footwear, for example, one has a certain price range up to size 5.5 which is the zero rating.  Parents who go shopping will know this.  A pair of zero-rated runners might be &euro;40 but if one goes to size 6 the cost could be &euro;60 or &euro;70.  The application of VAT to runners of size 6 or 6.5 does not explain the price differential.  It is clear that either manufacturers, distributors or retailers are taking the opportunity afforded by the jump from zero rating to applying the standard rate to impose a very dramatic increase in the price of footwear and clothing once the zero rating no longer applies.  There is a huge difference.<\/p>  <p>  While the average might be at around age ten that a child would need size 6 footwear or in the case of clothing greater than a 26 in. waist or a 32 in. chest, there are many exceptions to that.  Many children of that age require larger sizes.  What we need to do is explore what flexibility, if any, there is for zero rating.  The Minister said the reference to the age is cast iron and cannot be changed, but there may be some flexibility in the average size relative to the age.  The rates were set in 1984 and I do not know if it has been reviewed since.  It is a very important issue for many families and there is an element of exploitation in that when one goes beyond the size threshold where clothes or footwear are no longer zero rated, there is a significant jump in price across a wide range of clothing and footwear for children, which is not explained by the application of VAT at 23%.  Is the Minister of State prepared to look at this and to see what can be done to help families dealing with this issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#NN00900","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1480,"content":"<p>The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Under Article 110 of the VAT directive, member states may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on and from 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services after that date.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the zero rate of VAT applies to clothing and shoes for children and that is possible under EU VAT law because the zero rate applied to those goods on and from 1 January 1991.  It is not possible under EU VAT law to extend the application of the zero rate by raising the age limit of children to whom the zero rate could apply in respect of articles of clothing and footwear.<\/p>  <p>  Since the mid-1980s, Irish VAT law has defined children's clothing and footwear as that not exceeding the size appropriate to children of average build and foot size of ten years of age.  That includes clothing described, labelled, marked or marketed as being for children under 11 years of age.  The practical application of the measure is that zero rating applies to children's clothing of sizes up to and including a 32 in. chest, a 26 in. waist or 152 cm in height; and children's footwear up to and including a size 5.5 or 38.  The sizes were determined in 1984 after consultation with clothing and footwear trade interests at both manufacturing and distribution levels.<\/p>  <p>  While EU VAT law prohibits any increase in the age of children's clothing to which the zero rate applies, the practical application of the current zero rate to children aged under 11 can be refined where there is evidence that the size limitations have changed since the current criteria were agreed in the 1980s.  Where the industry representing children's clothing and footwear has reason to believe that the current practical size measurements no longer represent children aged under 11 years of age, it should make a submission to my Department to that effect and we will engage with the sector.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.<\/p>  <p>  Effectively, it is a matter of interpretation by Revenue if the average size to which the legislation refers has changed or if children have become bigger, which I expect is the case since 1984.

It had been 2%.  This caught many people in the farming community and to be fair, the Finance Bill has rectified the situation where a father or mother hands down the land to a son or daughter.  <\/p><p>We have tabled this amendment for 2% up to &euro;300,000 along with two other amendments and another on consolidation.  The latter relates to relief being available where farmers who have units of land that might be ten or 15 miles away may be in a position to sell it if another piece of land was for sale closer to them.  The 2% stamp duty is not about farmers alone, it is pertinent to every Deputy who lives in rural Ireland.  I asked about the rural-proofing of the budget.  Every Deputy across the country is trying to encourage people in small towns, especially where many businesses have closed due to the recession, and the premises are left vacant.  This is not a matter that concerns one party or group alone; everyone is trying to encourage people to open businesses and make towns more vibrant again.  Added to that, there is a major problem within the farming sector where large operators who have the funds are able to mop up lands, while we are trying to encourage young people to take over the land.  The idea of increasing the threshold to &euro;300,000 at 2% is for the benefit of the many farmers who do not have the same flexibility with a bank as larger operators, when a small piece of land comes up near them.  It would probably be the most land that a farmer would buy in their life.  Looking at the trends for protecting a family farm, it is often the case that a farmer will need to buy an extra piece of land to consolidate the farm for the future.  We must make this decision to protect family farms, that is why we propose that those farmers be given the opportunity along with other small businesses, such as hardware shop or other small shops which had closed.  It is great to see some parts of the country improve, but there are still many areas with vacant buildings.  This budget is telling them that they must pay and extra &euro;8,000 or &euro;12,000 for a building that we should be encouraging them to buy.  Money is not that freely available and there are people who are reaching their thresholds.  <\/p><p>There is significant confusion over consanguinity which I hope the Minister and the Department will clarify.  There is supposed to be a document that says that if someone is buying land and the deposit was paid prior to the budget and the deal is finished by the year end, the purchaser is not liable for this.  Will the Minister confirm this?  The 2% figure is included in this amendment to protect the small operator.  We do not stand for landlordism or multinationals, we are talking about the person.  If we fail to solve this problem, it will be another kick for rural communities and small towns, against everyone's efforts.  I am not having a go at everyone; people are trying across the board to ensure fair play and get businesses open.  If something like this is not done, there will be further demise in rural Ireland.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#OO01200","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1500,"content":"<p>I have also put my name to this amendment.  Deputy Fitzmaurice tried on budget night to have the measure postponed until the end of the year, and I supported him.  Many people have been caught by this for various reasons.  Some blame auctioneers or solicitors, or in some cases the banks where they could not secure the finance in time, and those people should be given a window to conclude the transaction.  They had made a deal, shaken hands and spat on their palms.  This measure was a double whammy for them.  It was unexpected and in the spirit of goodwill and behaving honourably they should be allowed to complete the deal without this blow.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice has outlined the funding.  We want to support the small businessman or businesswoman and the small family farm.  The iar-Thaoiseach came to Edgeworthstown and announced there was nothing he would not do - I said it was like the Four Roads to Glenamaddy - to rejuvenate rural Ireland.  This budget measure is doing the exact opposite, it is a blow to every town and village.  Anyone on this committee from a rural area - I mean everywhere beyond the Red Cow - will be familiar with these villages and towns.  I travelled to one last week in County Mayo, where I saw one closed building after the next.  My own town of Clonmel was once thriving, the biggest inland town in the country, and now the middle of the town is devastated.  We are trying to get people back into the town and rejuvenate it.  Then there is a housing crisis.  This measure is an obstacle to both of these problems.  We could solve much of the housing crisis, although not all of it, and get a living town once more while giving a break to entrepreneurs that they could buy a premises that has been closed for the last five or ten years if it did not reopen as a business premises; someone else might buy it and put accommodation above or at the back.  Several small businesses that were in the middle of the process have contacted me.  Some of them thought that the solicitors had completed the transaction but they had not, since one almost has to live with a solicitor to make them do what they are supposed to; the longer it goes on for them the better.  This measure is meanspirited.  <\/p>  <p>               It is against the spirit of everything we say - so much for rural proofing.  This is rural segregation.  It is not that many of these family farmers wish to buy land, but they have no choice if they wish to stay in the production of milk, cereal or beef, especially given the vast amount of land required.  It is different with poultry and other production.  Farmers must try to expand their acreage - the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, should understand that given where he comes from - to stay in the game or even to stand still.  That is especially the case with the onset of Brexit.  A number of young farmers have been brave enough to invest hugely in dairying and I am worried about them.  If they see some land they wish to buy, this will be a hammer blow from the Government.  They are already being hammered by the vulture funds.  We tend to think those vulture funds are abroad but there is a home grown vulture fund in my area of Tipperary.  It is buying every morsel of grass or seedling that grows.  It is a land grab by a very famous conglomerate.  That conglomerate has much prowess in the horse racing industry, which we welcome, and provides much employment.  However, it has amassed up to 17,000 acres by now.<\/p> <p> I put a proposal to the Minister for Finance for a land tax on any farm over 750 acres.  Being from Tipperary I know how emotive the words \"land tax\" are but we must do something to ensure the survival of rural Ireland and to keep the schools open and the families, churches, teams and playing fields there.  We must keep the place alive, not shut it down behind gates.  We have submitted this amendment because we must give some type of solace, not blindfold these business people, entrepreneurs and families, tie their hands behind their backs and let them be sucked up by the vulture funds and just tossed to hell or to Connacht.  It is to hell or wherever now.  The vulture funds are not being touched.<\/p> <p> We were very careful with our figures, with 4% from &euro;300,000 to &euro;500,000 and 6% from &euro;500,000.  We are not trying to be all things to all people.  It is for a specific group of people.  The value of property will rise in towns, even if there is not much business.  We are going to hunt all our entrepreneurs into this city where one cannot get a bed for a night, a parking space or anything else.  The recent OECD report found that 53% of all economic activity is taking place in the capital city.  It is 15% or 20% higher than the figure for any other capital city in Europe.  We are in the middle of Brexit and all the announcements and pronouncements of what we are going to do, along with all the hashtags and God knows what else.  The last Taoiseach never had to hashtag but went out himself to tell what he was going to do.  People do not want lip service.  They want tangible efforts and in this case to be left alone.<\/p> <p> This hammer blow was totally unexpected, especially with all the talk about rural proofing.  The words \"rural proofing\" should be deleted from the Government's vocabulary because there is nothing rural proofing about this measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#OO01300","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1502,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 69 is in this group of amendments so I wish to discuss that.

This is based on the outturn for commercial property sales last year.  Looking at a linear increase, it would double at 4% and so forth.  We raised our concerns on the night of the budget and since then.  It is interesting to listen to CBRE property consultants.  They have insight into the current position of commercial property.  They say the figures for the past three years have been inflated by the sale of assets by NAMA and the banks, which has generated an unusually large number of high value transactions.  Obviously, one can take it that such transactions will not continue into the future.  In addition, most property commentators are of the view that total investment spend volumes in the Irish commercial property market will be lower in 2017 than they were last year.  Overall investments in the Irish commercial property market exceeded &euro;1.3 billion in the first nine months of this year according to Jones Lang LaSalle Limited, JLL.  JLL is of the view that volumes for 2017 will likely reach between &euro;2 billion and &euro;2.5 billion.  If we accept the higher estimate of &euro;2.5 billion, which would mean a significant increase in the last few months of this year, that is significantly lower than the &euro;4.5 billion outturn in 2016.  That is an expected &euro;2.5 billion in commercial property transactions in 2017 against &euro;4.5 billion last year.<\/p>  <p>  It is risky to use what could be seen as dodgy figures to underpin the budgetary strategy.  I raised this issue two days ago when we were discussing cuts in income taxes, the sustainability of the tax base and so forth.  There is close to &euro;400 million coming from this, but we must investigate whether the figures are robust.  There are serious questions in this regard on a number of measures.  First, the experts expect the outturn for this year to be a little over half of the outturn for last year.  Also, the previous outturns were inflated because of sales by banks and NAMA.  A major gap, therefore, could emerge in the budget very quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#PP00400","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1505,"content":"<p>I am seeking some technical information on property transactions.  Property transactions take place equally throughout the year.  My query is about the transitional arrangements in the budget.  For the sake of argument, one twelfth of property transactions are still waiting to be stamped.  The deed might be executed by the solicitor and a signed contract is delivered.  People are just waiting to have it stamped.  Heretofore, the Revenue online service, ROS, included a box which one would tick when filing one's return online.  That would enable a person to avail of the reduced rate and, therefore, the person would get his or her certificate on that basis.  However, that does not appear to be the case on this occasion.<\/p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners issued two notes on this.  First, where somebody has the contract signed and ready to go, if he or she wishes to get the deed stamped he or she must pay the full increase.  He or she will get the refund back on the signing of the Finance Act.  That is ridiculous.  People are relying on bank finance in many of these transactions and one is asking the person to foot the cost of an additional 4% in tax for which the person is not liable.  The second point made in the clarification is that one can avail of the reduced rate but the Revenue Commissioners will not give one the stamp certificate.  If one does not have the stamp certificate one cannot get bank finance or register with the Property Registration Authority, PRA.  In other words, it is not a solution.  What can happen then is one's return could be late.  If somebody's stamp duty return is late, because he or she cannot finance the additional 4%, will the Revenue Commissioners charge the person interest and penalties on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#PP00500","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1506,"content":"<p>I wish to comment on amendment No. 69, the proposal to have a risk assessment of the sustainability of stamp duty receipts.  At the beginning of the debate on the Finance Bill I said I was shocked that this increase in stamp duty was leaked.  <\/p>  <p>               It was leaked very comprehensively in all of the main national newspapers, particularly on the weekend before the budget, in a way that I have never seen with a tax measure before.  The Minister for Finance suggested in his response that this was perhaps a method for getting a feeling for how the sector would react to this proposal.  If there was in fact private information circulating beforehand, however, this means that a great many avoidance measures were undertaken back in the days before the measure came into effect.  This further means that people who were not in this golden circle of potential recipients of information will have lost out on the double.  When it comes to developing tax policy, this is extremely unfair.  It is unfair to the person in a rural smallholding who did not have the information that this was about to come down the tracks.  It is also unfair to the business that may have been undertaking an ordinary business transaction as it would not have had that advance information either.  This information was, however, clearly shared with and broadcast to the so-called players in the property market.  Any report on this should look at this matter because tax information released before the applicable date is of course enormously valuable information for deals that are in the pipeline.  I know that the Minster was annoyed that this issue was raised, but it has been a fundamental principle of Irish tax policy for a very long time that there be no such circle of people with access to prior information on the details of the budget.  It is important, then, that this be examined.<\/p> <p> I come to second point.  There was clearly a surge in property deals last year because of various deals that were undertaken and legitimate questions have been raised over whether or not that surge will continue.  As this is the very pillar holding up the budget's arithmetic, we need to know the truth about the likely revenue outcomes from this tax.  The whole manner in which this deal was conducted strongly indicates that there are within the circle of this current Government some people with more access to information than others.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#PP00600","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1508,"content":"<p>I have a problem with statements like that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#QQ00200","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1509,"content":"<p>It was published in the newspapers.

I do not care if the Minister of State is annoyed at this or not.  All of this amounts to a significantly unfair potential advantage to very wealthy people with tax advisors who are part of a circle of information and are able to get access to it.

As Deputy Burton has said, information is power, and in this case it would seem that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine did not have the information on the extension of stamp duty to farmers because he certainly came out the next day to say that this was not going to extend to them.  We now find, of course, that it does and there was great dismay among many in rural Ireland who were in the process of buying and selling land to find that this 6% stamp duty was to clamped onto it.<\/p>  <p>  Our proposal here is to reduce that stamp duty rate in line with what the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine said the day after the budget.  That is our demand here and we expect it to be met because at the end of the day the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine represents the farming community.  We all know that farm income in Ireland amounts to about half of the average industrial wage and that farmers are struggling to survive.  Many of the people in this situation want to buy land so as to make their holding sustainable.  Somebody holding 40 or 50 acres, for example, might decide to buy the extra 20 acres that becomes available beside them.  When that farmer goes to the bank to buy it, however, a big issue now is whether or not he or she is going to have to pay this 6% stamp duty.  This would clamp an extra charge onto the farmer that he or she might not have budgeted for at the outset.<\/p>  <p>  The issues under discussion here have been very well rehearsed both here at committee and in the D&aacute;il on budget day.  The farming community is quite angry, not just at the increase but also at the fact that they appear to have been treated as little more than an afterthought in all of this.  They are quite justified in their anger because it is very clear that this was not thought through or worked out properly.  This duty was simply applied to commercial property without any thought for the impact that it might have on rural Ireland and on members of the farming community.

In the meantime the Revenue Commissioners have made further clarifications on this, which I welcome, but which do not far enough in dealing with this issue.  There are two options: pay the 6% now and get a 4% refund at some future point without any guarantee of timing or mention of interest; or pay 2% now and not get the stamp certificate until the Finance Act 2017 passes into law sometime around Christmas and the purchaser complies with the proofs needed for the transition arrangements.  There are very serious practical difficulties with this.  I understand that in the past, generally speaking, transition arrangements were laid out in the financial resolution on budget night.<\/p>  <p>  Can the Minister of State comment on the various proposals that have been set out in the amendments?  Some involve a tiered approach whereby the larger transactions would attract the highest rate with a reduced rate for transactions at a lower value.  Is it possible to cost such an approach and what would the implications be for the tax yield?  Can the Minister of State clarify if this had been factored into the budget?  <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the changes made to consanguinity relief.  These will go some, though not all the way towards dealing with people's concerns.  We will shortly be debating amendments around farm consolidation in situations where there is already a capital gains exemption, and whether or not this might also be extended to stamp duty where the test of consolidation has been met.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#QQ00800","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1515,"content":"<p>I wrote to the Minister on this matter.  I also raised the issues brought up today by Deputies Burke and McGrath.  I know that the Minister has sent the correspondence on to the Revenue Commissioners but the outcome remains unsatisfactory.  We understand that there are transitional arrangements in place.  The problem, however, is that there are people who purchased land and for whom the transfer of that land went through on budget night.  <\/p>  <p>               They obtained finance to purchase a land holding and have no access to the additional &euro;10,000 or &euro;11,000 required to pay the stamp duty charge.  The problem is that the individual, who may be one of many, does not want to be in breach of the law.  Time is now running out and a decision needs to be made this week.  I understand there is a period of four weeks from when the charge is generated to when it must be paid.  I made the point that there should be an announcement from the Revenue Commissioners and the Government that no late fees or penalties will apply to individuals who do not pay the charge until the Finance Bill is through.  I have not heard any clarification in that regard.  The individual in question wants to comply completely with the law but must satisfy the bank.  He or she cannot gain access to any other money and did everything he or she believed to be proper.  He or she took out a loan for the value of the land and stamp duty.  On the night when the transfer went through, the law changed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#QQ00900","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1517,"content":"<p>I have about 400 notes coming at me from all different directions.  We have had conversations previously about other taxes.  The 2% stamp duty rate was the emergency rate.  We had to reduce the rate to this to try to get the property market moving.  The standard rate in times gone past was 6%.  The rate has returned to that.  It was based on a sustainable, broad tax base.  The rate was as high as 9% prior to its being 6%.<\/p>  <p>  We discussed earlier the VAT rate for the hospitality sector.  There is always pain when taxes reduced during an emergency are returned to a sustainable level that puts the nation's finances onto a solid footing.  Everybody in this room, and in both Chambers, wants the taxation system to be sustainable so we will not return to the cliff face we were at in previous years.<\/p>  <p>  If it is acceptable, I will not address the matter of consolidation until speaking on amendment No.  67.  I will read my notes and deal with each section in turn.<\/p>  <p>  Amendments Nos. 64 to 66, inclusive, and 69 have been grouped together.  Amendments Nos. 64 and 65 deal with the proposed amendments to the stamp duty rates charged on non-residential property.  Amendment No. 66 is specific to agricultural land, and amendment No. 69 seeks a report within six months on the sustainability of stamp duty receipts from commercial property.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2018 includes an adjustment to the rate of stamp duty on non-residential property from 2% to 6%, projected to raise &euro;376 million in 2018.  This is based on estimates in Revenue's pre-budget ready reckoner, which showed that a 0.5% increase in the stamp duty rate applying to non-residential property would result in a &euro;47 million increase in the yield.  From a &euro;376 million yield, a four percentage point increase was derived.<\/p>  <p>  For non-residential stamp duty, this yield projection for 2018 is based on receipts for previous years, combined with an ongoing assessment of expected receipts by the end of the current year and for next year as well as impacts of earlier policy changes.  <\/p>  <p>  Following budget 2018, Revenue has updated the ready reckoner to a post-budget basis, taking account of budgetary changes and revised growth forecasts from my Department for 2018.  The post-budget ready reckoner indicates that each 0.5% increase in the stamp duty rate applying to non-residential property would result in a &euro;49 million increase in the overall yield.  This would indicate that the estimated additional yield from the increase in stamp duty rate on non-residential property could be in the region of &euro;392 million rather than &euro;376.  While the estimated yield makes an assumption of no behavioural change, basing receipts on 2016-17 levels and trends is the most reasonable option.  The estimate also assumes current exemptions and other reliefs remain unchanged.<\/p>  <p>  There has been some commentary regarding the estimated yield of &euro;376 million.  Most of the commentary has focused on the level of commercial property assets traded, with estimates putting this between &euro;2 billion and &euro;4.5 billion per annum.  It is clear from Revenue data, however, that the levels of commercial and other non-residential property transactions significantly exceed that which has been estimated by some commentators.  A simple extrapolation of the receipts for 2016, based on &euro;256 million at a rate of 2%, implies transactions valued at over &euro;12 billion in that year.  Adjusting for significant once-off transactions in 2016, which were stripped out, receipts in the three-year period 2014 to 2016 were quite stable.  For the nine months from January to September 2017, revenue receipts indicate a level of commercial activity in the order of &euro;6.4 billion.  This is significantly more than the estimates of certain commentators, and it is reasonable to expect this level of activity to continue.  <\/p>  <p>  The latest forecast from CBRE for new office supply in Dublin from 2017 to 2020 is 880,000 sq. m.  This includes projects with planning permission granted and planning applications submitted, as well as projects under construction and recently completed, in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Naturally, tax receipts under all heads are monitored closely and reported on in the monthly fiscal monitor, which incorporates the Exchequer statement.  Any developments are, of course, examined by my officials.  This ongoing monitoring is more useful than a static report at some future time.<\/p>  <p>  Amendments Nos. 64, 65 and 66 would result in a reduction in stamp duty yields that would have to be made up from other taxation measures in order to maintain overall budget arithmetic.  I am informed that the estimated loss in yield under amendment No. 64 would be &euro;162 million, while the estimate in respect of amendment No. 65 would be &euro;105 million.  The estimated reduced yield from Deputy Doherty's proposal, in amendment No. 66, would be &euro;32 million.<\/p>  <p>  In my budget statement I announced an extension of consanguinity relief for another three years and that the stamp duty rate applying under that scheme would be fixed at 1%.  Consanguinity relief is availed of in transferring farms to younger family members and is particularly relevant where the transferee does not qualify for an alternative relief, such young trained farmer stamp duty exemption.<\/p>  <p>  Following discussions with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I decided that in addition to extending the period of the relief and fixing the associated stamp duty rate at 1%, the age rule for the consanguinity relief will be removed.  This means it will be possible for all gifts and sales of farmlands to closely related family members who do not qualify for the 100% exemption from stamp duty under the young trained farmer scheme to benefit from the consanguinity relief at a stamp duty rate of 1%.  For the reasons I have outlined, I do not propose to support amendments Nos. 64, 65, 66 and 69.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of other issues with which I want to deal.  Land purchase is not the only option.  I am one of the farmers in the room, and there are others.  Budget 2014 reflected the analysis of the release for the farming and agriculture sectors.  There is a really substantial relief.  Farmers have the opportunity to rent their land to other farmers tax-free for the income up to &euro;40,000.  This is really beneficial.  Farmers enter an agreement to have a long-term lease, the lessor can get up to &euro;40,000 for the duration of the lease.  It is not correct to state nothing has been done for farmers who choose to expand.  A tax-free sum of &euro;40,000 is a lot of money over the period of the lease.  That should not be ignored.<\/p>  <p>  I want to touch on some of the issues mentioned.  Commercial stamp duty at 2% yielded &euro;252 million in 2016.  At a rate of 6%, we are stating it will yield &euro;376 million, representing an increase of &euro;94 million based on an increase of 4%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#RR00200","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1518,"content":"<p>That will be 6% extra in 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#SS00100","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1519,"content":"<p>That is correct, but it will go from 2% to 6%, an extra 4%, so we are quite satisfied that the figures are accurate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#SS00200","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1520,"content":"<p>That is the yield.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#SS00300","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1521,"content":"<p>The yield is &euro;376 million at 6% extra.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#SS00400","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1522,"content":"<p>Extra?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#SS00500","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1523,"content":"<p>Yes, extra.

That is what I heard and I claim that what I say is the truth.<\/p>  <p>  In the line of what the Minister of State has said, we all need clarification on this transition period.  There is no point coming out of a meeting and not knowing what the Minister of State has said.  Is he saying that the 2% is applicable until the Finance Bill has been passed?  A clear message needs to go out from this committee.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State spoke about 850,000 sq. ft of office space in Dublin.  We are fully in favour of this for the big guy who can afford to pay big money, and we had tabled a later amendment to tackle the vultures who are crippling this country and ordinary people right around, it but it was ruled out of order.  However, that is for another day.  We are talking about the small business person who is trying to survive in every one of our constituencies.  It is like talking about the elephant and the mouse.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State spoke about the time the country was in crisis.  Some parts of the country, thankfully, have made some recovery.  I am not being pessimistic but other parts have not made the same recovery.  The Minister of State has spoken about hotels and I compliment him on what he has done for them in the VAT rate.  We are reliant on the farming and small business communities to bring in revenue.  Will the Minister of State and the Department give those people breathing space?  Those amendments were tabled to make sure we hit the big operator who has plenty of money.  We are not talking about the people who can get millions of euro.  We are talking about what other Deputies outlined earlier, namely, people who have gone too far to get &euro;10,000 or &euro;12,000 more from a bank.  This is a problem in rural Ireland and this Bill has not been proofed for rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  If the Minister of State talks to auctioneers around the country he will find that land deals are at risk because the extra &euro;10,000, &euro;12,000 or &euro;20,000 is not available.  That is very clear.  The Minister of State should read the articles the solicitors wrote.  It is not just me saying this.  We will stifle them.  I am not talking about the guy who can get &euro;40,000 worth of a tax rebate or allowance.  I am talking about a person who does not have enough land to rent to get &euro;8,000 or &euro;10,000.  I am not talking about highfalutin operators but about normal people in normal parts of rural Ireland who have family farms.  That is what we are trying to protect, not the big operators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#SS02400","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1542,"content":"<p>I do not know whether the Chairman would say I am an experienced politician but I do not think I am a fool, thanks be to God.  The Minister of State, however, must think that some of us are.  He said amendment No. 64 would cost &euro;162 million, and amendment No. 65 would cost &euro;105 million.  That comes to &euro;267 million, I think.  I agree with Deputy Burton and others.  We saw the economy crash and the trauma that ended in.  A big part of that was due to the errant stamp duty and where it went.  I thought we had learned a lesson from that but one of the primary pillars in this budget depends on stamp duty.  He might get it from the 800,000 sq. ft buildings here, and we welcome that, but where is the Government going to house the people who work in them?  That is a crisis facing everybody.  I know companies in Dublin that cannot get staff from England and abroad because they cannot afford to live here.  One hand does not seem to know what the other is doing.<\/p>  <p>  It is a scandal that amendment No. 68 has been ruled out of order.  It proves there is a cabal.  <\/p>  <p>               There was an opportunity to level the playing field in terms of a distressed property being sold by financial institutions and vulture funds without being offered first to the borrower or family member at the same price as what is offered to the third party.  A 50% land tax could be incurred on that if we wanted it, with all the Paradise Papers and scandals that went on.  This was an opportunity to consider it and not rule the amendment out of order because of a charge being imposed on the people.  The people my backside.  We are trying to protect the people but it seems we are afraid to touch the fat cats.  Banks are selling distressed loans at 17% of value in some places, or 20% or perhaps up to 30%.  I have been in the Four Courts with unfortunate land owners or, even worse, householders or business people.<\/p> <p> A fellow might have had a loan on a machine or tractor but these thugs are putting a tracer on the tractors so they can find out where they are and seize them.  They are sold at a distressed price without being offered to the borrower.  Many families, business owners and householders offered 70% of the loan value, with accountants backing up the figures and money put together by families, but that was not entertained because the Minister's friends in vulture funds wanted the money.  It is murky and dirty business.  We should be trying to balance the playing field and ensure there is some semblance of fairness.  These people do not get it in the courts, and that is for another day.  I am attending the High Court tomorrow with a family from Wexford, the Minister of State's county.  Perhaps he should be down there to watch what is going on.  It is a decent and well-respected family in County Wexford.<\/p> <p> We have been told it will cost money but the Minister of State has no idea what it will cost.  These sales will not go through.  As clear as the nose on one's face, the auctioneers, solicitors and the hard-pressed young farmer or business person above all, who wants to get the loan for the transaction, will say that he or she cannot afford stamp duty.  These people will not know if they are tax compliant.  I do not know if there are representatives of the Revenue Commissioners here but we know well they will impose penalties and apply interest no matter what.  All we want is a level playing field and we tried that with our amendments.<\/p> <p> I welcome the continuity of the fixed rate for a year.  I have no interest in the &euro;40,000 mentioned by the Minister of State.  They might all be big farmers in Wexford who lease the land.  I am talking about keeping family farms alive.  What the Minister of State suggests encourages people to go buy a yacht and get &euro;40,000 in tax relief.  I am talking about the unfortunate people trying to get the cow herd up, produce our milk and beef and bring about the wonderful exports we have.  We need to keep them functioning in the jaws of Brexit and the &euro;40,000 is no good to them.  My understanding is that is for the people who want to retire, whether they are young or old.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State is not sure of his ground and he is certainly wrong in saying there is not a cabal.  There is a very strong and powerful organisation in this country that knew about this the Friday before the budget.  It is the same organisation that will not stand to represent the farmers who are being terrorised by the vulture funds in my county and that of the Minister of State, as well as Kilkenny and Waterford.  The racing syndicate is a vulture fund.  We can welcome what it does and we congratulate Mr. O'Brien last week.  It is not about him.  We welcome that it is a flagship industry but it is time to stop when it is amassing 15,000, 16,000 or 17,000 acres.  Without naming it, we know what organisation it is.  It knew about the budget and there is a cabal.  It is a dirty, rotten, stinking cabal and the little people do not matter.  One would think it would not be so after all that has gone on, especially with the Paradise Papers this week.  The Government will not control the banks that are selling the loans of people to the vulture funds.  It gives them a clap on the back.  I said before it is like rubbing butter on a fat sow's you-know-what.  That is what it is like and the Government will not tackle them.<\/p> <p> There was an opportunity with these amendments but they have been rejected.  Worst of all is the rejection of amendment No. 68, which would have tried to level the playing field.  It would have tried to get something from these Oliver Cromwell-type vultures.  They are worse than Oliver Cromwell.  They are faceless and unaccountable to anybody.  They are destroying people's lives.  We have seen suicides and marriages breaking up as well as stress, trauma and cancer because of this.<\/p> <p> There is a third force and I have been in the Minister of State's county trying to defend farmers, not far from where he lives.  People in this third force come in with balaclavas and Alsatians in the middle of the night, beating up people.  We know what happened to Mr. Henry, one of the Minister of State's constituents.  They beat him and his son, nearly killing them, on the side of the road.  There were no charges.  To make it worse, a garda who visited the scene two hours later let it go ahead.

The Minister said this amendment would result in a loss of &euro;32 million to the Exchequer if the stamp duty was reduced from 6% to 2%, which the amendment requests.

This is one of the great injustices done to be people who have paid their mortgage, whether on commercial or residential property.  They are caught in a bind as their properties have been taken from them.

Last week, I drove to Belfast to meet people because it is not possible to meet the vulture funds.  Capita, a company which operates in different parts of Ireland, is dealing with the issue.  To cite one case with which I dealt, a man who is suffering from cancer had a loan on which &euro;33,000 was owed.  The figure had increased to &euro;40,000 when Capita bought the loan with interest.  When I proposed repaying &euro;25,000, Capita, in addition to refusing the offer, this morning informed me that it planned to proceed with a sale in the middle of negotiations.  This is the type of reckless behaviour in which the vulture funds are engaging.  While I thank the Minister for his offer of a meeting, the time has come to name these people in the D&aacute;il, where Deputies have protection, and highlight what they are doing because this practice will result in a suicide.<\/p><p>I concur with the point Deputy Kenny made.  The vulture funds bought these loans at a low rate.  While we do not have a problem with them making money, we do not want people to be screwed.  <\/p><p><b>Chairman:<\/b>If the Minister does not mind, I would like to add to this discussion because the issue of vulture funds, which I intended raising towards the end of the meeting, is highly relevant and has been raised a number of times in this debate.  The loans we are discussing are generally managed by regulated entities such as Capita.  The problem people are experiencing is that it is virtually impossible to meet representatives of these organisations and difficult to obtain documents from them if one is putting together a paper trail to try to find a resolution.  When one finally meets their representatives, the culture one experiences is shocking.<\/p><p>Young people in a bank have been conditioned to stonewall people and be stony-faced when meeting customers who are clearly experiencing mental distress as a result of the issue they are experiencing.  It is not the case that they cannot negotiate but that Capita, on behalf of the various funds, will not negotiate, which is truly shocking.  I have attended some of these meetings.  I have also attended the Master's Court on a number of occasions.  The most recent hearing I attended with a client had 138 cases listed for Allied Irish Banks.  The Master of the High Court extended the time for dealing with these cases on foot of a request to do so by the banks.  This only adds further anxiety and trauma to an already wrecked family.  One must see this to believe it. <\/p><p>The same circumstances prevail in the registrar's court.  Unfortunately, the banks are facilitating this practice because it suits them to do so.  AIB and Bank of Ireland are serious offenders in this regard.  I raised with the Minister a case involving the sale next Saturday of properties owned by the Morrissey family, which tells us everything we need to know.  The family has sufficient funds outside AIB to purchase the properties in question.  They also have a track record going back 100 years and are working a number of quarries.  The families of approximately 100 families rely on them.  Once the properties go to a public auction, the cartel in quarrying, namely, the three big powers in the quarrying game, will buy the quarries and close them down.  As a result, the cost to local authorities of road construction and housing will shoot up because it is controlled by three companies.  I do not say this lightly but because I have been observing this process in this committee for a long time. <\/p><p>In my correspondence with the Minister, I asked him to stop the sale of the Morrissey properties from proceeding and allow the family to buy them back at the value the banks say they are worth.  This would protect competition in the marketplace, 100 jobs and the services and goods supplied into the quarries in question.  That is all I am asking.  I am not asking anyone to show favouritism but simply to recognise that there is a reckless cartel in the banks and vulture funds and among the large companies that are wrecking the lives of individuals. <\/p><p>This committee tried on more than one occasion to have various funds - the main players - appear before us to explain how they operate and what they do.  They refused point blank to do so.  I have dealt with these funds face to face and I am shocked by them.  Capita, a regulated entity which is supposed to act properly, is even worse than the vulture funds.  I am interested in hearing from Deputies Fitzmaurice and Mattie McGrath and perhaps other Deputies who have attended these meetings.<\/p><p>It is truly shocking that this bad culture of banking has been handed on intact to the next generation of young bankers.  The country is suffering immensely for this reason.  I am not being extreme about this or taking it to the edge.  However, I have seen this often and, as a public representative, I find it disturbing when my efforts to do something about it in the Oireachtas fail.  It was for this reason that I contacted the Minister directly on the Morrissey case.  <\/p>  <p>               That is a real example of what is happening.  People appeal - they do not do so lightly - to individuals like me and the Minister to intervene.  As we own the bank, the sale should be stalled while negotiations are ongoing.  Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice has made a valid point.  As negotiations are ongoing with Capita, on behalf of the vulture funds, such institutions escalate their efforts to sell properties to put pressure on the individual or individuals concerned.<\/p> <p> I shall tell the Minister what I said in the D&aacute;il.  I shall not say it in an argumentative manner but will simply outline the facts.  I sat in front of three representatives of Capita with the man at the centre of this case.  Both he and his family are completely and utterly broken.  They are suffering a terrible mental illness because of it.  All the man can do is give Capita permission to sell every piece of property he owns.  When the representatives asked him about the residual debt, he said he could not do anything about it because he did not have any money.  Then a young girl seated behind the desk reached over and said to him: \"I want you to ask your father, mother, brothers, sisters, community and credit union, but we want money, money, money.\"  That is exactly the way she said it and I found it horrific listening to her.  <\/p> <p> I shall finish by saying I am disturbed by what the banks are doing and by what has happened between AIB and Morrissey's.  I am sorry if I went on a little, but I had outline what was truly happening.  It had to be said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#ZZ00600","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1557,"content":"<p>I apologise for my late return.

If the Minister does not know that this is true, I do not know where he is living and it is a case of hear no evil, speak no evil and see no evil.  I can attest to the fact that this is happening and it is downright evil.<\/p>  <p>  About receivers, I know of a well respected family in the Minister of State's county who are having an unmerciful time in trying to sell everything.  Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice and I have tabled amendment No. 68 which, unfortunately, has been ruled out of order.  It would afford individuals, like the people I have mentioned - I know the business - an opportunity to be offered the property at the price it was offered for sale to a third party.  The family in question have not been given an opportunity to buy back their business to keep it going and retain 100 jobs in the area.  They have not been afforded an opportunity to keep their pride, dignity and mental health.  The amendment has been ruled out or order.  It seeks to ensure that when a property is sold for 30% of its value or even less, an appropriate charge would be applied.  In this case the financial institution involved was offered between 70% and 80% of the asking price for the property, but it refused to sell it back to the original owners.  It is a controlled takeover, which is totally unacceptable.  I commented on this matter earlier when the Minister of State was present.  Receiverships are happening.  For proof all one needs to do is go to the courts where receiverships are registered or to the High Court tomorrow morning where one will be able to witness the case I have mentioned, with hundreds of others, for whom there is no refuge in the courts - none.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#AAA00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1558,"content":"<p>I advise the Minister that on 5 May we received a list provided by the Department of Finance of the various funds Ministers for Finance had met over time.<\/p>  <p>Obviously, these meetings were part of the business of the country and the Ministers for Finance had to meet them.

From my understanding of this stamp duty relief, but I am open to correction and this is the reason I have tabled the amendment in this way, this relief was removed last December.

I, along with my colleagues, Deputies Jackie Cahill and Charlie McConalogue, attended a meeting with the Department of Finance and Revenue on this issue to make the case and to explain where we are coming from.  The Minister will be aware of the existing relief, section 604B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, in respect of farm restructuring and which has to be certified by Teagasc.  It will be in place up to the end of 2019, and provided that certain strict conditions are met involving the sale and purchase of land to consolidate a farm holding, there is an exemption from CGT on the sale portion.

Section 81C of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 allowed a farmer to claim relief from stamp duty where he or she sold and purchased land, in order to consolidate his or her holding, where both the sale and purchase occurred within 18 months of each other.  The relief applied provided Teagasc had issued the farmer with a consolidation certificate in respect of the sale and purchase.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy McGrath has raised this matter with me and I also engaged with his colleagues.

It may therefore be necessary to provide that a stamp duty relief for farm consolidation transactions is subject to a commencement order.

It was an honest attempt to deal with some of the issues which the Chairman addressed not long ago.  We are not dealing with it.  The banks have run amok and they are engaged in daylight robbery.  The Taoiseach makes strong expressions to convey his angst.  Yesterday I asked him if the Minister for Finance had attended the EGM of AIB last week, and he was not able to tell me, maybe the Minister will tell me here.<\/p>  <p>  The culture of \"softly softly\" is still there.  The Minister himself said that all is not well there.  We know that.  This amendment was an effort to do two things.  Against the vulture funds and our home-grown banks, and we now have a home-grown Tipperary vulture fund which is amassing land, this was to try to give a reasonable chance to the owners of distressed loans, whether in the cases of property, farms, family homes, buy-to-let or whatever, these were people who got up in the mornings, borrowed money, had a business and then the crash happened, which was not their fault. <\/p>  <p>   Like the Chairman, I voted for that bank guarantee, and what did we get for it only two fingers from every hand; if there were three hands we would get two fingers from each of them the whole time.  We as a Parliament encounter this but so do the people the banks are dealing with.  We are talking about farms, households and machinery necessary to carry out business, where the debt was sold on for 17% of the value.  There were often many payments made on the machinery, some of which was old.  I referred to a man in Wexford who had been beaten up by thugs - his tractor was ten years old and worth about &euro;12,000.  Deputy Fitzmaurice and I put forward this amendment to see if we could get some respect and put some manners on these people so that, where they sold a distressed loan to a vulture fund, they would first have had to have offered the same conditions to the person to whom the loan was made - whether it was for a house, tractor, shop, or the farm.  That is not unreasonable.  What are we doing?  We are terrorising our own people and crushing them into ground to give away loans to foreign - and now home-grown - vulture companies.  <\/p>  <p>  This was also a way of bringing in revenue.  It beggars belief that loans can be sold off for that kind of money.  We know what we paid to Europe for the money.  They told us it was a bailout but it was a clean out.  Here was an opportunity to stop this in its tracks and bring valuable revenue into State coffers, to allow a modicum of civilised living in rural and urban Ireland for families who will end up in hospitals, whether they are general or psychiatric.  A wasteland is being created, and for what purpose?  It is to line the pockets of fat cats and vultures.  I cannot understand it and I will not understand it, nor will any reasonable observer.  No one will accept it.  I do not like using the word but it is the rape of our own people and land for which we fought dearly.  My late father fought in the War of Independence as did many others to free our country, and for what purpose?  To be owned by these cartels and cabals and vulture funds.  That is what is happening and I am appalled that the Minister would not listen to our suggestion in the Rural Independent Group's pre-budget submission to introduce a land tax on farms of over 750 acres because that covers the vast majority of ordinary farmers.  People with holdings above that are not interested in their neighbours, parish or community, the just want to amass large tracts.  It happened recently in Wicklow where another stud bought a farm of land.  <\/p>  <p>               The stud industry is great.  I have nothing against it.  All we wanted was a level playing field or some semblance of one, but the Government failed to do that in the budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#DDD01200","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1614,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's commitment to meet Deputies to discuss the vulture funds, in respect of which the amendments sought to introduce a high rate of stamp duty.

Following publication of the Bill, it was noted that the references to the Companies Act 2014 were not sufficient to encompass mergers or divisions involving public limited companies.  The amendments insert the relevant references for mergers and divisions in sections 59, 60 and 74 of the Bill. <\/p><p>I take the opportunity to flag that I may bring forward a further amendment to this section on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017110900002#EEE01800","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1510221600,"counter":1630,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1510221600,"counter":1631,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 71:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 56, to delete lines 35 to 39, and in page 57, to delete lines 1 to 5 and substitute the following:  \t&quot;

The Independent Victims and Survivors Coalition is a group that was formed to give a voice to people in the Republic of Ireland who have been most affected by the Northern Ireland Troubles.  Our group is independent and non-political, and is open to all innocent victims and survivors.  While we appreciate the support that has been shown to us by many individual members of the public and by various media outlets, our voices have been largely forgotten by politicians and policy makers.  We feel that official Ireland has very badly let us down.  Our group has come together to collectively address this imbalance and to ensure that the legacy work in relation to the Troubles does not forget or continue to ignore those innocent victims and survivors who suffered at the hands of the terrorists.  We want to play our part in shaping a better Ireland, North and South, but we cannot do this if our voices continue to go unheard.  In a presentation to this committee in 2015 we outlined the four main aims of our group; truth recovery; justice; support and services; and remembrance and recognition.  These aims remain the same and sadly there has been little or no progress in most of the areas of concern that we raised.<\/p> <p>  I will address truth recovery first.  A recent research study that I carried out among 80 victims and survivors of the Troubles has revealed some very interesting information.  While it is generally recognised that there are many unsolved crimes from the Troubles, there was a 92% non-conviction rate in the sample involved, with 80% of those crimes dating back 25 years or more.  Some 95% of those surveyed expressed a desire to get answers and truth.  This comes against a background where those terrorists who committed these crimes have been aided and supported by both governments in living a full life and all that that entails, while those who have lived in the shadow of these crimes have not been so lucky.  The victims in these cases have had no answers to their questions, have had no admissions of responsibility and will most likely never get justice for their loved ones.  <\/p> <p>  In the face of such realities the survey found that 42% would readily commit to an informal justice approach to truth recovery, while 30% replied &ldquo;Maybe&rdquo; and only 28% definitely ruled it out.  Those figures suggest that victims and survivors are more than willing to fully commit to a truth recovery process.  However, the biggest obstacle to participating for those who opted for &ldquo;No&rdquo; or &ldquo;Maybe&rdquo; is the area of truth.  This became very evident in the focus groups that were conducted as part of this research.  Victims and survivors have very little confidence that former terrorists will have any incentive to tell the truth and many would point to my own attempt at truth recovery as an example where a victim was not dealt with in a truthful fashion by the terrorists or their political allies.  In fact, many victims and survivors feel that the political organisations who are aligned to the former terrorists will never take responsibility for their actions, as evidenced recently when the murder of Tom Oliver was labelled a &ldquo;political killing&rdquo;.  Truth is something which does not sit easily with these organisations.<\/p><p>It is for these reasons, as stated before the committee in 2015, that our group feels the truth recovery process, as envisaged and agreed by the Governments in the Stormont House Agreement, falls well short of meeting the needs of victims.<br\/><br\/>As stated in 2015, the following is required in order for the Stormont House Agreement to become acceptable to victims.  The process of truth recovery must be victim-centred with victim representatives involved in the structures, management and oversight of the process, as envisaged by the Hass proposals.  Not including the victims' voices at this level is a grave mistake and needs to be rectified by the Governments.  The process of truth recovery must be done in public so that victims who have had to suffer quite publicly and who have been subjected to public denials over a long number of years can have a public admission of truth.  There can be no hidden truths.  The process of truth recovery must be transparent.  The current proposals stop well short of giving victims all the relevant information regarding their cases.  Crucially, they do not allow victims to meet with or question those supplying information or the perpetrators.  In order for us to trust the process, we need to be able to test and question the evidence.  Being handed a report by a third party is not acceptable and it is not truth recovery.<br\/><br\/>I turn to the matter of justice.  In our evidence before this committee in 2015, we highlighted concerns on two specific issues relating to justice for victims and we asked the committee for its help and support in these areas.  The first relates to remarks made by former Attorney General, Senator Michael McDowell, in which he stated to various media outlets that a Government decision was taken not to pursue historical cases from the Troubles era.  At the time, we asked for clarity to be sought in relation to this matter.  The second relates to our concerns about the way many of the investigations relating to crimes from the Troubles were carried out.  There appears to have been a gross mismanagement of many cases and these unfortunately all seem to be quite similar in nature.  We asked the committee to support us in calling for a full public inquiry into the way these investigations were carried out.  No progress has been made on either of these issues.  We are again asking the committee to seek clarification in relation to the first issue by asking Senator McDowell to give evidence to the committee and, secondly, to publicly endorse our call for a public inquiry into the manner in which investigations from the Troubles era were carried out.  As stated to this committee in 2015 while victims were not consulted on the Good Friday Agreement and had no voice in the process, we accept, as democrats, the conditions laid out in the Agreement and what they require should there be convictions in cases that are relevant to them.  This group is founded on the principal of not seeking revenge.  However, our group continues to seek assurances from Government that all historical cases will continue to be vigorously investigated and prosecuted, especially as many of the victims were in the service of the State and murdered in the line of duty.<br\/><br\/>I turn to support and services.  As we explained to the committee in 2015, victims of terrorism have had to deal with many issues in their lives with zero support from our Government.  These issues are ongoing and affect us every day of our lives.  They range from post-traumatic stress to anxiousness, panic, fear, alcoholism, mental illness, marriage break-up, and poor education outcomes.  As many of these problems only come to light years after the initial trauma, the Government needs to put a structured set of supports in place for victims and survivors.  We are aware that, through the reconciliation fund, the Government supports victims and survivors in Northern Ireland and we hope for parity of esteem with those groups.  Supports should be centred on counselling and therapeutic needs, education needs, respite needs and supports to help victims aid the reconciliation and healing process.  Our group met with officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and presented the case for such supports to them.  To say that we were disappointed with the response would be an understatement.  We were informed that as part of the Good Friday Agreement negotiations that there was, purposely, no provision made for Southern victims to have funding made available to them.  The rationale for this, we were told, was that we could &quot;go to the HSE&quot; for any support that was required.  Not only is this in-built level of discrimination unacceptable, it says, in effect, to Southern victims and survivors that our suffering is somehow worth less or not on a par with that of those in the North.  I suggested to the committee in 2015 that it would benefit from hearing the personal testimonies of some victims as it would help inform members of the needs and supports required.  Again, I invite the members to arrange for this to take place.  Our group is yet again calling on the Irish Government to establish a victims forum similar to that in Northern Ireland and to end the practice of discrimination in relation to supports by opening up discussions with us on how to best achieve this support.  We ask this committee to actively support us in this regard.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>I turn to remembrance and recognition.  Since our group last gave evidence to the committee, I am pleased to say that there has been some small progress in the area of remembrance and recognition.  I am glad to be able to inform the committee that the relatives of Garda Michael Clerkin are to be presented with a posthumous Scott Medal on his behalf.  His colleagues who were injured in the same heinous attack by the IRA will be similarly honoured at a ceremony in December.  During the Troubles, 12 garda&iacute;, one member of the Defence Forces and one member of the Prison Service<b><\/b>were murdered while defending our State.  Many civilians, such as the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, and individuals, such as Senator Billy Fox and Tom Oliver in County Louth, had their lives ended by acts of terrorism.  Our group is aware that many members of our security forces who served during the Troubles are now suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.  For the victims' families and for survivors, remembrance and recognition are very important but we have very often had to remember in a private an isolated fashion.  As I previously remarked to this committee in 2015, recognising and remembering all victims and survivors equally is something the State has failed to do.  Our suggestions seemed to meet with general approval when they were put to the committee in 2015 and we ask again for the committee's support in calling on the Government to award special service medals to all members of the State forces who served during the Troubles; award bravery medals to members of the State forces murdered in the line of duty, where it is not already done; open discussions with civilian victims on how to best recognise their loss or harm; reopen the Remembrance Commission; and create one national memorial for all innocent victims and members of the State forces murdered during the Troubles, at which an annual memorial service could be held.<br\/><br\/>On behalf of the Independent Victims and Survivors Coalition, I thank the committee for giving us this opportunity to address how the legacy of the Troubles has impacted and continues to impact on us.  For too long, the perceived focus of the peace process has been on the perpetrators.  The time has come to change this so that the focus is on the innocent victims and those who risked their lives upholding the rule of law and preserving society.  We ask the committee to support our suggestions and recommendations as to how our specific needs can be dealt with in the areas of truth recovery, justice, support services, and recognition and remembrance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017110900002#B00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Austin Stack","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510244100,"counter":1716,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation today, which we appreciate.  Innocent Victims United, IVU, is an umbrella organisation for 23 groups which have a collective membership in excess of 11,500 individual victims and survivors.  The organisation was formed in 2012 as a movement to offer a cohesive voice to the innocent victims and survivors of terrorism and other Troubles-related violence.  The organisation's status is voluntary and its membership spans Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland, Great Britain and mainland Europe.  The organisation has a clear position on terrorism and violence.  It stands on the solid legal and moral foundation that in the context of Northern Ireland that there was not and is not a justification for the criminal taking of life in either the advancement or defence of a political objective.  IVU is non-sectarian and non-political and seeks to offer a robust challenge and independent voice in holding terrorism and its proponents and apologists accountable.  We also engage robustly with Governments, policy-makers and other stakeholders who engage with victim and survivor issues.<\/p> <p>  The cry coming from large sections of wider society today is that victims and survivors should and must move on.  While victims and survivors are often characterised as anti-peace and anti-progress, is this really the case?<\/p><p>We would argue that when these matters are scrutinised it is victims and survivors who have given more than any other constituency in the quest for a lasting peace to be possible in this land we all inhabit.  The expression &quot;dealing with the past&quot; is insulting to victims and survivors who are in fact pleading with Government and wider society to deal with their present so that they may have the means to move forward with their lives and start actually living again as opposed to simply existing again.<br\/><br\/>The burdens that victims and survivors are asked to carry include the burden of the immediate loss of a loved one through terrorism or other criminal actions committed by individual members of the security forces, or the physical and\/or psychological damage caused by such acts; the burden of injustice,<b><\/b>where limited numbers of perpetrators have been held accountable for their crimes and where states and others have failed to provide adequately for those who have suffered grievous damage, be it physical or psychological; and the burden of forgiveness,<b><\/b>where large sections of the establishment and of the general population demand and expect victims and survivors to unconditionally forgive those who have grievously wronged them and that this should be in the absence of remorse, repentance and restitution being demonstrated by those who inflicted the wrong.  In each of these instances the victims and survivors were and are being treated as collateral damage so that wider society might benefit from the supposed peace dividend brought about through a decrease in violence on our streets. <br\/><br\/>The Stormont House Agreement claimed to pave a way for difficult issues around the Troubles to be advanced.  A suite of institutions were and are being proposed including the historical investigations unit, HIU; the independent commission for information retrieval, ICIR; the oral history archive; and the implementation and reconciliation group.  There are other statements of intent to establish a mental health trauma service and a pension for the seriously injured. <br\/><br\/>We have consistently stated that any new process must contain the following: a commitment from all to work to ensure that the violence of the Troubles period never be repeated; more importantly, that it be recognised by all, including both the proscribed terror organisations and the Governments of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, that in the context of Northern Ireland and irrespective of real or perceived grievances, there was never any justification for the criminal taking of life in the advancement of or defence of a political objective; a victim-centred approach, whereby the needs of victims and survivors are, belatedly, put front and centre of proceedings and that we move beyond an appeasement process of perpetrators; and an open and transparent public debate on what constitutes a victim or survivor in the context of the Northern Ireland Troubles.  The current definition of the term &quot;victim&quot; is at the centre of the abyss into which these issues have fallen.  Innocent Victims United has engaged with victims groups; individual victims and survivors; church leaders; political leaders; academics; the GAA; the Orange Order; and with a plethora of other community and voluntary sector based organisations.  There was universal recognition in those discussions that the current definition of &lsquo;victim&rsquo; as laid out in the Victims and Survivors (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 is morally defunct.  The definition of &lsquo;victim&rsquo; is at the very core of the failed policies which have been developed on victims and survivors issues.  There must be a genuine pathway for victims and survivors to pursue justice, truth and accountability whether they are victims of terrorism or of actions committed by individual members of the security forces, and there must be the means for real outcomes to be delivered.  Steps must be taken by both the UK and Republic of Ireland Governments to send out clearly a message that no-one is beyond the reaches of the law and no-one is protected.  This means, for example, the legal rescinding of letters of comfort provided to approximately 200 Republicans.Legislation must also be introduced by both the UK and Republic of Ireland Governments which commits each state to providing full disclosure and full co-operation around matters concerning Troubles-related events and crimes.  There must also be equitable access to support services for victims and survivors wherever they happen to live across the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland.  This requires a collaborative approach from Dublin, London and Belfast as well as the adequate resourcing of future service provision across the areas of health and well-being; advocacy; welfare; compensation; restitution-based packages and so forth.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>I will now move on to outline our specific concerns with the new historical investigations unit, HIU, proposed in the Stormont House Agreement.  We have concerns, for example, on the issue of equality.  As we understand it, it  is currently proposed that only those cases where no Historical Enquiries Team, HET, review was conducted will automatically have an entitlement to a HIU investigation and that those cases which have had a review may only have access to an HIU investigation on the basis of new evidence emerging.  This is not equality-compliant and is causing substantive frustration and hurt amongst the victim and survivor constituency.  We submit that this<b><\/b>must be resolved.  There is also inequality around access to information files.  Presuming that there is full disclosure and full co-operation from both the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland Governments, factoring in national security considerations, we have concerns as to how terrorist organisations will be compelled to provide information, given that they do not hold files or documents to make available for interrogation. <br\/><br\/>There are also governance issues here.  How will this new unit interfaces with the Policing Board given the significant conflict of interest that one particular political party has with legacy-related issues?  I speak of course of Sinn F&eacute;in and the IRA.  We have further concerns over other matters of appointment and oversight, the details of which remain unclear to us.<br\/><br\/>Turning again to the issue of what is termed &quot;on the runs&quot;, or OTRs, and the Royal prerogatives of mercy, unless and until these issues are resolved through the legal rescinding of previous assurances given, we see little value in supporting an agreement which leaves victims and survivors entirely in the dark as to the remaining opportunities for justice. Why would we encourage families to engage with HIU or ICIR processes unless it is made legally clear and transparent by both Governments that no-one is immune from prosecution? <br\/><br\/>With regard to the ICIR, there is significant apprehension within the IVU constituency concerning the proposed ICIR process and we have deep concerns on how information provided can be tested and\/or verified.  We also have concerns around information leaks which could potentially prejudice a future criminal prosecution.  Critically however, we do not see evidence of the goodwill which would be necessary to convince  innocent victims and survivors of terrorism that the proscribed terrorist organisations actually wish to deal honourably with these matters. <br\/><br\/>In respect of the oral history archive, we acknowledge the need for personal testimony and accounts to be facilitated but we have also lobbied for and continue to insist upon the need for a commission of historical clarification.  There is a need for the development of a process which examines Troubles-related events critically and which distinguishes between events proven on an evidential basis and those relying upon intelligence, rumour and supposition reasoning. <br\/><br\/>With regard to reparations and pensions for the injured, terrorist organisations took the decision to go out and murder and maim and also to destroy commerce.  In doing so they inflicted serious disablement to members of our community.  Through their political voices these organisations are now seeking to prevent the innocent from receiving lifeline financial support and stability because these organisations continue to subscribe to a selfish ideology rooted in the philosophy of &quot;ourselves alone&quot;.The contentious political issue of terrorists receiving the pension needs to be taken off the table, either through politicians having the courage to rule it out outright or through the development of an appeals mechanism similar to what was devised in the Stormont special advisors, SPAD, Bill.  Those who hold a conviction for serious crimes would thus be required to go through such a mechanism.  <br\/><br\/>We argue that reparations also need to be resolved for the following groups: the immediately bereaved or next of kin; those who have been displaced or, in the case of parts of Fermanagh and Castlederg, ethnically cleansed; and the victims of Gaddafi and Provisional IRA terrorism.  Additional work is also needed to examine a reparation case for those who have been psychologically injured. <b><\/b><br\/><br\/>I will conclude by discussing the forerunner to the work of the implementation and reconciliation group.  We in the IVU demand that the Governments responsible for stewardship of the peace and political processes recommit themselves to the principles of justice, truth and accountability, and that they will without fear or fervour support the innocent victims and survivors of terrorism and other Troubles-related violence in their quest to obtain answers.  Society must be embedded with a mind-set that when one neighbour wrongs another they are required to engage in a process of what may be terms &quot;3 Rs&quot;, that is, that they demonstrate remorse; that they show repentance; and that they engage in restitutive acts.  After these processes have been worked through, individual and societal reconciliation will then be possible.Without this, we will continue with our current state of phoney peace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017110900002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kenny Donaldson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510244100,"counter":1718,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak about the experience and work of the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation on legacy issues on the island of Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Una O'Higgins O'Malley was one of the founders and drivers of the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation, which was established in early 1970s as a response to the outbreak of conflict in Northern Ireland.

She reported in a radio interview in 2005, two years before she died, that the loss of her father had a profound impact on her life, one that made her particularly sensitive to the impact of violence on children.<br\/><br\/>In an interview to mark her 75th birthday, she told <i>The Irish Times<\/i>she only once nearly succumbed to bitterness when she discovered the killer's claim that he had danced on her father's grave, and she said:<\/p><blockquote>I got seized with this awful, awful unforgiving cloud, that I hadn't ever felt as badly before.  I couldn't stop it, it was like this lava pouring from a volcano ... I had so often gone to that grave.  That happened on Holy Thursday and I thought, 'So much for Holy Thursday and Jesus Christ and all that'.  I wanted to throw the whole thing out there and then.  But on Good Friday, I made my way back to the church somehow and as I put my foot on the church porch, I had this thought: 'Have a Mass said for them all'.  And that was when I felt normal again ...&quot;<\/blockquote> <p>So it happened that 60 years after the murder of Kevin O'Higgins, his daughter arranged a memorial mass in Booterstown church, here in Dublin, for him and his killers.  Her response to his murder or execution, although she admits that living with the loss was very hard to bear at times, was to call the sons and daughters of a bitter Civil War to dialogue.  She devoted her life to calling the enemies or protagonists together and to the creation and repairing of fractured relationships across this island.<br\/><br\/>In a recent publication, aptly called <i>Wounds<\/i>, BBC foreign correspondent Fergal Keane uses his experiences of civil war to write about the impact in north Kerry, where his people come from.  It examines the brutality of &quot;cogadh na mbr&aacute;ithre&quot;, the fight or war between brothers, and &quot;how the ghosts of the past return to shape the present as acts of killings reverberate through the generations.&quot;<br\/><br\/>One hundred years on, <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">we have lived a mostly peaceful life in the South of Ireland, although there have been traumatic and violent attacks on this side of the Border.  We have often ignored Northern Ireland as having nothing to do with us.  We are, however, deeply entwined - historically, politically, economically and emotionally.  The story of those in the North is our story too; our legacy is their legacy too.  There is no single story.  What we do know is that the ghosts of the past will return if we do not heal the wounds of violence in this generation.  The Civil War generation chose not to address the impact of the violence and opted for amnesia, passing the responsibility to a later generation.  Are we up for it or mature enough here in the South over the next five years to talk about the unacknowledged hurt of those years?<\/font><br\/><br\/>Our centre's work has always been to deepen reconciliation across and between those on the island.  The strategic objective for the next ten years is to work in this regard.  Our work is done in facilitating dialogue, sharing learning and building capacity, promoting relationships and networks, and encouraging public discourse.  Hospitality underpins that for whoever comes and in whatever way we can offer it.<br\/><br\/>Since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement or Belfast Agreement in 1998, the centre has worked tirelessly to explore the complex legacies and traumas of the conflict, how they can best be addressed and reckoned with, and how those affected can be helped.  Our work was done through tough economic times when many said there was no need for it and asked whether there was not now peace and whether the conflict was not now over.What we knew, of course, is that Northern Ireland was in recovery and that, like any society that had experienced trauma, including our own earlier, it would take time to recover, regardless of the rhetoric and the peace talk.  That is why Glencree is encouraging the current generations on all sides who experienced the violence of the Troubles to hear the stories of victims and survivors so violence will never again be used to achieve ethnic political objectives.<br\/><br\/>Two years ago, in the absence of the legacy arrangements of the Stormont House Agreement being put in place, we started an intercommunal project from the bottom up whereby the stories could be heard in Glencree's large circle by the other side.  We are very pleased that the EU PEACE IV programme has acknowledged that work and will allow us to continue with it in a more systematic way over the next four years.  Through a process of private and confidential facilitated dialogues, it will examine themes and issues that remain as obstacles to deeper understanding and the promotion of positive relations.<br\/><br\/>No words I can use here today will help members understand the experience and power of people being able to talk about what happened to them and then hear what happened to others.  Black-and-white accounts of narratives turn to shades of grey as people start to walk in the shoes of the others and see another perspective.  It is never comfortable or easy.  We hope the learning accrued through the project will be of assistance to victims' and survivors' groups, interest groups and academics.  The programme will also have a very strong women-led process because we have recognised over the years that we have worked that women sometimes carry a double burden in the midst of conflict.  They sometimes have to care for their children in the midst of conflict and make sure there is enough food on the table that their families are kept safe.<br\/><br\/>What is needed?  It has been said here before that support is needed for direct victims of the conflict to make sense of and meaning from what happened and how it all happened, and determine what questions were left unanswered as a result of what happened.  Victims of the conflict have been forced to carry the burden of the peace process and are often ignored and made to carry a burden of guilt for not being able to get over it in the &quot;we need to move on&quot; narrative.<br\/><br\/>Support is also needed to deal with the embedded post-traumatic stress in individuals and communities that has manifested itself in mental health issues.  Over 3,000 suicides, three quarters male, were recorded between the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and 2014.  This is almost the same number as the number directly killed in the conflict in the previous 25 to 30 years.  This is often from the unhealed emotional injury that is best worked through by the acknowledgment of the hurt.  <br\/><br\/>Glencree works with women in tough working-class communities to develop leadership.  As I stated, women carry a double burden in conflict.  They come from a patriarchal society that is economically and educationally disadvantaged and are trying to care for a family and keep them safe.<br\/><br\/>Young people, like all young people, sometimes struggle with a sense of wanting to understand what happened while many do not want to know anything about the past.  Others are held in the past by a sense that if they move forward, they will be at some level betraying their parents or community.  As we now know, many are carrying intergenerational trauma.<br\/><br\/>What have we learned?  We have learned that victims have different needs.  These can include the need for recognition and for their suffering and pain to be acknowledged publicly or privately, or both, by those who caused it or by those in power, be it the state, judiciary, political establishment or church.  They want truth, which means hearing the truth of what happened, regardless of whether it is too late for the punishment of those who perpetrated it.  Compensation is often a matter of money or other things.  Relationships are so important because they are fractured.  For a long period, we have turned our backs on each other.  I refer to this State and the Northern Ireland state.  The quality and presence of relationships and a sense that there is a place for everybody on this island need to be spoken about in a spirit of generosity, genuineness and service.<br\/><br\/>It is a matter of using dialogue to have difficult conversations.<\/p><p>What dialogue means is increasing the flow of understanding between people.  It enables people to stop rivalling and competing with each other, where all in the room feel safe to speak, are respectful of others and are heard without judgment, creating the conditions that enable people to find meaning. <\/p><p> Language also is heard and understood differently in different traditions.  We need to watch our language because our language can be used as a weapon to inflame and denigrate and it also can be used in a supportive way.<\/p><p> The Good Friday Agreement and Belfast Agreement addressed many things.  One can be Irish or British, or both, or have multiple identities.  However, the acknowledgement of the hurt caused on all sides is not embedded in the text nor a stated commitment to develop, create and recreate fractured relationships at all levels on this island, political, social, and economic, that will enable not just a tolerated coexistence between all of us but a genuine set of relationships that will last into the future that we will be able to give to our children, and now, for some of us, our grandchildren.  <\/p><p> In conclusion, I want to say that 20 years ago the Good Friday Agreement did not provide for a healing process.  It provided for many things but not for that.  There is an urgency for the Stormont House arrangements and the three designated units for a five-year period to be put in place as soon as possible before it is too late for this generation.  If political agreement is not possible, then the moneys allocated for the Stormont House Agreement need to be made available to bottom-up processes by reconciliation groups and civil society organisations and churches.  <\/p><p> Lastly, we must ensure that the legacy of the past is not another stage to play out tired, repetitive and old worn-out arguments that were neither won nor settled conflicts 30, 40, 100 or 50 years.  There must be another way, and Glencree knows that there is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017110900002#E00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Barbara Walshe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510244100,"counter":1720,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Walshe, and I thank all the groups who have come in to testify today.

I am conscious that a lot of people want to ask questions so I will try to be as quick as possible.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Stack stated that when he was here in 2015 that we wanted to call the former Attorney General, Michael McDowell, into the committee.  That has not happened yet.  I would propose that we write to Senator McDowell, as he is now, to request that he come in and give his views to the committee, if that is possible.  <\/p> <p>  Also, Mr. Stack wanted a full public inquiry into the investigations.  I wonder who we could call in.  Is there anybody the witness feels we should call into this committee to ask for a full public inquiry, because it obviously has not happened in the last two years.  I will let the witness answer in a minute if that is okay.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Donaldson mentioned words which are very disturbing, \"collateral damage\".  They dehumanise civilians and victims and I find sometimes the victims have been taken for granted and I do not know what we can do about it here.  It is an issue that sometimes has been put down on the bottom of the pile when it comes to dealing with issues but I understand Northern Ireland is a very complicated issue.  <\/p> <p>  To Ms Walshe, I want to say that the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation has done amazing work over the years.  I did not know the history of Una O'Malley and the setting up of Glencree.  From somebody who came from near the Border in the late 1970s and early 1980s, we felt comfortable because the full impact of the Troubles, or whatever we call them, did not impact on us but invariably it did to some degree.  I think we are in a much better situation but sometimes people get left behind.  I think we need to mobilise more people from the Republic that were affected.  Mr. Stack mentioned 12 garda&iacute;, and the prison officer was Mr. Stack's father, and also a member of the Defence Forces as well as the Monaghan and Dublin bombings.  Perhaps we should do a lot more including Northern Ireland politicians, Republic of Ireland politicians and also those in Westminster as well.  Working together we can see we have a shared history and can do more.<\/p> <p>  Ironically, the decade of commemorations, which commemorated Home Rule and the Ulster Covenant and the First World War and the Easter Rising, has been a huge success and I think we can learn an awful lot more.  It has been a huge success in the last six or seven years.  It has been carried out from an historical perspective but I think it has provided a platform where we can move on.  <\/p> <p>  In relation to the Civil War issue, I think we have learned a huge lesson from what went on in the last five or ten years.  What can we do as politicians to help?  I know where I live people feel that with the Good Friday Agreement being 20 years old that the problems in relation to Northern Ireland are sorted and that it has moved on.  It clearly is not, but we are in a much better place.  What can we as politicians, who were not as affected, do?  Ms Walshe referred to language.  I have always found that Northern Ireland politicians, because they were at the coalface, use the right political language whereas sometimes down here in the Republic we do not use the right political language.  It can be hurtful.  I just want to ask those questions and once again thank all of the witnesses.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017110900002#F00300","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speech","time":1510244100,"counter":1722,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Breathnach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017110900002#F00400","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speech","time":1510244100,"counter":1723,"content":"<p>I would like to thank the three groups for their presentations.

The witness mentioned Mr. Tom Oliver, Ms Jean McConville, and three members of the garda&iacute;, including Sergeant Morrissey, who were murdered.  Sergeant Morrissey lived in my own town.

The witnesses made a number of different proposals and I do not disagree with any of them.

There has been much mismanagement of the investigations of cases, in particular those from 1980 to 1985.  Such mismanagement centres around issues such as critical witnesses not being questioned and evidence going missing, which seem to go hand in hand in this regard.  There were very similar issues involving witnesses not being questioned and evidence going missing in the case of my father, that of Mr. Kelly's father, and other cases involving people in our group.  We are quite forthright about looking for a public inquiry in that regard.  It is not simply explained by poor Garda practices at the time, although that is what we have been told.  We were told the fingerprint archive in Santry was flooded and fingerprints were washed away.  We then asked the Garda if it had the original material evidence off which the fingerprints were taken and were told it had been lost.  That is the sort of barrier that has been put in our way.<\/p> <p>  If one looks for the log book of where that evidence went and who the last person to have it was, one is told the Garda has the log book and knows where it last was but it is not where it is supposed to be.  That is not down to poor Garda practice at the time.  Our group believes there was something untoward going on.  We believe it is confined to a very specific period of time.  In 2015, when I last gave evidence before the committee, I pointed out that in his book Deputy Ferris thanked certain members of the Prison Service in particular for help they gave him.  That is the sort of thing with which we are faced.  There was a very small minority within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Prison Service who aided and abetted the IRA at the time.  We need to tease those matters out in a full public inquiry.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Breathnach asked what form a victim-centred peace process or true recovery process would take.  I have spoken to many people on that issue and discussed it with the leader of the Provisional movement, Deputy Adams.  He was quite adamant that there had to be amnesties at the start of the process or else he could not bring his people on board.  I was quite forthright with him that the victims are prepared to enter into informal justice and truth recovery if the process is done right.  There should be a commission attended by the victims and the perpetrators.  There would be privilege over what is said therein and one could not be charged or prosecuted over what is divulged.  At the end of the process, if the families felt they had been dealt with in a truthful and honest fashion, they could then recommend that there be an amnesty.  When we tried to do an informal process, I had to bring my family with me on it because we were kind of split as a family.  I said to Deputy Adams at the start of the process that if at the end of the process my family felt we had been dealt with in a 100% truthful fashion, we would be prepared to state that we did not want prosecutions to result.<\/p> <p>  We went into that process and were not dealt with in an honest fashion.  We were told about 70% of the truth.  The 30% we were not told involved the sanctioning of the operation and we could not be told about it because it leads back to quite senior people in Sinn F&eacute;in.  My view on this is quite simple.  A victim-centred process allows the victim and perpetrator to sit down to discuss what has happened and to come to an arrangement that would help aid reconciliation and the healing process.  If the victims feel they have been told the truth, they can recommend to the commission that there be an amnesty or no charges.  That is a very fair proposal.  There can be no prosecutions about what is held within the process.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Breathnach asked about there being little incentive to tell the truth.  From the research I conducted, and focus groups in particular, it was evident that people were very concerned about truth and felt that the former terrorists would have very little incentive to tell the truth.  There are a couple of reasons for that and both boil down to the cosy and secret deals that were done behind the scenes at the time of the Good Friday Agreement.  Those deals include the on-the-run letters and the statement made by Senator Michael McDowell regarding the Garda not pursuing historical crimes committed during the Troubles.  It is very hard for victims to accept that our suffering and the crimes committed on us by terrorists would not be investigated.  If one considers it from our perspective, it means the terrorists have got off scot free and there is no incentive for them to tell the truth if they know they will never be charged, they have the on-the-run letters and, according to Senator McDowell's statement, the Garda will not prosecute them.  Why would they tell the truth if they know they will never have to face up to what they did?<\/p> <p>  The second strand of that relates to taking responsibility for one's actions.  It is clear that the former terrorists will never take responsibility for their actions.  Deputy Adams recently described the death of Tom Oliver situation as a political killing.  Tom Oliver was murdered in a most heinous fashion by the Provisional IRA and the Provisional movement.  That is an undeniable fact.  For that to be dressed up as a political killing is disgraceful and for Deputy Adams to say it would be counter-productive to look for prosecutions is unacceptable.  The victims perceive that the Provisional movement and the terrorists are never going to tell the truth and that they try to wiggle like a worm at the end of a line to avoid telling it.  One can look at what happened when my family and I entered a process with Deputy Adams.  We thought we were doing the right thing by having an informal process to try to get answers.  When we went to meet the IRA, we were told lies to try to get certain people off the hook.  Deputy Adams then went into D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and told untruth after untruth when he made a personal statement.  He did that because if he told the truth it would come back to senior people in his organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017110900002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Austin Stack"},{"type":"speech","time":1510244100,"counter":1728,"content":"<p>I am in a difficult situation.

Victims have never been considered at any stage of the process during the last 20 years.  To all intents, victims have been collateral damage within the dirty sectarian squabble that went on here for 30 years, with the security forces of both Governments caught in the middle, trying to manage it.  That is the reality.  We have been left with tens of thousands of damaged goods, the victims who are struggling to recover from what happened in the past.<\/p> <p>  Recently, for instance, a prominent member of Sinn F&eacute;in did a walkabout in Londonderry with the Taoiseach.  The family of the person who that person is alleged to have murdered were traumatised by that taking place, live on television.  Afterwards, the Chief Constable of the PSNI made a statement at the Northern Ireland affairs committee in Westminster about why that person had not been arrested.  For that evidence, which the family had never been aware of, to emerge in an open forum has retraumatised them.  These types of incidents happen daily across Northern Ireland and in the South where the perpetrators of these crimes walk around freely, brazenly admitting to things they did in the past.  It is the case that victims are collateral damage and that is unfortunate because society looks at these people as damaged goods who get in the way of the two Governments trying to move on with more important things.  A good example of this was a few years ago where victims were at the gates of Hillsborough Castle while the ex-godfathers of crime were being lauded at an event inside.  This is where we are coming from, we are on the outside looking in.  We are classed as being the ones causing problems rather than the process being victim centred.

Then one meets groups such as those before us who simply cannot forget about it or put it behind them, who have to deal with the legacy which has been left.  Many of us have legacy issues.  I managed to hide my service in the British army forces for 35 years until I came to the Seanad.  Shortly before I took my seat it was exposed across the newspapers and I had to revisit it, including the reasons I left.  It is history and I will not revisit it today.<\/p> <p>  One thing which jumps off the page for me is the reference to innocent victims.  I want the witnesses to understand that I am very much on the side of the innocent victims but there are victims on both sides.  It is only very recently that I have come to understand the hurt and pain among the innocent victims and the discrimination and rejection among those who participated in the violence that left the hurt and pain among the people who are represented here, and I look towards Mr. Stack and Mr. Kelly in particular.  I am acutely aware of what their families have suffered and they are to be commended on what they have done.  Their requests are simple, but a truth commission is simple until one asks people to come in and bare their souls on the atrocities which they committed.<\/p> <p>  I want the witnesses to address something about which I have spoken to Mr. Donaldson in the past.  If we managed to get someone to that point where he or she is prepared to admit to having done this, that and the other, how sure can the witnesses be that, on the other side, the innocent victim will accept the evidence that person has given and say that he or she is able to turn the page and move on?  No matter how much we might want to move on, turn the page and be able to say that we know what happened and now we are content, it is not that easy.  I was confronted with this myself two weeks after I was elected to Seanad &Eacute;ireann when I was contacted by the garda who had investigated threats that were made to me and my family.  He suggested that I might like to know who had been involved in it, and that he had the files if I cared to speak to him about it.  I was on my way to do so when I was gripped by fear, and it was real fear.<\/p><p>If I found out who it was and it happened to be a next door neighbour or somebody who lived around the corner from me, how would I cope with it?  How would I handle that?  I remember the pain they put my mother through.  I suddenly thought that I do not want to know but I can understand how the Stack family or Kelly family would want to know.  That is perfectly reasonable.  If I am the perpetrator, and if I walk into a room, close the door, as Mr. Stack has suggested, sit down and have an honest conversation, at the end of the day, having given it exactly as I know it, can I be sure that Mr. Stack will accept me at my word?  Will Mr. Stack say that the perpetrator is holding something back?  There would be a tendency to do that.  We are all only human.<\/p><p> It is absolutely essential to have a national memorial for people who suffered, both those on the uniformed and non-uniformed sides, since we lost people in uniform, including garda&iacute;, prison officers and members of the Defence Forces.  If a person served in Northern Ireland for 13 weeks, he or she would get a general service medal in Northern Ireland and a bar on it each time he or she came back for 13 weeks.  We had people in the Republic of Ireland, particularly soldiers and also garda&iacute;, who spent months on the Border, away from their families, and we have airbrushed it out of history.  We need something to mark that, such as the national service medal.<\/p><p> The war was a dirty war.  It did not just involve Sinn F&eacute;in-IRA, as it is referred to in the North of Ireland, though I would prefer to say IRA.  It did not just involve the UVF.  It also involved security services, including some, as Mr. Stack has said, from the South.  There were some who betrayed their uniform and worked with terrorists.  Some part of a dirty war has to be just left aside.  People just have to put it aside and move on, and that is not easy for any of us.  Mr. Stack said that perhaps 80% of people would be prepared to accept truth and reconciliation.  What do we do with the other 20% who simply cannot move on from it?  That is a danger.<\/p><p> I want to address the other victims, those who committed the atrocities.  Some of these people were sucked into the organisations that they represented at such a young age that they thought they were doing the right thing.  I am not excusing what they did.  A couple of weeks ago, in north Belfast, the issue of the prisoners was brought to my attention.  I would have been quite happy for most of them to have been behind bars.  As far as I was concerned, they were terrorists, but a situation could arise where a former prisoner is released under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement and his or her grandchild might be affected.  For example, a divorce takes place shortly after the person goes into prison.  The divorcee heads off to the UK to start a new life, leaving the former husband behind in prison.  She has a child with her, gets married over there, has another relationship and everything is fine.  In this case the child joined the Metropolitan Police on an accelerated promotion process.  Six months into her job, she was called aside and told that the police did not realise she was the daughter of a prisoner.  She was told to hand in her warrant card and that her job was finished.  There is a victim who had nothing to do with the Troubles.<\/p><p> Similarly, we met the wife of a former loyalist prisoner.  She got her car insurance for &pound;200 sterling.  Three months later, she got a call from the insurance company to say it did not realise she was the wife of a prisoner and that her car insurance was now &pound;800.  That woman was not involved in any way in terrorism at any stage.  She married this man at a later time in his life.  When we start to talk and to unravel the issue of victims, there are innocent victims and there are victims.  There are victims who were terrorists and victims who have been branded by association.  How does the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation unravel that?  Of everyone here, the witnesses from it are probably the most neutral.  How do they deal with that young woman's career being destroyed or another we were told of who was due to join the Royal Navy and was told not even to bother coming?  How do we explain to somebody that his or her life has been destroyed because of something that person knew nothing about?  I am interested in how the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation looks at that, and also in Mr. Donaldson's and Mr. Stack's views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017110900002#H00900","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510244100,"counter":1739,"content":"<p>The Senator should withdraw his remark about Sinn F&eacute;in-IRA.

I welcome all the presentations here today.  It is important that this committee hears about the issues.  Mr. Kenny Donaldson comes from the unionist perspective and it is important for us to hear that but, unfortunately, we have not had unionist politicians attend this committee.  They are invited to attend this committee, as are other MPs.<\/p> <p>  I come from what is called the murder triangle.  Many victims of the situation lived in that area.  The triangle went from Pomeroy to Portadown to Loughgall and there were terrible murders there at the time, right across the board.  We should recognise that.  As Mr. Austin Stack has said, the issue of evidence being destroyed is not unique to the Garda.  There are several cases in the North where forensic evidence has been destroyed, lost or tampered with.  It is important that people get answers about how that happened.  It shows a lack of concern.  Some evidence is lost, destroyed or mislaid and there has always been a question about evidence and how it is come about.  With DNA being reviewed and renewed, it is very important that we deal with what is factual and what is not.<\/p> <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has been leading on truth recovery for many years.  We wanted a truth and reconciliation commission to be set up in a similar way to South Africa and other countries.  Having said that for a number of years, we fell back from that and, with the Stormont House Agreement, saw the opportunities for the truth and reconciliation legacy issues to be dealt with.  I know it has been said that it does not beat all the issues, but the problem is that it has been held up by the people who said they wanted to put it through for so long, namely, the British Government, which does not really want all of the truth but just part of it.  If we are to have a truth and reconciliation commission, it is important for all of the truth to be available, particularly from those who have the archives and information.  We saw it with the Glenanne gang, for example.  Much information was stored and whenever people started to recover it, it all disappeared from the books.  It is very important for all that information to be open to us.<\/p> <p>  Are the victims' groups open to all victims who have suffered in different ways or is it limited to certain sides or groups?  We had the Eames-Bradley plan as an earlier structure.  Much work went into it to try to deliver for the victims.  That was knocked back because of the financial issues it raised.  Much good work and many good considerations went into the Eames-Bradley plan.  The Stormont House Agreement has not yet been implemented.<\/p><p>The resources have not been provided for the inquests.  Many families are waiting 40 years for inquests that are being held up because the British Government is refusing to provide the resources for them.  We need to find ways of addressing this issue in the context of dealing with legacy issues.  <\/p><p> In regard to the Glencree, many years ago I attended a number of discussions on various issues, some of which were heated but always ended in reconciliation.  It was an important mechanism which allowed people to engage in discussion.  It is perhaps a failing of the Good Friday Agreement that this mechanism was not built into it.  The Stormont House Agreement presents an opportunity to deliver on this.  I would welcome members' views on how the Stormont House Agreement can be implemented and on how we can secure the release of the money which the British Government committed to providing to allow this process to continue.  There is still a need a Glencree-type mechanism.  It is important there is a renewed round of negotiations or discussions around the issues that currently exist.  This forum is known as the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  All of these issues are holding back implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  If we are to do our job right, the focus must be on implementation of the agreement.  As stated, in terms of implementation we are operating on a shoestring budget.  Leaving aside how good or bad the mechanism might be, the danger is that if it is lost we will have nothing and thus a vacuum will be created and further problems will arise.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues.  <\/p><p> In regard to the survey referenced by Mr. Stack, I believe it would be useful for members of the committee to have a copy of it and to know the outcome.  As stated by all here today, there are different needs in different communities.  Victims have different needs.  Some victims want more from the process than others.  Some just want the truth and some want justice.  This is the case across all of the communities.  There are victims on all sides.  I knew a young girl named Sheila Campbell who was studying law at Queen's University and was murdered in the company of a Protestant friend in a hotel.  Queen's University never even recognised that she was a student because she was a republican.  She was a victim.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017110900002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Francie Molloy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510244100,"counter":1743,"content":"<p>I am conscious that many of our witnesses have to travel after this meeting and as the weather is not too good I ask members to be brief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017110900002#K00200","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510244100,"counter":1744,"content":"<p>In my case, I find the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman very difficult to deal with.

He was a Catholic.  As a family we were non-political.  My brother worked in Garda stations and police barracks north and south of the Border.

In terms of his case, 16 items have gone missing from a Garda station in Dundalk.  I only became aware of that when the HET was investigating the case.  I became extremely concerned about where these items had gone and so I involved the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.

I believe a documentary will air soon about the collusion between the police and the UVF, which was involved in what happened there.  I visited my aunt's grave last summer.  There is still an air of sadness in that area.

It may not work.  In my case my father was the Irish Army soldier killed in Ballinamore in 1983.  The perpetrators were Maze escapees from Belfast and this year, 34 years later, there is no truth, which is very difficult.  No support was provided for my family afterwards.  It was all downhill.  Three years later we were living homeless on the streets of London.  That is how significant it is.  Talking about women's rights, my mother went through years of domestic abuse.  That is how these things play out.  I like the sound of a truth commission.

In response to Senator Craughwell's question about where we find ourselves if the perpetrator comes in and bares his soul but the family does not accept what has been said, I am a restorative justice practitioner.  I have been doing it for a long time.  Miss Walshe from Glencree and I have been involved in that movement for a long time.  We can never guarantee going into that process that everyone will come out hugging and kissing one another.  There is a long period of preparation with both parties before that meeting would take place.  Both parties would have a good sense of what would play out when it does happen.  For example, I facilitated a very difficult restorative meeting recently between two individuals and it took me approximately two months to prepare it, going back and forth.  We went into the room with the two individuals.  When I went into the room I was still unsure whether the perpetrator was going to make that leap.  I knew that the victim was a very strong individual.  I facilitated that meeting but I kept going back and all of a sudden the penny dropped and the perpetrator understood because of a remark the victim made that personalised it a little bit.  If there is a good facilitator little things can happen in these meetings that can turn them around.  One can never be sure that will happen.  I propose that we at least try because if we do not try we will never have healing.  This is for all of us here in the room, the politicians, the policymakers, the victims and their advocates to at least try.<\/p> <p>  There was a question about the 28% who cannot move on or do not want to get involved in this process.  We need to try to put supports in place for those people such that at some stage down the line they may come around because we are all at different stages on the journey.  I can forgive the people who did what they did to my father.  I have no problem saying that.  I will shake their hands and talk to them.  I have forgiveness.  I can do that.  Some people cannot and never will.  It is a journey.<\/p> <p>  In respect of what Francie Molloy said about our group, we take everybody who we would describe as an innocent from both sides of the political perspective.  We are open to people from the Unionist side and the Nationalist side.  We will not deal with anyone who was a perpetrator of terrorism.  That is our membership.  Generally it is people from the South who have come to us.<\/p> <p>  In response to what Deputy Sherlock said about legislation on how amnesties would work, I would propose that, once the process is finished and the family proposes that the individual be given an amnesty because the individual has dealt with them in an honest, open and truthful fashion, when the chair of the commission makes a report, the legislation could then be formed in some way that closes the matter.  The committee members are the legislators and they know best the angles involved in that process.  As a simple layman that is what I would propose.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Breathnach's question about services North and South the difference is stark.  We get absolutely no help, aid, support, good, bad or indifferent on this end.  We get zero.  I went to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and spoke to a high-level delegation on this matter and they told me that when the Good Friday Agreement was being negotiated they specifically left out this element for victims in the South because they said we could go to the Health Service Executive, HSE, for support.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will not fund groups down South.  It diverts funds to the groups in the North.  The only funding of any description that we get is a very small grant each year from the Victims &amp;amp; Survivors Service in the North.  Only recently did people such as the garda&iacute; who were badly injured in the Garryhinch bombing benefit from the scheme whereby injured personnel could get something from the Victims &amp;amp; Survivors Service in the North.  Groups down here have been told they need to go to the HSE.  That is completely impractical because the HSE is not set up to deal with victims of terrorism.  They do not know what is involved.  I have seen how groups like South East Fermanagh Foundation, SEFF in the North work.  When the group gets together members support and help one another.  They are able to identify the services and the needs of their people and bring them to the agencies required.  There are between 80 and 90 victims down here, dispersed all over the country and we are told to go to the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017110900002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Austin Stack"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510244100,"counter":1754,"content":"<p>There was a comment about Unionist representatives not coming down.

They are right across the board.<\/p> <p>  We have been exercised for five years on the point that Mr. Stack raised.  In our last presentation to this committee two years ago we were fighting for the rights of Republic of Ireland-based victims along with those based in Great Britain.  Within the Stormont House Agreement there is supposed to be a collaborative approach taken by Belfast, Westminster and Dublin except when it comes to the jingoes, the resources, because this side of the Border is not very good at that.  There is lip service paid to the issues.  There is a need to conduct a deep study and mapping exercise of where victims and survivors are located in the Republic of Ireland as there is to do likewise in Great Britain.<\/p><p>We talk about deaths when we bring it down to those cold, hard percentages.  One in six lives lost in the Troubles was of a person associated with Great Britain who was either murdered there or had family members murdered here and who was from Great Britain.  Likewise, in the Republic upwards of 90 innocent people lost their lives as a result of the Troubles.  That is not insignificant.  There is work that needs to be done.  <\/p><p> The point concerning what constitutes a victim needs to be addressed.  People should take a whistlestop tour back to where this emanated from.  No one on this side of the table had a view as to what the definition of victim should be.  In 2006 it was ushered through in emergency legislation.  That was another side deal agreed at the time which caused damage and harm to people when it was rolled out.  A widow once put it to me in these terms: \"It is bad enough that my husband was taken.  In 1998 I voted for the Belfast Agreement because I wanted a better future for my grandchildren, but eight years later, for those individuals who were released from prison that day to in effect be equated in law alongside my husband was the ultimate betrayal.\"  That issue needs to be considered.  <\/p><p> Our organisation has always been very clear that terrible deeds were committed by loyalist terrorists, and there were actions committed by the State which were unforgivable.  The Republic of Ireland is no neutral arbitrator in proceedings either.  As a representative of a victims group, I have no difficulty in saying that where there was criminal violence committed, whether by the proscribed organisations or indeed by either State, it was illegitimate and wrong.  If that was said right across the board we would have the building block to deal with these issues properly.  We do not have it because people are still in denial and are trying to justify the indefensible.  We need to condemn violence as wrong across the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017110900002#L01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kenny Donaldson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510244100,"counter":1760,"content":"<p>I am keen to know what truth recovery will look like.

When we enter the truth recovery process we have governments armed with many documents, itemising what each individual did at each time and place on each day, and we have terrorist organisations and individuals who will say everything or nothing and minimise and maximise as suits.  I still do not understand how truth recovery can work.  Mr. Stack says that we should test it out, but there is no appetite in the North for it, certainly amongst the victims' community.<\/p> <p>  To add to what Ms McAnerney said on how we can move forward with the Good Friday agreement, we have the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, PONI, which is totally independent and has wide-ranging powers for access to whatever it needs.  In the South the ombudsman has to go cap-in-hand to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ask for permission to access documents.  The Garda can say no or provide everything requested.  Ms McAnerney's case is riddled with collusion.  The investigation into it has been totally improper because the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC does not have the power to investigate retired police officers.  It can make a report with suggestions, which goes back to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which then investigates its own people.  In Ms McAnerney's case bogus garda&iacute; signed for forensic evidence which was never investigated properly.  Multiple pieces of forensic evidence went missing, including a vehicle, an anorak with blood, a balaclava and cigarette butts.  It goes on and on.  Retired garda&iacute; failed to comply or assist with the investigation.  There is a case from County Donegal in which there is clear evidence of collusion with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; a suspect list was handed over to the IRA which resulted in a murder and an attempted murder.  These are two of many cases we are dealing with.  We need to see honesty from both sides of the Border, not just one side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017110900002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Funston"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510244100,"counter":1761,"content":"<p>The legacy of the past is really about our future together on this island and how we can learn to live well together as good neighbours, having a decent relationship in which we get to know each other.

To answer Senator Black's question, inter-generational trauma is no surprise.  Parents and grandparents have been traumatised and hurt, and children have seen more than any children should see.

If reconciliation happens as a result of it then that is fair enough, but sometimes it is about the process.

The agreement, in its three-stranded approach, was designed and envisaged to repair the broken relationships which gave rise to the conflict across the island - the conflict within Northern Ireland, the conflict between North and South - and the conflict between the two islands was to be repaired in the context of that agreement so that we could work together.<\/p><p>We do not have anything else and, ultimately, we have to continue to deepen the reconciliation and to work towards repairing those relationships.

The CCMA welcomes this opportunity to present to it on the topic of local government funding, in partnership with our colleagues in the Association of Irish Local Government and the National Oversight and Audit Commission.  I am Eamonn O'Sullivan, chief executive of Monaghan County Council and I am accompanied by Mr. Garry Martin, director of finance, information systems and emergency services with Donegal County Council.  I am currently the chair of the CCMA finance committee and Mr. Martin is the chair of the heads of finance association of the CCMA.<\/p> <p>  Our presentation focuses on three points.  The first is the evolving role of local government following a period of significant reform.  The second is the local government budgetary process and primary funding lines.  The third relates to the current financial standing of the local government sector.<\/p> <p>  Since 2010, the local government sector has undergone a period of significant reform.  In 2010, the local government efficiency review group recommended 106 actions designed to deliver savings of &euro;511 million in the sector.  Those were achieved through a combination of staffing reductions, procurement, shared services and operational efficiencies.  By the end of 2015, a total of &euro;586.6 million in savings were achieved by the sector by implementing the majority of those recommendations.<\/p> <p>  In 2012, the Government published, Putting People First &ndash; Action Plan for Effective Local Government, the policy of reform for local government.  It was the largest such policy in more than 100 years of local government in this country and envisaged a strengthened role for local government in economic and community development and the devolution of further functions to the sector.  In 2014, the Local Government Reform Act was passed.  This gave legislative effect to the reform programme.  Municipal districts were established and an associated reformed budgetary process was introduced.  Since 2014, the reforms have been embedded in the sector.  Municipal districts and associated roles have developed.  Local community and development committees were established which underpinned the broader economic and community role local authorities play.  The local government sector has continued the drive for efficiencies with the establishment of shared services to deliver back office functions such as payroll, procurement, road management, environmental and waste management and housing assistance payment, HAP.<\/p> <p>  The Local Government Act 2001, as amended by the Local Government Reform Act 2014, provides the legislative basis for the local authority budgetary processes.  There are two principal budgets: the revenue budget, dealing with day-to-day and operational expenditure; and a multi-annual, rolling capital budget.  I will not go through the revenue budget in detail but it is outlined briefly in the presentation.  There are four stages to it which I have set out for the committee.<\/p> <p>  The primary constituent income lines for the local government sector is respect of the revenue budget are: local property tax, which comes under the local government fund; commercial rates; Irish Water, through the service level agreement; direct Government grants; and income from a variety of charges and fees, such as those relating to housing, planning, car parking and so on.  The proportion of each of the above will vary from authority to authority depending on scale and whether it is rural or urban in nature.  The proportion of income generated as a sector in respect of the headings is profiled in the appendix and shows the trend in the income lines over the period 2008 to 2015.  I will not go into that in detail.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the capital budget, the chief executive also prepares and submits to the elected members a report indicating the programme of capital projects proposed by the local authority on a rolling three-year basis.  The capital programme includes expenditure on the acquisition of fixed assets and the construction of infrastructure in areas such as roads and transportation, housing, marine, cultural services, economic and tourism infrastructure, environmental services and fire and emergency services projects.<\/p> <p>  The capital budget is primarily funded through a combination of direct grants, most often from central government but also from external funders such as directly from EU funding programmes, internal council capacity through development charges or contributions, and, subject to affordability, through loan finance, raised by councils and subsequently financed over the duration of the loan.  Unlike central government and the majority of other State-sponsored bodies, the local government sector operates on an accrual accounting basis, meaning that any operational loss or gain is carried forward on the accounts of each council at the end of each year and with the effect that a number of councils, due to a variety of reasons, found themselves carrying deficits on their accounts.  Those are managed on an individual basis by each council, with the oversight of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the local government audit service.<\/p> <p>  As outlined in the appendix, local authorities have made significant progress in reducing their revenue deficits between 2012 and 2016 reflecting a positive and proactive management of the challenges faced and responded to.<\/p><p> In recent years, local government finance contracted significantly.  Sources of revenue income reduced from &euro;4.84 billion in 2008 to a low of &euro;4.04 billion in 2016, a reduction of &euro;800 million in nine years.  The contraction in capital budgets was starker.  Between 2008 and 2015, capital budgets decreased from &euro;5.58 billion in 2008 to &euro;1.15 billion in 2014, with a slight increase to &euro;1.31 billion in 2015.  Between 2008 and 2015, capital income reduced by almost &euro;4.27 billion.  The trend in the sources of both current and capital income is set out in the appendices.<\/p><p> The local government sector is the key enabler for development in its area across many guises in addition to its core statutory functions related to housing, roads and transportation, planning and development, and fire and emergency services.  These include infrastructure, actions enabling economic development, tourism, recreation and the quality of life in our respective local authority areas.<\/p><p> An appropriate financing model is critical to the sector in terms of enabling it to maximise its capacity in maintaining and developing each respective city and county area for the future in a manner that meets the needs of all of our citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510218000,"counter":1775,"content":"<p>We hope we can be of assistance to the committee in its deliberations a funding model for local government finance.  My name is Damien Geoghegan.  I am a member of Waterford City and County Council and I am president of the Association of Irish Local Government.  I am accompanied by Councillor Danny Owens, executive member of the AILG and a member of Offaly County Council, and by our director Mr. Tom Moylan.  We are also accompanied by members of our executive committee who are in the public gallery, Councillors Brian Lawlor, Thomas Healy, Guss O'Connell, Pat Daly and Luie McEntire.<\/p> <p>  The AILG is the statutory representative body representing the democratically elected members and their member authority of Irish local government.  Our submission today gives an overview of current receipts and their funding model as opposed to capital receipts.  Current receipts fund the day-to-day activities of our members' authorities providing the essential local services to the communities that we represent.  However, as an association representing the full body of local elected members across the country of every political party and none, we can only comment on the funding streams available to local authorities in their current format and we cannot give any ideological or political opinions on the merits of any funding source available to local authorities as determined by national Government.<\/p> <p>  I will now summarise the points in our detailed submission to the committee regarding the funding model for local authorities.  The Local Government Reform Act 2014 brought new local government arrangements into effect from 1 June 2014 with all 80 existing town councils abolished and replaced by a comprehensive system of municipal districts, integrating town and county governance.  Therefore, the number of local authorities decreased from 114 to 31 city and county councils.<\/p> <p>  The funding streams for local authorities come from a variety of different sources, including central Government from a number of different Departments, the local government fund, goods and services, commercial rates and local property tax, LPT.  The Local Government Act 2001, as amended by the Local Government Reform Act 2014, provides the legislative basis for the budget process which details these funding streams on an annual basis.  EU requirements dictate that the main parameters of the national budget are to be published by 15 October each year and that local government aspects and budgets must be formally adopted by 31 December.<\/p> <p>  The local government-funding model changed considerably in 2014, with the introduction of Irish Water and the LPT.  Total local authority budgeted current income for 2016 was &euro;4.011 billion which was a 3.35% increase on 2015.  However, this was still a 3.3% reduction on current income of &euro;4.149 billion for 2014, the last year of general-purpose grants from the local government fund before the introduction of the LPT.  For 2016 the highest percentage income for local authorities was received from commercial rates at 37% followed by income from goods and services at 30%.  Direct central government grants and subsidies amounted to 24% with LPT accounting for 8% of current income for local authorities.  More than 75% of all local authority income is generated locally from commercial rates, income from goods and services and the LPT, thereby helping to fulfil the vision set out in Putting People First for local government to be the primary means of public service at local level.<\/p> <p>  We will now briefly go through and comment on the various income streams available to local authorities.  Local authorities are obliged by law to levy rates on commercial property.  Commercial rates accounted for 37% of overall local authority income for 2016 with rates accounting for individual income in local authorities ranging from 16% to 52%.  Budgeted income from rates in 2016 amounted to &euro;1.47 billion, down from &euro;1.49 billion in 2015.<\/p> <p>  While revenue from commercial rates is an important income for local authorities, one area of concern is the increased number of rates arrears and the lower rates-collection rate being experienced across all local authorities.  This is a significant issue particularly over the last eight to ten years as local businesses navigate and try to survive the economic recession, and as local authorities address the issue of higher vacancy levels.  A study by NOAC, published in April 2016 on local authority rates collection for the period 2013-2014, found that rates-collection rates had fallen to as low as 72% for some local authorities with other authorities recording rates arrears as high as 51% to 56%.<\/p> <p>  While it should be noted that collection performance has improved as local authorities work with their ratepayers to address the issue of rates collection and arrears, the AILG believes that this is one of the biggest challenges facing local authorities.  We need to establish how we can protect a significant source of income for our member authorities while at the same time help existing businesses and encourage and attract new local business into our cities, towns and villages to ensure their survival.  To this end, the AILG welcomes the announcement by previous Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, on new rates legislation that will provide for the introduction of a number of measures, the most important of which is a provision to allow local authorities to introduce rates alleviation schemes including a six-month exemption from rates where a property has become vacant to allow a property owner to seek new tenants.  These measures will help to improve the financial position of local authorities while allowing the elected members to introduce mechanisms to support specific local economic policy objectives depending on the priorities of their local authority.<\/p> <p>  LPT was introduced in 2015 by national Government and, since then, it has replaced the general-purpose grant previously payable to local authorities.  Some 80% of LPT is retained locally to fund vital public services with the remaining 20% redistributed to provide top-up funding to certain local authorities to ensure that no local authority is worse off compared with general purpose grant allocations in 2014.  As already outlined, the current element of income from LPT for 2016 was &euro;312 million, accounting for 8% of income for local authorities.  Nineteen local authorities were net recipients from the equalisation fund receiving over &euro;108 million.  The balance of 12 local authorities were net contributors to the equalisation fund.  Eleven local authorities reduced their level of LPT by varying their LPT rate at a cost of &euro;36 million.  Of these 11 local authorities, three were net recipients from the equalisation fund.<\/p> <p>  The association has identified a number of anomalies in the workings of the LPT that should be addressed as a matter of urgency.  Our members are required to make their decision on any possible variation in the LPT by the 30 September of each year, but the budget process for our members is not finalised by the 31 December of each year.  This had been identified as a significant problem on the basis that they are been asked to make serious decisions on LPT rates without the benefit of having a full budget available to them so they can make informed decisions as to any potential implications a varying of the LPT may have on their finances.  There is also an issue with using 2014 as the ongoing baseline to determine the current element of LPT payable to our member authorities.  This baseline needs to be increased dramatically in order to ensure that local authorities have sufficient general funding available to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien Geoghegan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510218000,"counter":1776,"content":"<p>Local authorities also receive a substantial part of their annual funding from a range of Departments and Government agencies which in 2016 amounted to &euro;979 million or 24% of current income for local authorities.  These central funds come from the local government fund and, as has already been outlined, the general-purpose grants previously payable out of the fund have been replaced by LPT allocations.<\/p> <p>  Most of the funding sourced from central government and provided to local authorities must be used for specified local authority services.  For 2016, approximately 70% of the total provision from central government to local authorities was accounted for by two categories, namely, housing and urban regeneration programmes at 41% and transport at 29%.<\/p><p>While there has been an increase of 4% on central funds to local authorities in 2016, it should be noted that more than &euro;141 million of this came from the capital element of the local property tax, LPT, which was additional funding to the current element of the LPT of &euro;312 million given to local authorities in 2016.  The overall 2016 LPT allocation to local authorities is &euro;453.3 million.  The association would contend that the LPT should not form part of the local government fund and, for better transparency reasons, should be a fund used for financing local services provided by local authorities as this was the original basis for its introduction in 2014.<\/p><p> Our final observation today is in relation to income from local goods and services delivered by local authorities.  Income from these services amounted to &euro;1.186 billion in 2016, or 30% of income for local authorities.  Most of this income from goods and services is generated at local level and the association would advocate the need for a much higher level of control over financial resources, particularly at municipal district level to reverse the current situation of our members having minimal financial influence at municipal district level during the local authority budget process.<\/p><p> The Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, is currently engaging with the Department of Planning, Housing and Local Government in relation to the strengthening of municipal governance of the new local government structures and the AILG is committed that more control over the budgetary process at municipal district level will form part of this review to ensure greater transparency and accountability of income from local goods and services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Danny Owens","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510218000,"counter":1778,"content":"<p>In conclusion, we acknowledge the work of this important committee and pledge that we in the AILG will play our part on behalf of all elected members to work alongside the committee and we look forward to continuing to contribute the committee's work.

It has published update reports on the implementation of the recommendations of the 2011 local government efficiency review and shared services projects, a review of the adequacy of the local authority 2015&ndash;19 corporate plans, reports on rates collection and the financial performance of local authorities 2013-15, studies of local authority performance of their statutory functions in relation to the private rented sector and of the management and maintenance of their housing stock, and a survey of local authority tenants&rsquo; experience and satisfaction.<\/p> <p>  NOAC operates mainly by sub-groups, including a financial performance sub-group, set up to oversee different aspects of its work, each consisting of three or four members from NOAC&rsquo;s total current membership of ten people.  NOAC does not have a separate executive and its secretariat is provided by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We currently have two staff.<\/p> <p>  NOAC's 2017 work plan includes a best practice showcase event later this month in collaboration with the County and City and Management Association, CCMA, and a customer service project consisting of a desktop exercise involving all local authorities.  The NOAC work plan also involves a workshop, happening today, with relevant customer service personnel from a selection of authorities.  NOAC has commenced compiling profiles of each local authority based primarily on the material in its own reports to date and meetings with the chief executives, but also to include information provided by the authorities themselves outlining the particular context within which they each operate.<\/p> <p>  As indicated above, NOAC&rsquo;s role in relation to local government policy is to oversee how the national policy is implemented by local government bodies.  NOAC does not have a function of providing input to the development of policy for the sector.  When it comes to financial performance, NOAC&rsquo;s role is to scrutinise performance of any local government body in respect of the financial resources available to it, and that scrutiny includes in relation to value for money.<\/p> <p>  NOAC carried out a review of local authority rates collection performance because this is a significant revenue source for the sector.  It reviews the reports by the Local Government Audit Service, LGAS, of their annual audits of the local authority financial statements and follows up on selected aspects raised in those reports.  It reviews also value for money reports produced by the value for money unit of the LGAS.  Regular meetings are held between us and the director of the audit service and NOAC has a good working relationship with the director and her team.<\/p> <p>  NOAC does not have any expertise on the components of the local government funding model and how it operates in practice.  It performs its functions within the funding model that exists and has, to date, looked only at a few aspects of local authority financial performance.  NOAC&rsquo;s focus is on how efficiently local authorities utilise their funding, rather than on how they are funded in the first place.  I hope the committee will appreciate that this is the context in which I will be pleased to participate in today&rsquo;s discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat McLoughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":1781,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McLoughlin.

Coming from a local authority background, only one and a half years ago, I feel the pain of the local authority members.  Back in 2014 we envisaged that local democracy was returning through Putting People First but, as it turned out, it did not restore any local democracy around funding.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the 20% equalisation fund, nobody has mentioned what their views are on that or the justification for it.  Do the witnesses believe that is the correct way to move forward on the LPT?  Just before I left the membership of my local authority, people were looking for the LPT to be kept in each municipal district.  This would have disadvantaged the weaker areas.  The fundamental issue is the baseline figure we are all faced with.  Are the witnesses from the CCMA and the AILG happy with the methodology used and the transparency around the calculation of the baseline?  Is it open and transparent to everybody so a comparison can be made county by county?  I have looked for this information and I have not got it.<\/p> <p>  Another critical matter that needs to be addressed is the adoption of the LPT and the budget.  From a political point of view, this is an utter disaster.  We are asked to make the tough decisions on the LPT in December while the budget does not come until six weeks later.  The people who do not want to make the tough decisions can hide behind the LPT, and when it comes to the budget they claim the credit for the tough decision that was made.  Moving forward, that has to be addressed.  In today's environment, where figures are available almost immediately, I do not see why there is any need to differentiate the time difference between the two.  I believe these figures could be merged together.  Each local authority knows its revenue in September.  They have it at the push of a button and they also know their costs at that time.  I see one of the priorities as the harmonisation or merging of the LPT decision and the budget decision into one process.<\/p> <p>  Using that baseline, the other aspect of the LPT is that the Government is now controlling the extra, over and above, that some local authorities have available to them.  This goes against the whole purpose of Putting People First.  Local democracy has been removed, in theory, from 40% of the budget process in some counties.  They have no say at all in this.  This is an area we need to consider.<\/p> <p>  Turning to rates and commercial rates, as a ratepayer I could never understand the value for money I was getting.  One of the reasons behind it was that the rates were the only available option left to the local authority members to balance the books at the end of the year.  It did not matter what services the commercial rates sector was getting - A minus B equals C and we had to do the multiplier on that.  When adopting the LPT, the local authority members are still left with that decision at budget time instead of bringing the two aspects together.<\/p><p> I want to discuss commercial rates and rental on housing in Wicklow.  There is a difference between how both are presented to members.  The write-offs for commercial rates are presented to members.  In other words, one has the total rate bill, the write-off and a net income.  The rental generated by housing was net of the write-off in Wicklow and, therefore, the process was presented differently.  I always consider collection rates.  I was surprised how high the collection rates were on social housing but that was because the write-off was never shown.  Perhaps that is not the same in each county but that is how it was done in Wicklow.  <\/p><p> The municipal district fund was the greatest cop-out ever because there was nothing left for municipal districts.  I do not know how we will manage the matter going forward.  If we are going to continue with municipal districts then we need to give them the powers to adopt their own budget of significance. <\/p><p> Turning to the effect the loss of water services has had on local authorities, some still have service level agreements in place but they will be watered down over a period.  I still believe one is left with the pension liability for all of the staff.  <\/p><p> In terms of outstanding balances for commercial water, are the organisations happy with the figures that have been derived from Irish Water?  What is happening with the development levies that would have been collected by local authorities through water services but now go to Irish Water?  Have the organisations any input into deciding where that will go into the future?  <\/p><p> It is frustrating to see that only 39% of motor tax is spent at local authority level and the rest probably goes to Irish Water.  However, that is an argument for another day. <\/p><p> I appreciate the exceptionally good work that has been done by the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, and thank it for all its reports.  In fairness, NOAC has no teeth and no role in providing solutions, directing policy or anything.  I mean no disrespect but it is a cop-out to have NOAC.  If NOAC had teeth it would perform a different function.  NOAC provides excellent report on rates collection but it does not take aim.  What would NOAC do to change its situation?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#G00600","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510218000,"counter":1784,"content":"<p>Deputy Casey has covered a lot of material and I will do my best to answer.  He started with a question about 20% equalisation in terms of the local property tax.  He must understand a baseline existed and that the transition from the local government fund to LPT funding in 2014 took that into account.  Depending on what side of the line one is on in terms of the distribution of the 20%, a number of counties have benefitted from the equalisation process, including my own county of Monaghan.  The baseline is still very important for rural counties but it is also a constraint.  One cannot go from a position of having a source of funding in 2014 to removing it suddenly, which is why we have the equalisation process.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the disconnect between the adoption of the LPT, which must take place before 30 September, and the statutory budget process.  The disconnect is recognised by the AILG and its members and, indeed, by the CMMA.  The matter is under discussion as part of the reform and ongoing adjustment of the budgetary process.  It is something that we have mentioned to our departmental colleagues.  We have sought the alignment of the budgetary process with its municipal district element to ensure that we have a more complete, well-defined and structured process. <\/p> <p>  In terms of challenges, we are only in year 3 and heading into year 4 of the new system that was introduced by the reform Act.  There is no doubt, depending on what part of the country one is in and, possibly, which political hue of those involved, opinions will vary on how the system currently works.  It has bedded in well.  Municipal districts are performing well and certainly those that I have dealt with.  Before I took up my current position in Monaghan I worked in the larger country of Kildare.  Therefore, I have experience of both a larger urban county and a smaller rural county.  Municipal districts are still settling in and bedding down.  They are not perfect but they are working.  Our challenge is to improve the situation, to keep improving and to ensure it can be seen at a local level that the municipal districts perform a valuable function.  It is a challenge for all politicians, whether one is elected or non-elected, to do so. <\/p> <p>  Irish Water was a very significant transition programme.  There are service level agreements and they work.  There is a  regulator to oversee that work.  To some extent, the regulator plays a role in tackling the challenge of managing the system and ensuring it works.<\/p> <p>  The sector in the CCMA is committed to making the service level agreements work and continuing the very good working relationship that has been established.  The CCMA recognises that a lot of change was involved and there was good co-operation by the staff side of local government in terms of making the changes happen.  Three years on a lot of work has been done but there is lot more infrastructure needed.  Irish Water has given ample evidence of same.  <\/p> <p>  In general, the local government sector now plays a more central role in economic development and enterprise.  Our challenge is to balance that to provide a pro-business and pro-enterprise culture in the sector, which is important.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to the adoption of the budget and its impact on commercial rates there are pressures from small business, particularly in terms of vacancies.  Effectively, the nation has had a fragile recovery.  As we all understand, different sectors of business have experienced growth quicker than some and different parts of the country have experienced different levels of growth.  The signs of growth and recovery are less obvious the further one travels from Dublin, which is a challenge for all local authorities.  <\/p> <p>  Our colleagues in NOAC play an important oversight role in the sector.  NOAC has consistently reported and its report on the 2016 performance indicators will be published shortly.  Such reporting is important for householders and the commercial sector because we can demonstrate where the funding is being allocated and what work has been done at local level.  NOAC helps us to do that because it is removed from the sector so can provide an impartial report.  We, as a sector, look forward to continuing a strong working relationship with Mr. Geoghegan and his colleagues in the AILG and Mr. McLoughlin and his colleagues in NOAC, and will continue to help the service to improve.  <\/p> <p>  I hope I have addressed most of the questions posed by Deputy Casey. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":1785,"content":"<p>I asked about the methodology and transparency in the calculation of the baseline.

No business would operate in such a manner but we are expected to do so.  It is the view of the association that local property tax raised in a particular area would be retained in that area.  There is obviously a cost to that.  Where is the incentive for a larger urban local authority to maintain its local property tax, or even increase it, considering that a large chunk of it is automatically taken away for central government funds?  There is no incentive either to maintain the rate at the baseline figure or increase it every year.  Local authorities should be allowed to retain their local property tax revenue in the area in which it is raised.  That would certainly require the elimination of the equalisation deduction from the authorities where it would apply, and there would be a cost of approximately &euro;100 million in this regard because one would have to ensure those benefiting from the equalisation fund would continue to do so.<\/p> <p>  The notion of returning one's local property tax to the baseline figure every year is unacceptable.  One is making a request of local authority members every year, if they are brave enough and if they have decided to increase the local property tax by any figure or percentage, and the following year they are asked to do the same again.  The increase does not remain in place.  It allows those of a particular persuasion to go in every year and make the proposition that the value can be reduced by 15% when, in fact, that is not the case.  If a local authority member increases the local property tax, for whatever reason, that increase should stay in place; it is as simple as that.  That is exactly how one would operate with rates, for example.  If one increases the rates one year, the increase stays in place.<\/p> <p>  With regard to rates, we acknowledge collection has improved but there is certainly room for further improvement.  Owing to a delay in the rates valuation office making a rates valuation, one business could have rates imposed on it while the business next door might not.  We acknowledge that the former Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, made allowances in this regard.  He has allowed local authorities to impose temporary rates on a business until the rates valuation office sets the rate for it.  We certainly welcome that.<\/p> <p>  Finance at municipal level is a major bugbear of all local authority members right now.  It is probably the one weakness in the system.  It is a very obvious weakness.  It has led to a number of calls on proposals to reintroduce town councils, precisely because, at budget time at municipal level, a major change took place.  In the past, a town council was presented with a major budget document at budget time but it is now presented with a one-page document.  The latter is not very clear with regard to expenditure and income.  There needs to be a major analysis of how municipal districts are financed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien Geoghegan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510218000,"counter":1790,"content":"<p>With regard to working from the 2014  baseline, it should be noted that the local property tax represents the only general-purpose funding that local authorities have.  The staff embargo for local authorities was lifted in 2015, yet we are still using 2014 for a baseline figure for general-purpose funding.  Therefore, if local authorities want to try to recruit vital staff they lost over the last eight or ten years, they do not have the general-purpose funding to do so because they are working from a 2014 figure.  This needs to be examined straight away.<\/p> <p>  Let me highlight the Deputy's other point on commercial rates and the budget book showing the full income from rates.  Arrears must be provided for.  I accept the Deputy's point from an accounting point of view.  One benefit, however, is that it shows, in monetary terms, the effect of high vacancy levels and the effect of arrears.  A monetary figure in the budget book hits home with our members and demonstrates that we have an issue either with high vacancy rates or arrears, and that needs to be addressed.  I accept the point.  In one way, it can be confusing but it highlights problems and an issue in another way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Moylan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510218000,"counter":1791,"content":"<p>It is fair to state we do not have teeth.  Giving us more teeth would probably be problematic given the independence of the local government sector.  I would argue, however, that the local government efficiency review group, of which I was chair, did not have teeth.  Neither did the implementation group, yet the sector has made &euro;587 million in savings since 2010.  It has done so by leveraging the scale of local government at sectoral level, developing shared services, wherever appropriate, and comparing and contrasting performance across the individual local authorities.  We are certainly finding in our work that our reports are increasingly beginning to become embedded in the local authorities.  The audit committees are reviewing it and discussing it with members, and members are challenging management on why their local authority compares poorly with others.  It is not all about saying that the performance is below par.  We see much potential in local authorities working together and sharing good practice.  That is why we are working with the CCMA.  We have an event where we are showcasing good practice in individual local authorities and challenging the sector to ask why it cannot be carried out in other local authorities.  It is about our being able to highlight where we believe performance could be improved.<\/p> <p>  How the local authorities might use any savings accruing from improvements is a matter for them, both individually and at sectoral level.  Given that there are only two staff and that we rely on CCMA and many of the local government and audit service staff to do our work, I believe the performance of the local government sector in terms of efficiency is much higher than that of any other sector of the economy.  I might not agree with that when I am talking to the CCMA but the reality is that if one looks objectively at what the sector has saved since the efficiency review, one notes that of a little over 100 recommendations from the review group, 69 have been implemented or partially implemented.  This is a high rate of performance.  I argue that there were no teeth in that; it had to be done through co-operation and people working together at sectoral level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat McLoughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":1792,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the time so I will try to be as specific as I can.  I thank the witnesses for attending.  This committee is about local government.  Our terms of reference today are to examine the funding model.  That is what we are about.  It is why this committee decided to invite the various groups and witnesses.  I thank Mr. O'Sullivan.  It is interesting to focus on CCMA.  I constantly visit its website.  There is not a lot of information on it.  I do not know who feeds into it.  The witnesses might take that point back.  Trying to understand what the CCMA is represents a difficulty for Oireachtas members.  It is certainly difficult for county councillors.<\/p> <p>  I want to draw on a few points that were made.  I echo what Mr. McLoughlin said because I do not necessarily agree with them.  I am fed up hearing the word \"savings\".  Savings have cost local government.  They have cost communities and people in terms of service provision.  It is not a matter of the bottom line in respect of savings.  The opening statement referred to &euro;586.6 million in savings were achieved but they were achieved with a lot of pain and hurt.  The reality is that many communities were left disadvantaged.  I am not going to give a lecture here today about the performance of local authorities in housing, value for money and waste within the services because we know the position.  I was a councillor for many years in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and I have a particular interest in governance and accountability.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McLoughlin might talk to us about the staff embargo.  What is the current position on the embargo in terms of costs?<\/p><p> On the question of the acquisition of property, it always amazes me that in any local authority the elected members do not consent to the acquisition of real estate that the local authority management purchases on behalf of the county or the community.  In section 93 cases, the local authorities have a disposal system that is put to the elected members, but the county manager does not seek and the legislation does not provide for the seeking of the approval of county councillors for the acquisition of property.  A number of councillors have spoken to me where their county managers - chief executives, as they are now - have spent millions of euro of public funds on real estate without any cross-reference or checking with the local authority.  When they come to fund that acquisition they must come back to the local authority, but that is after the event.  It raises serious questions of accountability and governance and finance that any of the 31 local authorities can go out and incur vast public expenditure with any consent in advance.  I can understand the arguments about the sensitivity of commercial transaction, being in the market and doing one's business privately, but I have concerns and I want to flag them to the association.  The association might come back to me on that.<\/p><p> The association's representatives might also talk about the local property tax, in terms of funding.  I want to say, in respect of the covers all three presentations here, that I am fundamentally against the local property tax.  It is an unjust and unfair tax.  It has no regard of people's capacity to pay.  As I have said here from the outset, I am in favour of a local tax or council tax - call it what it is - where people get services and they pay for them.  We want less ambiguity about local government finance.  I accept that someone has to pay for the delivery of local services but we should make it clear.  We should simplify the model.  We should let people know what they are paying for and what they can legitimately expect for what they pay.  I am a supporter of a local council tax.  We should learn from the experiences of Britain and elsewhere, but should not get hung up on the view one cannot introduce something called a council tax.  Let people know they are paying for local services, but to attach funding to the size of people's property or the valuation on people's properties is grossly unfair.  As I stated in the Seanad last week, this is one of the most important issues that will face the electorate.  I am determined to address it.  Voters are sitting in the long grass, as am I.  This is not the proper, fair and responsible way to fund local government.  At some other point, we need to look at the whole model.<\/p><p> Turning to the AILG, I particularly welcome the association and Councillor Damien Geogheghan.  I congratulate Councillor Geogheghan on his election as president.  I am always keen to do business with the AILG.  I myself was a member.  It is a wonderful organisation.  It is representative of the voices of councillors.<\/p><p> I note what Councillor Geogheghan said about the local property tax but I will not dwell on it.  He pointed out a number of anomalies and we need to look at them.  He addressed \"Putting People First\", which I have here.  A lot in this document was never delivered on.  It is timely that this whole matter was looked at again.  We need a strong debate.  From talking to the AILG's members throughout the country on a regular basis, local property tax and the funding of local government is important, as is the funding and support of the members who do the work.  The AILG is always keen to address these issues.  I welcome it and all its executive here and say that its role is very important.<\/p><p> The witnesses might share some of the AILG's views on a council tax because politics requires leadership.  Politics requires us, both city and county councillors and Senators and Deputies to lead from the front.  I would like to hear a more proactive response from the AILG on that.<\/p><p> Turning to Mr. Pat McLoughlin and the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, the Chairman correctly stated NOAC has no teeth.  NOAC does great work but many councillors know nothing about it.  That is the reality of it.  Oversight is all very well but when will NOAC not only have teeth but, more importantly, be able to impose sanctions?  I would like to see a greater synergy between the Local Government Audit Service, who we will have in here later, and NOAC.  I would like Mr. McLoughlin's feedback on this.  Time and time again, I have sought clarification on audit reports from the Local Government Audit Service.  I am critical of it too.  It is not appropriate that an inhouse Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government audits 31 local authorities.  I have always argued the case that all local authorities should come under the scrutiny of the Comptroller and Auditory General.  They should be in here and have to answer questions about their accounts.  What is Mr. McLoughlin's view?  What would he suggest?  How could NOAC work in greater collaboration or would he like additional powers and additional resources to work closely with the Local Government Audit Service?<\/p><p> A number of Local Government Audit Service reports for 2015-16 were posted up on its website in the past few days but there are no sanctions.  The Local Government Audit Service has singled out many local authorities here for their failure to comply with their property registers to transfer their property register assets to an IT system.  For four years in succession, they have singled out one particular local authority and asked why it has not done so and the response from the chief executive in question was that the local authority does not have the resources.  When one talks to chief executives, they say the Local Government Audit Service cannot sanction them, it is all a joke and all the chief executive is asked is to comment.  The Local Government Audit Service does not seem to have any powers.  NOAC does not seem to have any powers either.  It is all a matter of scrutinising and reviews and conducting reports but it ends up being nothing.<\/p><p> At the end of the day, councillors have a duty.  We are public representatives at all different levels.  Citizens have a right to expect good corporate governance and sanction.  The big problem in this area is who is sanctioned, that is, what chief executive gets removed if he or she has failed.  I am not suggesting one should because it is a difficult job.  I would be the first to point that out.<\/p><p> I am concerned about the last paragraph in Mr. McLoughlin's statement to the committee where he states, \"NOAC would not have any expertise on the components of the local government funding model and how it operates in practice\".  Those are Mr. McLoughlin's words, not mine.  That raises a concern and I would like Mr. McLoughlin to explain that to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#J00600","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510218000,"counter":1794,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boyhan for his comments on the CCMA website.  We will certainly take that on board.<\/p> <p>  I am a little surprised that the Senator would be so vocal on not knowing of the County and City Management Association because we have been in existence for over 50 years.  Within our own local authority areas, members of the association are highly visible and also accountable for our actions, rightly so because of the positions that we hold.  The elected members - the AILG can comment on this if it wishes - sit at least once a month in public session, with access for citizens and for the media, and rightly so.  In the local authorities that I have worked in, there has always been a strong tradition of accountability, both directly as part of the local authority but, most importantly, because we are conscious that the members are extremely vulnerable and accountable every five years when local elections come around.  Working with the elected member is an important part of the role of a chief executive or county manager.<\/p> <p>  My own experience was previously as a head of finance.  I was heavily involved in producing budgets and the mantra by which we worked was that there should be no surprises for the elected member when the draft budget is presented so that there is full transparency and full accountability at local level.

By doing so now through NOAC, it gives a level of scrutiny that might not have been there previously in the sector.<\/p> <p>  In my experience we have been publishing service indicators, and now performance indicators for over ten years.  Given the diverse role that local government performs, it is impossible to capture everything but it does capture the wide range of essential services that are delivered at local level in spite of the vagaries of the funding system that has evolved.  In this regard the funding system is a challenge.<\/p><p>It leads to the imperfection and variation across the country that can occur because of settlement patterns and the way in which the country has developed.  The draft national planning framework, which is out for consultation, is a recognition of the need to promote regional development in a more equitable and balanced manner.  This is a challenge for all of us, whether Members of the Oireachtas or members of the County and City Management Association. <\/p><p> To return to Senator Boyhan's question on the 2014 baseline and the staffing embargo.  As noted, the embargo was relaxed in 2015.  Chief executives of local authorities can only employ the staff they can afford to employ.  The budgetary constraints we face must be managed, which is part of the challenge.  We identify a need and we have workforce plans which we keep under review.  However, the challenge is to be able to afford to employ additional staff and then to recruit and retain them because once the market picks up, the supply of labour becomes constrained.  <\/p><p> The Senator referred to the acquisition of property.  I am not aware of the specifics to which he is referring.  We have to acquire property from time to time.  We operate in a market in which there are other bids.  I have experience of the council being outbid for property it was seeking to secure for good operational reasons.<\/p><p> On the funding of property acquisitions, it is a reserve function of councils to sanction any borrowing proposal.  We tend to try to keep our corporate policy group in the loop regarding major financial matters and, as I stated, budgetary matters should create any surprises for elected members.  However, there are times when information cannot be made public owing to the sensitivities surrounding negotiations to acquire property.  This is also a challenge.<\/p><p> We have capital programmes which signify, on a rolling three-year basis, what are our capital aspirations.  Anything the chief executive does should accord with the plans and programmes in place.  We cannot always get this right, however, and timing issues sometimes create an information gap.  This should be the exception rather than the rule.<\/p><p>On the local property tax, from the perspective of councillors and county and city managers, we operate within the funding system that is legislated for by the Oireachtas.  The local property tax is, for now, the main source of funding for local government.  Senator Boyhan explained his preferences on the matter and he is entitled to his views.  We are operating on the basis of the legislative programme set out for local government and we must make the best possible use of it.<\/p><p> We are conscious that the revaluation decided in 2014 under the local property tax is due for completion in 2019.  That is a matter for the Government and Oireachtas to legislate. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":1796,"content":"<p>I am conscious of time as the session is scheduled to conclude by 11 a.m.  We will extend the session by approximately 15 minutes.

On the issue of the local property tax and our views on a local tax, we represent 949 councillors of all political parties and none.  I am sure Members of the Oireachtas could debate the merits of a local property tax all day, just as we could.  The question to be addressed is how local authorities should be funded.  Should they be fully funded from central funds or should local charges be used to generate funding?  This question must be asked as part of a wider debate.  As noted in the submission, 75% of funding for local authorities comes from local receipts from commercial rates, local property tax and income from goods and services generated locally.  The remaining 25% of funding comes from central funds.  As such, much of the funding for local authorities is generated locally from the general public.<\/p> <p>  Councillor Danny Owens will highlight the services people receive for the money they pay, which is extremely important.  Councillor Brian Lawlor is from South Dublin County Council, which last year introduced a small pilot scheme on a participatory budget.  It established a local fund of &euro;300,000 for one of its local electoral areas and asked members of the public in the area how they would like this sum to be spent.  This was done to show the public what their local property tax is doing for them.  It is a good pilot scheme and I understand the sum involved has been increased to &euro;600,000 this year.  This type of initiative could be rolled out elsewhere to demonstrate to the public the services they receive from their local authorities.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Moylan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510218000,"counter":1798,"content":"<p>To address an issue raised by Senator Boyhan, while the purpose of the meeting is to examine the funding model, it is also important to consider the utilisation of this funding and how it is spent, particularly in terms of value for money for local authority housing.  Many councillors are disenchanted because the role of local authorities in building houses has been considerably diminished as a result of the advent of approved housing bodies.  This raises a serious longer-term issue.  In the short term, there is an economic argument for using approved housing bodies but that is not true in the longer term.<\/p> <p>  A small number of local authority homes are built in County Offaly.  While building directly is more costly to the State initially, the benefits of doing so are obvious.  The houses built by councils become an asset from which an income is gained and the council retains the house when it has been paid off.  That is not the case under the approved housing body model under which we hand over approximately 30% of the cost of building houses to these bodies.  This is dead money which will never achieve anything.  We do not own the asset and we have less input into the allocation of the completed homes.  This approach must be reviewed.  I am not making a political point because it has been presided over by successive Governments.  It is important that we address this in the long term rather than in the short term because housing provision by local authorities is an aspect of policy that must be addressed very soon. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Danny Owens"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510218000,"counter":1799,"content":"<p>When I was a member of an bord snip nua, as it was known, and the local government efficiency review, it was clear that the difficulties experienced by the State at the time impacted on local government because of the extent to which the latter was dependent on State funding and the fact that local government did not have a sustainable model of funding in its own right.  Internationally, local government is much more independent of central government finances.<\/p> <p>  On the Comptroller and Auditor General and local government audit service, I was appointed to chair a group established to determine whether the two services could be merged.  During our deliberations, which were by no means easy, the Government took a decision to establish the National Oversight and Audit Commission.  From recollection, the reason for not merging the different services was that local government receives approximately 75% of its income locally and must, therefore, be accountable locally.  Why should the national audit service - the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General - interfere in that particular area?  This is a policy issue.  Nevertheless, we established that the services could work together in a number of areas, including quality standards.<\/p><p>The reason we have no expertise on the funding model is because it is not an issue for us.  Should we have more powers?  Other than in matters of examining and reporting, I am not sure that the PSA necessarily has any more power than we do.  It may have greater ability to call people in as witnesses, perhaps.  Within NOAC, however, we have now decided to bring in each local authority, as much so that we can get an understanding of the individual context as anything else.  Each local authority deals with quite different issues so there can be very different reasons efficiency can vary.  <\/p><p> We work very closely with the Local Government Audit Service, LGAS, and have, for example, agreed on the range of issues we will look at from the point of view of value for money.  LGAS has some expertise in value for money as part of its audit service.  We have now agreed on a programme of work - what we in NOAC will do and what the LGAS will do - and we will do so every year.  I also regularly meet the director of the audit service and she has come before NOAC to agree on these issues.  We have not discussed what other powers we should have because this is a policy matter for Government.<\/p><p> With regard to councillors' knowledge, all I can say is that I am being increasingly asked to meet audit committees and so forth.  We will certainly do anything we can to bring the attention of councillors to the work that we do and I will raise the possibility of providing greater information at the next NOAC board meeting.  When we issue our reports, for example, there is no reason why we could not email copies to councillors if they were happy to receive them.

By their nature, these questions are probably more for Mr. Geoghegan and his colleagues from the Association of Irish Local Government.<\/p><p>I will start with the question of the local property tax.  I believe this to be an unjust tax; a tax on the family home.  When it was first introduced we were told that it would go towards funding local services but this was a con trick.  While 80% goes to local services, central Government funding for these services has been cut so badly that the local property tax revenue is, in reality, just replacing lost income and communities have not benefited from better services as a result.  I note a particular paragraph in Mr. Geoghegan's paper which I will now read out for the committee:<\/p><blockquote>The issue of using 2014 as the ongoing base-line to determine the current element of local property tax payable to our member authorities needs to change with immediate effect and this base-line needs to be increased dramatically to ensure that local authorities have sufficient general funding available to them. <\/blockquote> <p>I read that as a call for a big increase in the local property tax, and I remind the AILG that this tax is a contested tax.  The household charge that went before it was not paid by 50% of the population, a level of opposition similar in scale to that against the water charges.  It was only when jackboot tactics were used and the Revenue Commissioners were put in charge of collection that opposition was driven back, only to later feed back into the water charges campaign.  If major increases in the local property tax are coming up either in 2019 or indeed further down the line, based on higher property prices in a housing bubble as opposed to a depressed market in 2013, all I can say is that the political establishment should remember that this was and is a contested tax and will remain so in the future.  This could be a major issue, particularly if large increases are sought.  I wish to put that on the record.<\/p><p>My next question concerns Traveller accommodation.  I have here an article that appeared in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>on 14 September, the headline of which runs: Traveller housing targets have not been met in 18 years.  The article reports that there are 1500 Traveller families living in overcrowded conditions in the State; that funding for Traveller accommodation, which stood at &euro;171 million euro between 2005 and 2008, dipped to &euro;34 million last year; that only 70% of the units targeted have actually been provided; and, incredibly, that more than &euro;55 million of monies allocated for Traveller accommodation since 2000 remains unspent.  Why is that?<\/p><p>On the question of local government capital income, I find the figures here to be earth shattering.  In 2008, local authorities received capital income grants from the State of &euro;5.5 billion euro but by 2015 that had been cut to &euro;1.3 billion.  In other words, then, every &euro;4 or more of this funding received by local authorities from central Government was cut back to less than a euro.  This is not just a cut - it is a massive cut, the impact of which can be seen on housing in particular.  We heard on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; this morning of the latest report from Threshold on how landlords are using the refurbishment legal loophole to evict tenants and hike up rents, thus putting even more pressure on the local authorities.  This is an absolute scandal.  If these cuts were reversed we would be able to build public housing on public land and put a major dent in the housing crisis.  A total of 9,000 local authority homes were build in 1975; 75 were built in 2015; 142 were built in 2016.  These cuts must be reversed and I ask the witnesses to comment on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#M00200","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":1802,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Moylan like to come in first on these questions?

What we do call for, however, is the need for a review of the practice of using 2014 as the baseline for the general purpose element that our member authorities receive from the local property tax.  That is our demand in the paragraph highlighted by the Deputy.  In 2016, for example, &euro;473 million was taken, or could potentially have been taken in 100% of the local property tax.  Based on the 2014 baseline, &euro;282 million of that goes back to local authorities for general purpose use while the rest comes back in capital allocations.  What we are saying is that the general purpose figure, as based on 2014, needs to be increased to meet the ever-increasing day to day expenditure of our member authorities.  What we are looking for, effectively, is that some of the portion of the local property tax that goes towards capital projects be moved back towards general purpose use.  How would one then fund the capital element?  This would just have to come out of the Central Fund.  Nowhere in our submission, however, do we look for an increase in the local property tax.  In line with the national criteria set down by the Oireachtas, our member authorities can either increase or decrease this tax by up to 15%.

Local authority budgets are made up of charges in respect of local property taxes, rent, waste, parking, planning fees, motor taxes and rates.  They cannot charge people any more without crippling them financially.  If the local authorities are experiencing budget shortfalls at the end of the year and they are reporting this to the Minister but he is refusing to provide more central Government funding then we have a problem.  There is nobody speaking up for local authorities and councillors.  This is a massive issue.  The powers which councillors previously had have been taken from them and they are dwindling further.

The legislation which barred Deputies also being a member of a local authority was, I believe, bad legislation.  As a result of that legislation the link between what happens locally and nationally was broken.  This is supported by today's discussion in terms of the lack of funding available to local authorities.  If one is not a member of a local council one does not know the ins and outs of its budget or the demands on it.  <\/p> <p>  I agree with Senator Boyhan's point about accountability to the Oireachtas.  As Members we ought to have more input into local government and we need to find a better way of doing this other than an annual meeting.  I also believe that local authorities should be accountable for their budgets to the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is in that arena that the local authorities can provide clarity around their budgets.  They will need to have all the facts before them when they do so.  In the interim, there is no accountability.  I welcome the work being done by the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC.  I am disappointed that the body has only ten staff.  I cannot imagine how it is getting through all of its work.  The commission needs a lot more support.<\/p> <p>  As stated, the job of the National Oversight and Audit commission is to provide independent oversight of the local government sector and it has wide-ranging functions in that regard.  As I said, the commission is doing important work.  Does it meet with its managers, auditors and councillors in a public forum?  Failing an appearance of NOAC before the Committee of Public Accounts, it should be seen to be holding the councils to account in its annual report in terms of which is operating to best practice and where practice is worst.  In other words, it should identify which local authority is bottom of the list and hold it to account in that regard in a public forum.  If that cannot be done via the Committee of Public Accounts then I am sure the commission has the power to do it.  This would bring about accountability and a focus to the work of the commission.  There is no doubt but that the commission is doing excellent work but it does not have sufficient staff.  We need to know more about it and what I have suggested might assist us in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to finances, I believe there is need for a root and branch reform of local government.  There is need for an independent analysis of how it operates, where best practice is adhered to, the most vibrant local authority, the best mix in terms of business input and so on.  I welcome the County City and Management Association, CCMA, comment about it being business and job focused.  I believe that is happening.  However, there is need for business expertise in this area to encourage local authorities countrywide to find new ways of being more accountable, more efficient and so on.  I do not know if there are business experts in the National Oversight and Audit Commission.  I would like more debate on this issue.  I believe by focusing on these issues publicly the commission will get a better result.<\/p> <p>  In regard to debt accrued by councils when land values were rising, some councils, including Louth County Council, bought land in good faith that is now worthless.  There are examples of land purchased for approximately &euro;12 million which is now worth only &euro;1 million or less.  Where local authorities made decisions in good faith and are now millions of euro in debt the Government should remove that debt from them to ensure they can spend their budgets on services and so on.  The decisions that were made were made at a time when property values were high.  The councils purchased that land to develop them for housing and communities.  I would welcome the views of managers on that issue.  Perhaps we could establish a NAMA-type agency to remove these bad debts from councils.  We need to ensure that no local authority is encumbered by bad debts.  Much of the budget of Louth County Council is servicing this type of debt and as such it cannot provide services and so on in the county.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#N00700","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":1814,"content":"<p>The Deputy must conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#N00800","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":1815,"content":"<p>I have been here for an hour and a half and I would like the time to make my points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#N00900","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":1816,"content":"<p>Every member was allocated five minutes.

Deputy O'Dowd referred to debt in regard to land acquisition.  It is something that affects some local authorities, where it is more pronounced, than others.  The local government audit service is working on it because it is a significant problem in certain counties, of which Deputy O'Dowd's is one.  It is under active consideration.<\/p> <p>  On best practice and how we share and learn from it, I will use my own county of Monaghan as an example.  Each year when the National Oversight and Audit Commission performance indicators are published, we take those indicators locally and rank ourselves not only against the national indicators but also against local authorities of a similar size and character - looking at the most local level, there is fierce competition between Cavan and Monaghan, for instance - and we do so with a view to establish where we can do better.  After doing this exercise at management level, we bring that report through our corporate policy group and to our councillors.  There is a process of trying to use the information that Mr. McLoughlin and the National Oversight and Audit Commission assemble and collate to improve our services but it is done in the context of funding constraints and staffing limitations.  It is not always possible to achieve them but we use the indicators to set targets to improve our position across the indicators over the following year.  One area where we have proven very effective has been pre-letting maintenance of local authority housing stock where Monaghan's turnaround time is the lowest nationally.  In the example of show case to which Mr. McLoughlin referred, my housing staff would be giving a presentation to their colleagues on how they achieved it in Monaghan.  It is an example of where indicators can be used as a benchmark which facilitates improvements within the sector.  If, through the local government added service, we can comply or explain, it would be an efficient way of improving standards across the sector.  It relates to scaleability, or the scale of a small rural county such as Monaghan versus that of the larger local authorities such as Fingal or D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  There will be differences because of scale and the character of the areas.  We are trying to use the performance indicators not only to report on performance but to improve it as a sector.

He is 100% correct.  I served for 17 years on a local authority which went from there being a very significant budget for a large urban centre being replaced by a one-sheet budget for a municipal district.  I do not disagree with Mr. O'Sullivan that they are doing good works but they are not comparable to what they did before, in what was allowed for statutory powers.  If Mr. O'Sullivan and the councillors are in agreement that there are failures, can we have a statement here that there will be a cohesive effort to change it?  It is not good enough to acknowledge that something is wrong, we must see a return of statutory budgets for these areas whether it is the through the return of town councils or statutory budgets for what were the electoral areas.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Dowd and Senator Boyhan raised the acquisition of property and it was also addressed by Mr. O'Sullivan.  It is having a considerable impact; it is the legacy of not having debt forgiveness.  Not every county got into the land aggregation scheme.  A point was raised about oversight for acquisition on a piece of land which elected members do not have.  Some county managers might bring it to the corporate policy group to flag it, but others do not.  In my own county, a 22 acre field was acquired for over &euro;20 million.  Nothing was ever built on this landlocked piece of land.  Now something will happen through the activation scheme but the houses that will be built on that field are now coming in at over &euro;100,000 per unit more expensive than any other house because the site acquisition cost is being factored into the delivery of the unit.  The county council is going to the Department asking for money to build the houses and the Department is saying okay but when they see how much the field cost, it is factoring this price into each unit.  The result is that we are getting fewer houses.  That is the catch.<\/p><p>Who is the loser?  It is not the Department or the Custom House, but the people on the social housing waiting list.  The yield is only half of what could be produced.  This is the key point and it needs to be addressed.  This feeds into the role of central government.  I accept the point made by Councillor Geoghegan, other councillors and Mr. McLoughlin on the 75% to 25% divide, but we need more involvement from central government.  If the general purpose grant had been allowed to stand with the local property tax when it was introduced, we would have had enriched councils providing more services, but what was given with one hand was taken with the other and we only got parity.<\/p><p> Rates are a big issue and not only with regard to revaluation.  After a decade of rates freezes and, in some case, rates reductions, we are getting back into the sphere and zone of rates increases.  This week, we saw Fingal County Council increase its rates by 2%.  It is under pressure as it has a huge number of people in the area, from Swords to Blanchardstown.  It is a very rich council and it is under severe pressure.  It will raise its rates by 2% this year, which will bring in &euro;2.5 million extra income.  It comes back to the key point of whether we are serious about the funding of local government by central government, or whether we will allow the funding model to be, as we are discussing, just on the shoulders of local authorities.  County managers and councillors will not shirk the challenge.  They will rise to the challenge of trying to provide the services they are required to provide for their people, but this lets central government off the hook.  We do not have a local government system that is comparable with Europe or the United States.  We need to be honest about this.  The discussion here this morning should help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#O01500","speaker":"1218","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":1835,"content":"<p>I will be very brief because I do not want to go over what has already been said and well articulated by various speakers.  The greatest crisis facing the country at present from a social and economic respective is housing.  Councillor Owens and Deputy Cassells have made very pertinent comments.  There is a feeling out there that local authorities are not building in the way in which they did.  They are told by central government that funding is not an issue and that if projects were put before it, funding would not be an obstacle, but it is taking two to three years to go from an initial site inspection to construction commencement.  At the same time, approved housing bodies are getting the apparent nod, and in recent years we have had an overdependency on the housing assistance payment as a result.<\/p> <p>  I ask that the Chairman and committee members insist on a further meeting with the witnesses to discuss this item specifically because this is something that has to be ironed out.  Why are local authorities not building?  When we meet the Department, it states the procurement process has been reduced from eight to four stages, but it still takes two to three years.  We hear this example replicated throughout the country, which is ridiculous in the extreme.  It is time those at the coalface, including the witnesses, elected members and ourselves, get a handle on why local authorities are not building houses.  It is as simple as that.  Last year, the Minister published the sites and lands in council ownership.  This was put on a website, expressions of interest were sought and then we heard no more about it.  I want a special meeting, if it takes two days or a week, to get to the bottom of this and get everybody on side on how this issue is dealt with so we can all be on the same page.  That is all I will say about this, rather than take taking up more time at the meeting.<\/p> <p>  With regard to commercial rates and the revaluation ongoing since last year, the assumptions are that in the round the income will remain the same and that the rates will be collected.  The variation in valuations in some sectors is such they will not be collected.  I was interested to hear about the National Oversight and Audit Commission, and I acknowledge the work it does.  I specifically compliment it on being the first to bring to public knowledge the lack of inspections and the 6% rate in 2015.  As usual, it takes a sexy programme on TV - not that it was anything of the sort - to bring home the alarming nature of it to most people.  It is from this that progress might ensue.<\/p> <p>  With regard to commercial rates, the witnesses mentioned that they carried out an exercise recently.  Have they made this public?  What are its findings?  Are the witnesses aware of the difficulties we face considering the new evaluation taking place?  Next week, we will discuss a new valuations Bill, which will seek to address the anomalies that exist in our archaic system, and bring about new methodologies in how rates are calculated and collected.  This is fine, but if that legislation were produced and agreed in the D&aacute;il tomorrow, it could not be retrospective.  It could be ten years before the fruits of it will be borne.  In the meantime, some people are of the opinion that the bills on their tables this year, which will come into effect next year, will somehow be wiped.  They will not, unfortunately.  Are the Association of Irish Local Government, the Department and the Minister aware of this train wreck that will present itself?  Some industries and businesses have seen their rates bills rise by 300% or 400%.  It is unbelievable in the extreme to think that in this day and age a cost and expense can increase by this amount and, considering what they have come through in recent years, they can be hit by this.  If it were any other sector or service, there would be uproar.  The way in which it is done is well managed in the sense it is county by county over a period and there is a bit of an outcry every couple of months in different areas of the country.  If this were happening in the whole and together, it would not have proceeded and it would not have lasted a week or two.<\/p> <p>  What exercise has been carried out and is it up to date?  Is it cognisant and relevant considering the huge increases taking place at present?  There is an assumption that local authorities will get the money.  I saw the same with development levies and charges.  There was an assumption that they would be collected and that if they were received one year, they would be received the following year.  The witnesses have mentioned their revenue has decreased by &euro;800 million or &euro;900 million.  I would like a breakdown of this.  Laois County Council recently reduced its development charge, which was commendable, in an effort to try to reduce the cost of construction for the private sector.  Local authorities should do this across the board, but will the Government compensate them in the short term for the shortfall?  It is the same with regard to the overdependency on these revenue streams.  The local authorities state they need a revaluation of the local property base rate and valuation going back to 2014, notwithstanding that local authorities have been forced to increase it over recent years anyway.  If this is not done, the Government can state the local authorities have the wherewithal to do it themselves, not to come knocking on its door and that they should take the play and take the hit politically on the ground.  This is what is at play.  None of us is interested in politics when we are elected to these forums.  We are supposed to come together and ensure we represent those who gave us the privilege to do so in a constructive and cohesive manner, but these are the facts.  While the oversight body might not have any input in policy, surely it can comment on the trend that has become obvious in recent years regarding the way in which the local property tax is spent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#P00200","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":1836,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee.

What can the witnesses do to help the local authorities in Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny and Carlow to get regional support to develop our areas?

We saw the \"Prime Time\" programme recently and not only do we have a question of supply of houses, including social and affordable houses, but we also see a major problem in the rental sector now.  It was shocking, disgusting and vile to see in that programme the conditions in which people are living and, moreover, and worse, the safety conditions.  These people's lives are being threatened day by day in the squalor of their rental accommodation.  They are paying large sums of money for dreadful conditions.  Do the local councils have funding to pay for inspectors to visit these properties?  We have heard there is a deficit in respect of property inspections.  If there is no funding at local authority level, can the Government step up and provide urgent funding to ensure that properties in the rental market are inspected for health and safety and living conditions for the people, the citizens, forced into rental because of the lack of social and affordable housing in the market?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#P00300","speaker":"1385","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":1838,"content":"<p>We are under fierce time pressure.

I am accompanied today by Mr. Richard Murphy, who is a principal local government auditor in the LGAS.<br\/><br\/>The LGAS performs the independent, external audit of local government, as established by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The LGAS audits the annual financial statements of local authorities, including regional authorities, motor taxation offices and other bodies.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government appoints auditors, known as local government auditors, to carry out or assist in the carrying out of audits of local authorities and other bodies.  All local government auditors are qualified accountants and are recruited following open public competitions. <br\/><br\/>Each local government auditor is assigned an audit district under warrant of authority from the director of audit.  Local government auditors are independent of the Department when discharging their professional functions.  This independence is protected in legislation in accordance with section 116(2) of the Local Government Act, 2001.  The 2001 Act sets out the primary duties of the local government auditor as follows: <\/p><blockquote>In the course of the audit of accounts of the local authority or other body, the local government auditor shall carry out such audit tests as he or she considers appropriate in order to be satisfied as to: (a) whether the annual financial statement is prepared in accordance with section 108 or with the accounting requirements otherwise applicable to the body concerned, <br \/><br \/>(b) whether the annual financial statement presents fairly the financial position of the authority or other body and of its income and expenditure for the period in question, <br \/><br \/>(c) whether the transactions of the audited body conform to the statutory or other authorisation under which they purport to have been carried out. <\/blockquote> <p>Following the audit each local government auditor issues an audit opinion, an audit report and a management letter to the chief executive of the local authority.  It is the local government auditor&rsquo;s main statutory duty, following completion of the financial audit, to give his or her independent audit opinion on the annual financial statements of the audited body as to whether it presents fairly the financial position of the audited body and of its income and expenditure for the period under audit.  In addition to the audit opinion, it is custom and practice to issue statutory audit reports covering any matter or matters which the auditor considers should be reported.  The chief executive of a local authority is required to respond to this report and his or her comments shall be included, if of material significance, as part of the final report.  This procedure has enhanced public scrutiny of local government as management responses to address the issues raised at audit now form part of the published audit reports.  In accordance with international standards on auditing, an auditor may issue a management letter drawing attention to any weaknesses in financial procedures and-or internal controls identified during audit and make appropriate recommendations. <br\/><br\/>The role of the elected members in the governance of local authorities is vital.  The approval and regular monitoring of revenue and capital expenditure and the consideration of the annual financial statement are important functions for the council members.  A copy of the auditor&rsquo;s report is furnished to each member of the local authority in accordance with section 20 of the Local Government (Financial and Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014.  Furthermore, the audit committee is required to report to the relevant authority on its consideration of the audited financial statement, auditor&rsquo;s report or auditor&rsquo;s special report at the next practicable meeting of the relevant authority following the audit committee&rsquo;s consideration.  The participation of members or retired members on local authorities&rsquo; audit committees is now an integral part of the oversight of corporate governance in the local authorities.  In accordance with good governance, each local government auditor attends at least one meeting with the audit committee of the local authority, to present his or her report, discuss the issues arising and to review responses provided by the chief executive. <br\/><br\/>Members of the public have unique rights as part of the public accountability framework for local government.  They can inspect the annual financial statement, records and other documents relating to the accounts to be audited for seven days before the formal audit commences. <br\/><br\/>I hope that the information provided clarifies the role of the LGAS in the accountability framework applying to the local government sector.  The LGAS has no role in determining the methods used to fund local authorities or in deciding on the levels of funding in individual cases.  However, in the course of their audits, the local government auditors would be aware of the financial position of each local authority and references are often made in audit reports to matters of concern in this regard. <br\/><br\/>As director of audit, I thank the committee for inviting me and my colleague here today to discuss the role of the LGAS. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":1850,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Larkin.

I am accompanied today by my divisional colleagues, Ms Lorraine O'Donoghue, Ms Sinead Kehoe, Mr. Rory O'Leary and Mr. David Kelly.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the funding of local government with the committee today.  The current system of local government comprises 31 local authorities which vary significantly from one another in terms of size, population, public service demand, infrastructure and income sources.  Local authorities have responsibility for delivering a wide range of services at local level including housing, planning, roads, maintenance and cleaning of streets, street lighting, environmental protection, fire and emergency services and the provision of recreational amenities and community infrastructure.  They also make a significant contribution in delivering the State&rsquo;s capital and infrastructure requirements across these areas as well as playing a key role in supporting economic development and enterprise at local level, a function that was put on a statutory footing in 2014. <\/p> <p>  The funding system that applies to local authorities is a complex one, as authorities derive their income from a variety of sources including commercial rates, charges for goods and services and funding from central Government.  In 2015, the most recent year for which audited figures are available, goods and services represented 32% of local authority income, commercial rates accounted for 37%, grants and subsidies for 22% and local property tax, LPT, allocations 9%.  Income from goods and services includes car parking fees, recreation and amenity activities, planning fees, housing rents and fire service charges. <\/p> <p>  Audited figures for 2015 indicate that total expenditure was &euro;5.27 billion.  Revenue or current expenditure represents &euro;3.96 billion of this amount, with &euro;1.31 billion in capital expenditure.  Notably, 2015 saw the first annual increase in revenue and capital expenditure for a number of years.  Capital expenditure has increased from a low of &euro;1.1 billion in 2014 to &euro;1.3 billion in 2015 and to an estimated &euro;1.6 billion in 2016, some &euro;1.9 billion in 2017 and &euro;2.3 billion forecast for 2018, which is partially attributable to the increase in activity to deliver the priorities in Rebuilding Ireland. <\/p> <p>  Commercial rates form an important source of funding for local authorities.  In 2017, budgeted rates income amounts to &euro;1.475 billion which accounts for 35% of total budgeted 2017 income of &euro;4.26 billion.  Local authorities levy rates on all relevant property as defined by the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015.  The Acts also provide that certain properties are not liable for commercial rates.  These categories of property are set out in Schedule 4 of the Acts and include, for example, hospitals, farm buildings and community sports facilities.  The rates paid on a property are based on two factors, namely, the valuation determined by the independent commissioner of valuation and the annual rate on valuation, ARV, determined by the local authority at the annual budget meeting. <\/p> <p>  The legislative basis for commercial rates is spread over a significant number of enactments, some of which date back to the 19th century.  Many of the provisions are outdated and are not suitable for business trends in the modern era.  In this regard, the Government has approved the drafting of a Bill to modernise the legislative basis for rates.  The Department will be attending a meeting of this committee later in November to discuss these proposals specifically. <\/p> <p>  Central Government funding of local authorities is through a number of Departments and offices and is for a variety of purposes.<\/p><p>Some streams of funding are delivered directly from Departments to local authorities while others are routed through State agencies.  Most funding from central government to local authorities must be used for specified services.  These can be grouped into six broad programme categories, recreational, education, environment, housing, transport and discretionary.<\/p><p> Local property tax, LPT, is an annual recurring tax applying to most residential properties in Ireland and is currently linked to the market value of the property in 2013.  LPT is collected by the Revenue Commissioners and the funds are ultimately redistributed to the 31 local authorities in accordance with Government policies on funding allocations.  LPT is a significant source of funding for local authorities.  It supplements income from other sources, having been introduced to provide an alternative, stable and sustainable funding base for the local government sector.  The role of local authorities in deciding the local adjustment factor annually is an important connection between revenue raising and expenditure decisions at a local level.  Currently, 80% of LPT is retained in the area where the tax is raised.  The remaining 20% is used to help fund other local authorities that do not have a sufficient property tax base to meet their funding requirements.  Every local authority currently receives a minimum amount of funding from the local retention of LPT that is known as the baseline.  Some local authorities with large property bases receive additional LPT income compared to their baseline.  The Government has decided that those local authorities will use this funding in two ways, with a portion available for their own use and the remainder, if any, for funding housing and road services.  The elected members of a local authority decide annually whether to vary the rate of LPT in its local area.  The rate can be varied up or down by a maximum of 15%.  If a local authority decides to reduce the local LPT rate, the authority forgoes that amount from its LPT allocation.  However, if an authority decides to increase the LPT rate above the basic rate, it receives the full amount of the increased yield collected.  The total LPT allocation to local authorities for 2017 is &euro;501 million.  This includes a subvention from the Exchequer of &euro;44 million.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for its time.

The two papers were excellent.  They were very simple with no ambiguity.  We will clearly be leaving here with a greater, crystal clear understanding of the two relevant functions and roles.  I thank the witnesses sincerely for that.  It is sometimes very hard to break something down to a simple message and the witnesses have certainly done so well.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for Ms Larkin.  I welcome her.  I know she has not been in her job for long since I had reason to contact her recently.  I am delighted that she is here.  I am familiar with outputs of audits, audit opinions, audit reports, management letters and even the role of elected members with regard to audit committees.  The big issue is what sort of teeth Ms Larkin, as director of audit, has in the local government audit service.  I have read local government audits and reports for many years.  I cited a story earlier today.  I will not single one local authority out because I do not think that would be fair, but I will single out a recurring issue.  Ms Larkin's auditors, in their successes, have raised the issue in local audit opinions and sought clarification about it from chief executives.  It relates to the property registers that local authorities are meant to maintain and their requirement to transpose these registers of very valuable assets.  Many of these registers of these public assets, held in trust, are incomplete and it is appalling.  Ms Larkin's organisation has identified the need to transpose these.  Every year, it has raised questions for chief executives and they have come back with a standard one-line answer about resources, staffing issues, etc.  It has gone on for four years in one local authority and for three years in another.  I can cite all of these and send all this detail to the local government audit service.  No action has been taken anywhere.  When I made contact with these chief executives, they told me that they were doing their best, that there was no money or resources, and to buzz off and stop asking.<\/p> <p>  I have worked with my group in the Seanad, the Independents, to bring a Bill forward.  The heads of it are something to the effect that we will seek to have the Committee of Public Accounts or Comptroller and Auditor and General to co-ordinate this power and bring in these chief executives.  I am not sure if that is the best use of resources but I am really trying to find out how effective we can be.  What sanctions does Ms Larkin have for a local authority that fails to address the continuous issues Ms Larkin raises in her reports?  I found it extraordinary that it went on for four years in a row in one case and that there was no action.  Chief executives say that the Local Government Audit Service does not have the power to do anything about them, and it continues to examine them.  In some cases, this issue is not raised in the Local Government Audit Service's next report because it clearly changes the focus in an audit and does not continue to raise the same matter.  It is frustrating.  What can Ms Larkin do about that?<\/p> <p>  The issue of the audit report being brought to elected members when \"next practical\" is not good enough and it may need to change.  I know Ms Larkin is dealing with the system that is in place.  I was dealing with her office two weeks ago to inquire why many of the reports of completed audits were not up on the councils' websites.  I suggest that when she completes her audit of a local authority, she might send a copy of the report to local authority members.  If there is any legal or legislative impediment, I would like to hear from her.  Every member should have the report.  It should not be sitting in someone's drawer waiting for a time that is suitable.  In one case, I was told that the local authority's audit committee would not be meeting for three months so the report could not be brought to members for three months.  That is too late, particularly if the Local Government Audit Service is producing strong recommendations.  I suggest that Ms Larkin consider circulating that and asking the chief executive to place that on the agenda for the next council meeting.  We know there is one every month.  I thank Ms Larkin.  She has given us a very comprehensive paper.  She might address what sanctions the local government audit service has to make people deliver with regard to its concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#S00200","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":1854,"content":"<p>I will be brief.  I want to discuss how information is presented to local authorities to provide a full understanding of the end of year financial statement.  I wish people the best of luck in trying to relate an end of year financial statement to a budget book.  We need to look at how the budget book is presented to councillors.  In all fairness, trying to follow that budget book is an absolute nightmare for anybody who is interested.  Issues I have encountered in my time in Wicklow include the lack of coherent policy for write-offs.  For commercial rates, the total budget and income, write-off, net income and collection rate will be shown.  The rental income from social housing would be presented in the budget book with the net after write-off, with the collection rate.  Key policy decisions need to be made to provide consistency throughout local authorities.  Those of us who have served on local authorities all know the huge problem we have with collection rates, yet we have the huge success with the Revenue Commissioners collecting the local property tax.  There is a question, moving forward, about the best way to collect local authority revenue.<\/p> <p>  We have all mentioned that we look at the Local Government Audit Service's annual opinion every year and that it remains the same, with no real action being taken on it.  What can we do in future to address the lack of action being taken on the annual opinion?  Having served on the first audit committee in Wicklow, I found it was hugely successful and beneficial from the local authority's perspective.  I know the Local Government Audit Service only engages with local authorities once annually.  Does Ms Larkin see those audit committees having a better role moving forward with regard to the overall audit performance of local authorities?<\/p> <p>  A debate is coming up on commercial rates.  It is the most antiquated system that we have seen.  It has been the only balancing act that local authorities have had to balance their books.  The payment of commercial rates was never about the service.  Commercial rates were balanced by what local authority members saw for income compared to expenditure.  I am glad to see that is being addressed at last.<\/p> <p>  I will ask the Department about LPT and the baseline figure.  What methodology is used?  How is the baseline figure for each local authority calculated?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#S00300","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510218000,"counter":1855,"content":"<p>There are a number of issues there which I might compile when I answer them.  I will start with the focus of the audit because the Senator mentioned it.  We approach the audit every year on a risk basis.  The local government auditor addresses that based on the issues in the prior audit year.  At the commencement of each audit, they would find out from the chief executive, the head of finance and the directors of service the risk areas in the local authority during the year.  That is built into our audit plan for the year so it means that the audit resources are focused on those areas that are considered to be of highest risk in the local authority.  Obviously, we are unable to audit every transaction within a local authority so we must direct our resources accordingly.  As a result of that, all of the issues that appear in an audit report would be revisited the following year.  Therefore, if something is raised in an audit report, we follow that up to find out what progress has been made.  If there is a lack of progress or insufficient progress has been made, that will be mentioned in the current year's audit report.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note that we also have a management letter.  Where issues are not considered to be of a high enough risk or a high enough priority, they would form part of the management letter.  There are additional issues that would not appear in the audit report but would appear in the management letter.  This year, we have changed the layout of our management letter.  As well as the recommendation from us as to what should happen and the feedback from the chief executive, the management letter also includes a timeline for addressing that issue.  The idea is that we can address it instead of it being just an item that has to be looked at at some point in the future.  We can then measure it in terms of when it should have been addressed, when it was committed to being addressed by the local authority, and whether that took place.<\/p> <p>  I have noticed as well that a number of the audit committees, and the committee referred to them and their important role, are now tracking the issues in both the audit report and the management letter.  They are bringing them up at each audit committee meeting and asking the directors of service or various staff members to make representations as to what is happening in that area within the local authority.  That is a further level of accountability and governance with regard to tracking issues and making progress on them.<\/p> <p>  We meet with the audit committee each year.  The purpose of that is to provide further clarity about issues that come up in the audit report.  The audit committee then prepares a report on that which it presents to the members in order that the members have a better understanding of some of the issues that are raised and their significance.<\/p> <p>  Delays in putting the reports on the website were mentioned.  The procedure at the moment is that the reports go to the chief executive who corresponds with the directors of service and their management who reply to us.  Once that is completed, we forward a copy of our final report to the audit committee.  Out of courtesy, we wait for the next audit committee meeting.  The audit committee meetings only take place every three months.  Typically, they take place four times a year, so sometimes there is a time delay.  After that, we wait for the audit committee to present its report to the council members, so we do allow time and there is a time delay between the audit being completed and being put up on the website.  We can definitely raise ways to shorten that with the County and City Management Association, CCMA.  It is not a delay on our end.  It just relates to following the procedures that have been set.  That is definitely something we can look at and we can consider circulating it.<\/p> <p>  Regarding sanctions, there are different levels of accountability.  In each local authority, it is the chief executive who is accountable for following up on all of the issues raised.  We then have the further layer of the audit committee which can also direct the internal audit unit to look at any issues we have raised and produce follow-up reports in that area or look at the area in more detail.  The audit committee can direct the internal audit unit and follow up and assess the actions of management in following up on issues.  Another feature is the report to the councillors.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the budget, there is a detailed note in the financial statements that explains at a high level the overs and unders in the year which we would look at as part of our audit.  As part of our preliminary analytical procedures and our audit procedures, we would go through the overs and unders for the year and obtain explanations from management as to why they have occurred.  We also look for the approval of the members regarding the overs and unders.  We would note the committee meeting at which that happened.<\/p> <p>  The other point concerned a policy for write-offs.  There is no standard policy as to when a debt should be written off but there is a process to be followed.  Thirty days after the year end, a schedule of uncollected rates is prepared that is reviewed by the chief executive.  A decision would then be made.  There is a formal process before a write-off is taken, and all those write-offs would be approved by the chief executive and the heads of finance.<\/p> <p>  As part of our audit, we would look at the collection rates of the three main income streams, which are rates, rent and housing loans.  All audit reports comment on those, whether they have improved or declined in the year and any reasons for that.  We would also look at the controls and procedures behind rates and rent collection, what procedures are in place in the local authority and whether we consider those procedures to be adequate.  I think that answers all of the points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#T00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Larkin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510218000,"counter":1856,"content":"<p>I think most of Senator Boyhan's questions related to the audit but I wish to underline that the Department sees the audit committee as a pivotal part of the governance framework, and that is why it was put on a statutory basis in 2014.

If it is helpful, we could do a note on that to clarify our understanding of it.<\/p> <p>  Rates collection is a huge issue for us.

It became a very complex model but it did establish for eight years what the general purpose grant should be.  From 2008 onwards, that was effectively kept as the baseline.

The idea is to get NOAC's input at the start of the year on any addition that we should consider or how we could expand the scope.  We took all of NOAC's feedback in that regard on board.  I have presented to NOAC on value for money, how our remit covers that area and other areas we will examine in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#U00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":1872,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Larkin.

Regarding baselines, which are now referred to as LPT allocations, I will be clear.  The Minister makes proposals on LPT allocations.  He does so within the constraints of the LPT legislation, which is the responsibility of the Department of Finance.  Effectively, we are constrained by the funding that is available within that legislation.  The Department of Finance commissioned a report from Dr. Don Thornhill on the LPT legislation, how it was administered and how it could be improved.  I understand that the Department of Finance will review its approach in 2018.  Our Department will be actively involved in that process to ensure that questions regarding issues such as the baseline are brought to the table at that point.<\/p> <p>  On the question of leniency that Senator Murnane O'Connor raised, we will get into that issue in more detail next week, but the policy towards rate payments is that the priority is for the ratepayer to engage with the local authority.  Under the current system, there are two moieties annually, with rates paid partly in January-February and partly after July.  The proposal, which we will discuss in more detail next week, is for that to be spread out over the year.  The priority is for the ratepayer to engage with the local authority.  It is only where the ratepayer declines to engage that further measures must be taken.  This is the approach that we are proposing.<\/p> <p>  The decision to vary LPT is a local one.  Seven out of 31 local authorities have chosen to increase property tax from between 2.5% to 10%.  The number decreasing it has reduced to four, not all of which are decreasing it by the full 15%.  There is a significant change.<\/p> <p>  I might revert to the Senator with a breakdown on the discretionary side of grants and subsidies.  We will get some more detail and send her a note.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#U01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Lemass"},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":1874,"content":"<p>I apologise, as I missed the witnesses' addresses.  I will pick them up on a point.  Someone stated that &euro;5 billion was the expenditure per annum across local authorities.  That is a great deal of money.  I support Senator Boyhan's assertion that local authorities and their auditors should appear before the Committee of Public Accounts.<\/p> <p>  Is a chief auditor's report published annually?  Are trends in the various audits published and circulated widely?  Is it on the LGAS website or somewhere else?  It would be important.<\/p> <p>Some local authorities, such as Louth, purchased landbanks at significant cost.  Through no one's fault, seeing as how land prices collapsed, the authorities have been left servicing a large debt.  Many of their resources that should be going towards current expenditure are instead going towards that debt, which is having a negative impact on councils' financial capacity to deliver a good service.<\/p> <p>  The gentleman from the CCMA told us that he believed the auditors were dealing with this matter and that something was happening.  I do not know whether I have remembered his words exactly.  For councils to function properly, this debt should not rest with them.  Perhaps the witnesses have a view on this.  Some councils have been able to get this debt removed whereas others have not.  Louth has a serious problem.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the fact that there is a chief auditor's report.  Some of the criticisms of local authorities relate to value for money and significant overruns.  Would the LGAS undertake a value for money report on certain issues across all councils, for example, where projects worth more than &euro;20,000 or &euro;40,000 have seen significant overruns in excess of whatever the service deems to be a reasonable figure?<\/p><p> One of things people complain about is work which sometimes goes on interminably and nobody seems to be responsible or accountable for it.  Everybody knows that something is going on and that the contracts are possibly not professionally proofed.  I am not saying that is what happened in a case we had in Drogheda some years ago but it went on for an entire year in the centre of the town and destroyed business in the area.  I never found out the reason that happened but it was a disaster.  I am highlighting the issue of significant impact on the ability of a town to function.  Will someone comment on what happens if it is brought to the attention of a local authority?  Part of the issue is that the project ought to have been priced differently, for example, if the contract had been completed by a certain time, there ought to have been a benefit to the contractor rather than it having been the case that the longer they were there, the more money they got.  I am not an auditor so I do not have any knowledge in that regard but it is an issue.<\/p><p> The other point I wish to raise relates to fraud.  I will not say where it was but it has been brought to my attention.  It was not in County Louth.  There was a court case and a conviction for fraud.  A business person lost millions and he lost his business as a result.  The Garda prosecuted in the case but the person still has questions arising in respect of the local authority.  I rang the auditor in Dublin and we got a letter from him saying he would investigate the matter but he was forbidden by law to correspond further with the complainant.  The problem is that the we do not know what has happened.  We have not seen the report.  The auditor did say it would be part of the audit he was doing but the person does not know what has happened and is very concerned and agitated about it.<\/p><p> I accept that an auditor should not and cannot get directly involved, but if there has been a court case, there ought to be a better way of dealing with the local authority aspect of the matter rather than have the person concerned coming into me every couple of months to inquire if I have heard what is going on.  He wants to know what the Garda is doing and what the local authority is doing.  He suffered a grave injustice.  The courts acted on that and convicted a person for it.  Another issue that must be addressed is whether there is a better way of dealing with such cases than a complainant not knowing what is going on.  He has not been told whether the audit has been completed.  I do not even know if the audit has been completed.  That is not fair, right nor just.  The person has lost his entire business as a result having been defrauded of millions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#U01200","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510218000,"counter":1876,"content":"<p>A number of points were made and I will address them in sequence.  The first point related to the overview report.  We publish it each year and it sets out a number of sections.  The first section is to provide clarity on the role of the local government audit service.  We also produce value for money reports during the year and the section explains the criteria for selecting them.  The second section goes into the financial figures that appear in the annual financial statements of the local authorities.  We look at sources of revenue income and revenue expenditure and we look at trends over a number of years.  We also look at capital spend and capital income and trends in that regard.  We look at the main balance sheet items and any movements that are in those items.<\/p> <p>  The third section relates to audit issues raised.  We look at issues that appear in a number of local authorities and what type of issues arise.  As I said in reply to Senator O'Sullivan, we look at fixed assets, which always comes up in our audit report, unfunded balances, development contributions, the existence of land loans and loans that have to be serviced by the local authorities, and the impact that has on them.  We also note areas where progress has been made.  That report is published on the Department's website.  It is freely available for everyone and a copy of it is sent to all local authorities as well.<\/p> <p>  With reference to land loans, if any of them are an issue, they would be referred to in the audit report.  Auditors frequently refer to the impact of servicing loans.  Many audit reports reference the amount it costs to pay the interest on a loan and the impact that has had on the revenue account of a local authority.  The CCMA referred earlier to the fact that we have started a project this year whereby we are looking at value for money and fact-based audit reports.  One of the areas is the interest cost of loans and the loans that exist in local authorities.  We are compiling information across all 31 local authorities on loans, the purpose of the loan, the interest cost of it and how much of it is recoupable from the Department.  That will give us a clear picture of the loans that exist, the number on an interest-only basis or loans where the interest may be rolled up.<\/p> <p>  In terms of value for money, we look at national studies.  Apart from the four fact-based reports, they are purely to collect information in a certain format on four topics across all of the local authorities.  We do have a consultative committee for the value for money examinations and it is made up of a number of chief executives, heads of finance and also our own staff.  We look at topics on either spend or areas where people may have concerns within local authorities and then we would carry out a study on that area.<\/p> <p>  With regard to capital projects, they are frequently referred to in audit reports.  The types of issue that come up are overspends, projects being referred for conciliation and arbitration, and the legal cost of that either as a percentage of the project or as a stand-alone figure.  Capital projects are an area we examine.  Procurement regarding certain projects is mentioned in a number of audit reports.  We ask for feedback from the chief executives in terms of that.<\/p> <p>  We follow a very specific process with regard to fraud.  At the commencement of each audit we correspond with the chief executive and his management team on fraud.  We ask them to make us aware of any instances of fraud and then we look at that.  We have to consider the legality surrounding certain ongoing cases and what we can refer to in our audit report.  We do refer to issues of fraud in our audit report or we consider that they have impacted on either the running of the local authority and in terms of materiality as well.  We look at the procedures local authorities themselves have to make sure that if fraud has arisen, it has been referred to the Garda and it is being followed up.<\/p> <p>  We do correspond in terms of issues that have been raised by the public.  We follow a formal process if someone writes to us, but we have to consider that in terms of materiality.  All of our audit reports are published on our website, and if something is brought to the attention of an auditor and it turns out to be an issue, it will form part of the audit report.  Reports are freely accessible to all members of the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2017110900002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1510218000,"counter":1877,"content":"<p>The problem in this case is that we do not know when the audit will be finished.

Thereafter, general purpose grants evolved, more or less guided by the needs and resources model, but it was felt generally by the sector that it was extremely cumbersome to be monitoring 600 financial indicators every year to decide on their appropriateness.

I am joined by Deirdre Shanley, who is the principal officer with responsibility for employment programmes and is based in Carrick-on-Shannon, as well as Jim Lynch, who is divisional manager for the mid-west division and is based in Limerick.<\/p> <p>  Community employment, or CE as it is most commonly known, is the largest of the Department's range of programmes catering for long-term unemployed jobseekers and those most distant from the labour market.  The purpose of the programme is to break the cycle of unemployment, maintain work readiness and improve the opportunities of a participant to return to the labour market.  Employment programmes such as CE also support the delivery of vital services in local communities, something that has long been acknowledged by the Department and Government.<\/p> <p>  At the end of September, a little over 21,000 participants were on the programme and there were over 1,300 supervisors.  CE schemes provide part-time temporary work in local communities.  The schemes include opportunities for training and development as a stepping-stone to employment for people in receipt of a range of social welfare payments, including those on long-term jobseeker's payments.  It is important to recognise, however, that CE placements are not full-time sustainable jobs.<\/p> <p>  CE schemes are typically sponsored by groups, known as CE sponsors, wishing to benefit the local community.  These include voluntary and community organisations and, to a lesser extent, public bodies involved in not-for-profit activities.  Such programmes provide a valuable service to local communities while at the same time providing training and educational opportunities for jobseekers.<\/p> <p>  As members of the committee will be aware, participants work for an average of 19.5 hours per week.  The rate of payment is linked to the person's social welfare rate, with a minimum weekly rate of &euro;215.50.  Participants may receive extra allowances in respect of qualified adult and child dependants as well.<\/p> <p>  I will set out some statistics to put things into context.  While there was a 40% fall in the live register in the period from 2012 to 2017, over the same period CE participation has remained relatively constant.  The numbers on schemes in June 2012 were approximately the same as at the end of September 2017.  It is important to note that the number of people on CE schemes fluctuates on an ongoing basis as vacancies arise and are filled on schemes.  Given reducing numbers on the live register, which is the main target cohort for CE schemes, demand for places can vary as well.<\/p> <p>  As the economic recovery takes hold and the overall level of unemployment continues to fall, the Department recognises the need to adapt schemes to the changing circumstances, opportunities and needs of jobseekers and others.  With this mind, the Department undertook an analysis of the CE programme, and this was completed in late 2015.  Government approval was obtained to publish the review report in April 2017 and to implement the various changes recommended.<\/p><p>The review looked at community employment or CE, T&uacute;s, Gateway and the rural social scheme.  It was agreed by the Government that the overall number of scheme places available in 2017 will be 32,000.  CE will continue to be the largest programme this year, with 22,400 places available across schemes.  The balance will be made up of placements in the rural social scheme and T&uacute;s.<\/p><p> In general, the changes agreed by the Government broaden access to CE to a wider range of people and emphasise the importance of training and upskilling of participants.  In particular, members of the committee should note that: the qualifying age for CE places has been reduced from 25 to 21 years; all CE placements for new entrants aged between 21 and 55 years are for one year, and participants working towards a major award can seek to extend their participation by up to a further two years; those over 55 years of age can remain on CE for three consecutive years; and it is now easier for previous participants to re-enter CE as participation prior to 2007 is disregarded, and previously the year used was 2000.  In advance of the roll-out of the new measures, the Department consulted with key stakeholders across the country in May and June 2017.<\/p><p> With regard to CE participation for older people, the pilot initiative announced in December 2015 enables a percentage of those aged 62 years or over to participate on CE on a continuous basis up to State pension age.  This initiative is currently under review and we expect it to be finalised in the coming weeks.  In recent months, the Department has also begun rolling out a two-strand approach whereby CE placements are being categorised as activation or social inclusion.  This recognises that unemployed people get different types of work experience on CE.  Some placements are closer to the labour market in terms of the type of experience they provide, with an emphasis on certified and industry-recognised training.  These places offer good progression opportunities for participants to access jobs in the open labour market.  Other places are more geared towards people who are very distant from the labour market and represent a first or intermediate step back into employment.  As a consequence of this work, different progression targets will be set for the different placements.<\/p><p> Given the reduction in the live register and other activation options available, including JobPath, T&uacute;s and CE, there are increased opportunities available for welfare recipients.  The impact of an increasing number of people at work and the continued reduction in the live register are all factors in recruitment to work programmes.  It is important to point out, however, that the Department continues to refer candidates to CE schemes so any sponsors who have recruitment concerns should contact their local Intreo office.  If there is a lack of interest in a vacancy, schemes may be required to assess the quality of the vacancy offered.<\/p><p> In recent months, concerns have been expressed about the impact of JobPath on CE and how it operates.  The aim of the JobPath service is to assist jobseekers in finding sustainable full-time employment.  On the other hand, CE schemes, as I have outlined, provide part-time work experience and training opportunities in local communities as a stepping stone back to employment for those on long-term unemployment payments.  Jobseekers who are already participating with the JobPath service will not be referred to CE schemes as they can only participate with one activation scheme or service at a time.  However, customers who on the date of their referral to JobPath have a written offer, with a start date within four weeks, for CE will be facilitated to take up the placement.  In recent months, those jobseekers that have completed their 52 week engagement with JobPath without finding suitable and sustainable employment are being referred back to their Intreo centres for an assessment by a departmental case officer.  They may then apply for other activation supports, such as CE, thus ensuring ongoing availability for CE schemes.<\/p><p> Over the years, CE has developed into a unique programme that integrates employment interventions and training for the individual with community service provision.  It is an important resource for communities to identify their own needs and provide vital community services in both urban and rural areas.  Both the Government and the Department remain committed to the programme and the work it is doing.  My colleagues and I are happy to discuss any issues raised by members of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017110900002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathleen Stack","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510224000,"counter":1917,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Stack for her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017110900002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1510224000,"counter":1918,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for the presentation.  A few matters have occurred to me arising from that opening statement.  It is interesting there are still the same number of participants on CE schemes as there was when the unemployment rate was much higher.  I presume that is because the schemes have been adapted and rules have been changed to accommodate more people.  Is that the explanation or only a partial explanation?<\/p> <p>  Community employment schemes are very popular and do tremendous work.  There is no doubt about that and there is big demand for them.  I wish, in responding to my constituents, I could establish many more in Limerick because of the big demand.  One of the objections always being made about community employment schemes is a lack of training.  The witnesses made the point in the statement that they are rolling out a new initiative, with one stream focused on training and the other focusing on giving people the habit of getting back to work, which is what community employment schemes do now.  Will they provide more details and has this been rolled out on a pilot basis?  When did that start and how extensive is it?  I note changes made relating to people who are over 62.  That was rolled out on a pilot basis and it is also under review.  Has there been any decision on that?  It seems to have worked well and many people, in my experience, took it up.  They were delighted they were able to continue with it.  What is the updated position on that?<\/p> <p>  Representations have been made to me and, I am sure, to others as well about the problem concerning the interaction between JobPath and the community employment schemes.  For example, people have said they are looking for personnel to fill a community employment scheme but they cannot get participants.  There are people who could potentially participate but they cannot because they have signed up to JobPath.  The witnesses indicate this is because jobseekers are already participating with the JobPath service.  It is fine if one is participating but if one is simply sitting around, waiting to be called for a job and doing nothing else, I would not describe it is participation.  That person might be signed up but is not actively participating.  This has been raised a number of times in the D&aacute;il but I do not understand the logic of a position where, in some parts of the country at least, community employment schemes are crying out for members and people are available to serve and make them a reality but they are being stopped from participating for a year because they have signed up to JobPath.  The JobPath scheme might not have succeeded in providing any employment for them.  I do not understand the logic and I need something more detailed to get my head around it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017110900002#C00300","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510224000,"counter":1919,"content":"<p>It was a range of questions and we will take them between us if that is okay.  On the question about people over 62, we have reviewed the scheme and it is with the Minister currently.  She is giving it thought and we met her yesterday.  I would expect some outcome on that fairly soon.  We certainly hope it will continue as it has proven worthwhile.  We will have an outcome on that fairly soon.<\/p> <p>  JobPath is the Government activation service and approximately 130,000 people have been referred to it.  It is a two-phase process, so in the first year JobPath providers work with the unemployed person, helping them to try to get a job, and at the end of the 12 months one sees where one is at.  There is a second phase where the JobPath provider continues to work with the person if he or she gets a job and supports the person in employment.  Having said that, there are 30,000 people who have come back from JobPath in recent months and completed the first year.  I mentioned that in the opening statement.  We are certainly targeting those in filling community employment vacancies.  They are a cohort we look at.  When somebody leaves JobPath, there is an exit plan that can highlight particular difficulties, such as the need for further training or other matters.  We are trying to match JobPath returnees with CE vacancies.  I will let Ms Shanley speak to the training, which is very much part of the activation process.  It relates to areas such as child care and social care, where there is recognised and industry-level training that improves a person's chances of employment in the open labour market.<\/p> <p>  We have probably done well to have kept number of participants where they are in light of a declining live register.  If they are the same now as they were five years ago, it is positive and it should be recognised that we did well in that regard.  We have approximately 20% of the long-term unemployed - those unemployed for more than 12 months - on community employment schemes.<\/p><p>Five years ago it was at about 11% and so it has worked.  As I mentioned in my opening statement the changes only kicked in from July and we are still working through them.  They are certainly helping in increasing the pool of people available for CE places.<\/p><p> I will ask Ms Shanley to talk about training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017110900002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathleen Stack","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510224000,"counter":1921,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Dea asked about the training on community employment, which is a very valuable aspect of the overall programme.  Last year about &euro;6 million was spent on procured training on community employment.  However, that really understates the value of training received because many community employment participants receive free training from the ETBs in their local areas.<\/p> <p>  The training is available to both strands of activation and social inclusion.  Someone in a place that is deemed to be social inclusion can still avail of the training.  We encourage all participants on community employment to engage in training and progress irrespective of the strand they are in.  The activation strands may be more focused on the QQI framework and training that leads to qualifications in FETAC or HETAC awards, whereas some of the social-inclusion-type training may be more industry related or to do with health and safety, but still very valuable to the participants who receive it.  On average in any year about 20,000 FETAC or HETAC components or awards are achieved by participants in community employment.  Some participants might do one or two modules of a HETAC or FETAC course, but in addition there are a substantial number of components outside the NFQ.  Almost 22,000 in 2015 were related to health and safety, manual handling, etc.  All participants on community employment receive some level of training.  All of it is very valuable in their outcomes and progression.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned it is available to both the activation and social inclusion strands, but the people pursuing the activation-type roles would engage in more QQI modules or achieving actual full awards, maybe a major award at level 5 in child care or level 6.<\/p> <p>  The over-62 pilot is still available to people who are over 62 even though it is under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017110900002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Shanley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510224000,"counter":1922,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. Lynch to outline what is happening on the ground with the JobPath returners and how we are trying to link those in with community employment vacancies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017110900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathleen Stack"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510224000,"counter":1923,"content":"<p>It is a very strong focus for us at present.  We are trying to ensure that there is an available intervention for people coming back from JobPath, the JobPath returners as we term them.  The interventions we see as most suitable would be T&uacute;s and CE.  We find that they often come back very enthusiastic about undergoing training because the year on JobPath, while it might not have yielded them a job, has given them a certain motivation.  They are coming back to us probably more motivated from the point of view of trying to access something.<\/p> <p>  Our case officers work strongly with sponsors.  We organise job fairs from time to time to try to get people back into community employment.  I know Deputy Carey has just left us.  We did one in Tulla the other day where we called in 140 people who might be eligible for CE.  We had the sponsors in the same room as them and had our community officers selling the CE as a programme.  We are engaging with people on a local level.  If committee members have any problems in their particular areas, they should engage with the community development officers and the Intreo area managers to see if they can do something for them in the area because it is useful.<\/p> <p>  We have also done one in Newcastle West, County Limerick, and have done one in Limerick as part of our recent jobs week.  We found it very useful.  It also provides a network for the sponsors to talk to each other and provides interaction between our CDOs and our sponsors so that we can see the real issues on the ground.  There is that informal piece that works behind the scenes from the point of view of targeting people.  We find it works quite well.  If there is anything committee members want us to do on an individual level in any particular division, they should come back to us and contact the area managers or division managers.  We will be more than happy to engage with committee members if there are particular problems.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Dea will be very familiar with that corridor up around areas such as Killaloe and Ogonnelloe, a very prosperous area, and O'Briensbridge.  We have particular problems trying to fill those because there is a local issue of being close to a good labour market in Limerick.  There is a job available for anyone who is employable and many of them are taking those jobs.  It is a positive sign in that they are not looking for CE because they are taking a regular nine-to-five job.  We have other problems in west Clare, rural Limerick and some of the other areas where transport would be an issue for people getting to the labour market.  We find CE fills a very useful function there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017110900002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1510224000,"counter":1924,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending.  Community employment is certainly a scheme that works and rarely gives rise to complaints.  The biggest complaint I get is the difficulties in accessing it, particularly in relation to JobPath.  It does Trojan work in communities the length and breadth of the State.  It throws open many challenges for the State.  People on CE schemes are doing work that should be full-time employment offered by local authorities and other agencies across the State.  Certainly it is a scheme that works.<\/p> <p>  However, it is not without its challenges from the point of view of supervisors and potential participants.  Ms Stack's opening statement indicates that the reduction in unemployment levels is obviously a challenge.  She also referred to other schemes such as JobPath.  Having nearly 130,000 long-term unemployed - I would question as to whether some of them are long-term unemployed in the first place - referred to JobPath must have huge repercussions on CE schemes.  Certainly CE supervisors are telling me that people are locked into JobPath for a 12-month contract and cannot transfer over, which is a serious problem.<\/p> <p>  Ms Stack referred to the 30,000 JobPath returnees, many of whom have a huge appetite to access training.  What kind of vetting process is carried out at the first stage in the Intreo offices when referrals are being made to JobPath?  What is the best route for those jobseekers to take?  Is it JobPath or should it be on to CE?  I hear many stories from JobPath participants spending 12 months locked into a contract with no proper training provided with people often put sitting in front of a computer week-in week-out told to go find themselves a job.  That is the height of the training and is a huge problem.  I ask the witnesses to give their views on that.<\/p> <p>  Ms Stack said that the same number of people on CE schemes is the same as it was in 2012.  She said that 22,400 places would be available this year.  That is the limit and there is another figure of 21,000.

I think everybody agrees that community employment does a great deal of work around the country.  It sustains a significant amount of community and voluntary work across Ireland.  It has to be protected and we are all very keen to ensure that happens.  We recognise that there have been difficulties in filling vacancies in recent times.  Many changes were introduced in July to broaden the pool of people who can get called.  Age limits were reduced, for example.<\/p> <p>  I understand the Deputy's criticisms of JobPath.  I am not here to defend it.  I suppose I would I say I do not agree with him.  I suggest one has to differentiate between the aim of JobPath, which is to create sustainable full-time jobs, and the aim of community employment, which is to create temporary part-time jobs.  At a time when the number of job vacancies in our economy is increasing all the time, our focus should be on sustainable full-time employment.  We need to be clear about that.  My colleague, Mr. Lynch, will talk about how the JobPath vetting process works.<\/p> <p>  The Government-approved upper limit for community employment is 22,400.  The figure for all the schemes is 32,000.  We are working towards the 22,400 target.  I would prefer to be in the position of trying to work towards the target than trying to work back from it.  As I said to Deputy O'Dea, it is positive that we have managed to maintain the numbers roughly at the level they were five years ago, especially in light of all the changes that have taken place in the economy in the meantime.<\/p> <p>  The pensions issue has been ongoing for quite a while.  As the Deputy is probably aware, a high-level group chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has been doing a great deal of work in this space.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is represented on it, as are a number of unions.  I understand that the next meeting of the group will take place on 23 November.  My understanding is that some decisions are likely to be made at that point.  It is not within our remit to say \"Yes\" or \"No\" on this issue.

The Deputy probably has a good degree of knowledge of the Intreo service.  I will go back a level.  When people come to us to sign on in the first instance, they are probably at a very vulnerable time in their lives.  We sign them on and try to process their payments as quickly as possible.  The first interaction that such a person has with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is with a departmental case officer.  Most of those who are selected for JobPath will have gone through a process that involved a year-long intervention with a case officer.  As part of the Intreo process, the case officer initially agrees a personal progression plan with the person in question based on what he or she wants out of life or for the future.<\/p> <p>  The first year is geared towards achieving what is in the personal progression plan.  This could include participation in the back to work enterprise allowance scheme or the back to education allowance scheme.  A person who falls into such an activation stream will not be selected for a Job Path referral because he or she will be in a longer-term process.  Equally, we can refer people to the local employment service.  If someone is with the local employment service, he or she is not available to be called for JobPath.  It is only after someone has been interacting with a case officer for 12, 15 or 18 months that he or she is selected for a JobPath referral.  At this point, the person in question becomes eligible for selection for JobPath, which is done purely on a random basis.  We do not have any control over whether somebody should be referred.  Participants are selected on a random basis.  After they have been with the JobPath provider for a year or a year and a quarter, they come back to us as part of our activation process.  At that point, they can be referred to something like community employment or T&uacute;s.<\/p> <p>  We all hear criticisms of JobPath from time to time, but we never hear about the positive outcomes for the people who were helped by JobPath and got jobs as a result.  There have been criticisms of the training that people receive from JobPath providers.  As Ms Stack has said, we administer the scheme but we are not the JobPath providers.  The training that is delivered is sometimes of a different type from the training we are historically used to.  Much of it would be interactive and might involve electronic training.  It is possible that some jobseekers are not used to such initiatives or approaches.  We have to get used to these changing processes.  Our experience of JobPath on the ground has been that people come back to us with a clearer focus on what they want to do.  They are often focused on community employment.  As Deputy Brady and others will appreciate, when people come to us they are sometimes looking for motivation to get out of the bed in the morning.  It is good that they want to have something to do.

I have been around long enough to have seen community employment in different Departments and in different guises.  The community employment scheme has always managed to evolve somewhat to meet the situation of the day.  It has been around in times of virtually full employment and at times of exceptionally high unemployment.<\/p> <p>  Ms Stack hit the nail on the head in her opening statement when she referred to the value of the scheme to communities as well as the training and education to the individual participants.  The feedback I am getting at present is that it is becoming more challenging for the community groups than for the participants.  A couple of issues come to mind.  For groups that might be relatively small, a significant change of personnel arises when the existing participants come to the end of their period on the scheme.  This means there is no shared learning or shared experience of being on the job and this gives rise to concerns when there are no immediate replacements.  As we are now reaching the point of higher employment levels, there needs to be greater flexibility to ensure that the perspective of the operators of the schemes are considered.  They could have a period of a month when they are missing one or two participants because they cannot recruit, and that needs to be examined.<\/p> <p>  Ms Stack specifically stated that the contracts are for a period of one year, except in the case where people are doing major awards, where it can be two or three years.  I would like Ms Stack to examine a different element, in particular in areas of significant economic disadvantage.  I think people from most disadvantaged areas who get on those schemes need more than one year.  In many cases, many families in the community have experienced intergenerational unemployment.  The level of support they need is probably greater.  Having broken the cycle to get on a scheme, a year may not be long enough and in the course of the first year they may not have entered an educational scheme where they are going for a major award.  It may take them longer to make that level of progression, but ultimately they might enter the education system.  In areas of significant levels of economic disadvantage, where employment prospects in their geographic vicinity are not that good, we need to look at the adequacy of the scheme to meet their needs.  I specifically ask Ms Stack to consider a longer run-in without the educational requirement being upfront because in many cases they will not have the capacity to meet the educational requirement in the initial stages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017110900002#F01400","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510224000,"counter":1964,"content":"<p>The point has been made that, by their whole nature, community employment schemes evolve.  At the end of my opening statement I said that community employment is a unique scheme.  It is peculiar in the sense that one could argue that the motivation for the sponsors is different from the motivation for the individuals and sometimes that is a marriage that might be hard to sustain.  What the community group and the sponsor are trying to do is to deliver a service to the best of their ability and at a satisfactory level, and they are trying to keep people as long as they can to keep the service on the go.  The perspective of an activation authority such as the Department is to try to train up the individual and move them on in order that they can progress to a job.  There are almost competing aims and objectives in the scheme.  That said, we all acknowledge the significant role that community employment plays in a range of areas throughout the country, for example, from the local GAA pitch, child care, social care and elderly care.  It is a challenge.  We have long debated in the Department the appropriate length of time to remain on a scheme, be it one, two or three years.  What we came up with reflects a lot of what the OECD and other bodies would say, that programmes such as community employment have a major role to play when there is a downturn in the economy and a recession, but that these numbers should be reduced and the period that people stay on them should be a lot shorter when the economy is getting better.  We arrived at a duration of one year as being the best balance we could get in terms of what we are about.  We have a facility to extend it to two or three years, and my colleague, Ms Shanley, will say a little bit more about that.<\/p> <p>  I accept the Chairman's point on areas of significant disadvantage, and we can have a look at that.  It is coming back to segregation.  The people involved in activation are closer to the labour market and are able to progress that little bit faster, whereas people in the social inclusion area take a bit longer.  They are probably out of the school and training system for a longer period and it can take them longer.  I take on board the Deputy's point on that issue.  We try, in so far as we can, to fill vacancies on community employment schemes and to provide replacements as quickly as possible.  However, our capacity to do so is determined by who is on the live register in a local area.  For example, places on a child care scheme tend by their nature to appeal to younger people.  If those on the live register are all aged 50 or over, they may not be that interested.  Sometimes it is a case of the supply not matching the demand.  That has to be managed in a local area.  My colleague, Ms Shanley, will comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017110900002#F01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathleen Stack"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510224000,"counter":1965,"content":"<p>I will pick up on Ms Stack's final comment.  In the context of some of the vacancies being filled, the local community development officers would work with the scheme when the person leaving has a particular skill set and a period of overlap is needed to train in the new person.  I know divisions are very flexible around that and try to accommodate a few weeks of overlap at the end of a person's contract.<\/p><p> With respect to the length of time somebody can stay on a scheme, we have opened it up for participants from 21 years of age.  For participants aged between 21 and 55, the standard duration will be one year.  For participants aged over 55, they can stay on it for three years.  For participants aged over 65, there is no obligation to engage in training or education to stay on it for three years.  For those participants aged between 21 and 55, we will extend them into a second or third year if they are pursuing education or training leading towards a major award, but that may be a module at level 3, which is a very basic level of education, and it could be just one module in the first year.  The aim is to encourage people at that age who have education or training needs to get onto that ladder.<\/p><p> If somebody comes along with literacy or numeracy difficulties and cannot access education or training, we will also extend those people into a second or third year provided they are doing something that is recognised that will address their literacy difficulties.  They do not need to be pursuing a Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, level 5 course, because that is not accessible to everybody, to be extended into the second year.  We require that they would be on a suitable pathway for their level to address their training or education needs.  If they have a very low level of education and no formal qualifications, they may pursue a basic learning module at level 3.  That is recognised and, in those circumstances, people can be extended into a second or a third year.  This is all to guide them towards coming out at the end their period on the scheme with some training or education that will help them access employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017110900002#F01600","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Shanley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510224000,"counter":1967,"content":"<p>Are there any other questions?

I take on board what was said about the process of the year lead-up to that.  Many people have called to my constituency offices, and the same applies to other Deputies, who have told me they want to participate on community employment schemes.  They have identified that themselves, whether it be to get a QQI qualification or to work within their community, to have those supports around them or to have direct involvement in the workplace.  JobPath does not provide that for people.  It does not give people the opportunity to do that.  People know their own deficits and what they would like to do.  However, the difficulty is, and this has been said to me by personal advisers within JobPath, that the referral of people to JobPath is not necessarily a random selection process.  How exactly does that process work?  I am told it is nearly a form of punishment.  People are being referred to JobPath and told that no other options are being made available to them.  I would like one of the witnesses to answer in that respect.  People are then locked into that process for 12 months, knowing that they will not get the education or training they have identified that they need.  We have seen that with 30,000 people coming through that process and many of them wanting to participate on community employment schemes.  That is the crux of the problem.  People are being forced to go on JobPath.  I would question that it is voluntary, and that is one of the difficulties.  Once people are referred to it, the big push is to get them to sign the contract on the dotted line.  There is pressure not to let the person out until he or she signs the contract, and then they are locked into that for 12 months with no opportunities available to them.  As one of the Deputies said, they are on JobPath for 12 months and they do not have the opportunity after one or two months to move to a community employment scheme or some other scheme that would be more beneficial to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017110900002#G00500","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510224000,"counter":1971,"content":"<p>It is definitely not a form of penalty.

Those selected come through the computerised process.  We have a very clear and transparent process, but it is a random computerised process, if that makes sense.<\/p> <p>  There are may benefits from JobPath from the point of view, as Ms Stack said, of the number of people who can get work after it.  As I said, the JobPath provider or adviser forms a process of where the person will be at the end of the year.  Sometimes the person gets there after three months, six months or nine months, and when they get to the end of the process, the best outcome for the person might be to go to a community employment scheme but it might have been that the journey involved the six or nine months it took to get there.<\/p> <p>  It could be argued that somebody should be able voluntarily to come off JobPath if he or she wants to do so, but there is a significant investment from the JobPath provider and in the training and the engaging process.  To give that process the best opportunity to work , we would say that it requires a person to be in the process for a year.  The Deputy and I would probably differ on that point.  I think I have covered all the aspects raised.  I want to be definite on this point.  It is a random computerised selection at the end of the week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017110900002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Lynch"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510224000,"counter":1972,"content":"<p>I would add that this is about trying to get somebody a full-time, sustainable job.

As members are aware, an allocation of &euro;19.85 billion was provided for the Department this year.  It represents 37% of gross current expenditure.  Our expenditure to the end of September was &euro;14.8 billion, which was very close to target for the year to that date.  <\/p> <p>  Each week approximately 1.35 million people - pensioners, people with disabilities, people on maternity leave or sick leave, carers and jobseekers - receive a payment from the Department.  In addition, more than 626,000 families receive child benefit each month for almost 1.2 million children.  What is significant about the figures is not just their scale but what they represent, with which I know we all concur, namely, a social contract whereby the State, on behalf of citizens, provides support for those citizens who for whatever reason or whatever short or long period of their lives cannot provide for themselves.<\/p><p> In a statement in the D&aacute;il on 15 June this year the Taoiseach announced that labour affairs and labour law responsibilities would transfer from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  At a national level, the following employment policy and legislative functions have transferred to my Department: employment rights policy and legislation; the Low Pay Commission and legislation relating to the national minimum wage and related areas.  At European Union and international level, the following employment policy functions are now the responsibility of the Department.  We are taking a lead role in co-ordination at the Employment, Social Policy and Health and Consumer Affairs Council, affectionately known as EPSCO.  There is the employment committee, also known as EMCO, while we are responsible for the EU Semester process.  We are also responsible for the response and input into the EU pillar on social rights which we hope to sign in Gothenburg next week.  We are responsible for engagement with Eurofound and the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, as well as the Council of Europe in the co-ordination of responses on the Social Charter.<\/p><p> The details of the employment legislation that was transferred to my Department following the Government's decision are set out in the Labour Affairs and Labour Law (Transfer of Department Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order 2017, SI 361\/ 2017.  The transfer of functions involved 11 separate pieces of primary legislation in the area of labour affairs and labour law.  The Department also changed its name to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to reflect these new responsibilities.  <\/p><p> In the context of an overall spend of almost &euro;20 billion, the transfer of funding associated with these new functions amounts to just over &euro;1.5 million.  The transfer takes place on a cost-neutral basis.  The Further Revised Estimate for 2017 for my Department has risen by &euro;1.55 million, but there has been a corresponding decrease in the Estimates for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p><p> The amount of funding transferred appears quite small in terms of the overall Estimate, but the rationale for the transfer is very important.  The transfer of the functions to the Department reflects the close links between the welfare and activation remit of the Department and the operation of the labour market.  As members of the committee will be aware, the conditions for receipt of in-work income supports, unemployment benefits, illness and disability payments, as well as pensions and support payments, both reflect and influence how the labour market operates.  Bringing responsibility for employment affairs and social protection under one Minister recognises this reality and will help to ensure, for example, that developments in respect of minimum wage pay rates, working hours and illness absences within the workplace will be co-ordinated with the relevant State supports from the Department.  This is a new challenge for the Department and I look forward to leading on it in the months ahead.  I am pleased to say 13 new colleagues from the former Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation joined us last month.  I welcome them to a large Department which has more than 7,000 staff.<\/p><p> In the immediate term our priority is to publish the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which is being drafted.  The committee is aware that the Bill is in response to a commitment in the programme for Government to tackle the problems caused by the increased casualisation of work and particularly to strengthen the regulations pertaining to precarious employment.  The proposals contained in the Bill are the result of extensive consultations, including public consultations following the University of Limerick study of zero-hour and low-hour contracts, in addition to detailed dialogue with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and IBEC for several months.  As I stated, I have met representatives of these organisations to hear first-hand their concerns about the ideas we all share.<\/p><p> The Bill aims to address a number of elements that have been identified by many parties in the Houses where current employment rights legislation can and must be strengthened to the benefit of employees, particularly low paid and more vulnerable employees, without imposing unnecessarily onerous burdens on employers and businesses.  They include ensuring employees will be better informed about the nature of their employment contract and arrangements and particularly the core terms at a very early stage of employment.  There is also the strengthening of provisions on minimum payments to low paid and vulnerable workers who may be called to work for a period but not provided with any work.  The Bill will also prohibit zero-hour contracts in most circumstances, ensuring workers on low hour contracts will consistently work more hours each week than is provided for in the contract of employment.  They will be entitled to be placed in a band of hours which better reflects the reality of their working hours over an extended period.  The legislation will strengthen the anti-victimisation provisions for employers who try to invoke their rights under the new proposals.  The drafting of the Bill is at a very advanced stage.  As I stated, it is my intention to publish the Bill before the end of the year, subject to Cabinet approval.<\/p><p> As I mentioned, the further revision of the Estimate is very small in the context of a very large budget.  However, expanding the remit of the Department to include employment rights, the Low Pay Commission and labour affairs makes absolute sense.  I look forward to working with the committee, the remit of which will also be extended to cover the same topics in the coming months and years.  We will work constructively on legislation and to improve employment rights in the labour force and the Irish market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017110900002#A00900","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510219800,"counter":1991,"content":"<p>Before calling Deputy Willie O'Dea, I have a general question.

She has spoken about employment rights, the Low Pay Commission, legislation relating to the national minimum wage and EU and international functions.  She has also mentioned proposed legislation.  I am conscious that, on the social protection side, the Department has a budget Bill to draft, with the social welfare and pensions Bill.  In all seriousness, in looking at the additional workload arising from the legislative and international and EU elements, is the transfer of 13 staff appropriate to deal with the new work to be done?  As the Minister set it out, it seems extensive.  The three key pieces of legislation include the Bill that has proceeded through Second Stage, the social welfare Bill and the employment Bill which was referred to by the Minister.  Will she give us an idea of the timelines for those pieces of legislation?  It would be useful for the committee to know what they are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017110900002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1510219800,"counter":1992,"content":"<p>It may be surprising, but it is testament to the 13 people concerned that every person involved with employment rights policy and legislation, the Low Pay Commission and the legislation relating to the national minimum wage was transferred.

The group was entirely responsible for this body of work and the 13 have moved to the new Department where they will continue to provide the excellent service they have always provided.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to discount the work being done, but there is the matter of how it has an impact on all other sections in the Department.  It is about working collaboratively with schemes to ensure conditions and activities will be reflected in all elements.  That is how we hope to improve as a 7,000-strong Department, as opposed to just relying on the wisdom of the 13 people concerned who were completely responsible in their previous Department.  All of the other roles I have mentioned at EU or international level, including the EPSCO, the EMCO and Eurofound, were always the responsibility of staff in my Department.  It is about ensuring we marry what we are learning and committing to at European level with the European social pillar that will be signed next week in Gothenburg and reflect the schemes we have in place, with the supports and services we provide for Irish people.  This is in order that we will enshrine EU ambitions with Irish ambitions and European labour law rights with Irish labour law rights.

It is important that we will have sight of those amendments for a reasonable period before we come here to discuss them.  This is a complex issue and we have had many representations about the amendments.<\/p> <p>  The Estimate before the committee is minor in the greater scheme of things when one is talking about almost &euro;20 billion in expenditure.  Some &euro;1.5 million going from one Department to another does not seem significant in money terms.  I have no objection to the transfer.  It is a good idea to transfer those responsibilities to the Department with responsibility for social protection.  I had a couple of general questions on the figures that we received which accompanied the proposal.  I notice that in 2016, the total expenditure on social protection was &euro;19.84 billion.  In 2017, it was &euro;19.854 billion.  There is a &euro;14 million increase.  There have obviously been savings which are being spent in other areas, etc., but the overall increase is approximately &euro;14 million.  We welcome the improvements announced to social welfare in the budget.<\/p> <p>  In the output section of the document circulated to us, the processing time for non-contributory old age pensions and disability allowance is only approximately 75% of the target.  What steps does the Minister propose to take to expedite that?  People in those circumstances, looking for disability allowance and the non-contributory old age pension cannot wait for too long to have their claims processed.<\/p> <p>  The Minister might not have this information but I would appreciate if she could get it for me.  I notice the figure for partial capacity benefit is &euro;14 million.  It seems low.  How does the partial capacity benefit regime compare with the old regime whereby one could work for a number of hours?  What is the expenditure on that?  If the Minister does not have that information, she might get it for me.  I am intrigued by the figure for control savings.  It is &euro;510 million in 2016 and &euro;510 million in 2017.  Will the Minister elaborate on that and indicate how effective the anti-fraud campaign, for want of a better phrase, has been in achieving the objectives stated by the then Minister, Deputy Varadkar?  There are three issues at the bottom of page 37 relating to the proposed output for 2017.  One is to prepare a paper on the total contributions approach for State pension qualifications.  What stage is that paper at with regard to its publication?  How much work has been done on the total contributions system?  The other proposal is to develop proposals for activation for new jobseekers and to review the operation and performance of the local employment service providers.  Will the Minister comment on where we are with those objectives?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017110900002#C00700","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1510219800,"counter":2005,"content":"<p>The Deputy's first question was on the difference between budgets from different years.  While it is only a small amount, &euro;14 million, one would have to reflect on the huge savings that the Department has thankfully made because we have 200,000 people now working who were, for the last years, reliant on a weekly payment from the State.  That is a significant amount of money and it has been reinvested to improve the lives of thousands of other people by increasing their weekly payments, albeit by a very small amount, by improving our making-work-pay structures, by increasing family income supplement, FIS, the thresholds of qualified child increase, QCI, and the thresholds for lone parents and their ability to make more money on a weekly basis.  We have saved money by the huge reduction on the live register and people will note that we have ambitions to reduce it significantly again this year.  All of that money gets reinvested and I am hopeful that we would get more money to have a debate on next year to figure out what we are going to do and how we can best spend it.  There has been significant reinvestment in other areas of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection because of the reductions in the live register.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked me a question about non-contributory payments.  We have an ambition in the Department that all systems and schemes should have a 12-week turnaround.  On appeal, some of those have delays because they are very complex and also because some people tend to hold back information from an original application until they get to appeal which does not help the turnaround times at all.  We have an ambition to try to turn around applications for all schemes within 12 weeks.  We suffer peaks and troughs for different schemes.  The two schemes that are experiencing longer delays at the moment are domiciliary care allowance, DCA, and our non-contributory pension applications because there has been a huge increase in those applications.  I am not sure why.  One reflection on the DCA is that the medical card came on stream this year and more people became aware of its value.  There is not a real reason why there should be a huge increase in non-contributory applications but there is.  Staff are reflecting on it and we are well aware that, in certain instances, we retrain staff from other Departments and move them.  There is nobody in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection without a workload.  We are trying to be responsible and reflective on where we have peaks and troughs.  I am aware of it and we are consciously and actively monitoring and looking at it.  We want to hit that 12-week target for all our payments.<\/p> <p>  I will address the Deputy's last question before I go back to partial capacity.  The targets for anti-fraud measures are in and around the same every year.  We do not get more or less ambitious to try to capture money that is being directed at schemes or people that should not necessarily be in receipt of it.  Our ambition is to capture in and around that amount of money every single year.  To answer the Deputy's question about last year's anti-fraud campaign, I will not entirely be in a position to be able to reflect on it until around the middle of next year.<\/p><p>That is because it takes 12 to 18 months to take a referral, assess it, carry out an inspection, chase the information and if there is untoward behaviour taking place, bring forward charges and close the matter off.  The ratio is that nearly half of reports received in the Department are substantiated and result in an overpayment being stopped and-or a summons, fine or, much worse, prosecution in court.  This year's anti-fraud campaign trebled the number of reports.  I am hopeful that, next year, I will be able to sit here with the committee, notwithstanding everyone's views about it or whether they like the method, and say \"It worked and it gave us more\".  I will not be able to do that until next year and it may be that others will be proven right and I will be proven wrong.  However, we will see when we have that conversation next year.  Our ambition continues to be to stop people receiving payments they should not get in order that we can direct the money involved to people who should get it.  That is not going to change.<\/p><p> I turn to partial capacity.  There are no changes to the scheme itself.  I was not 100% sure of that but it has just been confirmed to me.

I misunderstood.  The new scheme was introduced in 2012 and it is probably more effective than what was there because it is much more flexible.  It responds to participants' needs.  The old system was probably a bit more clunky, although that is probably not the best word to describe it.  The previous scheme was not as flexible as the new partial capacity system and it was changed to reflect directly the experience of the people using it.  In the main, they are very happy with it but that is not to say we will not reflect in future on whether there are other changes to be made.  As the Deputy and I are aware, schemes may need tweaks or small changes and we are always willing to have a look at them and reflect.<\/p> <p>  I hope to be able to publish, for public consultation, the report on total contributions soon.  It is very nearly ready and I expect to bring it to Cabinet within the next two weeks.  Once it is approved by Cabinet, the members of the committee will be the first to get it.  It will be an extensive public consultation.  As I said in the House yesterday, every new change and every new system creates winners and losers.  There will be people who have an expectation of receiving a full or nearly full pension under the new total contributions model who may not do so, while there are others who are in receipt of less than they feel they should be who will get more.  There will be an extensive public consultation process once that paper is published in the next couple of weeks and it will go on for at least three to six months.  I hope there will be extensive hearings at this committee.  I will value very much any help the committee can provide to make public the contents of the document and to bring about as fulsome a response to it - both from those who support it and those who want to point out its warts - as possible.  It is about having a full conversation and that will start in the next couple of weeks.<\/p> <p>  The difference between the scheme we have planned for those under 25 and other schemes we have launched is that it will be entirely co-operative.

We will work with industry and young people who want to work in jobs which give them training, the opportunity to expand their skills, an educational base and the work experience they definitely need where they are longer-term unemployed to address the challenges they face.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017110900002#D00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1510219800,"counter":2009,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to introduce the scheme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017110900002#D00400","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1510219800,"counter":2010,"content":"<p>We will launch in quarter 2 of 2018.

Where has the figure come from?  It is a matter of concern.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said she hopes to bring forward the employment (miscellaneous provisions) Bill before Christmas and to start the legislative process.  Deputy Joan Collins referred to a Bill which my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, brought forward and which went through a rigorous procedure before the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, as it was then known.  Unfortunately, that Bill is now parked and waiting on a money message.  In her response to Deputy Joan Collins, the Minister said she would do everything she could to ensure that Opposition legislation is advanced.  It seems, however, that many Opposition Bills are on the shelf waiting for money messages.  If the Minister is sincere in what she says, I ask her to use her office to help to progress Opposition legislation because Deputy Cullinane's Bill will deal with the zero-hour and banded hours contracts she talks about in the context of her legislation.  Said Bill has gone through a rigorous procedure in committee.  It received cross-party support at the joint committee and numerous amendments were recommended which will enhance and strengthen the Bill.  There was input from all of the trade unions as well as from legal experts and all of that has been taken on board.  As such, I ask the Minister to look at the Bill and to advance it.<\/p> <p>  I am a little bit confused about the Minister's Bill.  In the first instance, she says it is about protecting low-paid and vulnerable employees and, in the next, she says it aims to prohibit zero-hour contracts in most circumstances.  Can she explain what the term \"most circumstances\" means in that context?  If she is only intending to ban zero-hour contracts in most circumstances, she is not banning them.  The problem will still be there.  To ban them for some employees but not others makes no sense.  The heads of the Bill state that it will ban zero-hour contracts yet it creates exemptions if work is of a casual nature.  The Minister will be well aware that zero-hour contracts are casual.  That is the problem.<\/p><p>The Minister would be well aware that zero-hour contracts are casual.  That is the essence of the problem.  Can the Minister explain that because it does not make sense to me?<\/p><p> I asked the Minister about head 8 of the Bill when she was here previously and she was not able to answer.  Head 8 proposes that an employee can seek redress from the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  Would I be right in saying that is within the Labour Court?  That head will make it an offence for an employer to ignore the Labour Court's ruling.  I presume I am right about that.

She could not or would not answer when it put it to her previously.<\/p> <p>  There was a news story yesterday about a Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, which he acknowledged.

There are 17,000 new contributory pensioners every year.  Some of those will be affected by their longevity, working out the averaging of their total contributions over those years.  The initial figure of 36,000 was probably at the end of last year.  This year, we will probably have an extra 6,000 and another 5,000 or 6,000 next year.  Until we fix this, more women and men who are averaging their total contributions over a 40 or 35-year period will be at a disadvantage in the context of the changes made in 2012.  I repeat what I said yesterday - the report will be ready to go to Cabinet by next Tuesday.  The officials have done Trojan work on it in the past couple of weeks.  It is difficult to get the details.  I cannot overemphasise that enough.  Staff are dealing with paper records and it is a manual job.  That report will give us solutions in respect of this issue in order that we will not be here next year discussing the fact that another 7,500 people have been disadvantaged.  We will fix the situation in the coming weeks or months.  I gave that guarantee yesterday.  In case the Deputy thinks there is some conspiracy on the part of the Department to hold back in respect of this matter, people qualify for contributory and non-contributory pensions every day.  The number of people getting less than they expected to get in the form of a pension on the basis of their contributions being averaged over a long period will continue to grow until we fix the situation.  We will fix it.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's second question was about the Opposition Bill.  Much as I am delighted to have been elevated to Cabinet in recent months, I know my place and I have neither the ability nor the authority to issue money messages.  I do have a view, as I have said many times, that nobody in this House has a monopoly on wisdom.  Opposition legislation can be as good and as robust as, and perhaps sometimes better than, that produced by Government.  I have never been of the view that just because a Bill comes from the Opposition we should vote it down for the sake of it.  I have always thought that we should have longer debates than we have had in the past 18 months.<\/p> <p>  There is a difficulty with Opposition legislation between Second Stage and Committee Stage.  There are approximately 230 Bills in that position.  Due to the fact that I was a member of the Business Committee, I am aware that the aim of the Dunning report, the process relating to which was conducted over seven months, to try to overcome that impasse in order that we might come to some arrangement.  The Government is not stopping money messages just for the craic.  The legislation has to be robust and must go through pre-legislative scrutiny or post-pre-legislative scrutiny, depending on where it sits.  We have to find a mechanism for getting some of that legislation through the House.  The Business Committee has not been able to agree on the recommendations contained in the Dunning report.  Until it does, we are not in a position to move any further than we have offered, which is significant for a Government, to advancing those Bills.  Much as I understand the Deputy's frustration, I suggest that he direct it towards the Business Committee and encourage it to accept the recommendations of the Dunning report.  If he does not accept those recommendations, he could come up with something better in order that we might move that legislation forward and not just think that is the lack of a money message that is stopping the legislation from proceeding.  The latter is not the case.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raises his eyebrows because I say not all zero-hour contracts will be banned but that is not a sinister view.  We are going to ban zero-hour contracts so that people cannot be brought in willy-nilly on a two or three-hour basis.  In some very strict and genuine cases, there is a need to have zero-hour contracts available.  I refer, for example, to substitute school teachers who may or may not be on a panel.  There may be an emergency where a school has no teacher, where a substitute teacher on a panel may not be available and where the school will have to look outside that panel.  A school is not going to organise a five hour contract for somebody on a weekly basis where there are not five hours in that school but the teacher is needed this week because another is off sick or for whatever reason.  It has to be a genuine emergency.  We are not leaving a loophole here for people to take the mick and to use it.  We are adamant, as I know the Deputy, those in Fianna F&aacute;il and all the other Deputies in the House are, that we are going to reduce an employer's ability to use people on a casualised basis.  There are genuine emergencies where they need that wriggle room.  That will be clear in the legislation.  The Deputy will be able to propose changes to it if he wishes but absolutely only in genuine cases where emergency cover is needed will we tolerate any offering of zero-hour contracts.<\/p> <p>  I will come back to the Labour Court issue later.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Halligan is in Thailand.  I know from my experience and that of some of my colleagues that it is difficult to make a fulsome response from so far away.  What I heard yesterday was a fulsome apology and acknowledgment that what he said was inappropriate and wrong.  If the Deputy considered the statement he made in the course of the interview, he probably acknowledged it at the time.  I think his words were \"I probably shouldn't ask you this but ...\".  That probably tells another story.  I have had the privilege of knowing Deputy Halligan not just since he has been in government with me but also over the past five or six years that I have been in the House.  In these Houses, one probably does not have reason to have conversations with certain people.  Deputy Halligan is an incredibly friendly person.  I know he has championed women's rights far more loudly, with respect, than some of the women in these Houses in the past seven years.  When I hear that he genuinely apologises for the hurt and distress he caused and his explanation for what he said, I take it as being 100% bona fide.<\/p><p>I accept his apology.  I will not sit here and pretend that what he did was correct because it was not.  I also know that he knows he should not have said what he said and he has apologised fully for it.  I also categorically put it on the record that he has championed women's rights in this House over the past seven years, which is as long as I have been here, much louder than some other people in this House.<\/p><p> In respect of the Labour Court, it is not the Supreme Court.  However, the Labour Court and the Workplace Relations Commission are statutory bodies which have statutory powers.  The reason people go to them is that they want to find co-operative solutions to the difficulties they have.  That is why it works as effectively as it does.  It also seeks and has the power to uphold judgments that arise from other courts.  Mr. Sheridan will correct me if I am wrong.  The reason it is so successful is that people co-operatively and collaboratively come to the table and find a solution to the issues they have.  The WRC is probably more effective because it is used much more often.  While the Deputy does not believe the Labour Court is a proper court, it certainly is a statutory body with statutory powers.  It works very effectively and I hope it will work as effectively today as it has done with all the other dispute resolutions that have been put before it in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017110900002#E00900","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1510219800,"counter":2028,"content":"<p>I also recognise the fantastic work the WRC does and not for one second was I trying to run it down.

Some may look at the new scheme and decide they would be better off under the total contributions scheme while others will not be.  I was delighted to hear the Minister say she hopes to be in a position to fix this problem in the very near future - in the coming weeks or months, as she said.  We are talking here about elderly people.  I know the Minister is conscious of that and that they do not actually have all the time in the world.  I welcome this move and we will keep engaging with the Minister on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017110900002#F01100","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1510219800,"counter":2038,"content":"<p>I received the Deputy's letter and I thank him for it.  To answer the Deputy's direct question, the people who are responsible for ensuring that all of our legislation, Government and Opposition, goes through pre-legislative scrutiny are those who were on the D&aacute;il reform committee.  Fianna F&aacute;il had three very active members on that committee.  I was lucky enough to sit on it myself.  We made the decision on the basis that if legislation needed to be enhanced before it got to Second Stage, it would make it robust.  That was also relying on us having a budgetary committee and legal representation to help Opposition Members with drafting.  Those facilities have not been established yet.  I am sorry to labour this point but in terms of the Dunning report and co-operation from Government, as the Deputy is aware, there is not money sitting in a budget somewhere for Opposition Deputies to get a money message.  All the money in every Department is qualified and accounted for.  The proposal was to have a budget for money messages so that at least, for Opposition legislation that required a money message, there would be a fund that could be drawn down and that was not earmarked for something else.  We are all from different parties and the sooner the Business Committee gets a resolution to these issues, the sooner all of our legislation can move forward.  The Deputy can extol my wisdom so I can help him make his legislation better and he can certainly help me make mine better.  While that impasse is there, the 239 pieces of Opposition legislation will continue to multiply.  It is up to us to fix it.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right but he is also wrong.  When we go to public consultation on the total contributions model, it will be dependent on the parameters and how much of a homemaker scheme we put into the new model.  That will determine whether people lose.  We might, for example, issue referrals of how people can exclude bits of their working life, if they worked for two years at the beginning of it and then had a break.  It will depend on us and that is why the public consultation is so important not just to me, but to all of us.  When we get to this magic date of 1 January 2020 or whatever the date will be that we move to the new model, it has to be the most robust and fair model that we can produce.  Our pensioners deserve no less.  I do not want to find Deputy O'Dea in Government in five years' time and me beating him over the head because there is an anomaly in the next system.  We want to make sure we get this right, that it is sustainable financially into the future, and that it is received by pensioners as something that is fair and that they can live with.  That is why the public consultation is so important.  We must all be part of it and must get as many people into the conversation as we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2017110900002#F01200","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1510219800,"counter":2039,"content":"<p>The Minister referred to EU and international level.  Apart from the three Bills, of which we have spoken numerous times, as a result of EU legislation or directives are there impending Bills, on either the employment side or the social protection side, of which she is aware?  I am asking about both primary and secondary legislation.<\/p> <p>  In her opening statement, the Minister mentioned a number of EU and international responsibilities and functions.  I attended the European committee on the social charter last week and I was surprised to see a list of conclusions of non-conformity for Ireland for 2016.  I quickly discovered that some countries were deemed to be non-conforming because they did not respond but I was disappointed to learn there is not a flow of information between the Department and this committee on these issues.  I ask the Minister to keep the committee informed of relevant information on the subject of EU and international-level functions.  When I read the documentation in preparation for the meeting, it was the first time I had seen this information and it had not been presented to the committee in any way.

To be honest, it never even dawned on me to do this.  I am new to Europe and it is all new to me but I will certainly send any information on reports on which we are working to the committee, including those which we will be signing off on next week.  I would love the chance for me and the officials to discuss what legislation might arise in these contexts.  There is no imperative to instigate legislation in respect of what we are signing up to but there is a will to do so.  Some of the legislative changes we are making to work-life balance, for example, and to ensure people get to spend more time with their children, are necessary but I do not get to make these decisions on my own - we have to do it collectively.  I will certainly get for the committee all the documents on which we have been working in the past couple of years.
