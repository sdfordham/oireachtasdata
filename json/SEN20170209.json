Its origins can be traced back to 1793.  The school has 30 staff and approximately 420 pupils.  In 1991 it was announced that a new school would be built, but 25 years later the project has not started.  While I am aware that funding for the project has been provided, having met parents of students at the college, I am calling for the issue to be addressed as a matter of urgency.<\/p> <p>I have received a note from a parent in which she paints a picture of the school her two boys attend.  It describes an inadequate heating system and very damp walls that are covered in mould and can be seen throughout the school.  It states the windows are single glazed, with window frames rotting away and most windows stuffed with paper.  Plaster is falling off most of the ceilings and some of the ceilings have fallen down.  The note refers to buckets being placed in certain rooms to collect rainwater leaking through the roof.  It adds that as a result of these leaks, floors are wet and slippery, making it dangerous for both pupils and staff to walk on them.  This has led to many injuries.  The sanitary areas are described as being outdated, damp and cold; the locker rooms are a health hazard owing to the wet floors, while rodents have been spotted.  In addition, a lack of modern equipment is preventing students from carrying out their scientific experiments.  The note describes bannisters on the main stairway as unstable and highly dangerous and refers to extremely cold temperatures in the school throughout the winter months, sometimes not higher than 2&deg; Celsius.  This, the note continues, is unfair to both students and staff who have to work and teach in such appalling conditions and the matter needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge that the building project at Knockbeg College has been put out to tender.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I realise that.  This has been going on for 25 years, but the building is unfit for purpose and is actually unsafe.  I ask again today the question which was asked before the funding came through, namely, whether the Minister can give the school some prefabs until the building is up and running.  The build is taking place in three stages.  As the Minister knows, when a building starts, one is talking a year if not more.  This building is unsuitable.  It is not right to have students and teachers in conditions like this in schools in 2017.  Can the Minister look at providing prefabs in the short term and until the school is built?  It is a priority 1 project and the Minister must ensure the funding is provided as soon as possible and that the school is built.<\/p><p>It should be recorded that Knockbeg school is an excellent one with excellent standards.  As such, it is sad to see that it has been left for 25 years until it is in such a state of disrepair that it is unfit for purpose.  The board of management wants to meet the Minister for Education and Skills next week.  As such, I ask now for a pre-meeting.  If the Minister of State could come back to me on that, I would really appreciate it.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to address this issue for me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020900002#A00500","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486636200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, asked me to thank Senator Murnane O'Connor for raising this matter as it provides an opportunity to clarify the current position regarding the project for St. Mary's College in Knockbeg, Carlow.  I thank the Senator for passing on the list from the parent setting out exactly what the situation is in the school at the moment.<\/p> <p>St. Mary's College, Knockbeg, is an all-boys, non-fee-paying, voluntary Catholic secondary school owned by the Diocese of Kildare and Leighlin.  It is one of the oldest secondary schools in the country, dating back to 1793.  The college itself comprises four main buildings, all protected structures, and the current major school building project aims to create an exciting and modern educational facility for the future while preserving the beauty and best qualities of the protected elements from the past.  There are inherent design challenges with extending such buildings, but the Minister is pleased to report that this has not overly affected the progression of the project through the various stages of architectural planning.  The project entails the construction of an extension to the existing school of approximately 3,350 sq. m., together with associated refurbishment and external works.  The project brief looks to extend the four main buildings to create a cloister, thus forming a courtyard to the centre which will act as a focal point for the school.  The innovative design includes single-storey, two-storey and three-storey structures incorporating facilities such as a study hall, PE hall, which can also be used for extra curricular activity, and a science laboratory.<\/p> <p>The project was announced as part of the five-year construction programme in 2012.  The project progressed quickly through the early stages of architectural design, although during stage 2b two replacement consultants had to be appointed which added some months to the completion of that particular process.  The Minister has asked me to report that the project is now progressing through stage 3, the tender stage.  The board of management of the school is the client for the building project and, as such, is responsible for directing the design team.  In October 2016, the board authorised the design team to proceed to tender.  The closing date for receipt of tenders was 12 January 2017.  The design team is currently preparing a tender report which is due to be submitted to the Department by the middle of February 2017.  Subject to no issues arising, it is envisaged that construction will commence in the second quarter of 2017.  Once the project is on site, it will take approximately 24 months to carry out the work.<\/p> <p>This project will provide school accommodation for up to 450 pupils.  Enrolments in September 2016 stood at 423 pupils, which is over 50 pupils more than five years ago.  Upon completion in 2019, the lives of these pupils will be enriched by a state-of-the-art learning environment for the future built with a significant nod to the past.  As the Senator has requested that I raise the matter with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, I will ask him about the possibility of prefabs on site in advance of completion in 2019.  I will also ask him if he can facilitate a pre-meeting with the Senator before the board meets him next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020900002#B00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1486636200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>It is great to see that Knockbeg is getting a new school but the building it is in now is simply unfit.

It is an issue on which he has probably received many representations and which he is dealing with as well as possible within the Department.  It relates to two very important schemes, in particular for smaller farmers.  These are GLAS and AEOS.  Payments under the schemes have been delayed this year.  I understand there are complications in terms of processing the applications but as of 2 February last week, the situation as set out in a reply the Minister delivered in the D&aacute;il was that 24% of all GLAS payments remained outstanding.  Of the 37,492 applications made, 8,967 had not resulted in payments.  That comprised GLAS 1 and GLAS 2 applications.  On the other environmental scheme, the agri-environment options scheme, 30% of applications for payment remained outstanding.  According to the figures the Minister released last week, 2,625 payments remained outstanding out of a total application set of 8,640.<\/p> <p>There is concern among farming organisations and in particular among small farmers themselves about this.  I appreciate that a lot of applications have been processed and paid.  It is understandable that there will be delays in processing payments every year.  In that context, I understand that there are new computerised systems within the Department.  However, can the Minister put a system in place whereby these applications can be processed more speedily?  I met with farmers last weekend who have not received these payments and whose feed bills at this time of year are increasing.  They are under financial pressure.  Is there a way to release the payments sooner?  Perhaps the Minister will update the House in relation to the current state of payments and state whether any additional staff have been sanctioned to allow the relevant section of the Department to process these payments more promptly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020900002#B00500","speaker":"1382"},{"type":"speech","time":1486636200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill for raising this matter on the Commencement and welcome the opportunity to outline the current position regarding the 2016 payments under the green low carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and the previous agri-environment scheme, the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS.<\/p> <p>GLAS provides support to farmers under the rural development programme 2014 to 2020 to deliver environmental benefits and public goods which will enhance Ireland's agricultural sustainability credentials into the future.  The scheme plays a critical role in enhancing Ireland's efforts to deliver sustainable agricultural production.  It provides support to Irish farmers aimed at the enhancement of biodiversity, water quality and the mitigation of the future impacts of climate change while allowing Irish farmers to improve their agricultural productivity and practices in a sustainable manner.  It is critical that we protect the Irish countryside for the benefit of all and GLAS provides support to Irish producers to do this while enhancing their ability to deliver sustainable food production.  That food production is making a critical contribution to growth in the Irish economy.<\/p> <p>GLAS involves a maximum annual payment of &euro;5,000 under the general scheme with provision for payment up to &euro;7,000, known as GLAS+, where the farmer is required to give exceptional environmental commitments in a limited number of cases.  Applications under the first two tranches of the GLAS scheme resulted in almost 38,000 farmers being approved into the scheme in its first year of implementation.  This represents an unprecedented level of participation in the first year of an agri-environment scheme in Ireland.  I recently indicated that all qualifying applicants under the third tranche of GLAS will be accepted into the scheme.  With just under 14,000 applicants for GLAS 3, this will bring overall participation levels above the targeted participation level of 50,000 farmers.  As all participants in the second tranche of the previous agri-environment scheme, AEOS Il, completed their five-year contracts at the end of December 2016, a full check of all payments made must be carried out before their final payment issues.  This final check is an EU requirement and has been completed in many cases.<\/p> <p>I note that 2016 payments in the amount of over &euro;19 million have been paid to over 6,000 participants remaining in this scheme.  Payments are issuing in outstanding cases as soon as the final check has been completed and officials in my Department are working to ensure that payment issues in all cases issue as soon as possible.  The 2016 payments represent the first full year of payment under GLAS.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Michael Creed:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=259\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=259&amp;amp;pid=MichaelCreed&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->At the end of December 2016, there were approximately 37,500 active participants in the GLAS scheme, of which 27,400 received 85% of their 2016 payment in  December.  These payments were valued at over &euro;97 million.  As the accredited paying agency, the Department has a duty to ensure that, in making payments, everything in an application that can be checked is checked as required under the regulations.  As a result, payments can only issue where all the required validation checks have been successfully passed.  As issues with outstanding cases are resolved, they are paid in weekly payment runs.  Further payments, valued at &euro;5.3 million, issued to just under 1,500 participants over the past couple of weeks and payments to a further 750 farmers are expected to issue before the end of this week.<\/p><p>To facilitate divergent farming practices, GLAS has a range of over 30 actions available for selection by applicants for GLAS.  Under EU regulations, compliance with each action must be verified, so there are validations associated with each of these actions.  As a result, there are a number of different reasons that payment may not have issued.  Many of these issues, given their complexity, require review on a case-by-case basis and this work is ongoing at the moment.  To suggest that these cases could be processed manually is unrealistic as the full suite of checks would remain to be carried out and recorded on each individual application which would, most likely, lead to audit  risks and further delays.  As issues are resolved, payments will continue to issue on an ongoing basis.  I am very keenly aware of the need to process these payments without delay and I recognise that these payments are overdue.  I am ensuring that all resources required, both on the lT and administrative side, are directed towards resolving the outstanding queries on these cases.<\/p><p>In relation to the online application system for GLAS, it is clear from the governing regulations that not only is it desirable that member states move to electronic processing of area-based aid and support applications, but it is, in fact, a mandatory regulatory requirement from the 2018 claim year onward.  In this context, my Department launched a tremendously ambitious development programme to move to an online application and payment processing system for GLAS.  Compared to Northern Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales, where farmer interest in agri-environment schemes is also very strong, this is an extraordinary achievement as these areas remain in the early stages of approving applications.  In the context of the recently launched consultation process on the future of CAP, it is in Ireland's interests that we have a fully developed, robust electronic processing and payment system that will give the necessary assurances that disbursement of EU funds is managed to the highest standards.  Not only will this act as a protection against disallowances in this programming period, but it will also serve to strengthen our position in negotiating funding for a future agri-environment scheme in the next programming period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020900002#B00600","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486636200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I appreciate the fact that the Department is doing everything possible to get these payments issued and I note that 750 payments will be issued this week, in addition to what has been issued in the past couple of weeks.

She tragically lost her five year old son, Keith Charles Goodwin, in a drowning accident in the north of Spain on 25 July 1972.  She has received what is supposed to be a death certificate for Keith from the Spanish authorities but she is not entirely happy with what she has received.  Keith was brought home to be buried in Malahide cemetery.  Mrs. Goodwin has spent decades trying to get Keith's death registered in the Dublin register and to get a certificate of his death as an Irish citizen.

As it stands, this section of the legislation has not commenced and I understand there may be administrative or staffing reasons for this situation.  It is three years since the legislation was brought in and this situation is unsatisfactory.

I welcome Mrs. Goodwin and councillor Leddy to the House today and apologise on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, who has to be abroad with the President.<\/p> <p>The Civil Registration Act 2004 provides for a register of deaths which occur in Ireland.  Any death which occurs in the State must be registered, irrespective of the nationality or country of permanent residence of the deceased.  Where a death occurs in the State, it is the duty of a qualified informant, normally a relative of the deceased, to attend at a registrar's office and register the death on foot of a certificate of cause of death supplied by a registered medical practitioner.  Where a death is referred to a coroner, the death is registered by a registrar on foot of a coroner's certificate.  These processes ensure the integrity, reliability and credibility of our registers, which is of the utmost importance.<\/p> <p>When an Irish resident dies abroad, the death is registered in the country where the death occurs.  A death certificate, issued by the civil authorities of that country and translated, if necessary, is normally sufficient for all legal and administrative purposes.  There is no legal requirement to register such deaths here.  Not having the death of a loved one registered in Ireland is a very emotive issue for some of the parents and relatives involved, and it was considered that provisions for the establishment of a record of foreign deaths would provide them with some comfort.<\/p> <p>Section 13 of the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014 provides for a record of deaths abroad to record the deaths of Irish citizens who die abroad while on holiday, on temporary work contracts or during short-term absences from the State.  The use of a record, rather than a register, to record the deaths is based on the fact that the certificates which will be issued from the record will have no legal standing and will not be used to replace the death certificate received from the country of death.  This is necessary to provide a clear distinction from certificates which are issued from the register of deaths in Ireland, which have a legal standing.  It would not be possible for the Oireachtas to impose statutory obligations on foreign doctors or coroners to certify a death.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The entry will record as many facts as are available on the death certificate received from the authorities in the place of death, other than the cause of death.

The provision does not place a time limit on when the death occurred so that no person is inadvertently excluded from applying to record a death of a deceased loved one.  The creation of a separate record ensures that the current death register would not be compromised by the inclusion of deaths that take place outside the State.  It also ensures that statistics used by Central Statistics Office, CSO, for medical planning will not be compromised by the addition of foreign deaths to the main register of deaths.  While the Department has responsibility for the commencement of this provision, the operation of the provision comes under the remit of the civil registration service in the HSE.

I wish him well and continued success with that.<\/p> <p>I tabled this Commencement matter following a Clare FM \"Morning Focus\" investigation into domestic violence and abuse in County Clare.  For a week after Christmas, Clare FM carried interviews with people involved in the Rape Crisis Midwest, specifically people involved in the services in County Clare, and spoke to victims of sexual abuse.  I would like to take this opportunity to commend the two victims who went on the record and shared their stories with Ms Fiona McGarry and Mr. Gavin Grace on Clare FM.  Their bravery is going to give other people encouragement to come forward and speak out.<\/p> <p>During the week long Clare FM investigation into sexual abuse in Clare, the issue of funding for the Rape Crisis Midwest was starkly illustrated.  There is a service in County Clare and I would like to commend the people involved for that.  Unfortunately, in 2016, there were a number of a weeks where the service being provided in Ennis had to be suspended due to funding issues.  The private sector came on board to provide funding to redevelop the office and ensure there were adequate office facilities and rooms where people who had been abused could have counselling and where people working with Rape Crisis Midwest could do the very important work they do in a comfortable and safe environment.<\/p> <p>The Rape Crisis Midwest has to do extensive fund-raising to bridge a gap that exists between the funding that it is getting from the State and the funding required to run the service.  Unfortunately, in 2016, there were pressures on the service and there was an unfortunate period of time where the service could not be provided due to lack of resources.  This should not happen again and the service should be available in Ennis all the time.  That should be guaranteed.  Funding should not be an issue for providing the service in Ennis, County Clare.<\/p> <p>Rape Crisis Midwest has also identified the need to provide counselling services and supports in other parts of Clare, specifically in west Clare.  It has proposals to establish an outreach service in the Kilrush area of County Clare, which would serve all west Clare, as a starting point for expanding the service and ensuring that more people who have been the victims of sexual abuse will come forward and seek the necessary counselling to help in the healing process.<\/p> <p>There are many victims out there who have not spoken to anybody and who are suffering in silence on a daily basis.  I encourage victims all over the country but, in particular, in County Clare, about which we are speaking, to go to the Rape Crisis Network, seek its services and engage with it, and life will begin to improve.  <\/p> <p>I appeal to the Minister to provide the necessary funding so that the Rape Crisis Midwest can keep its facility in Ennis open all year round and also provide the very important outreach services that it has identified a need for in west Clare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020900002#D00400","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1486636200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to respond to the issue raised by Senator Conway on behalf on my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Zappone.<\/p> <p>Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence whether in the context of the family or otherwise.  At all times, Tusla&rsquo;s key priority is to ensure that the needs of victims of violence are being met in the best way possible.  A network of 60 organisations provide services to victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in Ireland, including 20 services providing emergency refuge accommodation to women and children, 24 community-based domestic violence services and 16 rape crisis centres.<\/p> <p>The Child and Family Agency has developed a more co-ordinated approach to the provision of these services with a single line of accountability and greater support and oversight of service provision by a dedicated national team.  In 2016, TusIa had available to it a budget of &euro;20.6 million to support the provision of services in this area.  Last year, the 16 rape crisis centres around the country received just over &euro;4 million in funding from Tusla.  Additional funding of over &euro;100,000 was made available to rape crisis and sexual violence services in 2016 to address sustainability issues and enhance access with provision of additional outreach services.<\/p> <p>Rape Crisis Midwest is based in Limerick city and has centres in Ennis, County Clare, and in Nenagh, County Tipperary.  It provides counselling services for survivors of sexual violence throughout the mid-west and also provides information, helpline and advocacy services.  Tusla allocated &euro;346,000 in funding to Rape Crisis Midwest in 2016.  The level of funding available to Tusla in 2017 for domestic, sexual and gender based violence services is being further increased.  This is to be welcomed.  Tusla is currently finalising arrangements for the publication of its 2017 business plan.  The business plan will confirm details of the funding allocation for these important services in 2017.  Tusla is currently engaging with organisations in the sexual violence services sector regarding funding and service arrangements for 2017, and will be confirming funding to individual organisations, including Rape Crisis Midwest, in due course.<\/p> <p>As part of its commissioning approach to developing services, Tusla is identifying priority developments and undertaking work to match needs with services for victims and survivors of sexual violence across the country.  Access to support services for victims and survivors of rape and sexual violence will be considered as part of commissioning processes, with a particular focus on equitable responses to those who experience sexual violence.  The Minister, Deputy Zappone, has emphasised to Tusla the priority that she attaches to the provision of services for those impacted by sexual violence.  She has communicated this priority as part of the annual performance statement, which issues to Tusla and which informs the preparation and content of Tusla&rsquo;s business plan.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In conclusion, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, has asked me to assure the House that the Government and Tusla are strongly committed to providing effective responses to victims of sexual violence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020900002#D00500","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486636200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>That is a very positive statement on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Zappone, with regard to her direction to Tusla and what she sees as the priority.  I agree with the Minister about the need to provide support to people who have been abused and encouraging them to come forward and to ensure the mechanisms are there to provide support for victims in rural areas as well as urban areas.  There are myriad challenges facing rural people, particularly in respect of transportation, rural isolation and not having the necessary support to come forward and seek help.  The service Rape Crisis Midwest is proposing in terms of an outreach facility in Kilrush is critical.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, reiterate to the Minister the importance of providing this facility and this service and that she should direct Tusla's that these would be included as part of its business plan and negotiations for its service level agreements with the Rape Crisis Midwest?  This should be stipulated and the funds should be made available to provide for it.  <\/p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for taking the time to respond to what has become a vocal campaign for the service in County Clare.

The Minister was unable to attend but sent a Minister of State in his Department to address us.  I asked the following questions.  Was the statement made by Mr. O'Brien that the HSE cannot afford to build the national children's hospital accurate?  If so, what exactly does that mean?  Does it mean the entire proposal to build the hospital at the St. James's site is shelved?  Why did it require a HSE official to deliver that news the day before yesterday to an Oireachtas committee?  Why did the Minister not deliver the news?  Was the hospital project in jeopardy?  Can the Minister set out how much taxpayers' money has been invested in developing the proposed site at St. James's Hospital to date?<\/p> <p>I am 100% for this hospital project as are all my colleagues in the constituency.  Not one of these questions was answered by the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, yesterday.  She completely fudged every single one of these questions.  It is alarming that the first-in-command in the HSE can make statements on one of the biggest projects in the State, yet the Minister does not have the courtesy to attend the House to explain and make a statement on these matters.<\/p> <p>The second matter I would like to raise today relates to the ongoing nightmare of staff shortages in the HSE.  Nurses have voted in favour of industrial action and will carry out a work-to-rule from Tuesday, 7 March.  This is incredible.  The Minister for Health promised 1,200 nurses.  To date, 108 beds have been closed in our hospitals.  It is a continuous nightmare for Fine Gael, which has had three Ministers in the Department of Health.  Not one of the them has been able to make a dent in the crisis that sees 600 patients on trolleys a week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020900002#G00400","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1486636200,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il had 14 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020900002#G00500","speaker":"1375"},{"type":"speech","time":1486636200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>It is absolutely scandalous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020900002#G00600","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1486636200,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il hypocrisy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020900002#G00700","speaker":"1421"},{"type":"speech","time":1486636200,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Senator Reilly was one of those Ministers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020900002#G00800","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1486636200,"counter":39,"content":"<p>Selective amnesia would be the term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020900002#G00900","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1486636200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>How long has Fine Gael now been in government?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020900002#G01000","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1486636200,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Look at Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin's record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020900002#G01100","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1486636200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>Today I will not call on the Minister to address the House because I know the Minister has no respect for it.

We need to come forward with five or six definite issues that we wish to have addressed.  We need to make them public and put solutions on the table.  When we met Mr. Michel Barnier yesterday morning, he asked us to give him solutions.  He said that if we gave him solutions, he would try to implement them.  I was delighted to hear from him that he would be willing, at the Cathaoirleach's invitation, to address this House.  That is an extraordinarily generous step by a man who has been given such an onerous task and I hope it is something we can facilitate in the coming weeks.  My colleague, Senator Neale Richmond, was particularly anxious that he would do so.

Of course, I could not possibly let the Leader away with nothing but compliments.  The other side of my argument is that the time has come for public statements and for us to step up to the plate to say what we want and how we believe it can be implemented.  That has to be done without further delay.  Ireland is streets ahead of other member states in the planning process, but very few citizens know what is going on.  I meet people every day of the week who say Ireland is following Britain.  I do not believe we are.  The Commissioner pointed out earlier in the year that Ireland needed to differentiate itslef from Britain and should not get dragged into its argument with the European Union.  We need to set out our own stall firmly.<\/p><p>This morning we all received an e-mail from the Tesco organisation on impending industrial action.  I do not think it should try to use this House to fight its argument.

Yesterday Fine Gael Members clapped themselves on the back and said regarding the problems in the health service that it was not a resource issue.  I am sure they will remember what they said.  Today, we see an internal assessment drawn up by the HSE which indicates that 9,000 pieces of hospital equipment need to be replaced.  When Professor Fergal Malone requested a sum of &euro;650,000 for the Rotunda Hospital last year to replace ageing and out-of-date equipment, it received &euro;150,000.  It looks to me as though the provision of resources is an issue.  Vital diagnostic equipment, including MRI scans, X-ray machines and other equipment being used in hospitals across the country, needs to be replaced.  I know from my own conversations with consultants and other clinicians that it has needed to be replaced for some time now.  Is it any wonder that an increasing number of patients are being misdiagnosed?  Not a week goes by without someone contacting me who has been given the wrong diagnosis.  Patients are being sent home from hospitals with broken bones, a fractured back and other illnesses that should be picked up.  They are not being picked up because the equipment being used is not of adequate quality.  The CEO of the HSE, Mr. Tony O'Brien, told an Oireachtas committee last year that he was greatly concerned about the lack of money available to replace critical equipment which he said posed an immediate safety and quality concern.  He estimated that an additional &euro;1.4 billion was needed in the next five years to address the issue.  Each time a procedure has to be cancelled when equipment breaks down, as many are, it adds to the waste of money in the system.  This does not make economic sense, but I have no doubt that my Fine Gael friends will have worked up a spin and a cover up that it somehow benefits patients and was part of the plan all along.  The failure to provide clinicians with the tools they need to do their jobs must be dealt with.  I can see why there are such big issues with recruitment.  I know from talking to nurses over Christmas why they are unwilling to come back and work in Irish hospitals.  It is not only because of the chaos but also because they would not have the equipment they would need to do the job.  In not replacing equipment the Government cannot blame the recruitment process.  It is very plain and simple - the money to replace equipment is either available or it is not.  The Government can either stand over the choice it made to give the money to the vulture funds, Apple or any other organisation or it can stand over the health service.

When I heard the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Pachal Donohoe, say the so-called labour activation schemes facing the axe included T&uacute;s and Gateway, schemes overseen by the Department of Social Protection, I was concerned.  We have made huge progress in reducing the level of unemployment and should not be talking about cuts to labour activation schemes.  We should be redesigning them to ensure investment to help the long-term unemployed.  I am very concerned that we are not having a discussion on or that there is not an internal review of how pet projects for Fine Gael will be funded and which long-term projects, including community projects, will be cut.  When Minister of State in the Department of Social Protection I saw the great work done under T&uacute;s schemes in towns and villages the length of breadth of the country to keep people in touch with and connected to the employment market.  Whether it was with Tidy Towns committees, helping in nursing homes or in general clean-ups, local communities and participants saw the benefitsm yet we are now talking about cutting schemes.  I have continuously raised the issue of community employment.  In many cases, the work carried out under community employment schemes constitutes a real job.  Community centres would not be able to open without community employment scheme participants.  GAA pitches would not be marked out, while the local GAA club's sports hall would not be opened.  We are seeing internal cost-cutting measures being taken without a proper debate.  It is time for the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, to come to the House for a discussion on the cuts about which he is talking.  He says funds will have to be saved within Departments.  There is an expanding wage bill in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If savings will have to be made within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, will we see the college in Templemore close again, as happened under Fianna F&aacute;il?  It was reopened under the last Government.  Exactly what cost-saving measures are being talked about?  I agree fully that we should constantly review all Government programmes to make sure they are fit for purpose.  However, there must also be an appreciation of the services provided in every community.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House for a debate and a proper discussion on the cost-saving measures he has asked Ministers to implement across Departments prior to the next budget?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kevin Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This must be done as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020900002#H01700","speaker":"1417","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486636200,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Yesterday, in a junior cup game held in Musgrave Park between my former school, St. Munchin's College, and Presentation Brothers College, PBC, Cork, three young rugby players suffered head injuries and concussion.

At senior level, some of Ireland's top players have suffered multiple concussions.  The issue needs to be addressed and I ask the IRFU and Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to seriously consider making head gear compulsory at junior cup level for under age players.  It may also need to be introduced at senior level.  While head gear should be mandatory for forwards, it may also need to be considered for backs because rugby has changed and become a much more defensive game in which backs are required to tackle opponents and form a defensive line.  We saw the way Brian O'Driscoll's game changed over the years, for example.  <\/p> <p>I am glad the three St. Munchin's College players are doing well.

The ambulance had to come from County Longford.  In the second incident, an individual collapsed in Monaghan Shopping Centre and it took almost two and a half hours for an ambulance to reach the site.  In County Cavan, a child took sick one day at school.  When an ambulance was called, the school was told that it would take 45 minutes to get there.

Over the past 20 years it has employed three CE workers to deliver its programmes to support families in a disadvantaged area in Galway.  It has lost the workers because, I believe, the private companies running the JobPath system are hoovering up anybody who may be eligible for a CE scheme.  That renders them ineligible to enter CE schemes, which means that CE schemes across the country cannot be resourced in order to carry out the work other Senators have mentioned.<\/p> <p>This is a retrograde step.  When we raised this matter previously, we were told a review of the scheme was ongoing.  I receive calls about schemes in the County Galway area every week where this is becoming a major issue.  It is wrong and we need to address it.  Therefore, I call for a debate with the Minister for Social Protection to discuss the problems the new JobPath scheme is causing across the country and its privatised nature .  <\/p> <p>We also need to examine the money that is available to CE schemes from a materials grants point of view.  Many schemes have participants, but have no materials grants in order to be able to do the required work.  We have been repeatedly told by the Government that the numbers of those unemployed are decreasing.

I could say a lot of things about said party leader when he was Minister, including the large Travers report which was lost behind the back of a radiator, but I will not waste precious time on that.<\/p> <p>I stood here two days ago and pointed out that no part of the health service exists in isolation.  While we have terrible trouble with waiting times and people on trolleys, that is very much influenced by what happens in primary care.  Early diagnosis and intervention and prevention are critical, as is what happens following treatment in terms of facilities for people to go home.  Most people want to go home and live in their own homes.<\/p> <p>In that context, I raise the need for a day hospital in Swords to serve the people of North County Dublin.  The Mater hospital and Beaumont Hospital are large regional hospitals with national and regional specialties and services.  Very often, day surgery spaces are taken up by acute admissions from the night before.  If Swords had a separate day hospital which was accessible to over 100,000 people and beyond, many of these procedures, such as hernia and gallbladder surgery, cataract removal, plastic surgery, etc. could take place.  These are currently being successfully carried out in places like Ennis, Louth County Hospital, Roscommon and Nenagh.  I call on the Minister to give consideration to this suggestion and he might come before the House at some point to discuss it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator James Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->On some of the comments made earlier, in his defence, the Minister is working to fix the problems he has inherited in the health service, many of them due to serious cutbacks.

I wish to speak about the 90% of the 35,000 nurses in the INMO who have voted to take industrial action to begin on 7 March.  Perhaps those represented by SIPTU might follow suit.  I am surprised that this issue has not been raised on the Order of Business already as it is an overwhelming rejection of the Government's proposals which do not seem to deal with the issue of the retention and recruitment of staff by providing a safe environment for nurses and patients.  The Minister for Health refuses to guarantee recruitment and contracts for this year's graduates in nursing and midwifery.  A conservative estimate of the number of vacancies is 1,500.  Under Governments led by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, in the past decade the number of nursing posts has decreased by 5,000.  Wards and operating theatres are closed and there are limited numbers of community care places in the day hospitals, which we need, and home care packages.  There is 80% public support for industrial action.  While the health service is not at breaking point, it is broken.  This is about the lack of staffing and safety.  It is also about the ability of nurses to deliver on their duty of care.  This and previous Governments under Fianna F&aacute;il failed miserably when they prioritised the bankers and speculators and handed over billions of euro to the European Union and others abroad.  The Government is also refusing to take the billions of euro in the Apple case, as dictated by the European Union.  In what country are we living?  Whom do we support?  Whom do we protect?  Whom do we prioritise?  We do not prioritise our own.  We prioritise being patted on the head by others in the European Union and abroad and being seen as good children and not upstarts by the masters to whom we express platitudes.

They will allow people to take career breaks and provide flexibility when people decide to leave the workforce for whatever reason.  I acknowledge and compliment the changes made in favour of self-employed persons and councillors.  We have seen the restoration of payments under the farm assist scheme and for lone parents, particularly single mothers.  This is all very good, but a group which needs attention and to be looked after comprises the 22,300 women in receipt of a decreased contributory State pension because they took time out during their working lives to look after their families.  They are on a reduced pension because of changes made in 2012.  We need to revisit this issue because if the women concerned had worked less in a more compact period of time, they would be in receipt of a larger pension.  This is an issue that particularly affects women because there was no such thing as a child care service years ago, other than the help provided by the extended family.  Women in many careers, particularly in the public service, had to leave their jobs and are being punished unfairly because of the changes made.  In fairness to these women who have worked hard all of their lives and raised their families, we should look at what can be done to accommodate them and not leave them in a situation where, in some cases, because they worked for just a few months, then took a career break and returned to the workforce a number of years later, they are on a decreased pension.  If they had never worked at all, they would now be in receipt of a full pension.  This is a serious issue.  Deputy Leo Varadkar, has been a reforming Minister for Social Protection and I would like him to come to the House for a discussion on this issue to see how we might implement some change to benefit the women concerned.  I acknowledge it is the central theme of the Age Action report being launched today.  I have made many representations on behalf of the women affected and would like to see changes made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020900002#M02000","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1486636200,"counter":105,"content":"<p>These are very difficult times in the health service.

Let us celebrate when we have it up and running.<\/p> <p>I join with Senators Ardagh and Devine, who raised the issue of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, and its decision to take industrial action.  It is important that we recognise and understand, as Senator Burke and Senator Devine - who I know worked in the health sector - said, that there is an awful lot of activity going on in our health system.  There is huge responsibility entrusted in the men and women who are nurses in our hospitals and in particular they have had to endure a torrid time over the past decade.  I accept that.  It is important to also recognise that recruitment is being carried on as we speak.  People are being recruited.  There are nearly 1,000 posts filled and we must welcome that.  If we need to increase the number of people employed in the health sector in the line of nursing then I will be one who will support and work with Senator Devine to achieve that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020900002#N03200","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1486636200,"counter":151,"content":"<p>The Leader is very nice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020900002#N03300","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1486636200,"counter":152,"content":"<p>The Lansdowne Road agreement oversight group is having a meeting to discuss the situation regarding the industrial actions of the INMO.

My information is that the Minister and the Government require the Bill to be passed into law as quickly as possible, but I will revert to the House on that.<\/p> <p>This will present a problem with the logistics as we have agreed our business at the group meeting so there may be no business for Tuesday next.

Senator Landy sent his apologies for not being able to be here, as did Senators &Oacute; Clochartaigh and Craughwell.  I have huge empathy with the workers.  I am sorry that I could not get to the briefing this morning.  I did give Senator Conway-Walsh the note I got in regard to Tesco yesterday.  It is important that the rights and entitlements of workers are protected.  We have fought hard to have these protections afforded to workers under our law.  I hope that Tesco and Mandate will continue to engage in the industrial mechanisms of the State.  The latest e-mail from Tesco contains a sign that it is willing to engage.  It is important that the Minister is made aware of the matter and I will bring it to her attention again.  I urge all sides to participate in talks.  It is important that we protect our workers.  I go into Tesco in Wilton in Cork late at night and I have got to know some of the staff.  As I said to Senator Gavan yesterday, some of them are working for a rate just above the minimum wage.  It was mentioned that the rate is &euro;14 an hour.  It is important that we protect the rights of staff.  Equally it is important that both sides engage meaningfully.  I will be happy to invite the Minister to the House to address the issue.<\/p> <p>Senators Conway and Wilson raised the issue of privilege.  I am not sure if it is through the Office of the Cathaoirleach that the note on privilege will be issued.  I will discuss the matter with the Clerk of the Seanad with a view to circulating it.  It is important, as Senator Wilson said, that we use privilege wisely and judiciously.<\/p> <p>Senator Landy raised the issue of the greyhound industry.  I was not aware that the events were cancelled but we have put in a request that a Minister would come to the House to address a Commencement matter on this issue.<\/p> <p>I share Senator Gallagher's concern and I offer my sympathies to the relatives of those who were tragically killed and injured in the incident.  I will ask the Minister for Health to come to the House in regard to the ambulance service.  <\/p> <p>Senator Noone raised the matter of the coroner's report on synthetic drugs.  We will discuss this matter.<\/p> <p>Senators McFadden and Wilson raised the issue of the Defence Forces.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, will be in the House on 9 March.  I am aware that Senator McFadden is a member of the committee at which I understand members of the Defence Forces Reserve appeared this morning.<\/p> <p>Senator Byrne raised the issue of connectivity in terms of the ability to book beyond 5 September.  I suggest she write to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, on the matter and raise it as a Commencement matter.  She could take it up with Aer Lingus.  The matter she raised is vital to the regions when one is trying to get connectivity from North America to places beyond Shannon.  I think connectivity is important.<\/p> <p>Senator Reilly raised the issue of the day hospital in Swords.  Again, to be fair to Senator Reilly, despite Senator Gallagher's review of his tenure in the Department of Health, he was the person who started the primary care centres model and asked for it to be rolled out across the country.<\/p> <p>Senator Mulherin raised the question of the changes to PRSI.  We welcome that and I will ask the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, to come to the House.<\/p> <p>Senator Burke raised the matter of health care, which was discussed already.  Senator Feighan also raised the matter of health in addition to raising the issue of car insurance.

The Government&rsquo;s commitment to the regional and rural agenda is a clear priority in the publication A Programme for a Partnership Government.  The publication just over a fortnight ago of the Action Plan for Rural Development has provided a clear roadmap for the implementation of the regional and rural commitments contained in the programme for Government as well as new ideas and initiatives.<\/p> <p>I would like to begin by expressing my sympathies to those affected by the job losses announced at the Hewlett Packard site in Leixlip.  Yesterday's news is, sadly, a reminder that we must not be complacent.  We have to work hard to ensure we remain competitive and continue to encourage companies into Ireland as well as supporting our home grown businesses.  Just this week, my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, announced over 200 jobs in Waterford and Kilkenny.  <\/p> <p>I was particularly pleased to hear the announcement that 140 new jobs will be created by the link-up between Mercury Filmworks and the wonderful Cartoon Saloon in Kilkenny.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Heather Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2308\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2308&amp;amp;pid=HeatherHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I was particularly pleased to hear the announcement that 140 new jobs will be created by the link-up between Mercury Filmworks and the wonderful Cartoon Saloon in Kilkenny.  I have visited Cartoon Saloon, which is an Oscar-nominated animation studio, and the place is quite literally brimming with talent and creativity.  A further 60 jobs were announced at the software company Red Hat in Waterford underlining the vast range of skills and knowledge available to prospective employers in all areas of the country.  It should be noted, of course, that these job announcements arrive on the heels of earlier announcements such as the creation in 2017 of 100 jobs in Athlone by the delivery company DPD with another 100 to follow before 2020, and the creation of 100 jobs over the next two years in Dundalk by the Almac pharmaceutical group.  We want to build on that progress.<\/p><p>The action plan for rural development represents a whole-of-government approach to rural development.  We are not looking at any single element of rural development in isolation.  We look at the whole picture - from supporting the creation of jobs and enterprise right through to fostering culture and creativity in rural communities.  It is the first plan of its kind and every Department is committed to delivering on the 270 actions outlined in this plan.  We have set ourselves a number of ambitious targets across all sectors covered by the plan.  In delivering the plan, we will support the creation of 135,000 new jobs in rural Ireland by 2020 by supporting indigenous businesses and increasing foreign direct investment by up to 40% in the regions; implement a range of initiatives to rejuvenate over 600 rural and regional towns, including a pilot scheme to encourage people to return to living in town and village centres; assist over 4,000 projects in rural communities through the Leader programme to boost economic development, tackle social exclusion and provide services to people living in remote areas; increase the number of visitors to rural Ireland by 12% in the next three years through targeted tourism initiatives, including increased promotion of activity tourism; and accelerate the preparation for the roll out of high-speed broadband, which will be a game-changer for rural Ireland and ensure that all homes and businesses in rural Ireland are connected to broadband as early as possible.<\/p><p>The plan also recognises the need to support and protect vital local services in rural Ireland so that people can live, work and raise their families in a vibrant and sustainable environment.  For example, as part of the action plan, the Minister for Health and the HSE have committed to increasing the number of GPs in rural communities allowing rural dwellers better access to vital health services.  The Government is also investing over &euro;435 million for approximately 90 projects in public nursing home facilities and district and community hospitals in rural Ireland up to 2021.  We will deliver 18 new primary care centres in rural Ireland next year.  <\/p><p>In addition, as part of this plan, a range of measures will be taken to address crime prevention, including ensuring that gardai are mobile, visible and responsive in the community.  A total of 3,200 new Garda members will be recruited nationally over the next four years to reach a strength of 15,000 members.  Other security and safety supports to rural communities will be provided through schemes such as Neighbourhood Watch, Text Alert and Seniors Alert.  A new community CCTV grant scheme will also be introduced by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality as part of this action plan.<\/p><p>The action plan will also ensure that rural Ireland is well served by our transport systems.  For example, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Transport Authority will work with rural communities to assess and implement improvements to existing rural transport routes and develop new routes as necessary. <\/p><p>I believe it is vital that we focus on the cultural vibrancy as well as the economic viability of rural Ireland and with that in mind, my Department is working with local authorities to implement the Creative Ireland programme developing culture teams and creativity hubs across rural Ireland.  I also intend to provide funding for competitive art works which contribute to public spaces and reflect the culture and characteristics of the town or region, all of which will enhance our rural communities.<\/p><p>I am acutely aware that the issue which is probably of greatest interest and concern to rural communities is the provision of high-speed broadband.  In that regard, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and I are working closely together to pave the way for the roll out of this vital resource in rural Ireland.  While the Department for Communications, Climate Action and Environment is managing the procurement process, my Department is taking all steps necessary to ensure that rural communities will be best positioned to capitalise on full access to the digital environment.  Two regional broadband action groups involving every local authority in the country have been established with a view to identifying and addressing any barriers which could inhibit the roll out of broadband once the contracts are awarded.  My Department is funding a broadband officer in each local authority who will act as a single point of contact with telecommunications operators regarding the roll out of broadband.  We are also helping to upskill up to 30,000 people in rural communities who have never used the Internet so they can fully avail of the service when it is rolled out.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and I will also work together to implement the recommendations of the task force on mobile phone and broadband access published last December.  The implementation of the plan will be overseen by a monitoring committee, which I will chair, and it will report to the Cabinet committee on regional and rural affairs, which is chaired by the Taoiseach. <\/p><p>I have appointed Pat Spillane to act as an ambassador for the action plan for rural development.  He has kindly agreed to take on the role to encourage businesses, communities, sporting organisations and other organisations to engage with the plan.  As Members of the House will be aware, Pat Spillane played a key role in the 2014 report of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, and is well placed to carry out this new role. <\/p><p>I thank Senators for their time today and I look forward to the contributions to come.  While I am sure there will be different views on how we should approach the task of rural development, I think we can all agree on our deep commitment to the issue and the desire for us to succeed.  I should also take this opportunity to thank all those who participated in consultations in developing the plan, our colleagues in other Departments, State agencies and local authorities, and all those who will partner with us in implementing this plan.  We need the help and expertise of those who have worked in the area of rural development for many years to realise the vision set out in the plan.  I have seen the capacity of local communities to come together to achieve great things when the right structures and supports are put in place to combine the efforts and expertise of all of us and I hope that Realising our Rural Potential: Action Plan for Rural Development will provide these structures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020900002#O01900","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486636200,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  As a fellow rural dweller, she will be very much aware of the struggles of rural Ireland, which I would regard as being in dire straits.  I note that in her speech, she said that this plan would enable rural Ireland to further grow and thrive but in order to allow something to further grow and thrive, it needs to already have grown and rural Ireland is in a regressive state at the moment.  There is no growth.  Indeed, there is decline.  We are starting in the wrong position if we talk about further growing rural Ireland.  We need remedial action.<\/p> <p>This action plan is another false dawn for rural Ireland and rehashes existing announcements, programmes and employment forecasts.  It is the fourth rural plan in 33 months from Fine Gael in power following the CEDRA report in April 2014, the Charter for Rural Ireland in January 2016 and the programme for Government in May 2016.  The first page of the plan dealing with key deliverables is a lovely graphic page.  It talks about 135,000 new jobs, which are already in the action plan for jobs.  The 12% increase in overseas visitors is already part of the tourism strategy.  The figure of over &euro;51 million for sports, recreational and cultural facilities is part of the sports capital programme.  The announcement of &euro;12 million to revitalise over 600 towns and villages is to be welcomed but it does not refer to the 1.7 million people who live in what are known as aggregated rural areas, namely, outside aggregated town areas.  This is the heart of rural Ireland and is most affected by problems.  In many people's minds, rural Ireland is outside the M50 and rightly so but the real rural Irish people are those living in parishes.  There is not one mention of the parish in a very comprehensive rural development plan.  The nearest thing to a positive effort is in towns and villages, which is to be welcomed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Daly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2464\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2464&amp;amp;pid=PaulDaly&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The plan totally ignores the heart of rural Ireland.<\/p><p>The next key deliverable is to protect vital local services.  Protecting what already exists is not sufficient.  We need to replace many of the local services that have been closed down and done away with during the term of the last Government.  We need a rejuvenation process instead of a protection programme.<\/p><p>The next key deliverable is to ensure all homes and businesses are connected to broadband.  More than 900,000 rural households and businesses must wait until 2023 for State intervention to receive moderate speed broadband.  That is six years passed the promised deadline, which is not good enough.  Rural Ireland will not prosper or grow if it has to wait so long for a proper broadband service.<\/p><p>Flood relief has been included in this fabulous new document but it was already committed to in the capital plan.  One of the plan's targets is to support 4,000 new community projects but no extra funding has been provided for the rural development plan and Leader programmes.<\/p><p>IDA Ireland is the Government agency charged with bringing industry to this country.  The fact that as many as 50% of all IDA Ireland's site visits take place in the greater Dublin area, which is not 50% of the land area or 50% of the populated area of the country, is one of the major death knells for rural Ireland.  That fact shows we have turned our backs on rural Ireland and it is one of the reasons rural Ireland has suffered.<\/p><p>This plan reveals a systematic rural policy failure by Fine Gael.  There is no long-term vision or planning.  The ultimate litmus test will be what additional funding, if any, will be ring-fenced for this plan.  The Minister must immediately update the Oireachtas on whether she will introduce a Supplementary Estimate for 2017 in this regard.  As I said previously, most of the bells and whistles associated with this plan that were supposed to cajole and reassure the people of rural Ireland have already been committed to.  There is nothing new in the plan to reassure people who live in rural Ireland and know what problems exist from their daily life experiences.  There is nothing in this plan that will reassure them that rural Ireland will improve.<\/p><p>The cornerstone of rural Ireland is, and always has been, the family farm.  We are all aware that while it may not be directly under the remit of the Minister, the agriculture sector is experiencing a major crisis.  When the rural family farm is under stress and is unprofitable then rural Ireland will have problems.  If the farmers and the farming community can make money and earn a proper profit margin on their produce, then they will spend it locally.  That will help to revitalise, rejuvenate and rebuild rural Ireland.<\/p><p>I will outline another major problem.  A directive must be issued by the Department, Ministers and the Government to the local authorities in rural Ireland in respect of planning permissions.  Each county has a county development plan that county planners are bound to implement.  The Government can issue a directive to influence the formation of county development plans.  It is as hard now, or it is harder than it ever was, to secure planning permission in rural Ireland.  I do not know how a plan or a proposed strategy to develop and enhance rural Ireland can succeed if barriers are imposed and people are refused permission to live in rural Ireland.  It is an enormous contradiction.  Central government needs to bring in the local authorities if we have a real ambition to foster and promote rural Ireland.  We must sit down with the local authorities and give them guidelines to loosen up their stringent planning laws that act as the greatest deterrent to the recovery of rural Ireland.<\/p><p>I could cover many more aspects of the plan, which I do not welcome.  We have been there and done that in terms of the vast majority of the plan.  The local authorities are the first line of defence for, or promotion of, our rural areas.  These situations must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020900002#P00200","speaker":"1383","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486636200,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for finishing his contribution right on the button.

It is the arts that communicate.  It is the arts that get young people through bereavement and loss.  It is the arts that give us all internal expression.

Those of us who live in rural areas, including the Minister, know of their potential as really good places in which to live, work, visit and raise families.  Despite the challenges faced in rural Ireland, there is also exceptional pride, as well as real community spirit.  I know this because I live in rural Roscommon.<\/p> <p>Pat Spillane has been mentioned as having been heavily involved in the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA.  Another person who was also heavily involved was Cathal O'Donoghue, a former advisor in Teagasc.  His words are important in roadmapping and ensuring rural communities will be very much to the fore.  He stated, \"Rural Ireland is tough and resilient, but we also need support.\"  The action plan for rural development is focused on trying to create that roadmap.  It is focused on co-ordination between various Departments and ensuring they will be held to account in delivering real results for rural areas.  It is critically important that the plan not just be a plan but that it deliver real results and that each Department be held to account.  <\/p> <p>As a young Senator from the west, the single biggest issue facing us is the need to create better job opportunities.  The Minister has talked about the creative sector, as has Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell.  One initiative on which I would like to focus and which is happening is the creative project Creative Communities Igniting Change which commenced in early January, as part of which 16 people have commenced training in a hub in Ballaghadereen.  They are involved in the creative sector, be it in the arts, technology or advertising.  They are learning and upskilling to try to turn their creative ideas and experiences into a business.  This is a very good example of agencies working together.  Roscommon Leader Partnership is leading on it, but we also the local enterprise offices, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, and the local community very much involved in supporting the people in question in trying to turn their creative ideas into a business.  We need to see more of this and the 16 people having the confidence, skills and capabilities following the training programme to do it.  They will need enhanced and increased support, but this is a good example of where we are trying to support people involved in the creative sector.  <\/p> <p>We also know that when the Western Development Commission carried out a huge amount of research in 2009, it found that the creative sector was very much underdeveloped.  It has the potential to be labour-intensive and very important to the west.  Similarly, in the red zone, funding was allocated by the Minister's Department for the creation of a food hub, An Chistin, in Castlerea.  It is in its infancy, but it is also very important in the delivery of the plan to ensure we will see people upskilling and having the confidence to turn their expertise and abilities into successful businesses.  <\/p> <p>The Minister and others have rightly mentioned the need for broadband which, without doubt, is the most important priority in improving infrastructure in rural areas.  There is a need for real action in this regard, but I know that the Minister is working very hard to ensure there will be broadband officers within every council.  However, we need to see delivery and young people having the confidence to return to rural areas and see them, as I do, as great places in which to live, work and raise families.<\/p> <p>The need to continue to improve road infrastructure has been mentioned.  As I have done on many occasions, I point to the need to ensure we upgrade the M5, the major route to the west, between Scramogue and Ballaghadereen.  There is an urgent need to deliver that project because if we want to remain competitive, we need to ensure business people will be able to travel short distances.  We must also ensure we will reduce travel times.  <\/p> <p>In terms of what has been done, a sum of &euro;10 million has been allocated under the town and village renewal scheme.  We received CL&Aacute;R funding last year.  We have also had the rural recreation scheme.  Being very much involved within my local community and across County Roscommon, the sense that people want to be involved to make their communities better is very evident.  Having been involved in coming up with ideas and suggestions for how the funding available under the town and village renewal scheme could be used, I know that the initiative has been very positive.  Local people want to work together to see communities improving.  To that end, obviously we need increased resources and funding.  This year the amount available will be increased to &euro;12 million, which is very positive as we need to support the weakest areas.  I come from north Roscommon which was hit very severely by the impact of the recession.  It was impacted on by the fact that the economy had been based on the construction industry.  We have seen huge outward migration.  There are boarded up buildings and town centres have lost their sense of vibrancy and life.  We need to become active to ensure we will support the towns and villages which are weakest and in need of enhanced support.  That must be a priority.  <\/p> <p>I will certainly be working closely with the Minister to ensure the action plan for rural development will work and that we will deliver real results for those living in rural areas.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Maura Hopkins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2478\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2478&amp;amp;pid=MauraHopkins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=09\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Our focus on our investment and energy needs to be directed towards the weakest towns and villages first.

We can be quite tempted to support rural towns and villages which are doing quite well but we need to actively ensure we support rural areas in greatest need.  This is in conjunction with the Department and local authorities throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020900002#R01400","speaker":"1415","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486636200,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am delighted to have this opportunity to discuss something that means so much to me.  I completely understand the context of the plan and the Minister's work, with regard to the bankruptcy of our country and the giveaway of &euro;64 billion to the banks, which could have been spent on rural Ireland.  Not only this, but we also have the &euro;7 billion we must pay each year to service the debt which could be used to develop rural Ireland and to do what is needed.<\/p> <p>I was very much looking forward to this plan, as somebody who cares so passionately about rural Ireland.  I can see the Minister also cares and it means an awful lot to her.  I was disappointed with the number of actions in it.  I am used to developing plans, and having this many actions in a plan dilutes it somewhat.  I would have preferred to have seen five real priorities for rural Ireland.  I have gone through every line and word of the plan and it is a compendium of cross-departmental schemes and measures which had already been documented.  When I read the plan, I was looking for the big idea but I did not find one.  I chaired Stand Up for the West, and Sinn F&eacute;in's policy document, A New Deal for the West, has really good ideas.  The Minister's plan disappointed me.<\/p> <p>The Minister is in the driving seat at present, but the plan did not deliver and it did not inspire me.  I will go through some of the reasons I was not inspired.  There have been ten years of absolutely massive cuts to capital spending, which have impacted on rural Ireland.  The author of the plan did not grasp the gravity of what is happening and what has happened over recent years in rural Ireland.  It did not show me the Government is really genuinely listening to the ordinary people.  It is almost shocking that, to date, there has not been cross-departmental co-operation and concentration on what is needed for rural Ireland.  I certainly welcome it but it is late, and it is a shocking indictment of the Government and previous Governments that they did not have a cross-governmental concentrated effort to address the seriousness of the crisis in rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has stated &euro;3 billion was needed to get the secondary roads up to standard, but last year's budget provided &euro;298 million, which comes nowhere near to addressing it.  The decline of rural Ireland has accelerated under this and previous Governments.  We know the broadband speeds in many areas in rural Ireland are 36 times slower than other areas, but we see the plan will not be implemented until 2022.  This does not suggest the urgency needed.  I have major problems trying to run my office at home.  I never know whether I will be able to send an e-mail.  When we speak about jobs we never equate or think about the jobs that are lost because of not having this connectivity which is vital to establish any business in rural Ireland.  Will the Minister please see whether the national broadband plan can be accelerated?  I ask her to start from the outside in because towns that already have a standard of broadband are returned to time and again while other areas are left with no connectivity whatsoever.  I would appreciate it if the plan were implemented from the outside in rather than from the inside out.<\/p> <p>I welcome the aspiration for 135,000 jobs, but many jobs have been lost and we do not count the jobs that have been lost.  If I were in Government, I would make a rule that I would never announce jobs until they were ready to be recruited.  Jobs were announced in Mayo but six, 12 and 24 months later there were still no jobs.  We have all the fanfare of the announcements but they do not materialise into real jobs for real people with real wages.<\/p> <p>I have some problems with how jobs are counted, including with regard to IDA Ireland concentration.  If we look at how jobs were counted previously, there was 60% and 40% concentration and anything outside Dublin and Cork was recorded as a percentage.   Now Cork has been removed so the percentages look bigger.  It is about a perception that there are more jobs.  It reminds me of 2013 when the Government lauded itself for the creation of 61,000 jobs.  When I examined it, I found 28,000 of them were to be in agriculture but they never happened.  I rang up the CSO in Cork and said they must be overrun by tractors down there because the jobs certainly were not in Mayo.  It would have equated to 100 jobs in agriculture a day, which was nonsense.  The line was pedalled out again and again and it was never challenged by the media.  The media have a role in all of this to really challenge some of the figures put forward.  Obviously, it was only an adjustment in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine which was a nonsense.  To count them as new jobs is lying to the people.<\/p> <p>Businesses continue to close in the west because of the high overheads, reduced footfall and how rates are calculated.  I completely welcome foreign direct investment and it plays a major role in a small open economy such as ours, but our indigenous businesses are still being ignored.  There is nothing in the plan that will substantially make a difference to small businesses in rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>With regard to local employment offices, we need to look at trying to sustain existing businesses and keep them open rather than chasing around here, there and everywhere throughout the world, looking for the people with the shiny shoes to come in and then pay them reverence.  We ignore our own people much of the time when a small intervention could make all the difference and could save jobs and businesses.  All we want in areas, such as my area of Belmullet, is small industry that would pay people at the end of the week so they would have a wage packet to spend in the local economy.<\/p> <p>I completely disagree with bringing the Leader programme under the local authorities.  The people who gathered throughout the country were ignored.  The Minister stated there was extra spending and projects through Leader, but it is a falsity when we look at a county such as Mayo where &euro;9 million has been taken from the Leader budget.  There is a delay in the evaluations and only 25 Leader projects have been approved since it was announced last September.  I can see a real glut happening there.  The Minister needs to look at Pobal with regard to putting in place extra staff.  If there is a backlog of three weeks, it will continue to increase and those promoting projects cannot get them done.  There is a real issue with planning permission for Leader projects.  Some county development plans stipulate that enterprises cannot be set up where there is no public sewage schemes.  In many of the areas where jobs are desperately needed, there is no public sewage scheme.  I ask for some flexibility on this issue.<\/p> <p>I have not touched on health, but the Minister knows the Taoiseach has stated University Hospital Galway is not fit for purpose, and it is not.  People cannot even park cars there and there are many cancellations.  I ask the Minister to look at another site, such as Merlin Park, where a proper hospital for the west can be built so people can access health care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020900002#S00200","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1486636200,"counter":228,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
