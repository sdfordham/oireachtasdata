I pointed out that we have the highest number of people per head of population with cystic fibrosis.  We should be in the vanguard in terms of research and new drug technologies.  Since I last raised this matter, I met Jillian McNulty who has CF and who has been on Orkambi for three years and three months.  It is worthwhile to meet her and hear first hand of the dramatic and transformative impact Orkambi has had on her life.  One can look at all the statistics and so forth, but one should also meet a person concerned.  There is one stunning statistic.  In the past two and a half years, Jillian has been in hospital for only ten weeks and that was due to the swine influenza.  Before she went on Orkambi, she was in hospital for eight to nine months every year.  That is her testimony to me.  She has met one of the lead researchers in Washington.  This drug has been 20 years in the pipeline and billions have been spent on bringing it to fruition.<\/p><p>There has been an attempt in recent times to talk down the effectiveness of the drug.  That is wrong.  The leak last week to <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>has been described by Cystic Fibrosis Ireland as a heartless and disgraceful form of communication by the Health Service Executive, HSE, to people with CF.  It was disgraceful and heartless but it is also part of an agenda that appears to be about talking down the effectiveness of the drug.  If it was so ineffective, why would the HSE spend 25 to 26 weeks negotiating with the company?  I do not deny that there are issues with the cost.  However, let us accept that this drug has an impact and is effective in terms of lung function, weight gain, quality of life and independence.  Jillian McNulty said that to me but there is no need to take my word or her word on the matter.  Cystic Fibrosis Ireland, in its open letter to the Minister, makes that point and it is very disappointed by the degree to which the acknowledged international research is in many ways being dismissed by the HSE and others.  It also references Professor Stuart Elborn of Royal Brompton Hospital, a leading facility for the treatment of CF, in this regard.  The research to which I refer points to the extraordinary impact the drug is having and how exciting it is, not just in the short term but also for its long-term impact on the condition.<\/p><p>Will the Government intervene to ensure that this drug is made available?

It is an issue of considerable concern, particularly for sufferers.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has made it clear that he wishes to make progress on this issue.<\/p><p>There is no attempt by the Government to talk down the benefits of this.  Indeed, other Ministers have met families directly affected and are very aware of the concerns.  However, approval of a drug of this nature has been taken out of the political process, as the Deputy knows.  We have decided, as an Oireachtas, that this would be decided based on the medical evidence and we have appointed those to be expert on this.  As the Deputy rightly said in his comments, both the effectiveness and the cost must be considered.  The National Centre for Pharmoeconomics, NCPE, which has expertise in this area, has been clear that it views that this company is not approaching this in the proper way and is not showing sufficient concern for patients' needs in the approach it is taking to the pricing of this particular product.  There have been intense discussions between the Health Service Executive and the company to seek to get agreement.<\/p> <p> It is not without note that none of the other Governments that have sought to find agreement have been able to reach agreement.  Canada, Australia and other countries have not been able to reach agreement with this company and the Minister for Health has taken the step of aligning himself with those other countries in order that we can form a group together to get a proper and decent outcome for patients suffering from this condition, some of whom can significantly benefit from this product, of that there is no doubt.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, is acutely aware of the position and is not only continuing to press the work that is done here but is seeking to get co-operation from across other Governments and Ministers for health who are in a similar position seeking to get a good outcome for their patients.  The product has to be brought within an affordable level.  The NCPE has to be in a position to show that this treatment will be effective at the price at which the drug is being provided.  That work is being pursued very intensively.  The Minister has taken the unusual step of seeking to get a coalition of other Governments to approach this company in a concerted way in order that we can get assurance that this product, which has hugely beneficial effects for some sufferers of cystic fibrosis, can be made available.  I assure the Deputy that everything will be done but it will be done within the legal provision that we have all agreed in this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000003#A00300","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480507500,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I do not accept the Minister's response in its entirety.

There is a lot of medical evidence that has not come to the fore and there has been an attempt to talk it down.  I believe the context of the discussions would change if there was an acceptance that this drug was effective and was an impactful therapy for people with cystic fibrosis.

I welcome aspects of the report, particularly the call for constitutional protection to keep our water services in public ownership.  Sinn F&eacute;in has long argued for that.  I also welcome the commission's recognition that the best way to pay for general domestic water usage is through general taxation.  Sinn F&eacute;in has long argued that case also.  The report rightly recommends fair treatment for those on group water schemes and those who paid the Government's water charge.  In Sinn F&eacute;in's view, this means no domestic charges for those on such schemes or those with their own water sources and involves refunding those who paid the Government's water charges to date but - and this is a big \"but\" - we do not support the commission's proposal for a charge on so-called excessive use.  This, in reality, is simply a rehash of the original Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party proposal devised in 2009 and it would inevitably lead to the introduction of across-the-board water charges in the future.  A low charge now to soften the blow before hiking charges in the future is how the story goes and that is not acceptable.  Given Fine Gael's and, indeed, Fianna F&aacute;il's track record on water charges, how could anyone trust them not to increase water charges in the future?  The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government said as much this morning.  He stated, \"No water charges for the moment\".<\/p>  <p>  Having flip flopped from one position to another more times than I care to remember, we learned this morning that Fianna F&aacute;il is proposing to introduce a super-tax of combined water charges and property tax.  A super-tax from super-Fianna F&aacute;il.  Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to scrapping both.  In any event, the report acknowledges that determining what is excessive water usage would be extremely difficult to calculate.  It is also highly likely that the cost of administering and enforcing such a scheme would be greater than the revenue that might be realised.  Let us be clear that citizens have demanded no water charges through the front door or through the back door.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government's statement this morning, is it the Government's intention to pursue those who did not or who could not pay its water charges?  If so, will this be done through the courts, the Revenue or deductions from social welfare payments?  Will the Government act to enshrine water services in public ownership?  Will the Minister commit today to a referendum being held in respect of this matter in the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000005#C00200","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1480508100,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank all those who have been involved in drawing up this report.  It is a useful piece of work done under the chairmanship of Mr. Kevin Duffy and it shows that a great deal of expertise was brought to bear on the issue.  The report allows us to have a genuine conversation about the future of water.  The Deputy has selectively picked parts that she likes and chosen to ignore others.  What we now have to do in the political environment that exists is use the committee that has been established, and on which Sinn F&eacute;in is represented, to tease out the issues that have been highlighted.  How do we ensure that genuine people who did their civic duty are treated equally and not put at a disadvantage in respect of this matter?  We equally must examine how we might deal with the fact that there is in the legislation an absolute assurance that no change in ownership can occur without a plebiscite.  We have to decide whether we need to go further than that.  The Deputy has expressed her view, but I am certainly content to wait for the committee to tease out this matter.  The commission has also made it clear that it believes the polluter pays principle, which is at the heart of a great deal of thinking about the use of water, would be met by making normal usage free.  That would be decided by an independent regulator, not the Government.<\/p><p>Where people are using manifestly excessive amounts of water, that would be paid for.  There is a large element of fairness in that.<\/p> <p> Much of the discussion during the general election campaign focused on the need to bring about greater fairness and to ensure that our economic success would be used in a fairer way.  Making sure that we use resources in a fair way has been at the heart of the thinking of the new Government.  The commission has pointed the way to some elements of how water should be dealt with in a fair way.  These elements include the principle of the polluter pays.  They also include ensuring that no person who did his or her civic duty and paid up will be left at a disadvantage.  They further include, as the Deputy rightly says, that those who are involved in group schemes and other schemes will not be placed at a disadvantage.  That is very valuable food for thought.<\/p> <p> I am content to work within the committee.  Fine Gael members will work with others on the committee to find a sensible route forward for a resource that is immensely important to our social and economic progress and which needs an investment in the near term of &euro;5.5 billion and in the longer term, according to Irish Water, one of &euro;13 billion.  We need to have a sustainable approach.  It will not be achieved by individual parties grandstanding and saying they are going to stand on this ground and not consider any other opportunities or options.  We have to behave in accordance with the way we were elected.  We are legislators.  We have to deliberate on what has been provided to us as expert opinion and draw conclusions collectively.

That is what the majority of Deputies, including this crowd here in Fianna F&aacute;il, were elected to do.  Committee or no committee, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, was quite clear in saying that those who have not paid will be pursued.  I want to know what that means.  Does that mean that this matter will go through the courts?  Will the Government use the Revenue Commissioners?  Will it deduct money from people's social welfare payments?  I will enlighten colleagues that this is not a matter which those affected will be happy to leave in abeyance or about which they will just wait and see.  Lots of people paid this charge because the Government browbeat and bullied them into it.  Many did not pay because they simply will not pay as a matter of principle.  Lots more did not pay because they could not pay.

In fact, we use 20% less water per household than Britain does, which has had charges and meters for many years.  There is, therefore, no excuse or justification on the basis of water conservation for water charges.  Irish people are conscientious in their use of household water.

Climate change must be fought on multiple fronts.  One such front, as outlined in Article 2 of the Paris Agreement, relates to ensuring that finance flows are consistent with the pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.  My Bill seeks to ensure that Ireland's financial flows are consistent with action on climate change.<\/p><p>It instructs the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, to divest public money managed by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, from fossil fuel companies.  Currently, Ireland invests &euro;133 million of taxpayers' money in global fossil fuel companies through the ISIF.  Under the Bill, this money will be withdrawn over five years and the ISIF will be banned from future investments in the fossil fuel industry.  Ireland must face up to the disproportionate role of fossil fuel companies in causing climate change.  It is urgent that we participate in the global phasing out of fossil fuel exploration, extraction and combustion in a timely manner in order that we can meet the commitments set out in the Paris Agreement.<\/p> <p> This is not just ethical financing; it is also responsible financing.  Recent research commissioned by Tr&oacute;caire shows that getting out of the fossil fuel industry makes financial sense for the ISIF as fossil fuel investments are becoming increasingly risky.  Expert analysis shows that the fund lost &euro;22 million last year and approximately &euro;100 million over the past three years by investing money in the fossil fuel industry rather than in companies working for climate solutions.<\/p> <p> Next week we will be discussing the Government's draft mitigation plan so it is timely to discuss fossil fuel divestment.  I remind the Government of the overwhelming public support for this move.  More than 10,000 people have signed Tr&oacute;caire's petition over recent months which calls on the Government to stop investing in the fossil fuel industry, and 25 organisations and networks throughout the country have made a formal submission to the Government on the issue.  Support is also growing internationally for divestment.  More than 600 institutions globally, including major universities such as the University of Glasgow and Stanford University in the US and major cities such as Berlin, Copenhagen, Stuttgart, Oslo and Sydney, have divested their funds from fossil fuel companies.  The Amalgamated Bank in the US is the first bank to announce divestment of all its fossil fuel assets, and many insurance companies are also offloading fossil fuel investments.<\/p> <p> Ireland has taken similar moves before.  In response to global calls, the Cluster Munitions and Anti-Personnel Mines Act 2008 was introduced, preventing the ISIF from investing in 19 companies on the basis of their work on cluster munitions.  We would be the first State to divest its public money from fossil fuel companies and lead on the issue of climate change.  I thank Tr&oacute;caire for its hard work on this Bill and its public campaign on fossil fuel divestment.  I look forward to working with everyone in the House as the Bill progresses through the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000013#L02000","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480512900,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000014#M00150","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1480512900,"counter":157,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000014#M00175","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480512900,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1480512900,"counter":159,"content":"<p>As this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000014#M00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1480512900,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000014#M00400","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480512900,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1480512900,"counter":162,"content":"<p>The debate is hereby adjourned.

This is a very important Bill and is critical for a growing industry in Ireland.  The Bill deals with an anomaly concerning craft brewers and distillers who are not allowed to sell their own produce on their own sites.<\/p><p>Craft brewing and distilling is a growing industry which currently employs approximately 1,000 people directly and indirectly.  There are craft brewers and distillers in every county in the country.  Many of these distillers and brewers wish to open visitor centres to attract more customers for their product.  Unfortunately, however, if one visits such a centre at the moment, one cannot purchase the actual product.  Imagine taking a tour of a vineyard in Italy, Spain or France but not being able to purchase a bottle of wine there.  It is, frankly, ridiculous.  The Bill deals with this anomaly and allows brewers and distillers to sell only their own produce on site.  This is critical.  They cannot sell anything that has been re-labelled or produced elsewhere.  They can only sell what is produced on that site.  They will be allowed to sell their produce from 10 a.m. until 6 p.m.<\/p><p>F&aacute;ilte Ireland, where I worked once upon a time, has stated that the craft brewing and distilling industry has enormous potential to increase tourism.  The turnover in craft brewing has grown exponentially in recent years.  In fact, there has been an 11 fold increase in the past five years alone.<\/p><p>The potential volume of people who could be employed if we made this legislative change is huge because with tourists coming to this country and from throughout the country to visit these sites, awareness of brands such as Irish brands of whiskey from 100 years ago that became so popular around the world will increase and more people will purchase them.  As a consequence, if this Bill is introduced, we will see a direct financial gain for many sectors.  For example, in terms of the construction industry, a number of growers are planning to build new visitor centres.  There will be gains in the distribution area, the transport sector, the agricultural sector - the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is in the Chamber - in terms of the growth of crops, in sales and in the production area where there will be more people employed.  In totality, we will have an industry that will be able to grow from strength to strength.<\/p> <p> I visited the White Gypsy Brewery in my constituency and while there I discovered that a number of craft brewer enthusiasts who had visited the brewery were shocked that they could not purchase the produce at the end of their short tour.  As a result, working with the independent craft brewers of Ireland and meeting some of the craft distillers, we came around to drafting this legislation to deal with that anomaly.  It will create significant growth in the industry and allow it to multiply in serious numbers the volume of people who will be employed across a range of sectors.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has indicated that it will create a new tourism product surrounding this area. <\/p> <p> This is important legislation.  I ask Members across the House and across the political spectrum to support this Bill.  The brewers would appreciate it if the Bill could be passed through the House swiftly because of their plans to grow the industry.  I ask the Government to accept and support this Bill so that we can get it passed quickly by the House.  The brewers will be launching the Bill this day week and I ask anyone who is available to support it.  All the brewers will be in touch with all their local Deputies asking them to support this legislation in the coming days and weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000014#M00800","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480513500,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000015#N00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1480513500,"counter":167,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000015#N00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480513500,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1480513500,"counter":169,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000015#N00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1480513500,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000015#N00600","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480513500,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1480513500,"counter":172,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 147(4), the Bill will be taken on the next day on which Private Members' business is to be taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000015#N00800","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Flood Insurance Bill 2016: Motion to Discharge Order for Referral to Select Committee","time":1480513500,"counter":173,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000015#N00850"},{"type":"speech","time":1480513500,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I understand it is proposed now to discharge the order made yesterday referring the Flood Insurance Bill 2016 to the Select Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and to refer it instead to the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000015#N00862","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1480513500,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the motion to refer the Flood Insurance Bill 2016 to the Select Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government be discharged.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000015#N00875","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480513500,"counter":176,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Flood Insurance Bill 2016: Referral to Select Committee","time":1480513500,"counter":177,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000015#N00900"},{"type":"speech","time":1480513500,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach pursuant to Standing Orders 84A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 141.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000015#N01000","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480513500,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1480513500,"counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000015#N01200"},{"type":"speech","time":1480513500,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Jonathan O'Brien - the housing situation for survivors of the Carrickmines fire;

For 2015 and 2016, the Commission moved from a 75% advance and allowed member states to pay up to 85%.  To comply with regulatory and audit requirements, a full suite of checks must be carried out on all payment claims and this work cannot commence until after 15 May, the closing date for submission of the basic payment scheme application.  For many of the rural development programme schemes, 2016 is the first full year of payment and 2016 payments for a number of the schemes are scheduled to issue in December.<\/p><p>The current position for each of the schemes in the RDP in respect of 2016 payments is as follows.

For 2016, the allocation is &euro;202 million, and we are on schedule to pay this full allocation by year end.  In 2015, some &euro;207 million was paid under the scheme.  Processing of the ANC scheme payments commenced on schedule during the third week in September with almost 65,000 applicants being paid a total of &euro;140.9 million.  To date, over 87,000 applicants have been paid a total of &euro;188 million.  In addition, over &euro;10 million has been paid this year in respect of the 2015 scheme year.  As is normal at this stage of the year, a number of applicants have not yet fulfilled the scheme eligibility requirements regarding stocking density but will do so, hopefully, before the end of the year.<\/p><p>Payments under the beef data and genomics programme are calculated on the basis of the number of calved cows in 2014 and the eligible hectares of forage land declared on the 2014 single payment scheme application.  Payments amounting to &euro;44 million have now been made to almost 24,000 farmers of which &euro;29 million was paid to almost 16,000 farmers in December 2015.

To date 4,965 approvals have issued across the initial four tranches of the TAMS II schemes.  Payment is made when the approved works have been completed.

Projected further spend to end of year is &euro;1 million.  It is expected that outstanding REPS payments will be made in the first week of December.  These will almost exclusively be payments for supplementary measures which are made one year in arrears.  The bulk of REPS participants exited the scheme at the end of 2014 with less than 850 remaining in the scheme to the end of 2015.<\/p><p>The agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, 2016 allocation is &euro;38.4 million and expenditure to 14 November is &euro;15.1 million, with a projected further spend of &euro;21 million before year end.<\/p><p>Under the green low carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, over &euro;17 million has issued in respect of the 2015 scheme year.

The Minister knows as well as I do the enormous pressure that agriculture has been under this year, across nearly all sectors.  There are significant cash-flow pressures.  It has been a difficult year for dairy and a difficult year for sheep, and an exceptionally difficult year for the tillage sector, and, indeed, for beef.

EU regulations governing the national reserve provide that the two mandatory categories of &quot;young farmer&quot; and &quot;new entrant to farming&quot; must receive priority access to the reserve.  A young farmer is defined as a farmer aged no more than 40 years of age in the year when they first submit an application under the basic payment scheme and who commenced their farming activity no more than five years prior to submitting that application.  A new entrant to farming is defined as a farmer who commenced their agricultural activity during the previous two years and did not have any agricultural activity in their own name and at their own risk in the five years preceding the start of the current agricultural activity.<\/p><p>Returning emigrants who meet the eligibility criteria for applicants under the national reserve will be eligible to submit an application for an allocation of entitlements.  The terms and conditions applicable to all categories under the national reserve require applicants to have a gross off-farm income of &euro;40,000 or less in either of the two tax years prior to the year in which the application is made to the national reserve.  All national reserve applicants must also comply with requirements in terms of an agricultural education qualification at Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, level 6 or equivalent.<\/p><p>The regulations governing the operation of the national reserve also include an optional provision whereby member states may use the national reserve to allocate new entitlements or give a top-up on the value of existing entitlements for persons who suffer from a &quot;specific disadvantage&quot;.  Support for such categories can only be considered once the two mandatory categories of young farmer and new entrant have been catered for.  Decisions regarding the eligibility of farmers under the specific disadvantage category of the national reserve require the approval of the European Commission.<\/p><p>Following my Department&rsquo;s consultation with the European Commission, the then Minister announced in March 2015 that the group commonly known as old young farmers, who established their holding between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2009, and who, due to the timeframe of setting up their holding, did not benefit from either the installation aid or the young farmer category of the national reserve, could be considered as a &quot;group suffering from specific disadvantage&quot;.  Following approval by the European Commission, this group was eligible to apply under the national reserve measure of the 2015 basic payment scheme.  Some 280 applicants were successful under the old young farmer category of the 2015 national reserve.  Therefore the old young farmer group has already been catered for under the 2015 national reserve.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>The group commonly known as the forgotten farmer group comprises farmers aged under 40 who established their holdings prior to 2008 and who hold no entitlements or low value entitlements.  Preliminary analysis carried out by my Department shows there are 3,900 farmers in this category.  An estimation of the cost of increasing the value of existing entitlements to the national average for these 3,900 farmers stands at in excess of &euro;12 million.  A Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to further pursue the category of forgotten farmers at EU level.<\/p><p>In 2015, the national reserve fund was based on a 3% cut to the basic payment scheme financial ceiling and provided &euro;24 million in funding which was the maximum financing rate available under the relevant EU regulations.  There was no national reserve in 2016 as all available funding had been utilised under the 2015 scheme.  To provide for a national reserve in 2017, funding is required to replenish the reserve.  EU regulations governing the scheme provide that funding for the replenishment of the national reserve may be obtained by means of surrender of entitlements that remain unused by farmers for two consecutive years and by clawback derived following the sale of entitlements without land.  It is envisaged that funding derived from these two sources in 2017 will be very limited.  The regulations also provide for the option of applying a linear cut to all farmers' entitlements to fund the national reserve.  Decisions on the national reserve for 2017 will be considered once the position on potential funding has been established.<\/p><p>Consultation between departmental officials and the direct payments advisory committee, comprising members of the main farming organisations, agricultural education and farm advisory bodies, takes place annually as part of the decision-making process for the national reserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000017#P00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1480514700,"counter":197,"content":"<p>The issue is not being dealt with.

The issue here, and the Deputy hit the nail on the head, is that there is no reserve at present.  Entitlements flow into the reserve in a couple of ways.  Clawback on leases and unused entitlements for two years go into the reserve.  At present, there is practically nil in the reserve fund.<\/p>  <p>  There is another option available to put entitlements into the reserve and perhaps the Deputy will give his views on it.  It is to top slice everybody's payment.  In 2016, for understandable reasons given that it was a very difficult year, all farming organisations, with the exception of Macra na Feirme, said it could not happen.  The Deputy might indicate his support for top slicing or cutting everybody's application by 2%, 3% or the required amount to give to applicants under the categories should the forgotten farmers be eligible, and there is an issue with getting that category of disadvantaged farmers over the line in respect of European Commission approval.  However, if we get them over the line, the question is how we create an entitlement.  I cannot just divvy out the little that might be available.  I am obliged under the regulations to give them the equivalent of the national average.  That can only realistically be done by top slicing.

If the Minister were to top slice them by 5% or 6%, it would create a pool of money amounting to &euro;2 million to &euro;3 million.  Approximately 2,000 farmers receive more than &euro;50,000.  If the Minister were to top slice them by 2%, it would create approximately &euro;3 million.  That is the small amount of money required for this.  Perhaps Members across the House should consider it.  I do not believe it is something that the vast majority of Members or, indeed, the vast majority of people in the farming organisations could oppose.  We are talking about taking it from the very top and putting it into the bottom where it is needed.  I believe we should try to find a consensus on doing something of that nature.  It will not take a great deal of money.  All it requires is the will and the agreement.

This scheme is providing support to Irish farmers to deliver environmental benefits and public goods which will enhance Ireland's agriculture sustainability credentials into the future.<\/p>  <p>  This scheme is playing a critical role in enhancing Ireland's efforts to deliver sustainable agricultural production.  The scheme provides support to Irish farmers aimed at enhancement of biodiversity, water quality and mitigation of future impacts of climate change while allowing Irish farmers to improve their agricultural productivity and practices in a sustainable manner.

Food Wise 2025 includes more than 400 specific recommendations spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness.  As well as specific sectoral recommendations, Food Wise 2025 is not just about expanding production.

Forest owners may wish to fell early, delay felling or in some cases not fell at all for their own reasons.  The Department and Teagasc provide guidance to landowners on the timing of harvesting their plantations.  What is of utmost importance for the Department is to ensure, through the felling licence system, that the felling and replanting is carried out in a manner that accords with sustainable forest management principles.<\/p>  <p>  Rotation length is defined as the length of time between planting the trees and clear felling the final forest.  There are many factors that impact on the rotation length such as species, site productivity, thinning regime, market requirements and site constraints.  In addition, forests located in exposed areas may suffer from the effects of windblow resulting in the earlier harvesting of plantations.  In 2014, Storm Darwin blew down more than 8,000 hectares of forest in the country.<\/p>  <p>  Until recently, the majority of clear felling and replanting has been concentrated in the public estate.  A significant portion of the private forest estate, particularly conifers, that were afforested in the 1980s and the early 1990s are now approaching a stage where forest owners are considering the best time to fell.  In some cases forests will be thinned and in other cases clear felled, depending on the site's particular characteristics.  Conifer species typically have rotations between 30 and 40 years of age, with broadleaved crops taking much longer, in some cases more than 100 years.  Decisions made to clear fell crops are based on a variety of different reasons and to a large extent depend on the size of trees that the market will take.  We have seen very productive stands of conifers growing to sizes suitable for sawmilling in less than 30 years.<\/p>  <p>  The general principle of rotation length is to provide the optimum return to the grower, consistent with the principle of sustainable forest management.  In some cases, the need to replace unproductive trees with a more productive crop or the early clear felling of trees susceptible to windblow may lead to a crop being felled earlier.<\/p>  <p>  In February 2016, my Department invited tenders to assess the impact of forest felling age on overall financial return.  The purpose of this work is to provide information to make growers and foresters aware of the possible impact of felling age on overall financial return.  The results of this work will be made available in the coming weeks on the Department's website through a new interactive tool that allows forest owners and managers to assess the optimum felling age of their forest.  The provision of this information will inform forest owners and managers on the appropriate felling age with a view to maximising the return on their investment and remaining consistent with the principle of sustainable forest management.  It is vital that landowners have a positive experience from their forestry investments and that revenue from the first rotation facilitates reforestation to continue the forest cycle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000020#S01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1356"},{"type":"speech","time":1480516500,"counter":243,"content":"<p>The Minister of State's reply is extremely worrying.

The Government has signed the Paris Agreement.

That is what I am hearing.  The Minister of State is reinforcing that market conditions are determining this.  Best forestry practice is that trees grow for 35 to 50 years.  If we do not, as the Council for Forest Research and Development, COFORD, suggested, have a minimum of 10,000 additional hectares of forestry a year, and currently we are at 6,000 hectares, our forest estate will be a net emitter of carbon dioxide rather than a sink.

I do not know why that was the figure picked but that is the figure picked per annum.  We hope, through certain measures, to be able to get to 7,000 hectares in the next 12 months.  If the Deputy takes the current market situation, the impact of the Brexit decision on sterling has meant that prices into the UK, which is our biggest customer, have dropped by 20%.

In this context, my Department is involved in a range of research activities with a view to progressing the development of a vaccination system for badgers.<\/p>  <p>  While research has demonstrated that oral vaccination of badgers in a captive environment with the bacillus calmette&ndash;gu&eacute;rin vaccine generates high levels of protective immunity against challenge with bovine tuberculosis, field trials are being undertaken by my Department to determine whether vaccination is also effective in the field.  A vaccine trial in Kilkenny has been completed and results are expected to be published in 2017.  In addition, trials are being conducted in six separate locations throughout the country, involving the vaccination by intramuscular injection of several hundred badgers over three to four years and continual monitoring of the badger population to assess the impact of the vaccine on the incidence of disease in the cattle population.

There is currently no vaccine licensed for badgers and my Department is engaged in several research projects with a view to submitting a dossier to the licensing authorities for a licence for an oral vaccine.

My Department is hopeful that this research will be successful and that a vaccination strategy will be a significant element of the national TB control programme.

Certainly, and that is why we have programmes like beef data and genomics, which address matters of food conversion, herd fertility and other elements to reduce our carbon footprint.

As part of the budget, additional funding of &euro;700,000 has been secured for capital investments in the commercial horticulture sector.  This will increase the budget for this scheme to &euro;5 million next year.  The horticulture sector will also have access to the &euro;150 million low-interest cashflow loan support that was announced last month in the budget.  This will provide access to highly flexible loans for up to six years for amounts up to &euro;150,000 at an interest rate of 2.95%.  The impact of the devaluation of sterling on mushroom producers and grower margins is a problem that has developed over a short space of time.  Grower production of this highly perishable product must be well aligned with demand.  The mushroom sector is at particular risk because of its high dependency on the UK market.  I am monitoring closely the situation with regard to sterling volatility.  The Minister has established a dedicated unit in the Department to consider the direct impact of Brexit on the industry.  There has been a modest reversal in the decreasing sterling exchange rate, with sterling now holding at approximately 85p to the euro.  The Department and the various State agencies, particularly Bord Bia, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland, are working closely with the industry to provide the necessary support and assistance.  Bord Bia is actively supporting this sector in the areas of market intelligence, UK consumer research and quality assurance.  It recently held a currency and negotiation workshop that was specifically targeted at the sector.  I understand this was well received by the mushroom industry.<br\/><br\/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><br\/><br\/>Bord Bia is running a marketing intensification programme that aims to provide targeted marketing supports to companies with high dependency on UK markets.  Grant supports will be prioritised to assist companies in strengthening their position in that market and in their efforts to identify new markets.  In the coming weeks, I will continue to meet senior executives from the UK retailers to highlight the obstacles producers are facing.  I understand that representatives of our growers have received a more positive reaction from their UK multiple customers in recent weeks as they have sought to make the case for fair and reasonable returns for their produce from the marketplace.  I draw attention to the support being provided to the industry through national and EU schemes.  Under the 2007-13 national development plan, the Department implemented the scheme of investment aid for the development of the commercial horticulture sector.  During this period, the Department paid out &euro;4,039,629 in grant payments to mushroom growers.  This supported &euro;10.1 million in investment.  To ensure ongoing support for the sector, my Department extended the horticulture investment aid scheme under EU sanction to run until 31 December 2019.  In 2014 and 2015, a total of &euro;1,635,190 in grant aid was paid to mushroom growers.  This supported investment of &euro;4.1 million by those growers.  Under the 2016 horticulture investment aid scheme, my Department issued approvals of &euro;1.33 million in aid to growers in the mushroom sector, supporting &euro;3.3 million in proposed investment.  I will provide a commitment to ensure payments under this scheme are made as early as possible to try to alleviate financial pressures growers are facing.  The EU producer organisation scheme is a vital support for mushroom growers.  Approximately 65% of Irish growers are in a producer organisation at present.  This scheme is an important mechanism that allows growers to achieve greater bargaining power in the marketplace by becoming part of a larger supply base.  A total of &euro;39.8 million was paid to mushroom producer organisations as part of the producer organisation scheme between 2005 and 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000023#V01500","speaker":"1356","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480518900,"counter":314,"content":"<p>While the establishment of the cashflow support agricultural loan scheme is welcome, I suggest it is a kind of patchwork solution.

Some farmers did not even sow any crops so they cannot generate income.  The concern is that the Minister is not focusing on the tillage sector, where there was a major mishap.

At the meeting in question, for example, a figure quoted by one of the participants was that 80% of the spring barley crop is planted on the basis of merchant credit.  Merchant credit costs are equivalent to credit card costs.  If this product can, at a rate of 2.95%, substitute for merchant credit, it will be far more effective and will improve cash flow.  There are other more critical structural issues for the tillage industry that need to be grappled with but this is one response.  It is not a panacea and I do not have the silver bullet that will solve all of the issues for the industry.

Teagasc has stated that only 37% of farms are economically viable.  Growth <i>per capita<\/i>in the west is one quarter of what it is in Dublin.  Broadband speeds in the regions that have broadband are 36 times slower than they are in Dublin.  The north-west quarter of the country is without a rail line or a decent motorway.  Where rail transport exists, it is far too slow.  The western rail corridor, which should be very important to the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, remains unfinished.<\/p><p>It was recently announced that water would be pumped from the Parteen basin to Dublin.  While I have not taken a decision yet on whether this is the right thing to do, my instinctive thought at the time was that instead of pumping all of this water from the Parteen basin to Dublin, why not put the jobs and the growth in Limerick, right beside the water?  This is another example of infrastructure being built to service Dublin at a cost to the State.<\/p><p>The problem is that the Government has a scatter-gun approach to development.  Thankfully, a limited amount of money is being spent in some areas but it is being spent without a plan.  There is no spatial plan in existence in this State.  The State has been developing in a haphazard, <i>ad hoc<\/i>fashion for a long time.  The national spatial plan has been defunct since 2002 and we are still awaiting the national planning framework.  What it boils down to is Governments fire-fighting in respect of infrastructure in a rudderless fashion.<\/p><p>The Minister of State can see that this as well as I and I am sure his constituents can feel it.  We are living in a lopsided economy.  There is a damaging over-concentration of resources, economic activity and jobs in the Dublin area.  One only need look at Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland as an example.<\/p><p>In recent years most of the jobs supported by Enterprise Ireland and the Industrial Development Authority have landed in Dublin and Cork.  In 2010, 37% of inward investment from the IDA was outside Cork and Dublin.  In 2011 that figure was 27%: in 2012 it fell to 23%.  The figures have recently improved slightly due to the lack of space in Dublin for new firms.  Approximately 60% of inward investment is skewed towards Dublin.  Not only is rural Ireland gutted by this rudderless Government but Dublin is overheating.  The population of Dublin is approximately 40% that of the State.  That is out of kilter with the European norm.  Even in Britain, for example, where London is considered too big compared with the rest of the country only approximately 13% of the population lives there.  The Government is on its way to drawing 50% of the population to the capital city.  That is shockingly dangerous for those who live in and outside the city.<\/p> <p> Even though that population lives in and around Dublin there are farms within the M50.  Thornton Hall, which the Government owns, is under potatoes yet there are people commuting into Dublin from Cavan, Leitrim and Laois.  Where is the sense in that?  Schools in the west are shedding pupils.  Consider the cost of the new schools the Government is building in the mid-east of the country while schools are withering and dying in the west.  Where is the financial logic in that lack of development?  That is why I am calling on the Government to focus on a plan of action.  There is no plan.  The Government is staggering along in a rudderless fashion and the cost is family life, investment and economic activity in the rest of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000025#X01300","speaker":"1235","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480520100,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue.  Responsibility for key elements of the Government's regional development strategy is shared across a number of Departments and State agencies.  For instance, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation oversees the eight regional action plans for jobs, which play a key role in ensuring job growth and enterprise generation across the country.  The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is responsible for spatial planning and housing and is currently preparing a new national planning framework which will form the basis for future development and investment decisions in the regions.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has policy responsibility for transport infrastructure, ports and airport policy.  The financial allocations for these and other areas of investment are set out in the capital investment plan to 2021, which was published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  This Government has been very proactive in terms of regional development and it is clear that policies such as the regional action plans for jobs and the work of agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Udar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta are having a significant positive effect on the development of the regions.  This is borne out by the latest employment figures for the regions.  In the past year, employment has grown in all regions of the country, not just Dublin, and employment nationally has been growing continuously for 16 quarters.  In quarter three of 2016, data from the Central Statistics Office shows that 72% of all jobs created in the past year were created outside Dublin.  Unemployment has fallen in all regions.  The Government has set a target of creating an extra 200,000 jobs by 2020, with 135,000 of these outside Dublin.  The first progress reports for the regional action plans for jobs will be published shortly and they will show the enormously beneficial work being undertaken across the regions to ensure that a supportive environment is in place for the creation of jobs and the cultivation of enterprise.<\/p>  <p>  As part of this process, I understand that the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Enterprise Ireland are developing proposals for a regional funding initiative which is aimed at supporting projects and activities that assist, sustain and create jobs in the regions.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of capital investment, the national broadband plan constitutes one of the single biggest investments in rural Ireland for generations, perhaps since rural electrification, and it carries the same level of opportunity in terms of the development of the regions.  Under the plan, the Government has committed to delivering a high speed broadband network to more than 750,000 premises, covering 100,000 kms of road network and 96% of the land area of the country.  The implementation of the national broadband plan will allow communities and businesses in rural areas to compete effectively and realise their full potential.<\/p>  <p>  In advance of the award of contracts for the roll out of the plan next year, my Department is working closely with the local authorities in every county to facilitate the installation of the broadband infrastructure by identifying and overcoming potential barriers to this installation.  The local authorities have also identified approximately 400 strategic sites in their administrative areas which would be ideally suited as priority connection points for high speed broadband.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to highlight the ongoing developmental work currently being undertaken by my Department in respect of the commitment in the programme for Government to explore the idea of an Atlantic economic corridor.  I led discussions with key public bodies on this initiative and more recently my Department undertook a round of discussions with the various chambers of commerce in the western region which published a concept document at the start of the year.  A further meeting will take place early in the new year with a view to scoping out a work plan to progress this project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000026#Y00200","speaker":"1334"},{"type":"speech","time":1480520100,"counter":347,"content":"<p>The biggest problem affecting the country into the future is split between too many Departments.

The budget for regional development is not within that Department.<\/p>  <p>  As an example of what is happening to this city, traffic on the M50 is growing at ten times the European average.  Commutes are slowing down or grinding to a halt if there is an accident on the motorway at the cost of local business.  This makes us uncompetitive for foreign direct investment in the future.  Meath is another example.  It is a great county with really energetic people yet its role in this confused spatial development is that of a dormitory county.  The population is increasing fast, to almost 200,000.  More Meath workers leave the county every day to work than stay to work there.  We have the longest commute in the State.  Rush hour is at a crawl at the Meath-Dublin border which is miles away from Blanchardstown.  Navan is the biggest town in the State without a rail line.  This Government will likely build an extra lane on the M50 before it will build the 16 km of rail line necessary from Pace to Meath.<\/p>  <p>  In 25 years&rsquo; time there will be 9 million living on the island of Ireland.

The steering group is now assisting with the physical and emotional recovery of those involved which includes the provision of health care and supports for survivors, along with responding to community welfare needs and the clean-up of the damaged site as well as the restoration of infrastructure and public services.<\/p><p>In relation to the accommodation needs, my Department worked with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to identify suitable temporary accommodation for the family concerned in the immediate aftermath of the Carrickmines tragedy.  Temporary emergency accommodation has been in place for the family in Ballyogan, Carrickmines, since October 2015.  The accommodation provided includes five three-bedroom mobile homes with shower and bathroom facilities, together with a separate utility area for each unit.<\/p><p>  A site at Glendruid, Shankill, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown was identified by the local authority in its Traveller accommodation programme for 2014 to 2018 for a group housing scheme to meet the needs of the Connors family.  Funding approval was granted by my Department for these works and the refurbishment of the site was completed at the end of 2015.  The family, however, indicated that this was not their preferred location.  Subsequently, the site was allocated to other Traveller families who requested Traveller-specific accommodation.  Following discussions with the family regarding their preferred options, the council proposes to develop a permanent four-bay halting site at Glenamuck Road, Carrickmines, which is in accordance with the local authority&rsquo;s Traveller accommodation programme.  The planning process was completed in July of this year and, following a submission from the council, my Department issued approval to the council to proceed to tender in September.  The council anticipates that the accommodation will be ready for occupation by the family in summer 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000027#Z00400","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1480520700,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I do not know if the Minister of State has the information on whether the tender has been signed for the permanent site, which is proposed to be open in July 2017.

Could the Minister of State outline some of the remedial works which have been carried out or which are proposed to be carried out on the temporary site on which the families are currently living?  It is my understanding that the site is surrounded by a number of large pylons and is rat infested.  The conditions are less than adequate, to say the very least.  While it is a temporary site, we are now asking the families to spend a minimum of another seven months on that particular site.

She understands my passion about improving youth services in County Kildare and the demographic challenges we face.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister for engaging with representatives of Kildare youth services in recent months.  She met them in mid-November and also back in June when she was in Kildare town to open the Hive youth hub, a great facility for young people in the town.  I hope these meetings and engagements, as well as the discussions I have had with the Minister, have helped to highlight for her the scale of the challenges facing Kildare in providing youth services and helped her to understand the unique position of my county.<\/p>  <p>  Kildare has a growing population as well as an above average youth population.  This is coupled with a low level of service provision across the spectrum from essential universal services to specialised services.  The Minister witnessed the strong, positive and established inter-agency relationships that exist in the county's children and young peoples' services committee and the local community development committee.  This allows us to maximise the impact of available resources and produce tangible results such as the Hive, which the Minister visited.<\/p>  <p>  The group presented a proposal to the Minister setting out the resources required to begin to increase service levels for children, young people and families in Kildare.  I wish to focus specifically on three areas: the need for a dedicated youth officer for Kildare, the need to increase the number of family resource centres, and the proposal to buy the Hive building.  Kildare shares a youth officer with County Wicklow.  The post is funded through the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, KWETB.  Kildare's population is one of the fastest growing in the State.  According to the 2016 census, the population increased by 5.6% compared with the national average of 3.7%.  According to the 2011 census, 28.3% of the population in Kildare is aged 17 and under compared with the national average of 25%. I expect that trend to continue and to be reflected in the 2016 census results.  Kildare is too big a county, with an above average youth population, not to have its own dedicated youth officer.  Will the Minister outline the engagement to date between her Department and KWETB to address impediments to filling such a crucial post?<\/p>  <p>  There are only two family resource centres in the whole county catering for more than 220,000 people.  Counties with much lower populations have considerably more family resource centres.  Kerry has 12, Donegal has nine and Mayo has seven, but the population in each of those counties is far smaller than that of Kildare.  I know from engaging with our family resource centres the value of the work they do.  We need more of them in our county.<\/p>  <p>  There is a proposal to buy the Hive building in Kildare town from An Post.  This is a cost-effective proposal which would greatly add to youth facilities, not just in the town but in the county as a whole.  The Hive provides a youth caf&eacute; and meeting space, services which were not previously available.  The plan was to pilot a youth hub for the entire county, and such a venture could operate out of the current space.  We need to secure the building to secure and maintain the current provision of services and facilities and to expand them.  The inter-agency approach is established in Kildare and a lot more can be done.  The purchase of the building is a one-off cost the Department should consider in its budget for 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000028#AA00300","speaker":"1237"},{"type":"speech","time":1480521300,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Heydon for raising these issues which, as he has said, we have spoken about several times.<\/p><p>My Department provides funding for schemes and programmes to support youth services.  These services are for young people throughout the country, including those from disadvantaged communities.  An estimated 380,000 young people benefit from this funding.  Approximately 1,400 youth work staff work in 477 projects supported by the Government.  What is also important is that 40,000 volunteers give their time and expertise to these very valuable projects.  Funding of &euro;51 million was provided in 2016 to my Department for these schemes.  A sum of &euro;2.6 million in capital funding was also provided in budget 2016 and is being used to support small-scale projects in local youth services such as refurbishment, health and safety fit-outs and accessibility improvements.<\/p><p>  A sum of &euro;500,405 has been allocated in 2016 for the projects and services under Kildare youth services which operates under Youth Work Ireland.  This was an increase of more than &euro;12,000 on the previous year&rsquo;s allocation.  My Department provides funding to Kildare youth services under the special projects for youth scheme for six local youth projects in Athy, Naas, Leixlip, Newbridge, the Curragh and Kildare town and for a youth information centre in Naas.<\/p><p>  I was delighted to visit and launch the Hive youth hub in Kildare town last June, to which Deputy Heydon referred.  As he knows, &euro;50,000 in capital funding was provided towards the cost of developing this youth caf&eacute; facility which offers a safe environment for young people.  My Department supports youth work activities at a local level through the local youth club grant scheme.  Under this scheme grants are made available to all youth clubs and groups through local education and training boards, ETBs.  More than 100 clubs in Kildare and Wicklow received grants under the 2016 scheme.  A sum of &euro;93,294 has been allocated to KWETB for this purpose in 2016.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Heydon outlined, I recently met representatives of Kildare local community development and the children and young people&rsquo;s services committee for Kildare to discuss their proposals.  Officials from my Department also met representatives of Kildare youth services and have visited Kildare to hear about their work and their proposals for providing services in County Kildare.<\/p><p>  At local level, youth officers of the ETBs have an important support role, on behalf of my Department, to local youth services.  They work closely together to address issues that arise for local services.  The Deputy will be aware that a number of funding schemes supporting youth services were the subject of a value for money and policy review in 2014.  That review involved an in-depth scrutiny of the impact youth service provision has on the lives of young people.<\/p><p>Work on the development of a new funding scheme has been prioritised by my Department.  Consultations with youth services continue with a view to introducing the new youth funding programme in line with the review over the coming years.  There is one youth officer in post covering Wicklow and Kildare ETB.  The officer is active in both counties.  My Department has started a mapping exercise with all ETBs as part of a value for money exercise.  The results of that exercise are due before Christmas, and officials will analyse the results early in 2017.  If there is evidence to support the provision of funding for a second youth officer post, this will be considered.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, budget 2017 has provided an additional &euro;5.5 million in current funding to my Department to support the provision of youth services.  That funding will be used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work.  In conjunction with national organisations and local services we are identifying local service development needs for 2017 and will complete that process as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000028#AA00400","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480521900,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her detailed response, her overall interest in the issue and, in particular, its impact in south Kildare.<\/p>  <p>  As a county, Kildare is not fully understood.  Its scale, the number of people who live in it, including the number of children and young people, the growth rate and the level of need our county is experiencing is sometimes underestimated.  County Kildare faces particular challenges.  Historically, we have very low levels of those services across the spectrums I mentioned earlier.  Traditional definitions and interpretations of deprivation and the manner in which those apply in resource allocation do not appropriately reflect and respond to the complex needs of our county.  In addition, our county's geography poses a challenge for service provision due to the urban and rural mix and its sheer scale.<\/p>  <p>  However, the biggest challenge we have faced in Kildare is the perception of affluence that does not mirror reality in every corner of the county.  I ask that the Department would take that on board and help us to expand our family resource provision, purchase the Hive building and get our dedicated youth officer.<\/p>  <p>  On the specific area of youth services, the Minister and the Department must recognise and understand the demographics of our very young population and our historically low service levels and realise that in playing catch-up, we need to do more than just provide for a small increase, as the rest of the county gets a small increase, because the recession hit us hardest due to our levels being low before the recession.  When the cuts came, they cut to the bone in Kildare South and there are statistics that point to that.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to the review in 2017 and to working with the Minister further with a view to getting improved resources into youth services provision in Kildare, south Kildare in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000029#BB00200","speaker":"1237"},{"type":"speech","time":1480521900,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Heydon.

I also welcome members of the business community from Navan and Athboy who are in the public Gallery viewing proceedings.  I sincerely hope to have a positive engagement with the Minister on this issue given his firm commitment and stance on sustainable models of public transport.<\/p>  <p>  In the summer 2010, we saw the recommencement of rail passenger services from the Docklands station in Dublin to Dunboyne, which saw for the first time since 1947 passenger services back in those stations.  It was the first phase of a major project to bring the rail line back to Navan.  It was a momentous occasion for those of us who travelled on that special train that day as we looked forward to seeing the extension of the line to Navan.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2011, final plans were compiled and the project was ready to move to the rail order stage.  That would have seen the 35 km of line being constructed from the M3 railway station at Pace, taking in places like Drumree, the expanding village of Kilmessan and eventually into Navan, with stations at both Navan central and north Navan in Windtown being constructed.<\/p>  <p>  The second phase of the project was anticipated to cost in the region of &euro;550 million and was probably the most significant transport and economic project for Navan in decades.  Thousands of people bought homes in Navan in the previous decade in anticipation of that line coming to Navan.  Alas, the project was suspended when the new Government came to power in February 2011.  What was even worse was the fact that the planning process for the project was not progressed even though the previous Minister had brought it to the point of advancement before leaving office.<\/p>  <p>  The desperate need for that second phase to be completed manifests itself each morning on the congested roads from Meath into Dublin.  I know there are huge demands on the Minister from TDs who already have rail services in their counties but who are looking for them to be expanded or retained but Navan is the only town in the greater Dublin area, and of any major capital town in the Leinster region, that does not have a passenger rail service.  The negative impact on Meath&rsquo;s capital town has been hugely significant both from a transport point of view and in terms of quality of life and it has been crippling in terms of our economic development.<\/p>  <p>  There was capital road investment, most notably in the form of the M3.  That project was mired in the courts and construction was delayed.  However, that project alone does not present a sustainable model of transport because even before they leave the motorway at Blanchardstown, people join the bottleneck of traffic when the road network condenses back into single carriageway traffic the entire way into the city centre.  It is brain damaging, and for the National Transport Authority to say it is investing in the bus system in lieu of the rail project being abandoned is no solution either because people are stuck on roads that cannot be extended in width any further.<\/p>  <p>  The town of Navan is hugely important from a regional planning point of view and the huge numbers of people who moved from the city put huge pressures on our physical and social infrastructure.  We have made great strides in terms of educational, sporting and cultural infrastructure but the critical piece of infrastructure lacking is the rail line.  The fact that it remains off the agenda is severely hampering our county and towns.<\/p>  <p>  Our latest economic strategy from our County Economic Department Plan illustrated that 54% of our population leave Meath each day to go to their place of work.  That is some 33,000 people leaving each morning.  We have the biggest outbound commuter population of any county in the country.  Seventy-six per cent of those people are trying to make their way into the congested city of Dublin.  That is a massive 25,000 people, mostly in the 20 to 44 age category.  Those statistics provide the compelling evidence for the Minister to take a serious look at this project and breathe new life into it.<\/p>  <p>  Some weeks ago the Minister committed to going to Westmeath with Deputy Willie Penrose to look at the rail situation in his county.  I want to extend the same invitation to him now to look at the potential for the extension of the line from Dunboyne to Navan.  I hope the Minister will accept that invite and that he will make his way to my home town early in the morning so he can see the choked arteries with the traffic coming in the opposite direction.  As someone who has a commitment to sustainable modes of transport I ask that he would right the anomaly of Navan being the only town in the greater Dublin area without a rail passenger service, and complete the line.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000029#BB00400","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1480521900,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Shane Cassells for raising this matter and for his kind invitation to visit Navan to see what happens there.  I hope it will not be too early in the morning because it is quite a long way from where I will be travelling from but I would be happy to accept his invitation.  That is my duty as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport when Members take the trouble to come into the House and suggest I come to the town.  It is only fair to say to the Deputy that I will come, although I do not know when.  The demands of the type the Deputy made - may be not so compelling but the Deputy made a very good case - are many and the Exchequer is not quite empty but is not full.<\/p><p>In that context, I would be happy to visit but nobody should regard it as a signal that there will necessarily be a rapid follow-through.  It is important, however, that I hear the case for it and see the position at first hand.  I would be happy to do so and I appreciate the Deputy's invitation.<\/p> <p> As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding of public transport.  It is difficult sometimes for people to remember that I do not really interfere on a daily basis in matters relating to which trains run where or at what time.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, has responsibility for the development of public transport infrastructure in the greater Dublin area, which includes County Meath, and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the heavy rail network.  Obviously, I have an influence over policy.  This matter would come under the heading of policy but the real detail of what goes where is normally a matter for the NTA.<\/p> <p> The Navan rail link project was included under the Transport 21 initiative and was to be developed in two phases.  Phase 1 of the Dunboyne rail line project involved the reopening of 7.5 km of a railway line running off the Maynooth line - at Clonsilla - to the M3 interchange near Dunboyne.  This line opened in September 2010 with park-and-ride facilities, with 1,200 car parking spaces available at Pace and 300 at Dunboyne.  Phase 1 was completed in 2013 with the opening of Hansfield Station.  The plan for phase 2 involved the extension of the Dunboyne line between Clonsilla and the M3 Parkway Station, and onwards to north Navan.  The development of the Dunboyne-Navan line, together with a number of other transport projects, as Deputy Cassells mentioned, was postponed in 2011 due to the economic and fiscal crisis.<\/p> <p> The bad news, of which the Deputy will be aware, is that the NTA, which has statutory responsibility for development of public transport in the greater Dublin area, included an examination of the Navan-city centre rail corridor in the preparation of its transport strategy for the greater Dublin area for the period 2016 to 2035.  The strategy was approved by my predecessor earlier this year.  The NTA concluded that, based on current population and employment forecasts, the level of travel demand between Navan, Dunshaughlin and various stations to the city centre is currently insufficient to justify the development of a high-capacity rail link.  Instead, it proposes to develop an enhanced bus service along the route and to develop a bus hub in Navan.  The good news is that this position will be kept under review, taking account of future developments in the catchment area and the NTA suggests that the corridor identified for a rail link to Navan should be protected from development intrusion.  In other words, it is not being ruled out.<\/p> <p> The Deputy will also be aware that Exchequer funding for public transport projects over the coming period is already set out in the Government's capital plan.  The transport element of the plan covers the period up to 2022.  I have previously outlined that my Department's first priority is to ensure the maintenance of our existing transport infrastructure at steady-state levels so that it remains safe and fit for purpose.  Based on the funding allocations for public transport under the capital plan, we should achieve steady-state levels by 2020.<\/p> <p> In view of the current constraints regarding the availability of funding, the priority for the heavy rail network under the plan is to improve efficiency and maintain safety standards, rather than expanding the network by opening new lines or stations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000029#BB00500","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480522500,"counter":366,"content":"<p>If I could interrupt, it seems the Minister might need another two minutes to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000030#CC00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1480522500,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I will complete the reply during my second contribution, if I may.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000030#CC00300","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1480522500,"counter":368,"content":"<p>If the Minister does not mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000030#CC00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1480522500,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I am particularly glad the Minister mentioned the NTA strategy and its summation in terms of population, etc., and, indeed, on whether the Minister and the Government have roles to play in respect of this matter.  They most certainly do have roles to play.<\/p><p>I referred earlier to how the plans would see two stations located in the town, with the final terminal in north Navan.  Only a stone's throw away from that station, there is a parcel of land of 51 acres to which a ministerial SDZ, zoning order is attached.  The latter is the reason the north Navan station was going built in that part of the town.  This SDZ, or strategic development zone, is designed to cater for 1,400 houses on that parcel of land.  That is a significant number of houses by any stretch of the imagination.  At present, the infrastructure in the town cannot cater for the near 30,000 people who live there, but here we have a ministerial order that would lead to the construction of 1,400 additional houses.<\/p><p>There are moves afoot.  Only three weeks ago,<i>The Irish Times<\/i>devoted an entire half-page - beautiful maps, aerial photographs and all - to the SDZ and the ministerial order.  This parcel of land in north Navan - which is already choked up - is retailing for in the region of &euro;6 million, a knock-down price in current terms.  The land in question is located adjacent to where the railway station would be located.  Reference was even made to the abandoned railway line in the developers' pitch to potential purchasers.  Only last week, a different parcel of land of 44 acres on the Dublin Road side of the town sold for &euro;6 million.  Across the river from that parcel of land, one can find another 30 acres for sale at Johnstown.  My point is there are nearly 120 acres of land up for sale at present.<\/p><p>My party made a significant submission to the NTA strategy.  I was a member of the local authority at the time.  Our planners disputed the figures that the NTA used.  The then Minister for Transport, Mr. Noel Dempsey, who advanced the matter to a particular point at the time, hotly contested with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann its contention regarding the figures it was using.<\/p><p>My town cannot cope.

I take the Deputy's point.<\/p>  <p>  The rail portfolio is not all about closing stations, it is involves developing stations that need to be opened for commuters in Dublin or the greater Dublin area.  Those stations might not necessarily produce a profit but they could fulfil the criteria relating to the societal needs and value-for-money considerations that exist.<\/p>  <p>  I do not believe that rail a mode of transport for the past.  It is probably one for the future, if it is developed selectively.  I think the rail review, to which I urge the Deputy to make a submission in respect of this hopeful point, will identify where stations should be opened.  I do not know whether it will identify closures but we will certainly have a clear picture after the consultation process.<\/p>  <p>  I say this to give the Deputy encouragement.  One of the most satisfying aspects of my transport portfolio was highlighted only a couple of weeks ago when the Phoenix Park tunnel reopened.  The latter, in turn, facilitated the reopening of a line from Park West in the western part of Dublin to the docklands in order to satisfy commuters' needs, particularly in the context of bringing them across the city.  That offers me some hope for the future for areas such as Navan, if they can justify and make compelling cases to bring commuters into the city in circumstances where there is no other viable mode of transport available to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000030#CC00800","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1480522500,"counter":373,"content":"<p>On a point of order, can I ask-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000030#CC00900","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1480522500,"counter":374,"content":"<p>There is no point of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000030#CC01000","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1480522500,"counter":375,"content":"<p>-----that the Minister come back to me on his commitment to visit the town?

According to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, the average rent for a one-bedroom home in Dublin has increased by 24%.  That is an extra &euro;2,940 per year.  The average increase for a two-bedroom home has been 21%, an extra &euro;3,204 per year.  In Cork, the home city of the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, the increases have been just as steep.  The average rent increase for one and two-bedroom properties has been 16%, which is an extra &euro;1,260 per year for a one-bedroom property and &euro;1,680 per year for a two-bedroom property.<\/p><p>The increase in asking prices for new lettings has been even more dramatic.  <i>Daft.ie<\/i>has recorded a 43% hike in new rents between January 2013 and October 2016.  New rents throughout the State have risen to more than &euro;1,000 per month, and in Dublin new rents are now more than &euro;1,500 per month.  As every Deputy knows, rents are now higher than they were at the peak of the boom.  In my constituency of Dublin Mid-West, the asking price for renting an average family home is &euro;1,700 per month.  That is more than &euro;20,000 per year.<\/p><p>The cost of renting is out of control and is affecting hundreds of thousands of families.  Approximately 750,000 people live in the private rental sector.  In Dublin, one in four households rent.  Gone are the days when renting was just for students, low income families and first-time buyers who were saving.  The private rented sector is where low and middle income workers and those on council housing waiting lists spend very long periods of time.  Indeed, low and middle income renting families are now paying between 40% and 60% of their disposable income on rent.  Families relying on rent supplement or the housing assistance payment, HAP, are being priced out of the market, while students and single people are being squeezed by out-of-control prices.  Crucially, the 200% increase in family homelessness since 2014 is a direct result of the crisis in the rental sector.  Tonight, almost 2,500 children will sleep in emergency accommodation.  In its recent Oireachtas briefing on family homelessness Focus Ireland said:<\/p><blockquote>A large majority of families becoming homeless had their last secure home in the private rented sector.  The main forces making them homeless from this sector were increased rents and landlords evicting to sell the property.<\/blockquote><p>Excessive rents are not just making families homeless.  Families are now trapped in emergency accommodation for 12 to 24 months because they cannot get back into the private rental market.<\/p><p>This is not an accident.  The rent and homelessness crises are not forces of nature.  They are the direct result of the actions and inaction of Fine Gael and its coalition partners since 2014.  The mealy-mouthed measures introduced in 2014 did nothing to stop the spiralling cost of accommodation.  Indeed, for some the so-called rent certainty measures resulted in immediate price hikes.  For others, they simply delayed the inevitable.  When Sinn F&eacute;in introduced rent certainty legislation last June, Fine Gael, eagerly supported by Fianna F&aacute;il, voted it down.  That Bill would have saved renting families up to &euro;2,000 a year.  There is no doubt that it would have prevented some families from becoming homeless.  However, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and his trusty ally, Deputy Cowen, said &quot;No&quot;.  Renters would get no immediate relief.  They said we were pre-empting the Government's strategy for the private rental sector, that the legislation would scare off investors and that any new measures would have to balance the interests of landlords with those of tenants.<\/p><p>When the Minister, Deputy Coveney, heard that Sinn F&eacute;in intended to use its Private Members' time this week to discuss the rental crisis, he expressed disappointment during Question Time.  He accused us of playing politics with the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000031#EE00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1480523100,"counter":381,"content":"<p>That is exactly what it is doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000031#EE00300","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1480523100,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I suspect the tens of thousands of families struggling with excessive rents would disagree.  I suspect the families living in emergency accommodation would also disagree.  The thousands of people who have signed the Secure Rents Campaign online petition definitely disagree.  The reason we have brought forward this Bill is that we are seeking to put pressure on the Minister and his colleagues in Government to include these three modest measures in the rental strategy that is being finalised.<\/p>  <p>  In our view, the best way to stop the spiralling cost of rents is to link rent to an index such as the consumer price index, CPI.  The best way to slow down the rate of evictions in the rental sector is to remove sale of property as grounds for issuing a notice to quit.  The best way to give tenants greater security of tenure is to make tenancies of indefinite duration the norm.  This is not just Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s view.  It was also the view of the all-party Committee on Housing and Homelessness.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael members of that committee supported these three measures when the committee finalised and published its report in June.  It is also the view of all the parties and Independents who have co-signed this Bill: Independents 4 Change, the Labour Party, People Before Profit, the Anti-Austerity Alliance, the Social Democrats and the Green Party.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill's measures were designed to echo the demands of the Secure Rents Campaign launched earlier this month.  Unite, Mandate, SIPTU, the Communications Workers' Union, CWU, IMPACT and the Civil Public &amp;amp; Services Union, CPSU, joined forces with Uplift and the Dublin Tenants Association in a public campaign calling for rent certainty and security of tenure.  I welcome representatives from the campaign who are in the Visitors Gallery today.  We all share a single purpose.  We want the Government to include these three measures in its strategy for the rental sector.  We ask that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, introduce an amendment to his Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Bill in the D&aacute;il this month to give effect to these measures.  We ask the Government to abandon its spurious opposition to rent certainty and security of tenure.  Struggling renters urgently need a break.  Rent certainty and security of tenure are good not only for tenants but also for landlords.  Action is required now to halt spiralling rents and evictions.<\/p>  <p>  Today Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have a clear choice.  Will they join the rest of the Members in supporting the 750,000 people who live in the private rental sector?  I sincerely hope so.

We now live in a society where the Government of this State considers it acceptable for thousands of children to be homeless.  Six years into this crisis it is now clear that this is not an accident; this is Government policy.  As long as the Government continues to vigorously protect the rights of landlords, tenants will continue to be exploited.<\/p>  <p>  In County Louth in my constituency we have 100 homeless people.  Two years ago we had one person who was homeless.  The chickens are coming home to roost and the fruits of the Government policy of protecting their own, the landlords, at any cost are crystal clear for all to see.  Last Friday a man who was homeless was found dead sheltering in a trolley bay in the car park of a shopping centre in Dundalk.  He was sleeping out in the open in sub-zero temperatures.  Just a few hours earlier another man was found dead sleeping in an abandoned mill in Donegal and it is believed he may have frozen to death.  That is the cost of Government inaction.  I have to ask what in God's name will it take for it to act.  <\/p>  <p>  It is completely unfair that people live with no security of tenure.  It is impossible to plan ahead, to plan families and to plan for the future when people do not know where they are going to be living in six months or in a year's time.  <\/p>  <p>  Spiralling rents, another issue raised in this Bill, have compounded the problem, as people and families are priced out of the rental market.  Between the lack of housing, the lack of regulation in the rental market and unaffordable property we find ourselves in this state of crisis.  However, the Minister already knows about this.  The question is: how much or how little does he care? <\/p>  <p>  Most other major cities have housing strategies to control the market but here it seems to be a free for all.  We lurch from boom to bust and back again and nobody seems to be put out by the collateral damage of families - men, women and children - who lose their homes and are made homeless.  <\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister, for once since he took up office, to take action.

This Bill attempts to address these harsh difficulties with which people are faced.<\/p>  <p>  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il continue to abandon the people to the horrendous situation of spending a substantial, unsustainable amount of their income on rent and with this they have no security on the sale of their home by the landlord.

This Government and the previous one have failed spectacularly to introduce effective rent controls.  Rent controls, together with ensuring people have a roof over their heads and, more important, ensuring that those roofs are kept over their heads would save the Government money because we would have fewer homeless people and less rent allowance to pay out to private landlords.  It would ease the pressure on the working poor, which the Minister's party claims to be protecting.  The working poor in some cases are paying as much as 60% of their meagre wages in rent alone.  That is criminal.<\/p><p>The previous Government introduced a measure where rents could only be increased every two years and we were told at the time that this would solve the problem.  I remember saying that it would not address the problem.  Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues and other Members on this side of House highlighted that.  Many landlords got the benefit and brought in massive rent hikes, which in some cases were as much as 30%.  I have seen rents in County Laois increase from &euro;550 per month to &euro;800 per month.  In Monasterevin in County Kildare I saw rents increase from &euro;700 per month to &euro;1,000 per month.  A <i>daft.ie <\/i>survey shows that average increase in rents in the past 12 months in County Laois was 13.6% and in County Kildare it was 13.4%.  <\/p><p>Meanwhile, 300,000 houses are vacant across the State.  According to the housing agency, 12.1% of houses are vacant in County Laois and 7.8% are vacant in County Kildare.  Banks and vulture funds have been repossessing homes and they are stepping it up with gusto, but they are boarding them up and sitting tight waiting for the value of the houses to increase.  Families are being forced into an already overpriced, overcrowded and congested private rented sector, or worse still, into homelessness.  This is a huge problem.  The Land League fought for fair rent and fixity of tenure but now, after a century has passed and we are into a new century, we are trying to get those principles applied not to land but to houses and to the rental sector.  It is most important that people have a roof over their heads because the lack of it affects everything else, health, education and employment.  All of those are tied into it whether people have the key of a door and secure housing.<\/p><p>Government inaction is adding to the problem.  For six years those in government have turned their faces away from this.  I ask the Minister to do the right thing and to put effective rent controls in place, link rent increases to the rate of general inflation and bring in measures where tenancies can be transferred with the sale of a house.  All of us know of cases where when houses were sold and the bank or the vulture funds moved in they wanted to move out the tenant.  The tenancy should move with the sale of the House if the tenant has a contract.  More of the people who have unsustainable mortgages should be moved into the mortgage to rent scheme and an ambitious housing building programme should be accelerated.  We want to see that driven on.  We want to see more local authority housing because that has to be part of the solution.  <\/p><p>Governments are supposed to govern and regulate and, thus far, this Government, following on from the previous one, has failed to address this issue.

It can provide a housing option to those who either cannot or choose not to enter the owner-occupied market but still have sufficient means to meet their own accommodation needs.  It can provide a housing option to meet increasing demand and it can promote flexibility and better alignment to a more mobile labour market, making it easier for individuals and families to pursue job opportunities or adapt their accommodation to changing family circumstances.  It can also reduce the macroeconomic risks of an over reliance on home ownership.  We have witnessed examples over the past decade where states with relatively large private rented sectors such as Germany and Switzerland were better insulated against housing booms than states with small rented sectors such as Ireland and Spain.  Indeed, the rental sector in Ireland has traditionally been regarded as a residual sector in which households who would prefer either to own their own home privately or access permanent social housing must serve time on their way to their true tenure of choice.<\/p>  <p>  The rental sector in Ireland has doubled in size over the past two decades.  Almost one fifth of the population now lives in the rental sector.  Growth in the sector has been driven by a range of factors, including a reducing reliance on home ownership as a tenure of choice, as well as demographic factors, including inward migration from the EU and decreasing household size increasing rates of new household formation.  Notwithstanding this, the rental sector in Ireland still needs to develop and mature to provide a viable sustainable and attractive alternative to home ownership rather than serving as a temporary refuge or a staging post.  Severe supply pressures, increasing rents, security of tenure issues, limited but nonetheless unacceptable examples of poor accommodation standards and a shortage of professional institutional landlords are impediments to delivering on a strong, stable and modem rental sector that offers choice for individuals and households while contributing to economic growth.<\/p>  <p>   There have been some improvements.  Important amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act introduced last year mean that the minimum period between rent reviews for tenancies has increased from 12 to 24 months.  This will apply for a four-year period, until 2019.  In addition, the minimum period of notice of new rent is increased from 28 days to 90 days and longer notice periods for the termination of long-term tenancies have been introduced.  However, acute pressures persist in the rental market.  These pressures are driven by a number of factors, including increasing demand, a fundamental lack of supply and high costs that indebted landlords face in servicing their loans.  There is no doubt that the problems in the rental sector are part of a bigger problem.  Ireland is in the midst of a housing crisis and the problems caused by high rents reflect, and are reflected in, the other issues facing the housing market, including insufficient homes for first-time buyers, increased demand for social housing and unacceptable levels of homelessness.  While many factors contribute to these problems, the one factor common to all of them is the prolonged and chronic lack of supply of new houses.<\/p>  <p>  The core issue behind almost all of the pressures throughout the housing market is a lack of supply.  Ultimately, the most effective way to reduce and stabilise rents in the medium to long term and benefit the entire sector is to increase supply and accelerate delivery of housing for the private and social rented sectors.  In publishing Rebuilding Ireland, the Government has set out a practical and readily implementable set of actions to create a functioning and sustainable housing system.  However, I acknowledge that it will take some time for supply and demand to reach equilibrium.  In the meantime, however, it is essential that measures taken to address rental prices do not jeopardise supply.  While I appreciate the motivation behind the Bill, it does not contain any mitigating measures to protect supply and, therefore, it is likely that it would have a negative effect on both existing and future supply of rental accommodation.  Without counterbalancing measures, there is a risk that the measures proposed in the Bill would force existing supply to exit the market and discourage future supply for the sector.<\/p>  <p>  That is why Rebuilding Ireland commits to developing a real and meaningful strategy for the rental sector, with a major focus on supply but also including new mechanisms for both setting and reviewing rents, and we are committed to that.  Every political party, members of the public and stakeholders in the rental sector have had an opportunity to contribute in writing to the rental strategy, which I will launch in a fortnight.  Many Members, including Deputy &Oacute; Broin who also attended and contributed to the consultation day, have done so.  I accept his is a detailed submission.  I will launch the rental strategy in a fortnight and it will set out a realistic targeted plan for dealing with the many serious issues that we are discussing.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il has tabled a detailed amendment to the Bill, for which it is seeking support.  We have also tabled an amendment to be voted on tomorrow.<\/p><p>There is much in the Fianna F&aacute;il motion that I am comfortable with but I do not want to commit to that kind of detail until we launch our own strategy.  We will not oppose the counter motion but we will abstain on it.<\/p> <p> From my perspective, I have made my position very clear on this issue since the summer.  What I said was that after a consultation process, we would launch a new rental strategy before the end of the year.  We will do that.  I appreciate the pressure that the Deputy needs to keep me under to make sure we deliver on promises.  I accept this Bill is an effort at continuing to raise the issue of rent certainty.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin knows I cannot support a Bill two weeks before we launch a comprehensive strategy which will perhaps be given legal effect by legislation that is about to come into the D&aacute;il in terms of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Bill.  If we are going to introduce measures, we have an opportunity to do that and I hope the Deputy will help us.  I cannot accept a Bill that is essentially a one-sided argument albeit dealing with a very genuine issue.  We need to have a balanced approach to protecting tenants because without landlords we do not have a functioning rental market.  We need to do both and that is what we will endeavour to do before the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000033#GG01700","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480524900,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the thrust, will and desire of the Bill from Sinn F&eacute;in this evening.  I acknowledge that strong rent certainty measures are necessary to help alleviate the record rent rates we have seen in recent years which have reached huge levels, were unforeseen and are contributing to the homelessness situation.  Far too much of people's disposable income is being contributed to rent, and in many cases not enough income is forcing people into homelessness.  We have what has become an abnormal market which needs abnormal intervention for it to be normalised.  Any intervention which has at its core a rent certainty model or measure would only be for set period - a sunset period - until such time as we can see a normalisation of the market.  I acknowledge that much of what is necessary for the mid to long-term resolution of the housing crisis is in hand and will take time to materialise.  We can have debates, and we can seek to exert our influence on supply measures to help with that, on the provision of housing units and also in the area of the rental sector.  Any form of a rent certainty model has to be well thought out.  Our amendment, as the Minister has alluded to, would oblige the Minister to bring forward rent certainty measures within one month if they are not contained in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Bill that is going through the Houses and that will be in the D&aacute;il in a couple of weeks.  I expect there to be some measures contained in the Bill to address this issue on Committee Stage.  Regulations that are constitutional and targeted, especially in areas in which it is most vital that we interfere, are required at this time when it is not too late, although in many cases it is too late unfortunately.<\/p>  <p>  By virtue of the configuration of the D&aacute;il, as I have said on many occasions, there is an opportunity for consensus.  There is an opportunity to resolve this issue and for a consensus to be arrived at in order for results to be achieved.  When we set out to facilitate this Government, we did so in recognition of the numbers that were presented to us and with the view that we did not feel that the electorate needed or wanted a general election.  We saw fit to give some value to those who voted in our favour by agreeing a confidence and supply arrangement with Fine Gael to facilitate the formation of Government and ensure that it went in a certain direction to address many pressing issues, while at the same time dealing with the other inevitable decision that had to be taken on water.  There is a pathway in place to deal with it and we are moving on to the next chapter following the commission's report this week.<\/p>  <p>  The confidence and supply arrangement affords us, as a political party, the opportunity to represent those who give us the privilege to do so and to yield some influence on Government in the preparation of policy initiatives to achieve results in areas where we want to see results.  The special Committee on Housing and Homelessness was also a product of the configuration of the D&aacute;il whereby a consensus was sought.  Much hard work was done by our party, the Government parties, Sinn F&eacute;in, and Members from other parties and none in an effort to consolidate an opinion and a set of proposals to Government for inclusion in the Rebuilding Ireland document that has been produced.  The various pillars within that have been announced on a couple of occasions but more particularly in this instance on the rental strategy, which will be forthcoming in the coming weeks.  We hope that committee for all its hard work, dedication and commitment will be in a position to yield influence.  <\/p>  <p>  In recent weeks, Fianna F&aacute;il and others, including the proposer of tonight's Bill, made submissions on the basis that the Government would assimilate and analyse them and negotiate with us during the course of their deliberations before finalising the strategy.  We respect that process.  We hope to see it reflected in the final decision by Government and that our imprint, and that of others if necessary, is in it so results can be achieved.  That is what we are here for and that is what we want to see done.  We do not want to game play or use Private Members' time to score points over one another politically and not address the issues we were put here to address.  We want people to see there is real and effective change and proposals in legislation coming forward as a result of the convoluted configuration that one might say is present here in the D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad the Minister made reference in his presentation this evening to bringing forward initiatives and a strategy that is reflective of that process.  Our submission sought and continues to seek to moderate rent inflation and increase supply.  It is inclusive of proposals around a rent certainty model which looks at five year historical rates in the area applicable especially the specific areas it is crucial to tackle in Dublin, other cities and different parts of the country.  We want to increase security of occupation with a range of incentives and competitive finance for build-to-rent units, for example.  We want to reward landlords who agree long leases, and have an NCT-type system where local authorities can inspect and authorise that units are safe, proper and appropriate for such rental agreements.  We want an extension of the empty property refurbishment grant that is being piloted in Carlow and Waterford and to see that rolled out in other parts of the country over time.  We want assistance for involuntary landlords who are in negative equity and who need help, and we want more favourable tax treatment for rental income.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the desire of many within my party to support, as a matter of principle, the Bill before us today, I refrained from doing so because I believe in the process that is being put in place.  I believe in its potential.  I hope it can be reflected in what the Minister brings forward in the coming weeks and that our input, dedication and commitment to resolving this issue is reflected in what the Minister introduces.  If the Minister does that, and is seen to do that, we can go to the public and be assured that it is getting better representation than the sort of political gamesmanship that is achieved by bringing forward motions that are simplistic and short in nature and which do not look at the regulations or the constitutional implications that are contained within it.  That is the reason we have tabled our amendment.  In the event of that not being reflected in the Minister's policies in the coming weeks, we will be very quick to bring forward a Bill to reflect our submission in the hope that we receive support from others.  We want to ensure that those we represent and those who are in this horrible, unfortunate predicament will see that the convoluted configuration of this D&aacute;il, and the difficulties associated with governance because of that, can be resolved and can effect the sort of change that is necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000034#HH00200","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1480524900,"counter":406,"content":"<p>Will Deputy Cowen move the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000034#HH00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1480524900,"counter":407,"content":"<p>My amendment states:<\/p><blockquote>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<br \/><br \/>recognising that:<blockquote>&mdash; the current level of rental inflation is not sustainable;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; rent inflation in Dublin and other cities is severely impacting on disposable incomes, pushing people into homelessness and posing a risk to our economic stability and competitiveness;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; rent certainty measures are required to reduce excessive rent inflation and increase security of occupancy for tenants and should be coupled with a range of incentives to expand the supply of rental properties; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; any rent regulations should be introduced initially on a short-term basis with a sunset clause, pending analysis of their market impact;<\/blockquote>acknowledging that:<blockquote>&mdash; this Bill is very poorly thought out and would possibly bring further chaos to the rental market;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; while stronger rent certainty measures are required, any model has to be well-thought out and display a cognisance of the significant disruptions that any rent regulations can inflict on the market; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; there is a need to examine the National Economic Social Council (NESC) proposal for a &lsquo;flexible market sensitive model of rent regulation&rsquo;; <\/blockquote>agreeing that within one month the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government will introduce new rent certainty measures to the Oireachtas, subsequent to scrutiny between now and then by the Oireachtas Select Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government which will consider submissions and hold hearings that have regard in particular to ensure that the proposed Bill:<blockquote>(a) is the most appropriate model for rent certainty regulations, including whether rents should be tied to local market indexes, such as historical market averages or to national indexes, such as the consumer price index;<br \/><br \/>(b) does not give rise to any unintended consequences that create adverse effects on the rental market, bearing in mind experience of rent certainty models in other jurisdictions; <br \/><br \/>(c) takes account of any negative impacts on rental unit supply and appropriate measures to limit these;<br \/><br \/>(d) does not give rise to constitutional difficulties by identifying and dealing with constitutional issues; and<br \/><br \/>(e) includes complimentary measures to increase supply of rental properties, including measures to assist so-called &lsquo;involuntary landlords&rsquo;, measures to encourage owners of vacant properties to lease properties to approved housing bodies or local authorities, and measures to direct low cost finance for new build-to-rent accommodation; and<\/blockquote>declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill.&rdquo;<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000034#HH00400","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1480524900,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Pat Casey, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000034#HH00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1480524900,"counter":409,"content":"<p>Deputy Lisa Chambers is going first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000034#HH00600","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1480524900,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Casey and the Ceann Comhairle.  It goes without question that Fianna F&aacute;il supports rent certainty.<\/p><p>We have put that fact on record on several occasions.  The problem with this Bill, as we have told those in Sinn F&eacute;in time and again, is that it is too simplistic and only addresses one aspect of the problem.  In fact, there are many aspects to this problem.  We need to adopt a holistic approach to this matter from the point of view of the concept of supply and rent certainty, as well as all the regional imbalances that are reflected in the current crisis.<\/p> <p> Unlike Sinn F&eacute;in, we are seeking real solutions to this problem rather than simply headlines in newspapers.  This Bill proves my point.  Let us consider the timing of its introduction, what is coming down the line in several weeks' time and our amendment.  The timing of the Bill's introduction shows the true nature of what those in Sinn F&eacute;in are attempting to do.  It shows the true nature of what Sinn F&eacute;in intends to achieve, namely, political gain for the party without a care for anyone else.<\/p> <p> We must be cognisant of the potential constitutional law issues.  We are legislators and we must be aware of the impact of any legislation we pass.  I fail to see how those in Sinn F&eacute;in has considered this.  We must also examine the position of landlords in all of this.  They are not all big vultures or corporate entities.  Some of them are accidental landlords.  Some are ordinary people who find themselves in the position of being landlords.  They need to be considered.<\/p> <p> Clearly, we have a massive housing crisis and there is a problem with rent, especially in our capital city.  However, supply is a major aspect of the problem.  The rental market is being driven by the lack of supply.  It is clear that we have an imbalance in regional development, a lack of investment in rural Ireland, poor investment in the regions and overheating of the rental market.  There has been mass migration of people from all parts of the country to Dublin.  That is why there is overheating in the rental market in our capital city.  This is the reason people cannot access housing and it is why they are living in cramped conditions, with rents soaring on a constant basis.<\/p> <p> What I have outlined indicates why rent certainty is only one aspect of this matter; it is only one part of the problem.  We need to ascertain the right model for rent certainty and regulation.  We cannot simply fix one problem only to create a host of new ones.  I am of the opinion that the latter is what the Bill would do.  This Bill represents a ham-fisted approach and it is ill-thought out.<\/p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il is doing what it has always tried to do.  We are using our political weight and our numbers in opposition to achieve real reform.  We are looking to help those who are in crisis with their rent and the families and citizens affected by rental problems.  Deputy Cowen has made it clear that we need to see action and results.  The Minister has overseen numerous announcements and launches of various reports, policies and actions he proposes to take.  However, we are not seeing the effects of these on the ground.  Meanwhile, rents continue to increase.  It has been pointed out to the Minister and his Department that we are facilitating his and the Government's work in this regard.  However, if we do not see action and results soon, we will have no option but to take an alternative approach.<\/p> <p> I reiterate our lack of support for the Bill on the basis that it is ill-thought out and it does not address all the problems.  Our party believes that it will create problems rather than fix them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000034#HH00700","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480525500,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I was not elected to this D&aacute;il to play games.

Fianna F&aacute;il wants to work to help to solve the crisis in all its forms, including homelessness, rental problems and, ultimately, supply.  Fianna F&aacute;il is here to provide solutions to the crisis for the people.

The issues of housing, rent and rents supports have dominated the D&aacute;il since the election and since before this Government was formed.  This is evident by the creation of the Committee on Housing and Homelessness, chaired by my colleague, Deputy Curran.<\/p>  <p>  The seriousness of the issue is something we are all united in acknowledging.  I have commented on this on numerous occasions in the Chamber.  I note Deputy &Oacute; Broin also raised this matter previously.  We need to try to address this in a unified manner rather than score points off each other.  We need to tackle the issues at hand.  Meath, where I live, is a commuter county.  I can see the impact of the housing crisis there and how it affects people in key developing centres such as Navan, Trim, Enfield, Ratoath and Ashbourne.  The lack of availability of rental property and property for sale has created a major problem for those trying to get on the property ladder or those simply seeking to rent apartments or houses.<\/p>  <p>  Like Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, I talk to the people who come to my constituency office every week.  I imagine Deputies from all parties have experienced this; it is not a scenario unique to one party.  People facing these issues come to all our constituency offices.  Why is that?  It is because of key issues, such as supply.  The latter is one of the major issues and it is something up to which we must face in this debate.  Unfortunately, those in Sinn F&eacute;in have shied away from that fact.  Like those in AAA-PBP and everyone else in the alphabet parties, they have no concept of the issues involved in the provision of homes, nor do they want to know about it.<\/p>  <p>  I have listened to Deputy Boyd Barrett on numerous occasions.  He comes to the Chamber and repeats the mantra that the State, and no one else, should supply housing.  There is no mention of the provision of homes by anyone else in the marketplace.  I fully believe that the State should build homes.  As someone who was a local councillor for 17 years, I am of the view that the way in which local councils were removed from this process was reprehensible.  In any event, there is now a major challenge for the State in the context of re-engaging.  However, the State alone will not solve the crisis and we need to work on the issues facing builders that can provide homes for the people who have money and who wish to purchase them.  Indeed, we must address the realities facing landlords.  We must work to keep people in the rental market rather than driving them out of it and having them selling their properties and making the rental situation all the worse.  We have concrete proposals relating to local property tax as an expense, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and empty property grants.  We all need to be involved in the scrutiny of these proposals.  Our party will play a key role in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Linking everything to the consumer price index is perhaps not the wisest methodology in view of what happened during the period from 2002 to 2014 and what resulted from that.

If I have time, I will return to that matter.<\/p><p>I point out to the House that the origins of the Bill - I think Deputy &Oacute; Broin would concede this - lie in a campaign initiated by SIPTU, the Communications Workers Union, CWU, IMPACT, Mandate, Unite, the Civil Public &amp;amp; Services Union, CPSU, and a civil society organisation called Uplift, and supported by the Dublin Tenants Association.  I was very happy to sign the Bill on behalf of my colleagues in the Labour Party because it constitutes very much an act of solidarity across the left in this House and in other parts of society.  I make no apologies for being part of that and I congratulate Deputy &Oacute; Broin on drafting the Bill and inviting others among us to sign it.  This is a focused campaign and a focused Bill, both of which are most urgently needed.  The legislation is designed to protect tenants from spiralling rents, short-term leases and summary eviction if their homes are being sold.<\/p><p>The latest Dublin rough sleeper count published today, which showed that 142 people slept out in the cold on 22 November, represents the reality of those whose plight is most extreme.  However, there are thousands more individuals and families in emergency accommodation and thousands more again who have a real fear that they will lose their homes through exorbitant rent increases or eviction because the properties are being sold or their leases are running out.  These people cannot wait until more homes are built.  They need security now.<\/p><p>The Minister has outlined various measures to increase supply, and I understand that they are being put in place.  They are welcome but they take time.  In the meantime, there are people who simply cannot afford their rent any more or who are in danger of losing their homes.  The most recent report by <i>daft.ie<\/i>, to which Deputy &Oacute; Broin also referred, shows that the annual rate of rent inflation nationwide is 11.7%.  People with expertise in housing have predicted impending increases of 25%.  As I said, while we all welcome the measures to increase supply, they will not deliver nearly as quickly as rents will increase and as demand exceeds supply in the meantime.  Stuck in the middle of this are real people and real families.  Their incomes are limited and that most basic of needs, namely, a roof over their heads, is more than they can afford.  The measures in the Bill can subvert this and stop the spiral.  Linking rent to the cost of living means that increases must be modest.  If housing provision is left to the market, the shortage of supply in our cities and other parts of the country, as described by previous speakers, will allow landlords to charge the highest rents they can get.  Those who have no choice but to rent will be in competition with each other, with people on the lowest incomes inevitably losing out and forced into, at worst, homelessness and, at best, accommodation that does not meet their needs.<\/p><p>The Minister said that renting can provide a housing option to those who either cannot or choose not to enter the owner-occupier market.  However, the fact is that renting is the only option for a growing number of people because they simply cannot get mortgages and cannot afford to buy houses of their own.  Yes, there are those who choose not to enter the owner-occupier market.  There are many others now for whom it is not a choice but, rather, the only option.  Providing for longer Part 4 tenancies and prohibiting the termination of a tenancy because the property is being sold will give security to tenants.  Essentially, the three measures proposed in the Bill alter the balance of power between the landlord and the tenant, putting cards in the tenant's hands that are common in other countries where long-term renting is a viable choice.  The Minister talked about the need for balance and the issues faced by landlords and property developers.  However, the problem is that there are far too many cards in their hands and far too few in those of tenants.  There must be balance but I and others argue that the balance is completely on the other side and that we need to give tenants some powers in this regard.  The Government amendment declines to accept the Bill and gives as the main reason that it pre-empts the commitment to publish a strategy for the rental sector by the end of 2016.  We all look forward to the publication of that strategy.  If I thought the strategy would contain the three measures in the Bill, I might not be too concerned,  From what I have heard so far, I am of the view that there will be measures but I do not believe that they will be as effective as the three proposed in the Bill.<\/p><p>I have very little time left so I want to return to the accusation of political gamesmanship.  In every debate in which I have participated here in recent times, Fianna F&aacute;il has taken this position.  It hides and snuggles in behind the comfort blank of the confidence-and-supply arrangement in order that it does not have to do anything.  It just fires accusations at the Opposition and issues veiled threats at times to the Minister.  Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies tell the Government that if it does not do such and such, they are the lads who have all the power and can pull the plug at any time.  That is supreme political gamesmanship.  At least the rest of us take positions.  We might disagree with each other on matters but we take positions and stand over them.  In this case, I am completely in agreement with the Bill proposed by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  I respect the fact that the Minister has a different approach, although I do not agree with him about the balance between the landlord and the tenant.<\/p><p>The Bill is designed to ensure that the tenant has a stronger card to play.  This is very much in line with what happens in other European countries and in places such as Canada, where there is a thriving rental market and where people see that they can have security and live all their lives in rented accommodation.  In many cases, these are families.  In some cases, they are individuals.  In any event, they have that secure rental market.  If we continue to do nothing because we have accidental landlords - and we do have them - and if we continue to say that we cannot have a properly organised private rented sector because of accidental landlords, we will get nowhere.  We need to take the kinds of measures that give tenants security, that ensure that their rent will not spiral out of control and that redress that balance.  I do not believe that this will have the disastrous effect on supply being suggested.  There is now hoarding of land so that there will be greater profits to be made at a later stage.  There are suggestions that we will not see, for example, apartment blocks being built where they are needed because of the cost of development.<\/p><p>The Minister has often quoted the figure that there are approximately 27,000 homes with planning permission in the greater Dublin area that are not being built.  We hear the voice of the developer a lot but we must hear the voice of the tenant as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000036#KK00900","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480526700,"counter":425,"content":"<p>Deputy Ruth Coppinger is sharing time with Deputy Boyd Barrett.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000037#LL00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1480526700,"counter":426,"content":"<p>People at home would be amazed at some of the goings on in this Chamber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000037#LL00300","speaker":"1254"},{"type":"speech","time":1480526700,"counter":427,"content":"<p>They sure would.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000037#LL00400","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1480526700,"counter":428,"content":"<p>At a time when rents are increasing exorbitantly, and the figures have already been given, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael in particular want us all to sit and wait for their private residential Bill that they have been discussing for a long time before we take any action.  The Bill before the House has been asked for by community associations and trade unions and it has been signed by a number of Deputies on that basis.<\/p>  <p>  A survey of 60 cases that the Anti-Austerity Alliance has on its books in Dublin West shows that this Bill would cover 61% of the reasons people become homeless.  It covers the issue of rent increases, which the survey indicated was the cause of 19% of people being made homeless.  The biggest reason for people becoming homeless, and the reason I will bring forward with the Anti-Austerity Alliance an anti-eviction Bill, is the landlord saying the property must be sold.  My figures have this at 31% of cases.  The other shyster landlords chancing their arm include those who say they are moving in a family member, accounting for 12% of evictions.<\/p>  <p>  The Government seems to think this Bill is not necessary, which is quite incredible.  All the figures have been given for rent increases, which are out of control, and yet the Government sets its face against that.  The new argument is this is unconstitutional.  I would say I put as much work into the housing committee as anybody else on it and we were all told to put our shoulders to the wheel to come up with solutions.  I have not seen any of those adopted.  One of the speakers before the committee was Mr. Edmund Honohan, who made it clear, chapter and verse, that there is no constitutional impediment to rent controls or rent certainty.  In his testimony, he stated the notion of public interest is extensive and the Legislature's judgment as to what is in the public interest is primary.  He went on to say that when the Part V elements were being introduced, it was made clear by the Supreme Court that the achievement of these objectives would be socially just and required by the common good, which speaks volumes.  Please do not use that excuse when people are being rack-rented into poverty in this State.<\/p>  <p>  My heart was bleeding as I listened to how these poor landlords would exit the sector, leaving everybody bereft of supply.  May we nail this myth once and for all with figures from the Residential Tenancies Board?  In 2011, there were 151,034 landlords in quarter one and in 2016 there were 173,956 landlords.  That is a massive jump.  Why would they leave the sector when it is a bonanza for them?  The Government will not bring in rent controls and they can charge what they want, with major power to find all sorts of ways to get rid of a tenant as well.  Why would they leave the sector?  Please pull the other one and do not use that ridiculous excuse.  Fianna F&aacute;il is beneath contempt.

This is the major contributory factor to an unprecedented homelessness and housing crisis.  The Government will not even support these minimal measures which will not even address the issue but would begin to offer some sort of certainty and level of control.  It is unbelievable.<\/p>  <p>  From the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il amendments we have this nonsense that we must not do anything that will affect the market.  The best example, which I love, is that we need a \"market-sensitive model\".  No, we do not.  We do not need to be sensitive about developers and landlords making an absolute fortune from extortionate rents and, we should be clear, who have a vested interest in keeping rents high.  Why would they want them lower?  Deputies might argue that if we get supply, it might bring down the rent but it will not.  At the point at which supply will begin to have a downward effect on rent, they will stop the supply.  It is just like we know developers hoarded land in the past.  The market and the developers will not deliver affordable rents.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear the Minister of State's Government does not want to deliver a position where anybody would have to pay no more than 20% or 30% of income on rent.  We have not yet heard it mentioned.  Currently, people are paying 60% or 70% of their income on rent in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  If the Government is not determined to achieve that position, it will not solve the crisis.  It does not want to solve the crisis and the landlords who vote for the Government, even those populating some of these benches, do not have any interest in reducing the profitability of the private rented sector.  If the Government were serious, it would have a social housing programme that would take all of those on the housing list into properties with council rents that are controlled and differential, based on people's ability to pay.  In the private sector it would introduce rent controls and rent certainty.  It is clear that whatever the Minister, Deputy Coveney, comes up with in a few weeks, it will not be rent control.  That is clear, as the language is repeated that we must not upset the market or developers because we must get down on our knees to grovel to them.  The idea is we must ensure they can make much money as that is the only way we can solve the problem.  No, it is not.  Those people made a lot of money in the last boom but it did not solve any of these problems or decrease rents.  It did not reduce housing lists or make housing or accommodation more affordable.  It will not do so this time either.<\/p>  <p>  The Government should just own up.  It and Fianna F&aacute;il represents the landlords so they should just admit it rather than offer the pretence they will do something when they refuse to accept the minimal proposals in this Bill to make some difference.

It is amazing that the problems we have with the housing crisis and rental market have been with us for so long and yet we still have them because of inaction.  One of the main reasons for inaction is because the tendency on the Government side to let the markets at it is too strong.<\/p>  <p>  The Government now argues that this is all about encouraging supply.  It has introduced a first-time buyers' grant and prices will be driven up.  The Central Bank was made to cut the 20% level for deposits to 10% but that is 10% of what?  Properties are unaffordable.  This is not necessarily the right way to get builders building.  People are forever confusing the developer and the builder but they are two different entities.<\/p><p>The developers feel there is not enough gain in it for them to be building.  The Government's failure to do anything about landbanking encourages and incentivises developers to continue to sit on landbanks.  Builders, who are different entities, cannot access money.  The Government could play a role in all of this by organising for builders to be able to access money.  They are not looking to make a profit of &euro;40,000 per unit.  They would be happy with &euro;5,000.  Builders are not the guys with the money.  For the life of me, I do not understand why the Government is not organising the local authorities to build social and affordable housing on land owned by the people.  The notion of NAMA building on land owned by the people and selling those properties for &euro;330,000, which most people in Ireland who need a house cannot afford, does not make any sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000037#LL01000","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480527300,"counter":435,"content":"<p>The Minister, Deputy Coveney, spoke about all the things the Government has done and what is going to happen to increase the supply of houses.  We have yet to see that happening.  We heard the same thing from the previous Minister, Deputy Kelly.  The same figures are being thrown out time and again.  The rental sector has not been addressed.  My constituency office deals with one or two families a week that have received termination orders from their landlords on the basis that they are selling the properties in question or that members of their families are going to move in.  These landlords have copped on that this is the best way for them to get rid of people.<\/p>  <p>  The Secure Rents campaign, which has been mentioned already, has three demands.  First, it wants rent increases to be linked to the consumer price index.  That is very clear.  Even though there is a rent cap in place at the moment, rents are continuing to soar.  It currently costs &euro;1,800 to rent a three-bedroom house in Dublin 8.  It is not possible for people on low wages to meet that cost because they do not have the money.  Second, the campaign is calling for the revocation of the right of landlords to evict tenants for the purpose of sale.  This is crucial because the Part 4 provisions currently give landlords the right to terminate the residency of tenants who have been in renting for more than six months but less than four years.  A longer period of time has to be secured.  Third, there has to be a move from the current four-year leases.  This is absolutely crucial.  If the Minister does not recognise that these are safe actions at this time, and someone rightly described them as the minimum that should be done, he is just not seeing what is happening on the ground, perhaps because he is politically ingrained in the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000038#MM00200","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1480527300,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I have previously advocated the provisions that are proposed in this Bill, such as linking rents with the consumer price index, providing greater security of tenure, making Part 4 tenancies of indefinite duration and removing the sale of a property as a ground for terminating a tenancy.  Such a system is already commonplace across Europe.  Ireland is one of the few European countries in which the mention of a sale by a landlord can result in vacant possession.  We are unlikely to see much improvement in the rent security situation when the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government publishes his strategy for the rental sector in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Any measures that are introduced now will be too late for the 6,525 people who are officially homeless in Ireland.  If the Government is to prevent any acceleration in homelessness, it needs to do things it has consistently rejected and refused to do.  For example, it needs to intervene in the market.  Fine Gael continues to use the age-old excuse that it could not possibly support measures like those proposed in the Bill before the House because such an intervention would have a negative impact on existing and future supply of rental accommodation and would have potential legal and constitutional implications that require careful consideration.  In this D&aacute;il, Fine Gael has sided with the property and mortgage industry and left itself open to persuasion by those engaged in a concerted lobbying effort who imply that measures supporting rent certainty and security of tenure are fantastical, ludicrous, economically disastrous, left-wing and radical.  Leading bodies like the OECD and the NESC have demonstrated that these proposals have a strong economic justification.

While this is certainly a huge Dublin problem in the first instance, it is also a problem in my county of Tipperary and everywhere else.  The special housing committee that was chaired by Deputy Curran did a lot of hard work when it inquired into this matter and produced its report.  It seems to me that something is missing from this debate.  We cannot seem to connect or get to the kernel of it.  It is getting worse instead of better.<\/p>  <p>  I heard Deputy Jan O'Sullivan attacking Fianna F&aacute;il for point scoring.  I remind her that the purse strings were under the control of her colleague, Deputy Howlin, when he served as one of the magic four economic managers for five years until quite recently.  What did their gung-ho colleague, the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, do about this issue?  It is easy to wring one's hands and attack others.

Some people think landlords are privileged people who wear gold suits, drive around in big cars and are nearly monster-like.  We need to get real here.  I have to declare that the only house I own is the one I live in with my eight children.  I do not have any vested interest in this matter.  Some of the people here who seem to have all the answers have never created a job or found a solution to any of these problems.  All they do is talk.<\/p>  <p>  My good friend, Deputy Boyd Barrett, is talking about taking to the streets again.  What is he going to do?  Is he going to get the homeless people to walk around with him?  We need a good dose of reality in here.

I did not want to read too much of it because it was another prepared script.  We have heard announcements and pronouncements about what the Government does and does not intend to do, but nothing is happening.  The system has failed miserably.  It is unable to deal with this crisis.  It is able to deal with very few crises.<\/p>  <p>  During Questions on Proposed Legislation in the House earlier today, I raised with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, my concerns around the Courts Bill 2016, which is coming down the line and is being debated in committee at the moment.  I told the House that the Bill \"proposes to have eviction and repossession cases returned to the Circuit Court\" once more.  This was blocked several months ago when the Land League and other groups prevented cases from going ahead.<\/p><p>Now, the Government is going to release them again.  The Circuit Court is unable to deal with these situations and, in many counties, including in my own county, they are dealt with by the county registrars, who are unfit to deal with them.  The registrar in my county left for some time and she was then brought back because she did not have enough evictions.  This is what we are dealing with.  The Circuit Court is not fit for the purpose of eviction from family homes.  If the power is restored to the Circuit Court, it will be a recipe for disaster.<\/p> <p> We are here talking about reports on housing and housing crisis committees yet, on the other hand, all of us have our heads in the sand with regard to what the banks are doing.  They were allowed to destroy families and destroy initiatives not only with regard to families, but also with regard to buy-to-lets and the vulture funds that have been mentioned.  It is a merry-go-round.  If we go back there again, it will be ridiculous.  The nonsense has been put forward by some in this House who are barristers and lawyers that they want this Bill changed because it will save families extra costs.  For a family facing eviction who are unable to repay the financial institution, that is a red herring.  The real issue is that 8,000 eviction cases have now collapsed as a result of this ruling.  That the proposed change in the Courts Bill 2016 cannot be backdated for those 8,000 families is a gravy train for the barristers, with figures of &euro;8,000 per case.  It is the vested interests again.<\/p> <p> There are complicated issues in this regard.  There are 200,000 empty houses, according to the 2016 census.  We need to think about that, given that some of these houses could have two or three units of accommodation.  Some 80% are bank-forced evictions and there is the de-tenanting of the rental sector.  These figures are in the research.  There are 400,000 people in financial trouble and all this debt ends up registered on family homes.  Where is the fairness and where is the just society?  We are doing all of that ahead of this Bill, which is an effort to sort out this problem.  We are playing hide and go seek.  It is a merry-go-round and we cannot get off it.  Someone needs to stop this merry-go-round and jump off, hold it up and expose it to reality.<\/p> <p> I heard the other speakers and I support the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment to the Bill.  We need better standards, we need proper accommodation and we need some type of NCT-style approach, as mentioned by others, to make sure it is done right.  We need to look at the rent certainty pilot schemes in Waterford and Carlow.  Ordinary people who happen to become landlords, for whatever reason, did not all set out to be very wealthy people.  Some are left a house or inherit a family home and, if they cannot live in it, they are entitled to rent it.  There are many good landlords who are looking after their tenants.  I would have questions to ask about the agency which advertises every day on the radio - it is the tenancy regulation body, although the name eludes me, but it does not solve many of the problems either.<\/p> <p> We need to look at the lack of investment that continued during the boom but, above all, in the past five years, when we had the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, holding the purse strings, and he gathered them like it was his own, personal money.  We had the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, who was going to change everything so nobody would be homeless.  There are many more issues than will be discussed in this debate.  The local authorities need to get back into the market and build and deliver the houses.  We could do this in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s when there was no mechanisation.<\/p> <p> On the point raised by Deputy Wallace, there is the developer and there is the builder.  We are demonising the builders as if they were a protected species.  They need money but the banks will not give it to them.  Much of the problem goes back to the banks that we have bailed out and helped, yet I read today about repossessions.  They just pass this from Billy to Jack.  They have no interest in ordinary people because all they have an interest in is getting the houses.  I will not even go near NAMA, but it is a huge property developer and the scandals going on there, including the knock-off sales to their friends, will be exposed and there will be inquiries into that.  We will not have enough retired judges to have all the inquiries in a couple more years.  We will have to put a CAO course forward for students to become retired judges in order to be appointed to be chairpersons of this investigation, that investigation and the next investigation.  We are just not connected in here; we are not connected to the real issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000038#MM00500","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480527900,"counter":440,"content":"<p>The Deputy should conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000039#NN00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1480527900,"counter":441,"content":"<p>We need a dose of reality.

It is true to say the single greatest failure of this and the last Government has been their inability to tackle the housing crisis.  That has resulted in a situation where untold misery is being caused to many families across the country, from the growing number of children who are growing up in cramped hotel rooms to the many families in emergency accommodation of other types, such as hostel-type accommodation, to those who are sleeping on the streets, who are currently at their highest number ever, and, equally, to the number on housing waiting lists, who are also at their highest number ever.  Apart from the fact this is causing personal misery for so many of our people, the failure of the Government to address the housing crisis is also putting huge financial pressure on families who have managed to get housing, whether that is through paying huge prices for the purchase of housing, families who are in negative equity or families who are renting.  Huge financial pressure is being put on people who are being stretched because of the difficulty in getting a basic roof over their head.<\/p><p>The other point is that the high cost of housing, whether purchasing or renting, is contributing enormously to fuelling wage demands, and this applies right across the board.  If we tackled the unacceptably high level of cost associated with all forms of housing, it would certainly take a lot of the heat out of demands for wage increases.  The impact of what the Government has failed to do is very clear in human terms and also in economic terms, and action is urgently required in this regard.<\/p><p>We all need decent housing conditions.  It is the most basic of our needs that we have a place we can call home, where we can put down roots in a community, and where we can contribute to building sustainable communities so people can have decent lives.  Housing should not be about the property market or getting a foot on the ladder, but that is what it has become in this country.  This and the last Government, and other Governments, have been quite happy to leave the issue of housing to the market.  They have failed to recognise one of the most basic human needs in our country.  They have failed to recognise that the Government has a clear role to play in ensuring housing of all kinds is affordable and does not put people under the kind of pressure we are seeing at the moment.<\/p><p>This Bill is to be welcomed in as far as it goes.  We know that while there are problems across the housing spectrum, the area of rental accommodation in particular has become the most expensive and least secure form of housing available to people.  Increasingly, because of the lack of affordability for people in buying homes, and particularly because of the lack of funding of local authority house building, what we are now seeing is huge pressure on the rental market, which, in turn, is driving up prices, making it both the most expensive and the least secure.  We also know from the latest <i>www.daft.ie<\/i>quarterly property report that the annual rate of rental inflation is almost 12%, the highest recorded since it started keeping records in 2002.  We know from recent public comments by somebody heading up one of the REITs that: &ldquo;'It&rsquo;s a great market...  We&rsquo;ve never seen rental increases like this in any jurisdiction&rdquo;.  He then added: &quot;I truly feel badly for the Irish people.&quot;'<\/p><p>By all accounts, it is a great market if one is an investor, but that is not what Government should be about.  It should be about ensuring decent quality housing for people, whether they are renting or buying.  This is the biggest failure we have seen so far from Government.  I am happy to support the Bill in so far as it goes.  It helps in a minor way and we should, of course, agree it as an emergency measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000039#NN00500","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1480527900,"counter":444,"content":"<p>The Green Party is happy to support the Bill and I commend the authors, Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin and others in Sinn F&eacute;in.  We do so because we are in a real rental crisis.  The figures have been cited but they bear recall.<\/p><p>Rents have increased approximately 45% in the past five years, we face the prospect of a further 20% rise and the percentage of income going on rent for the 300,000 private rental tenants in the country is way above any international average and is really harming the quality of their lives.  It is even worse for those 5,000 families who, because of rent increases, have been forced into emergency hotel and hostel accommodation.  We have to address this crisis.<\/p> <p> The methods of addressing it to date have gone back to the old ways of trying to pump prime supply by giving tax incentives and other breaks to the developers and building industry.  That needs to change.  We got into a housing and economic crisis because we relied too much on the developers and gave them too much leeway.  We have to change it so that we do not go back to the very conditions that created our housing crisis.  That requires a fundamental reassessment of the relative rights of property owners versus renters.  As Thomas Drummond famously said, we must recognise that property had its duties as well as its rights.  We have to turn to Article 43 of our Constitution which, while it recognises property rights contains the caveat that: \"The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.\"  It is for the common good that we sign this legislation.  We cannot wait two or three years for the supply to increase even if we did want to go back to that old way.  It is not in tune with where the market is going.  By giving security of tenure and rent increases, we will create an environment that is better for developers and builders.  I attended the recent Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland conference and heard there that they want to go to this build-to-rent model in which people can expect to live in a development for 20 or 30 years and maybe even move within that development as their family grows or shrinks.  That model requires certainty of tenure and rent.  It is perfectly plausible for us to introduce these measures to increase the rights of the tenants and, to counter the Minister, it would not kill the development of building opportunities.  If anything, we need to create this rental certainty and security of tenure to raise the funds to get people to invest in the buildings we need.  That is not happening.<\/p> <p> This Bill provides a mechanism to change the whole approach and that is what is badly needed.  I do not care about the politics of who is in here, who is up or down, or who has a motion ahead of the other.  It is a question of addressing a fundamental crisis, particularly in our cities, and particularly this city.  We cannot do nothing about it.  We need to act fast and we are very glad to support the Bill with that intent.  We hope it does pass and that the rental sector changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000039#NN00600","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480528500,"counter":446,"content":"<p>The Minister of State will have noticed a pattern emerging in this Chamber over recent months: Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have been contriving on one issue after another to block solutions and progress on many issues facing people outside this Chamber.  When we deal with rising and high rents, it has consequences for families and individuals.  It adds to the cost of living crisis.  There are families deciding now whether to purchase groceries or pay the rent.  They have to make these choices every day.  This is driving more people into poverty and adding to the homelessness crisis.  It is no surprise that today the Dublin Region Homeless Executive published a report that shows that homelessness has increased by 53% in the capital city since last winter.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government accused Sinn F&eacute;in of playing games on this issue.  How dare he accuse us of playing games.  We have a responsibility and a job to do.  Our job is to legislate, to bring forward solutions.  This Bill is a solution.  The people who are playing games are the ones who are blocking every solution put forward by the Opposition that will deal with this and many other issues.  Every time we bring forward a solution we are told we have to wait, but people cannot afford to wait.  They cannot wait any longer.  I do not have faith in the ability of Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael to do the right thing on this issue.  They can unite to block progress, but not to block tax cuts or a cut in the universal social charge for the wealthy, as we saw in the budget, or in respect of multinational companies and Apple&rsquo;s tax.

Rents and house prices are increasing and we are still talking about issues the Government told us would have been dealt with by now or were in the process of being dealt with.  Last June, we discussed this issue when we brought forward our rent certainty Bill.  Since then, the Government has done little but spout rhetoric.  What was a housing emergency in June has now, on the edge of December, gone well beyond an emergency especially as the temperatures drop.  As we all know, the price of renting has increased so much that it is now cheaper in some cases to have a mortgage.  In my constituency, Dublin North West, it costs approximately &euro;1,300 a month to rent a two-bedroom house and &euro;1,500 for a three-bedroom house.<\/p>  <p>  Given that there are 750,000 people in the private rental sector across the State, a quarter of all households in Dublin rent.  There are many low and middle income families relying on the private rental sector to put a roof over their heads.  These families live with insecurity of tenure and spiralling rents.  Couples and families who are working in good jobs come to my office because they cannot afford to keep up with rent increases.  They are paying up to 60% of their disposable incomes on rent and are now in danger of becoming homeless.  These families need immediate action, not rhetoric from Government.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill will do three things for tenants: provide for rent certainty with rent increases and decreases linked to the consumer price index; amend section 28 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2015 by changing the duration of Part 4 tenancies from four years to an indefinite period - this would give tenants and landlords the option of securing long-term leases, providing greater certainty for both parties; and, finally, it will remove the sale of property as grounds for a landlord to terminate a lease.  These are three simple but important changes to help working families who are finding it increasingly hard to keep a roof over their heads.  Any State that professes to call itself a democracy should be able to supply basic housing.  However, the current housing emergency does not seem to bother many in this House.  There are many in this House who are landlords.  They should declare their interest and desist from voting on this Bill because it is an obvious conflict of interests. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000040#OO00300","speaker":"1303"},{"type":"speech","time":1480528500,"counter":448,"content":"<p>My last engagement on Monday before I travelled here was to meet a constituent in a fast food restaurant connected to a hostel.  He had been living there for approximately 14 months.  He told me of his situation and wanted support to apply for local authority housing, and advice.  He has three children and faces his second Christmas in that place.  Despite the fact that the owner of the hostel was willing to provide him with very good references, which he showed me, he has not been able to find anything.  That is the human cost of our housing crisis.  It is affecting his children.  He was doing his best but I could see that his dignity and pride were deeply hurt and that it was having a significant impact on his family.<\/p><p>It is no great surprise to me that the ninth report of the special rapporteur on child protection published in the past couple of weeks found that Ireland is operating contrary to international law on the basis of the number of children placed in emergency accommodation.  That is an indictment of the failure of successive Governments to deal with the housing crisis.  It requires that we take steps to minimise whatever harm or dangers exist as regards children in such emergency accommodation, but it also requires that we deal with the housing crisis.  That is not just about the building and construction of local authority housing, it is also about ensuring that this rental crisis, which is absolutely rampant in urban areas in particular at present, is tackled.<br\/><br\/>In my constituency, the rate of increase has been exceeding that of Dublin for nearly two years.  It was at a rate of approximately 14.4% in the last <i>daft.ie<\/i>report and the average cost of a three-bed house in Cork city for that period was in the region of &euro;1,087, but much higher than that in certain neighbourhoods such as Douglas, Blackrock and Mahon.  In those areas, it is far in excess of that.  This has meant that it is absolutely impossible to find accommodation, particularly for people on lower incomes, whether it is through HAP or anything of that nature.  It is an indictment of any of the Deputies of Cork South-Central if they fail to support this important legislation that will make such a concrete difference.<br\/><br\/>People have been accused of using this to play politics.  I have constituents calling to see me regularly.  Often, they are people from other parts of Europe who might have been served with their notice or who are trying to find a new tenancy.  They just cannot believe how poor the protections are here.  They cannot believe how weak the position of the tenant is in this country.  Objectively, by any standards, the protections that exist for tenants in this country are absolutely brutal and that certainly needs to be tackled.  This is why I believe that not only is the rent certainty element so important, but so is the extension and strengthening of tenancies of indefinite duration.  It is one step of many that need to be taken to ensure that tenants have security of tenure and feel confident that they can have some kind of security in their lives and in their tenancies.<br\/><br\/>This is absolutely essential legislation.  The Government should support it.  Fianna F&aacute;il, in particular, should support it rather than shedding crocodile tears over the rental crisis.  It is widely-supported legislation as well in terms of SIPTU, Mandate, the CWU, the Dublin Tenants Association and Uplift.  That shows how wide the support is for legislation that will make a significant difference in halting the rampant increases in rental prices and provide some kind of security for our tenants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000040#OO00400","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480529100,"counter":450,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000041#PP00200","speaker":"1303"},{"type":"speech","time":1480529100,"counter":451,"content":"<p>Before I call on the Minister of State to respond and the Sinn F&eacute;in Members to wrap up, a little earlier Deputy Coppinger made reference to the Minister and the Minister of State being landlords.

That crisis is affecting all parts of the housing sector, including the rental sector.  Our approach must, therefore, be holistic and founded on the realisation that all parts of the housing sector are interlinked and interdependent.<\/p><p>It was precisely because of rent increases that the Government introduced a package of rent stability and additional housing supply measures last November.  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 introduced a number of measures to address rising rents.  With regard to rent stability, the Act provided that the minimum period between rent reviews for tenancies increased from 12 to 24 months.  The provision will apply for a four-year period.  In addition, the minimum period of notice of new rents was increased from 28 days to 90 days and longer notice periods for the termination of long-term tenancies were introduced.  The extension of the period between rent reviews from 12 months to 24 months takes effect from the date of the last review.  If a tenant had a rent review in July 2015, the next review would not be until July 2017.<\/p><p>There is, however, no question but that pressures on the rental market remain driven by rising demand, which is a result of the economic recovery, by a lack of supply and by the high costs that highly-indebted landlords face in servicing their loans.  These pressures are borne out by the data published by the Residential Tenancies Board Ireland and in the <i>daft.ie<\/i>rental reports.  Fundamentally, the increases in rent have been driven by a mismatch between the additional demand associated with the very welcome economic recovery and a lack of a corresponding response in supply.  The best way to reduce and stabilise rents in the long term and to benefit the entire sector is to increase supply and accelerate delivery of housing for private and social rental sectors.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, there is no on-off button for the delivery of additional rental accommodation.  It takes time for the supply measures in particular to take effect and alleviate some of the pressures.  The aim of Rebuilding Ireland, the Government's action plan on housing and homelessness, is to increase and accelerate housing delivery across all tenures to help individuals and families meet their housing needs.  It sets out more than 80 actions that the Government is taking through new policy, new legislation and innovative measures in the budget to achieve that aim.<\/p><p>As the Minister, Deputy Coveney, outlined earlier, pillar 4 of the Government's action plan commits to developing a comprehensive strategy for the rental sector by the end of this year in just a few weeks' time.  The strategy for the rental sector will lay out measures to address immediate issues affecting the supply, the cost and the accessibility of accommodation.  In particular, the strategy will consider measures to increase security of tenure and will consider the potential of new mechanisms for both setting and reviewing rents.  The strategy will also focus on maintaining existing levels of rental stock and encouraging investment in additional supply.  Most importantly, the strategy will set out the wide-ranging actions this Government will take to get us the type of mature and stable sector we want to see and which reflects our changing housing demand and supports continued recovery for our modern economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000041#PP00600","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1480529100,"counter":455,"content":"<p>Deputy Louise O'Reilly is sharing time with Deputies &Oacute; Broin and T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.

I do not wish in any way to be personal but I would ask those Members who are not going to support the Bill whether they have ever rented and whether they have ever felt the unease that is caused by renting and by not having the type of security that should really be a basic and a given.  It is regrettable that it is not.  I rented for years when my daughter was young.  I hated it.  I hated not knowing where we were going to live at the end of the lease.  I hated having to go cap in hand to my landlord to find out if he was going to renew the lease.  People in that situation cannot make plans.

It is astounding, three years into this housing crisis, that this is the true motivation behind the Fine Gael housing policy.<\/p>  <p>  We have seen astronomical rents achieved by a purposeful retrenchment in the building of social housing over the last number of years.  We have seen activity by real estate investment trusts, REITs, and vulture funds, as well as tax breaks and help to buy schemes, which have poured petrol on a housing market that is already out of control.  The result is chaos for people all over the country.  <\/p>  <p>  If the Government believes that a garda in Dublin earning &euro;23,000 will be able to pay &euro;15,000 for housing per year, then its maths is completely astray.  There is not a sector in society that is not suffering as a result of rent inflation.  Rent inflation is fuelling pay inflation as families struggle around the country.  The mistakes the Government is making in this sector are causing problems in other sectors too.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, a young mother called Caoimhe Murtagh, who is seven months pregnant, had no choice but to sleep rough in Market Square in Navan.  She is expecting a child in eight weeks and is absolutely terrified that she will not have a stable space for herself and her baby.  She has also been separated from her three year old son as she obviously could not bring him with her as she slept at a bus stop overnight.  She is facing Christmas in bed and breakfast accommodation along with thousands of others.  She has been approved for the housing assistance payment, HAP, but the supply of housing is just not there and the prices are far too high for her.  She is probably going to join hundreds of other people in County Meath who have been forced, in a tidal wave of people, westwards.  People from Ratoath in County Meath have ended up in Kells, Oldcastle, Cavan and Leitrim in the search for affordable accommodation.  <\/p>  <p>  Clearly, now is the time to act.  We have demand-pull inflation and the Government cannot let this rent inflation crisis continue.  I appeal to the Government, in the run up to Christmas, to accede to the logical tying of rent to inflation in this country so that people can have some idea of what level of rent they will have to pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000042#QQ00200","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1480529700,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I thank Independents4Change, the Labour Party, the Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit, the Social Democrats, the Green Party and others not only for supporting this Bill, but for co-signing it, which sends a very important signal to the other parties in the House and to the public.  I would also like to congratulate the Secure Rents campaigners and urge them to keep up the campaigning activities in which they have been involved in the run up to the publication of the Government's strategy.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to respond to some of the comments of the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, and of Deputies from Fianna F&aacute;il.  The Minister is correct that no political party has a monopoly on compassion and nobody from Sinn F&eacute;in has suggested otherwise.  Compassion will not solve this crisis; correct policies from the Government will.  The Minister believes he has a comprehensive strategy, but Sinn F&eacute;in disagrees.  There is no doubt that there is a strategy but it is reliant on the same fundamental policy flaws of previous Governments, namely, an over reliance on the private sector to deliver social and affordable housing and an under investment in proper public housing.  The Minister can say as often as he wants that there will be a 50% increase in capital investment next year but all this Government is doing is reversing the cuts the Fine Gael Party introduced when it first came into office in 2011.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister questioned our commitment to his process.  It is not our process but we are engaging with it constructively.  We make detailed submissions, we engage in committees and so forth but we have a right, if not a responsibility, to raise issues on the floor of the D&aacute;il and attempt to exert pressure on the Government to do things that we believe it would not otherwise do and I make no apology for that.  As for playing politics, the reality for struggling renters and homeless people is not a game and there is nobody on this side of the Chamber who is attempting to play politics.  <\/p>  <p>  When the Minister came into the Chamber earlier, he suggested that Sinn F&eacute;in's problem is that we do not have enough patience.  I would have some sympathy with that argument if the Minister was only six months in office but he sat at the Cabinet table when the last Government refused to introduce the rent certainty measures that the Labour Party was rightly arguing for at that time.  I presume, because he did not say anything to the contrary, that he blocked the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, from introducing the kinds of measures that Sinn F&eacute;in is currently proposing.  He has had plenty of time to introduce those very measures.<\/p>  <p>  The central problem here is that Fine Gael is against rent certainty.  The idea that the cause of the crisis is a mismatch between supply and demand ignores the fact that during the boom when we had the greatest supply of rental properties in the history of the State rents continued to rise.  This is good legislation which anybody who is serious about tackling the rental crisis would support.<\/p>  <p>  As for Fianna F&aacute;il, the first thing I would point out is that the amendment that party proposed cannot be tabled.  Deputy Barry Cowen is around long enough to know that but he wanted the cover of the amendment to justify opposition to the Bill.  What is more remarkable is the fact that Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies supported the three measures in this Bill when they sat on the Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness only a few months ago.  One Deputy suggested that we had not put enough time and effort into this.  We spent seven weeks at that committee and had hours of hearings with experts in the rental sector, with constitutional lawyers and so on.  We listened to all of their advice and agreed the three recommendations in this Bill, unanimously.  All of a sudden Fianna F&aacute;il no longer thinks that the proposals its Deputies supported in June are credible policies to support in legislation.<\/p><p> The real problem is that Fianna F&aacute;il has nothing to say on security of tenure.  It does not even mention it in its amendment, despite the fact that it makes up two thirds of the Bill, and it is not willing to support rent certainty either.  There is no point in Deputies coming into the House and saying they will support it if, when it comes to voting on it, they vote against it, not once, not twice but three times.  Tomorrow will be the third time they will have opposed this measure.<\/p> <p> I want to deal with the issue that the measures in this Bill will hurt landlords and hurt supply, neither of which is backed up by any evidence.  The rental yields currently in the Irish market are the highest in the European Union so capping rents with the consumer price index now will have no negative impact on future supply.  In fact, when I talk to landlords, and Sinn F&eacute;in is not anti-landlord as we want good quality landlords operating in the market, they tell us that security of tenure and security of rent over a long period is better for them because many of them suffered when prices crashed at the start of the recession and would have liked to have rent certainty during that period.<\/p> <p> We have debated these issues at great length in the Committee on Housing and Homelessness and in this Chamber.  There is compelling evidence from academic experts, international best practice and our own knowledge of the rental market that these three measures will make a real difference.  Will they solve all the problems in the rental market?  Of course they will not, and in the detailed submission Sinn F&eacute;in made to the rental strategy review of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, which we will publish next week, we have made many other proposals.  However, if these measures had been introduced when Sinn F&eacute;in proposed rent certainty last June, fewer families would be homeless and families would not be paying the jacked up rents they are now paying.  If we were to agree the security of tenure measures, fewer families would become homeless in the coming months and fewer families and children would be living in emergency accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000042#QQ00300","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480530300,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000043#RR00200","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1480530300,"counter":464,"content":"<p>This is a simple, sensible and modest Bill.

In addition, it allows the authority or the court to give due weight to them, that is, to consider the views on their own merits and in the context of the age and maturity of the child.<\/p><p>However, there is no basis for making that conditional on how practicable it is.  To offer a parallel, it would be similar to providing in legislation that somebody in front of a criminal court would be entitled to legal representation in so far as practicable.  As far as I am concerned, it would be the right of the child and there should not be any conditionality to it.  The Minister has taken some steps but we must do more to strengthen the voice of the child in proceedings.  I welcome what she said regarding the heads of the Bill relating to guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  In that context, we should consider a minimum age or a minimum age above which children's voices should always be heard.  However, that is another matter.<\/p><p>To return to the amendment, there is no basis for making the entitlement of the child to be heard with regard to any of those sections and the proceedings that would be involved contingent on how practicable it is.  As I said on Committee Stage, that phrase usually relates to matters of budget or administration.  There are no circumstances I can envisage in which it could be considered to be not practicable, other than where the child is considered not capable of forming his or her own view and that is already provided for even without the inclusion of those words.  All the amendments have the same effect and I will press them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000045#TT00600","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1480531500,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Deputy raising this matter again.

It states: \"The State recognises and affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and shall, as far as practicable, by its laws protect and vindicate those rights.\"  It allows the Adoption Authority or the court, as the case may be, to take into account the individual needs of each child in ascertaining his or her views, having regard to the child&rsquo;s age and maturity.

However, I retain the view that it is something that must be dealt with either in this legislation or in a future legislative measure.  In this instance, I believe it is worth pursuing.  There are two contexts in which it would apply.  One is probably more urgent than the other, but it is still relevant and worth considering.  It is particularly important in instances where there might be some delay in the administration.  As I said on Committee Stage, adoption should not be a speedy process.  It is right that it should be thought through and comprehensively well managed.  However, that presents the potential difficulty that a delay would result in a child reaching the age of 18 years before the adoption order has been fully processed.<\/p><p>I understand that all efforts are made to rush it through where it is absolutely required, but there should be some provision to allow for people who have reached the age of 18 years to be considered to be adopted.  That is in very restricted circumstances.  It would allow the person, after they have reached the age of 18 years, to enjoy certain entitlements.  Obviously there are significant differences in how that person might enjoy property rights and social welfare entitlements.  Indeed, I believe there are some implications for the property rights of the would-be adoptive parents as well.  Most of the Deputies were present for the discussion on Committee Stage.  If somebody were to die intestate, how the person would be entitled to benefit subsequently would be greatly different.<\/p><p>If that person were to die testate, they would still be subject to a much greater tax on any assets to which they would be entitled.<\/p> <p> Essentially, this relates to a very small number of cases where it might be necessary to regularise those situations to provide some recognition.  It should not be open-ended.  Due discretion and care should be shown in that regard.  This is an important issue that needs to be dealt with.  The adoption is entirely about the welfare of the child and providing an environment in which the welfare of child is safeguarded and advanced.  This amendment is not particularly about the welfare of the child, rather it deals with a person who has ceased to be a child but that person will continue to have rights.  That person has a history that should be recognised in terms of their property rights and entitlements with respect to how they deal with the State more generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000045#TT01400","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1480532100,"counter":505,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire made a very good case in regard to a young person where there was a delay and the child became an adult during the course of the adoption process.

If there is delay in the process and there was an intention that the person would be adopted but they cannot be adopted because they have turned the age of 18, is there some mechanism, although perhaps not through legislation, by which the Minister could ensure that if a process was commenced, it would be completed in time for the intention to be fulfilled?

They have all referred to the discussion of this issue  on Committee Stage which was very thought-provoking.  I promised to think about it again and I have thought done so.  I will outline some of my reflection subsequent to that.  The rationale Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire provided in his amendment, largely on Committee Stage, related to a concern about there being a delay in the process.  On this Stage the Deputy has amplified some other aspects, not only related to a delay in the process, and I will also deal with those aspects, but I will first address the delay issue.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed amendment would allow for the adoption of person over the age of 18, as the Deputy is aware.  The primary purpose of the Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2016 is to give effect to Article 42A (Children) of the Constitution in so far as it relates to adoption.  en applications for an adoption order were received by the Adoption Authority in 2015 where the child was due to turn 18 years of age in 2015.  All of those applications were finalised and adoption orders were granted in 2015.  In 2016 to date, ten applications have been received for children turning 18 years of age in 2016.  All of those applications have also been finalised and adoption orders have been granted.  Currently, the Adoption Authority has no outstanding applications received in 2016 where the child will turn 18 yers of age in the 2016 calendar year.<\/p>  <p>  As I explained on Committee Stage, priority is given by the Adoption Authority, the Child and Family Agency and the courts to cases where a child is older to ensure the adoption process is completed before the child reaches the age of 18.  I am not satisfied that a provision in this regard in the Bill is required.  On this basis I do not propose to accept this amendment. <\/p>  <p>  I would like to add a few points as what I have said is largely is based on the rationale of whether there could be a potential delay in the process.   As I indicated, and this is new information, that has not happened in 2015 and it is not happening in 2016.  As I also indicated, it would be a major policy change for us to accept this amendment in the context of a Bill when there is no evidence that it has ever happened and that is still the case.  <\/p>  <p>  Having acknowledged a concern about there being a delay in the process, to pick up on Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's point it is a process that should be thought through and enough time should be given for that.  Even if there is a shortened period involved, the adoption process can move forward and has moved forward.  I would like to believe that we make law that encourages, as the Deputy said, people to think through the serious issue of  adoption.  In terms of some of his other arguments that significant things can change in terms of entitlements and so on for the person - a child or a young person who is just past the age of being a child - who could potentially be adopted, these are serious matters.  <\/p>  <p>  Given that, we need to support and make law to encourage those people who are thinking about becoming legally part of a family to make those choices for all of the reasons that this would entail and they would require sufficient time to do that, as distinct from that process being narrowed to issues of entitlement or tax relief, which I know the Deputy was not implying.  I am answering his points in a fulsome way while on the one hand, acknowledging that this is not something that should be quickly done and, on the other hand, pointing out that even when there may be less time in some cases when children begin the process of adoption, we still do not have any cases where they are not prioritised and enabled effectively to become part of a family.  <\/p>  <p>  Given the concern expressed by Deputies Jan O'Sullivan, Rabbitte and &Oacute; Laoghaire in terms of the age process, and  even though this has never happened previously and I do not believe it would happen given the law we are crafting with this Bill, I would be willing to offer - I believe this would be a good measure and this demonstrates the additional thinking and research we have done - that in accordance with section 110 of the Adoption Act 2010, I can and I will request the Adoption Authority in preparing its annual business plan to consult with Tusla and to prepare plans to ensure that all adoption applications are assessed and completed before the adoptee's 18th birthday.  The best interests of the child is always paramount in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000046#UU00400","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1480532700,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her response.  Clearly, a great deal of thought has been given to this, which I welcome.  The steps she and the Department are committed to taking are also welcome.  However, this does not necessarily deal with the broader question of people for whom it was not a cause of delay but ultimately who found, just after their 18th birthday, that this potential avenue was closed to them.  I refer primarily to delay.  While I recognise it is not an issue at the moment, the number of 17-year-olds on behalf of whom applications are being made is relatively small but that might not always remain the case.  Adoption numbers generally are relatively low in this country, albeit there will be an increase following the passage of the legislation.  However, we do not draft legislation on the basis that everything has worked fine so far.  If somebody who, despite every effort, found the clock had run out, there would be no recourse for him or her.  All the timelines, guidelines, instructions and directives to everyone involved in the process would be no addition to that person.  If the Minister does not accept the amendment, I ask her, beyond whatever instructions she intends to give to the authorities responsible, to commence some form of consultation or discussion within the Department and the agencies to consider whether a change in policy is required.  The policy I propose exists in other countries.  There is not even a maximum age in France.  I do not necessarily advocate that but I ask the Minister to consider whether a change in policy might be necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000047#VV00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1480532700,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I appreciate the rationale for the Deputy's arguments.

If people wait until, say, the final five days before their 18th birthday, that would raise a question in respect of the overall rationale in that regard.  While I would not necessarily be respectful of that, it could raise a question.  On the basis of the Deputy's arguments and recommendations, I would be happy to instruct the Adoption Authority of Ireland, in preparing its business plan, to ensure anyone who applies before he or she turns 18 has his or her assessment completed.

I made the point at length on Committee Stage that children who have been subject of an adoption do not have the statutory right to have access to their former family.  That could happen in a number of circumstances.  It could be parents with whom they had a good relationship or people with whom they did not maintain a good relationship.  In those instances, it could be a grandfather or a sibling.  Clearly, in most cases where an adoptive family has the best interests of the child at heart, it will allow and facilitate such access.  However, should the family be restrictive about this, my understanding is the child has no recourse.  Where such access occurs, it is monitored by the relevant authorities such as Tusla and in consultation with the adoptive family.  However, a statutory right should be put in place.  Commentary has been generated previously about the fact that our adoption laws are open and shut.  We do not have necessarily the same forms of open or flexible adoptions that exist in other jurisdictions.  The matter needs to be considered as a wider policy issue but, in the interim, at the very least, a general right limited on the basis of the child's consent or where it is in the child's best interest should be given a statutory basis, ensuring he or she has access to the family because he or she has a past and will want those people to continue to be a part of his or her life.  The door should not be shut on that part of these children's lives forcing them to move on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000047#VV02100","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1480532700,"counter":528,"content":"<p>This amendment proposes that an adopted child would be entitled to continue to have access to previous parents, guardians or non-guardians.

Under current practice, there are often arrangements in place for ongoing contact between birth parents and adopted persons and their families, where there is agreement by the relevant authorities.<\/p><p>The Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016, which I published last Friday, also provides that the birth parent and adoptive parent can enter into arrangements regarding the sharing of information between both parties.

I will touch briefly on the fact that there would be beneficial by-products of this.  I emphasise before I say this that it is very much a secondary consideration to what would be in the best interest of the child and what he or she would consent to and desire.  The possibility that the child might decide to maintain contact with the previous family would have implications for and would inform decisions taken by the birth parents about whether they consent to an option.  It would inform that.  It would also inform decisions that women who have unplanned pregnancies make and the decisions they make subsequently.  The possibility of greater access, obviously contingent on the consent and best interest of the child, would inform those decisions.  That is a secondary consideration.  The interests of the child are first and foremost.  It is an issue that has been flagged by a number of legal academics.  Some research carried out by the crisis pregnancy agency highlighted the fact that the possibility of such a form of an adoption would inform decisions women take after that time.  That is a much more advanced process of reforming adoption law and the processes more generally.  At the very least we should be providing such an option.  It is not good enough to simply say that the birth family has lost all legal rights and entitlements.  It is not so much about the birth parents' rights and entitlements, although that is worthy of consideration; it is about the right of the child.  It is not fair to say a child has no right in law to access the family, or grandparents, who raised him or her for perhaps five, ten or 15 years, depending on the circumstances.  It is not good enough to say that they have no such right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000048#WW00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1480533300,"counter":531,"content":"<p>Let me offer an additional response.  Under the recently published Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016, the Child and Family Agency will have a role in encouraging and facilitating contact between adoptive children and previous parents or guardians.  I refer the Deputy to section 45 of the Bill as published.  Recent legislation in this area is endeavouring to provide an equivalence between adopting families and other families.  That is important and we cannot just sweep it aside.  Under our legislative framework on adoption, parental rights and responsibilities are assigned to adoptive parents.  Where voluntary contact is not agreeable between the parties, it is desirable that a child receives guidance and support from his or her adoptive parents.  Underneath that is the principle that the rights of the child are not absolute in this regard.  They are qualified by the rights of the adoptive parents and in this case they act as protective measures and mechanisms for the child.  Article 41 of the Constitution recognises and protects the family.  The courts have interpreted this constitutional status as extending to an adopting family.   If we have a child with an adoptive family, the views need to be ascertained and heard, with the support and guidance of the adoptive family and balanced by the responsibilities and rights of the adoptive family.  Not only is that reasonable, it is the way our law already proceeds.  It is also a protective mechanism for children.  The amendment, while clearly well-intentioned, could lead to unintended consequences.  Inserting this entitlement into the legislative framework might give rise to sensitive difficulties of an intractable nature.  The area involves a delicate calibration of the rights of the various parties.  That is what the legislation is attempting to do.  As the Deputy knows well, no right is absolute.  As an example for further reflection, if there is an amicable relationship between the adopted child and the different families, there could be contact but if there is dissension there is no framework in the amendment put forward for how it would work.  Our concern is for the child.  For those various reasons, I will not accept the amendment.  No constitutional right is absolute.  They are all balanced with other rights and given it is a child in this regard, it is balanced with the adoptive family's rights.  I would certainly be happy to consider some of the further issues the Deputy identifies such as open adoption.  I will get the Department to take a look at that.  In respect of the amendment the Deputy has put forward, because of the reason I have given, I will not accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000048#WW00300","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1480533300,"counter":532,"content":"<p>I welcome the publication of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016.  I did not table the amendment I tabled on Committee Stage because the Bill has now been published.  I have no doubt that the issues Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire is raising will be a big part of our discussions when we come to deal with that legislation where we are talking about people who, in many cases, have no information about their birth parents and who are seeking access to birth certificates.  There will be issues we want to tease out in that legislation.  There are issues around statutory declarations which we will come to when we come to that legislation.  There are two different kinds of children here.  There are children who remember their previous family and have formed ties, which are the ones Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire is concerned about.  If a child is adopted almost immediately after birth, there is a totally different scenario.  We will be dealing with much of this when we come to the other legislation so I will contribute at greater length at that stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000048#WW00400","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1480533300,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I recognise that point.

I recognise that no rights are absolute under the Constitution.  If the Minister sees fit, I would be more than happy to accept a regulatory framework or a provision for regulations to underline and qualify an important statutory right.<\/p><p>The point being made was that the child does not have an unqualified right.  As things stand, the child does not have any statutory right.

However, in this instance the child has no agency.  The child has no right to access where his adoptive parents are unwilling to co-operate.  Of course there will be circumstances in which there might well be dissension, but that does not necessarily mean the child should be deprived of the right to see the family.  The child may well have happy memories of the family or may well have close connections.<\/p> <p> It is not good enough to fail to provide any statutory right whatsoever.

The Bill deals with legislation from the founding of the State to the 1950s.  Most of the Bills are definitely superfluous, although some are of major interest.  I raised a question yesterday about the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na legislation, particularly the Act initiating the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that is being repealed with this Bill.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to reassure us on Committee Stage that this will have no effect on subsequent legislation that firmed up An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I presume that is the case.  It was originally known as a civic guard Bill until the final moments when Cathal O'Shannon proposed \"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na\" as the title.<\/p>  <p>  There are other pieces of legislation, such as that relating to emergency powers.  We only just had the debate in the D&aacute;il about rent control and when there is an emergency, the State can move emergency legislation.  It is not that I would like anything like the Public Safety (Emergency Powers) Act to be passed in this House ever again.  We have the Offences against the State Act, which superseded that legislation in 1939.  It is still on the Statute Book and has been enhanced.  The emergency powers Act of that time led to the execution by this State of what were known historically as the 77, although there were 83, I believe, official State executions, not to mind the 110 who were executed upon arrest without any recourse to any semblance of a trial or military tribunal.  That legislation is being eliminated and it also gave effect to internment without trial during the Civil War.  Some of the legislation being repealed is Civil War legislation.<\/p>  <p>  There are other interesting examples from an historical and nerdy perspective.  When I looked through the list I laughed at the Eucharistic Congress (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1932.  I hope it will not be repeated the year after next when the Pope comes to Ireland.  That legislation allowed people to drive public buses or vehicles without a licence.  There does not seem to have been enough licenceholders in the country and sufficient people were coming that they needed people to drive the buses.  It also allowed licensed premises to open extended hours at certain times and be restricted at other times, I presume for some of the masses in the afternoon etc.  It is interesting that although I presume some of the debate was around the Eucharistic Congress, the D&aacute;il spent most of its time discussing the driving of buses to and from the venues and the effects on the delegates attending.  It was a major event and, in some ways, looking back at the legislation, it seems very simple seen through our modern eyes.  It was very practical legislation and it was an example of something much shorter than some of the legislation we produce today.<\/p>  <p>  One of the longer pieces of legislation I looked at that has been repealed is the Spanish Civil War (Non-Intervention) Act 1937.  It was interesting for the time and if we look at the debate, it was quite far-ranging and different to what we would have today.  There are some comments one might not believe, such as Eamon de Valera being accused of being a supporter of the reds.  I do not think anybody would have felt that.  It was a different era.  Last week we discussed neutrality and it is in that context that we might look at it.  The context was different, nonetheless, as the State allowed General Eoin O'Duffy to leave the country under much fanfare with his volunteers in the Blueshirts.  They were blessed on their way to attack the forces of the republic in Spain and supposedly to defend Christianity but they spent most of their time in the pub, coming back disgraced in ignominy.  Nothing was heard of the Blueshirts, in many ways, afterwards because they did not assert themselves well.  Those who took the side of the republic, standing by the revolution in Spain, did so quietly and left the country without fanfare.  They suffered the consequences of taking that side before coming back to Ireland and suffered further consequences from a religiously run State.  They were frowned upon, ignored and ostracised in many ways.  It is a pity, but many of their memoirs have come to the fore in recent years.  Those people were open, energetic and focused in their community.  It is a pity they were ostracised but that was not the intention of the Act at the time.  It was enacted so the State would not take sides or encourage anybody one way or the other.  It would not facilitate the movement of armaments or soldiers through Ireland on the way to war, so it is a pity the same kind of legislation is not there today to deal with Shannon Airport's issues.  There are often similarities and differences between today and what happened in the past.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is a good piece of work.  I was critical in the past that JobBridge was used in formulating the Bill as there was no guaranteed work at the end of the process.  That criticism was answered and I am not making a complaint at this stage.  We have dealt with that and JobBridge is over.  How many more pieces of legislation will need to be eliminated?  At least we are up to the 1950s at this stage and I cannot see many more pieces of statute law revision coming forward.  It is interesting to see that one of the pieces of legislation we repealed is being reinstated, which demonstrates that we can make mistakes in this House.<\/p>  <p>  This has been a useful piece of work.  Yesterday, my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, referred to my request that there would a searchable archive of legislation.  I understand the information is available but there should be a single source for the available material when the process is finished.  The process will be beneficial but when it is completed I ask that the Government set aside whatever sum of money is required for that objective.  I assume it would not be that much because the work has been done and the documents have been found and assessed.  Somebody should have ready access to the information and that job can produce something worthwhile for future historians.  I wish the Minister of State well with the legislation.  If he does not get to answer all those questions I may contribute again on Committee Stage in order to further elaborate on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000051#ZZ00300","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speech","time":1480534500,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions to this debate.  Statute law revision is a very interesting and important piece of work.  Taking the contributions made by Deputies in the course of our discussion on Second Stage yesterday evening and Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's continued contribution this evening, one can look back at these Acts seeking parallels with the present day.  One can find different information or interests and, as the Deputy noted, it allows us as legislators to get our nerd on in a way and dig deep.  We can find it very interesting from that perspective.  However, the work is also very important in what it does, so I thank everybody for their contribution.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh stated, the Bill proposes repealing spent and obsolete Acts enacted between 1922 and 1950.  It is interesting that it is the first comprehensive review of Acts enacted by the Oireachtas and it will result in a significant reduction in the size of the Statute Book for that period.<\/p><p>Even though it is not the first time we have done a piece of work like this, it is the first time we have been looking at legislation from the Oireachtas.  That it is a first in this regard makes this Bill an important piece of work.  When the Bill is enacted, it will help to reduce the regulatory burden for business, industry and citizens by simplifying the complex stock of legislation that is currently on the Statute Book.  It will also help to provide further legal clarity in this area.<br\/><br\/>Before we conclude and the Bill moves on to next week's Committee Stage debate, I would like to respond to a number of points that were made during this Second Stage debate yesterday and this evening.  I want to make it clear in response to points that were made by Deputies Calleary and O'Callaghan that the Government has not decided to stop the statute law revision programme.  We recognise the value of this project and the benefits it brings.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is proposing to pause the programme at this time so that the Department can make progress with other priorities.  The Government reform unit in the Department, which has led this programme since 2012, is currently heavily involved in work on the Public Sector Standards Bill 2015 and the forthcoming data sharing and governance Bill, which will he published in the new year.  The Government, like many Members of the House, is attaching a high priority to these significant and complex Bills.  The Government reform unit is also involved in the reviews of the lobbying and protected disclosures Acts.  These tasks are priorities at this time.  The Minister will keep his priorities under review.  Consideration will be given to the matter again in due course.<br\/><br\/>The statute law revision programme is not the only initiative to make the Statute Book more transparent and accessible.  The Law Reform Commission's work on the legislation directory is ongoing.  This is a vital source of information for legal professionals and anyone working with legislation.  It assists them in checking the current version of the law.  The index currently tracks changes to primary legislation from the pre-1922 and post-1922 periods and to secondary legislation from 1998 onwards.  Work is progressing on expanding the directory.  I understand that an index of statutory instruments from 1997 will be published in the near future.<br\/><br\/>Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan asked a question about the cost-efficiency of the delivery of this programme.  Approximately &euro;623,000 has been spent since the programme transferred to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2012.  Expenditure on the Bill before the House to date amounts to approximately &euro;285,000.  This expenditure does not relate solely to work on the preparation of the legislation.  A proportion of the spending relates to the legal advisory functions carried out by legal adviser to the Government reform unit. This legal advisory role has been applied to a range of other legislative priorities, such as the Freedom of Information Acts, the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and the Public Sector Standards Bill 2015.<br\/><br\/>Deputies Cullinane and &Oacute; Snodaigh raised the issue of the availability of the text of the statutes repealed by the Statute Law Revision Acts 2005 to 2016.  I share their view that these texts would be of interest to historians, parliamentarians and the public.  As I have mentioned, the Law Reform Commission has made most of the pre-1922 public general Acts that remain in force available online.  I am not aware of any plans to make the text of pre-1922 repealed Acts or instruments available electronically.  This would be a matter for the Law Reform Commission.  The text of the majority of these Acts and instruments are available to the public in hard copy.  No text has survived in the cases of a small number of pre-1922 Acts and instruments.  Examples include texts of Irish Private Acts that were held in the Four Courts in 1922.<br\/><br\/>The Statute Law Revision Act 2007 repealed public general legislation pre-1922.  The texts of these statutes were spread among a number of collections available in the National Library.  To assist in the identification of the source of these statutes, the citation system used for each of these statutes is set out in the Act and includes references to the relevant source documents.  Similarly, the source documents for the pre-Independence statutory instruments repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 2015 can be identified by the citations in that Act.  Sources used for the 2015 Act include the <i>Dublin Gazette<\/i>, the <i>London Gazette<\/i>, the Irish Manuscripts Commission and certain other printed collections.  The <i>London Gazette<\/i>is available online.  The statute law revision team reviewed hard copies of the Dublin Gazette from the National Library.<br\/><br\/>The Statute Law Revision Acts 2009 and 2012 repealed local and personal Acts and Private Acts from before 1922.  In the course of their work, the research team viewed texts of the Acts made available by the Honourable Society of King's Inns, the Oireachtas Library, the National Library, the National Archives and the UK parliamentary archives at the House of Lords and the House of Commons in Westminster.  Fortunately, the text of all Acts enacted by the Oireachtas are available electronically at <i>www.irishstatutebook.ie<\/i>.  The text of all Acts repealed by this Bill will remain available electronically.<br\/><br\/>Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh asked yesterday whether there has been a proper discussion of the Acts proposed for repeal in the Bill before the House.  The Bill was subject to a public consultation process.  A list of all Acts identified as suitable for repeal was published on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's website and the public was invited to comment on the list.  In addition, all Government Departments and relevant local authorities have been consulted and advised on Acts of relevance to them.  Relevant bodies and organisations are made aware of the legislation being assessed for revocation.<br\/><br\/>I was also asked about the remaining work that is to be completed under the statute law revision programme.  This falls broadly into three categories, the first of which comprises charters and letters patents from 1066 to 1922.  The second category comprises three types of secondary legislation: secondary instruments from 1821 to 1922, statutory rules and orders from 1922 to 1947 and statutory instruments from 1948 to date.  The third category comprises two types of post-1922 primary legislation: public general Acts from 1951 to date and Private Acts from 1922 to date.<br\/><br\/>I thank all Members for their involvement in this debate.  I look forward to further deliberations on Committee Stage next week.  If Members have any further questions, we can go through them then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000051#ZZ00400","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480535100,"counter":544,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Statute Law Revision Bill 2016 [Seanad]: Referral to Select Committee","time":1480535100,"counter":545,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000052#AAA00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1480535100,"counter":546,"content":"<p>I understand it is proposed to send the Bill to the relevant committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000052#AAA00400","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1480535100,"counter":547,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach pursuant to Standing Orders 84A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 149(1).<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000052#AAA00500","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480535100,"counter":548,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1480535100,"counter":549,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 8.10 p.m. until 12 noon on Thursday, 1 December 2016.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
